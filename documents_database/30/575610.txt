goldstein is a research scientist and futurist he began his career in the 1970s as a molecular biologist before becoming a theoretician in the field of nanobiotechnology he has codified the central concepts of this nascent area of knowledge into a set of operational rules termed the laws of biomimetics as part of this work goldstein has published a set of guidelines specifically designed to identify the artificial life forms likely to emerge from research at the intersection of nanotechnology and biotechnology he has also created the animat test as a practical bioengineering tool for monitoring the coming transformation from natural to artificial biology let us define a life form as an entity that reduces entropy by self executing the minimum set of physical and chemical operations necessary to sustain the ability to execute functionally equivalent negentropic operations indefinitely across time given that a life form will be considered an animat living material if all the information necessary to execute that minimum set of physical and chemical operations cannot be stored in dna or rna the corollary if all the information necessary to execute that minimum set of physical and chemical operations can be stored in dna or rna the

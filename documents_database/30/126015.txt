the formula expresses the fact that the sum of the sizes of the two sets may be too large since some elements may be counted twice the double counted elements are those in the intersection of the two sets and the count is corrected by subtracting the size of the intersection the principle is more clearly seen in the case of three sets which for the sets a b and c is given by this formula can be verified by counting how many times each region in the venn diagram figure is included in the right hand side of the formula in this case when removing the contributions of over counted elements the number of elements in the mutual intersection of the three sets has been subtracted too often so must be added back in to get the correct total generalizing the results of these examples gives the principle of inclusion exclusion to find the cardinality of the union of sets the name comes from the idea that the principle is based on over generous inclusion followed by compensating exclusion this concept is attributed to abraham de moivre 1718 but it first appears in a paper of daniel da silva

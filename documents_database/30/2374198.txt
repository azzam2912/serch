the more disturbed an area has been the less characteristic it becomes of remnant habitat remnant areas are also described as biologically intact or ecologically intact remnant natural areas are often used as reference ecosystems in ecological restoration projects a remnant natural area can be described in terms of its natural quality or biological integrity which is the extent to which it has the internal biodiversity and abiotic elements to replicate itself over time another definition of biological integrity is the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced integrated adaptive community of organisms having a species composition diversity and functional organization comparable to that of the natural habitat of the region abiotic elements determining the quality of a natural area may include factors such as hydrologic connectivity or fire in areas that have been dredged drained or dammed the altered hydrology can destroy a remnant natural area similarly too much or too little fire can degrade or destroy a remnant natural area remnant natural areas are characterized by the presence of conservative plants and animals organisms that are restricted to or highly characteristic of areas that have not been disturbed by humans tools to measure aspects of natural areas quality

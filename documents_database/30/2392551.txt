unbihexium and ubh are the temporary iupac name and symbol respectively until the element is discovered confirmed and a permanent name is decided upon in the periodic table unbihexium is expected to be a g block superactinide and the eighth element in the 8th period unbihexium has attracted attention among nuclear physicists especially in early predictions targeting properties of superheavy elements for 126 may be a magic number of protons near the center of an island of stability leading to longer half lives especially for ubh or ubh which may also have magic numbers of neutrons early interest in possible increased stability led to the first attempted synthesis of unbihexium in 1971 and searches for it in nature in subsequent years despite several reported observations more recent studies suggest that these experiments were insufficiently sensitive hence no unbihexium has been found naturally or artificially predictions of the stability of unbihexium vary greatly among different models some suggest the island of stability may instead lie at a lower atomic number closer to copernicium and flerovium unbihexium is predicted to be a chemically active superactinide exhibiting a variety of oxidation states from 1 to 8 and possibly being a heavier congener of

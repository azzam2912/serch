suppose that the greatest common divisor of f and g is constant which means that the projective curves that they define in the projective plane p have an intersection consisting in a finite number of points for each point p of this intersection the polynomials f and g generate an ideal f g of the local ring of p at p this local ring is the ring of the fractions n d where n and d are polynomials in three variables and d p 0 the theorem asserts that if h lies in f g for every intersection point p then there are homogeneous polynomials a and b of degrees a and b respectively such that h af bg furthermore any two choices of a differ by a multiple of g and similarly any two choices of b differ by a multiple of f this theorem may be viewed as a generalization of b zout s identity which provides a condition under which an integer or a univariate polynomial h may be expressed as an element of the ideal generated by two other integers or univariate polynomials f and g such a representation exists exactly when h is a multiple

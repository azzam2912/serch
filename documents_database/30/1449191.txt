he is well known for his observational work on all classes of supernovae especially the use of type ia and type ii supernovae as measures of cosmic distance hamuy was a student in astronomy and physics at the university of chile working with jorge melnick in february 1987 he came to the cerro tololo inter american observatory and within a few days of his arrival when the type ii supernova sn1987a exploded in the large magellanic cloud he began a major campaign at ctio to monitor this important supernova in 1989 in collaboration with jose maza mark m phillips and nicholas suntzeff he began the cal n tololo supernova survey which led to the pioneering work on the standard candle luminosities of type ia supernovae this work led to the precise measurements of the hubble constant h and the deceleration parameter q the latter indicating the presence of a dark energy or cosmological constant dominating the mass energy of the universe in graduate school at the university of arizona at the steward observatory working with professor phil pinto he changed his focus to the study of core collapse supernovae in particular using type ii supernovae to measure geometric distances using

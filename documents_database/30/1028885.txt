this reduction into a single variable is the result of the straight line approximation or the eikonal approximation which allows us to choose the straight line as a special direction the early steps involved in the eikonal approximation in quantum mechanics are very closely related to the wkb approximation for one dimensional waves the wkb method like the eikonal approximation reduces the equations into a differential equation in a single variable but the difficulty with the wkb approximation is that this variable is described by the trajectory of the particle which in general is complicated making use of wkb approximation we can write the wave function of the scattered system in terms of action s inserting the wavefunction in the schr dinger equation without the presence of a magnetic field we obtain we write s as a power series in for the zero th order if we consider the one dimensional case then formula 6 we obtain a differential equation with the boundary condition for formula 8 formula 9

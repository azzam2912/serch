it is sometimes used as a reference or standard pressure it is approximately equal to the atmospheric pressure at sea level it was originally defined as the pressure exerted by 760 mm of mercury at 0 c and standard gravity g it was used as a reference condition for physical and chemical properties and was implicit in the definition of the centigrade later celsius scale of temperature by defining 100 c as being the boiling point of water at this pressure in 1954 the 10th conf rence g n rale des poids et mesures cgpm adopted standard atmosphere for general use and affirmed its definition of being precisely equal to dynes per square centimetre this defined both temperature and pressure independent of the properties of particular substance in addition the cgpm noted there had been some misapprehension that it led some physicists to believe that this definition of the standard atmosphere was valid only for accurate work in thermometry in chemistry and in various industries the reference pressure referred to in standard temperature and pressure stp was commonly but standards have since diverged in 1982 the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac recommended that for the purposes of

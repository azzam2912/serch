first released on the octane2 it was subsequently used on the fuel tezro workstations and the onyx visualization systems where it was branded infiniteperformance vpro provides some very advanced capabilities such as per pixel lighting also known as phong shading through the sgix fragment lighting extension and 48 bit rgba color on the other hand later designs suffered from constrained bandwidth and poorer texture mapping performance compared to competing gpu solutions which rapidly caught up to sgi in the market four different odyssey based vpro graphics board revisions existed designated v6 v8 v10 and v12 the first series were the v6 and v8 with 32mb and 128mb of ram respectively the v10 and v12 had double the geometry performance of the older v6 v8 but were otherwise similar the v6 and v10 can have up to 8mb ram allocated to textures while v8 and v12 can have up to 108mb ram used for textures the v10 and v12 boards used in fuel tezro and onyx 3000 computers use a different xio connector than the cards used in octane2 workstations the vpro graphics subsystem consists of an sgi proprietary chip set and associated software the chip set consists of the buzz

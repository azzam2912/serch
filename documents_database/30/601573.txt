reptiles have on a number of occasions evolved into limbless forms snakes amphisbaenia and legless lizards limb loss in lizards has evolved independently several times examples include the families pygopodidae and dibamidae and species of isopachys anguis and ophisaurus the same is true of amphibians caecilians sirenidae a clade of salamanders that are limbless except for atrophied front limbs amphiumidae a clade of salamander with extremely atrophied limbs that appear non functional and at least two extinct groups a stopoda and lysorophia legless forms of reptiles and amphibians probably evolved so as to be able to move underground or in water more easily there are also a number of fish with elongated bodies that have no or reduced appendage like fins for example eels and swamp eels while hagfish and lamprey also do not have appendage like fins they may not have lost them but simply retained the form that vertebrates had before they evolved limbs there are no known limbless species of mammal or bird although partial limb loss and reduction has occurred in several groups including whales and dolphins sirenians kiwis and the extinct moa and elephant birds the moa in particular are notable for having completely lost

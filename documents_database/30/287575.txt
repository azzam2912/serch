it can be thought of as a computer programming language though it is not convenient for writing software instead it is important in the mathematical theory of algorithms because it is an extremely simple turing complete language it was introduced by moses sch nfinkel and haskell curry all operations in lambda calculus can be encoded via abstraction elimination into the ski calculus as binary trees whose leaves are one of the three symbols s k and i called combinators although the most formal representation of the objects in this system requires binary trees they are usually represented for typesetability as parenthesized expressions either with all the subtrees parenthesized or only the right side children subtrees parenthesized so the tree whose left subtree is the tree ks and whose right subtree is the tree sk is usually typed as ks sk or more simply as ks sk instead of being fully drawn as a tree as formality and readability would require parenthesizing only the right subtree makes this notation left associative isk means is k i is redundant as it behaves the same as skk but is included for convenience informally and using programming language jargon a tree xy can be

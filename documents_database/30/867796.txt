it was based upon and used some components of the short sb 1 an earlier glider design the short sb 4 sherpa was designed by david keith lucas as a research aircraft aimed primarily at assisting in the development of wings for faster very high altitude aircraft in general and the company s preliminary design short pd 1 in response to the u k v bomber requirement b35 46 in particular it was the first powered aircraft to employ the aero isoclinic wing first proposed in 1951 by professor geoffrey t r hill who had been instrumental in the design of the westland hill pterodactyl tail less experimental aircraft in the mid 1920s this radical wing configuration was designed to maintain a constant angle of incidence regardless of flexing by placing the torsion box well back in the wing so that the air loads acting in the region of the quarter chord line have a considerable moment arm about it the torsional instability and tip stalling characteristics of conventional swept wings were recognised at the time together with their tendency to aileron reversal and flutter at high speed it was to prevent these effects that the aero isoclinic wing was

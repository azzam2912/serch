the arc discharge is generally confined to a small fused quartz arc tube mounted within a larger borosilicate glass bulb the outer bulb may be clear or coated with a phosphor in either case the outer bulb provides thermal insulation protection from the ultraviolet radiation the light produces and a convenient mounting for the fused quartz arc tube mercury vapor lamps are more energy efficient than incandescent and most fluorescent lights with luminous efficacies of 35 to 65 lumens watt their other advantages are a long bulb lifetime in the range of 24 000 hours and a high intensity clear white light output for these reasons they are used for large area overhead lighting such as in factories warehouses and sports arenas as well as for streetlights clear mercury lamps produce white light with a bluish green tint due to mercury s combination of spectral lines this is not flattering to human skin color so such lamps are typically not used in retail stores color corrected mercury bulbs overcome this problem with a phosphor on the inside of the outer bulb that emits white light offering better color rendition they operate at an internal pressure of around one atmosphere and

it may have been the first public example of the mainstream media publicizing a curse on a major league sports franchise the hawks first season 1926 27 was a moderate success with the forward line of mickey mackay babe dye and dick irvin each finishing near the top of the league s scoring race the hawks lost their 1927 first round playoff series to the boston bruins following this series team owner frederic mclaughlin fired head coach pete muldoon jim coleman a sportswriter for the globe and mail wrote in 1943 that the reason for muldoon s firing boiled down to a heated end of season argument with mclaughlin as the story goes mclaughlin felt that the black hawks were good enough to finish first in the american division muldoon disagreed and mclaughlin fired him muldoon supposedly responded fire me major and you ll never finish first i ll put a curse on this team that will hoodoo it until the end of time at the time finishing in first place was considered to be as much of an achievement as winning the stanley cup while the team would win the stanley cup in 1934 defeating the detroit red wings

she is well known for her work utilizing video to understand the behavior of various species of birds kane received her bachelor of science degree in physics in 1982 from massachusetts institute of technology she then attended harvard university for her master of science degree and her phd there she worked in the laboratory of applied physicist peter pershan her thesis entitled optical and x ray studies of critical phenomena in thin liquid crystal films and published in 1989 focused on utilizing x ray and light scattering techniques to study biological membranes and low dimensional soft matter systems following her phd she became a postdoctoral research associate at the university of pennsylvania working in the laboratory of j kent blasie between 1988 and 1990 there she continued her work using scattering techniques to understand the structures of multilayer films and biological membranes in 1991 kane became an assistant professor at haverford college where she was eventually promoted to professor in 2016 kane s research centers on the intersection between biophysics soft condensed matter physics and statistical physics to understand a range of topics from the behavior of birds to the bacterial diversity of ecosystems using experimental techniques that include bioacoustics

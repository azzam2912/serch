micrornas are usually derived from precursors known as pre mirnas these pre mirnas are recognised and cleaved from a pri mirna precursor by the pasha and drosha proteins however some micrornas mirtrons are known to be derived from introns via a different pathway which bypasses pasha and drosha some micrornas are also known to be derived from small nucleolar rna small nucleolar rna derived microrna was first described in 2008 the protozoal intestinal parasite giardia lamblia lacks the drosha protein involved in pre mirna cleavage from pri mirna however the mirna processing protein dicer is found in giardia a 26 nucleotide rna mir2 is processed from the giardia lamblia snorna glsr17 by dicer mir2 is a microrna which may regulate the expression of variant surface proteins also in 2008 a small rna was found to be cleaved from scarna15 a human small cajal body specific rna by dicer this small rna was found to function as a microrna potential micrornas were also identified in several other human snornas giardia lamblia produces at least 20 snornas snornas guide the modification of rrna and contain a region of 10 21 nucleotides which is complementary to the target rna five of the giardia

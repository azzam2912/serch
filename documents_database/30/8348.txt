one parameter of manner is stricture that is how closely the speech organs approach one another others include those involved in the r like sounds taps and trills and the sibilancy of fricatives the concept of manner is mainly used in the discussion of consonants although the movement of the articulators will also greatly alter the resonant properties of the vocal tract thereby changing the formant structure of speech sounds that is crucial for the identification of vowels for consonants the place of articulation and the degree of phonation of voicing are considered separately from manner as being independent parameters homorganic consonants which have the same place of articulation may have different manners of articulation often nasality and laterality are included in manner but some phoneticians such as peter ladefoged consider them to be independent manners of articulation with substantial obstruction of the airflow stops fricatives affricates are called obstruents these are prototypically voiceless but voiced obstruents are extremely common as well manners without such obstruction nasals liquids approximants and also vowels are called sonorants because they are nearly always voiced voiceless sonorants are uncommon but are found in welsh and classical greek the spelling rh in standard tibetan the

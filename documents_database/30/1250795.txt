it was initially developed by the mathematical psychologists david krantz 1968 and amos tversky 1967 the theory was given a comprehensive mathematical exposition in the first volume of foundations of measurement krantz luce suppes tversky 1971 which krantz and tversky wrote in collaboration with the mathematical psychologist r duncan luce and philosopher patrick suppes krantz tversky 1971 also published a non technical paper on polynomial conjoint measurement for behavioural scientists in the journal psychological review as with the theory of conjoint measurement the significance of polynomial conjoint measurement lies in the quantification of natural attributes in the absence of concatenation operations polynomial conjoint measurement differs from the two attribute case discovered by luce tukey 1964 in that more complex composition rules are involved most scientific theories involve more than just two attributes and thus the two variable case of conjoint measurement has rather limited scope moreover contrary to the theory of n component conjoint measurement many attributes are non additive compositions of other attributes krantz et al 1971 krantz 1968 proposed a general schema to ascertain the sufficient set of cancellation axioms for a class of polynomial combination rules he called simple polynomials the formal definition of this schema given

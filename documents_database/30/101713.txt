this property is used to determine the usefulness of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms for a problem typically a greedy algorithm is used to solve a problem with optimal substructure if it can be proven by induction that this is optimal at each step otherwise provided the problem exhibits overlapping subproblems as well dynamic programming is used if there are no appropriate greedy algorithms and the problem fails to exhibit overlapping subproblems often a lengthy but straightforward search of the solution space is the best alternative in the application of dynamic programming to mathematical optimization richard bellman s principle of optimality is based on the idea that in order to solve a dynamic optimization problem from some starting period t to some ending period t one implicitly has to solve subproblems starting from later dates s where tbellman equation which shows how the value of the problem starting from t is related to the value of the problem starting from s consider finding a shortest path for travelling between two cities by car as illustrated in figure 1 such an example is likely to exhibit optimal substructure that is if the shortest route from seattle to los angeles passes through

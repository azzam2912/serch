many but not all churches that practice open communion require that the person receiving communion be a baptized christian and other requirements may apply as well in methodism open communion is referred to as the open table open communion is the opposite of closed communion where the sacrament is reserved for members of the particular church or others with which it is in a relationship of full communion or fellowship or has otherwise recognized for that purpose closed communion may refer to either a particular denomination or an individual congregation serving communion only to its own members generally churches that offer open communion to other christians do not require an explicit affirmation of christianity from the communicant before distributing the elements the act of receiving is an implicit affirmation some churches make an announcement before communion begins such as we invite all who have professed a faith in christ to join us at the table open communion is generally practiced in churches where the elements are passed through the congregation also called self communication however it is also practiced in some churches that have a communion procession where the congregation comes forward to receive communion in front of the altar

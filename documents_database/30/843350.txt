more specifically like the thomson s lamp paradox the ross littlewood paradox tries to illustrate the conceptual difficulties with the notion of a supertask in which an infinite number of tasks are completed sequentially the problem was originally described by mathematician john e littlewood in his 1953 book littlewood s miscellany and was later expanded upon by sheldon ross in his 1988 book a first course in probability the problem starts with an empty vase and an infinite supply of balls an infinite number of steps are then performed such that at each step 10 balls are added to the vase and 1 ball removed from it the question is then posed how many balls are in the vase when the task is finished to complete an infinite number of steps it is assumed that the vase is empty at one minute before noon and that the following steps are performed this guarantees that a countably infinite number of steps is performed by noon since each subsequent step takes half as much time as the previous step an infinite number of steps is performed by the time one minute has passed the question is then how many balls are in

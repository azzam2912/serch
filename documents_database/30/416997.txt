the city primarily consists of those who are either bosnian serbian or croatian generally speaking the population of those of the bosnian nationality has fluctuated over the years there was a sharp decline in the population of the bosnian in banja luka from 1879 to 1991 while there was a sharp and consistent increase in the serbian population in the city in that time frame meanwhile the population of those who were croatian remained relatively the same in banja luka over the years with a gradual decline starting after wii on the municipal level numbers tend to stay relatively the same it is noted that the serbian population has declined due to some of the rural parts that were included in the city and the in migration that occurred after the 1969 earthquake there was a sharp drop in the bosniak population on the municipal level in 1910 which can be attributed to massive emigration partly due to agrarian reform and the fact that many bosnian peoples had to declare themselves as croats serbs or undecided muslims until 1971 when their national identity was created

it was found that this outcome primacy can account for much of the underweighting of rare events in experience based decisions where participants apparently underestimate small probabilities in contrast to prospect theory where people tend to overestimate low probabilities when lotteries are described behaviour in this task can be modelled using a standard model free reinforcement learning algorithm in this model the values of the different actions are learned over time and are used to determine the next action according to a predefined action selection rule it was shown that a substantial effect of first experience on behaviour is consistent with the reinforcement learning model if one assumes that the outcome of first experience resets the values of the experienced actions but not if symmetric initial conditions are assumed moreover the predictive power of the resetting model outperforms previously published models regarding the aggregate choice behaviour these findings suggest that first experience has a disproportionately large effect on subsequent actions similar to primacy effects in other fields of cognitive psychology such as in the application of the serial position effect the mechanism of resetting of the initial conditions that underlies outcome primacy may thus also account for other forms of

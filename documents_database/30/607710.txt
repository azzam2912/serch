it has an apparent visual magnitude of 3 5 which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye in 2001 an asteroid belt was confirmed to orbit the star zeta leporis has a stellar classification of a2 iv v n suggesting that it is in a transitional stage between an a type main sequence star and a subgiant the n suffix indicates that the absorption lines in the star s spectrum appear nebulous because it is spinning rapidly causing the lines to broaden because of the doppler effect the projected rotational velocity is 245 km s giving a lower limit on the star s actual equatorial azimuthal velocity the star has about 1 46 times the mass of the sun along with 1 5 times the radius and 14 times the luminosity the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium what astronomers term the star s metallicity is only 17 of the abundance in the sun the star appears to be a very young probably around 231 million years in age but the margin of error spans 50 347 million years old in 1983 based on radiation in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum the infrared

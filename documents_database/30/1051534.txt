this relationship is perhaps one of the most well documented relationships in macroecology and applies both intra and interspecifically within and among species in most cases the o a relationship is a positive relationship although an o a relationship would be expected given that a species colonizing a region must pass through the origin zero abundance zero occupancy and could reach some theoretical maximum abundance and distribution that is occupancy and abundance can be expected to co vary the relationship described here is somewhat more substantial in that observed changes in range are associated with greater than proportional changes in abundance although this relationship appears to be pervasive e g gaston 1996 and references therein and has important implications for the conservation of endangered species the mechanism s underlying it remain poorly understood range means the total area occupied by the species of interest in the region under study see below measures of species geographic range abundance means the average density of the species of interest across all occupied patches i e average abundance does not include the area of unoccupied patches intraspecific occupancy abundance relationship means the relationship between abundance and range size within a single species generated using

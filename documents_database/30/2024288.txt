it is supported in video and image compression designs such as h 264 mpeg 4 avc hevc jpeg xr and dirac it is simple to compute has good transform coding gain and can be losslessly converted to and from rgb with fewer bits than are needed with other color models a reversible scaled version ycocg r is used in display stream compression advantages the ycocg color model has over the ycbcr color model are simpler and faster computation better decorrelation of the color planes to improve compression performance and exactly lossless invertibility the three values of the ycocg color model are calculated as follows from the three color values of the rgb color model the values of y are in the range from 0 to 1 while co and cg are in the range of 0 5 to 0 5 as is typical with ycc color models such as ycbcr for example pure red is expressed in the rgb system as 1 0 0 and in the ycocg system as however since the coefficients of the transformation matrix are simple binary fractions it is easier to compute than other ycc transformations for rgb signals with bit depth n either the

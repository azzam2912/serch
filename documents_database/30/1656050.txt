it had an estimated magnitude of 8 1 on the moment magnitude scale making it the strongest known earthquake of 1944 and a maximum felt intensity of greater than 5 shindo about viii severe on the mercalli intensity scale it triggered a large tsunami that caused serious damage along the coast of wakayama prefecture and the t kai region together the earthquake and tsunami caused 3 358 casualties the southern coast of honsh runs parallel to the nankai trough which marks the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the eurasian plate movement on this convergent plate boundary leads to many earthquakes some of them of megathrust type the nankai megathrust has five distinct segments a e that can rupture independently the segments have ruptured either singly or together repeatedly over the last 1300 years megathrust earthquakes on this structure tend to occur in pairs with a relatively short time gap between them the 1944 event which ruptured the c d segments was followed two years later by the 1946 nankaid earthquake rupturing segments a b in addition to these two events there were two similar earthquakes in 1854 in each case the northeastern segment ruptured before the southwestern segment

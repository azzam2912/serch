the complexification which always exists is unique up to unique isomorphism its lie algebra is a quotient of the complexification of the lie algebra of the original group they are isomorphic if the original group has a quotient by a discrete normal subgroup which is linear for compact lie groups the complexification sometimes called the chevalley complexification after claude chevalley can be defined as the group of complex characters of the hopf algebra of representative functions i e the matrix coefficients of finite dimensional representations of the group in any finite dimensional faithful unitary representation of the compact group it can be realized concretely as a closed subgroup of the complex general linear group it consists of operators with polar decomposition where is a unitary operator in the compact group and is a skew adjoint operator in its lie algebra in this case the complexification is a complex algebraic group and its lie algebra is the complexification of the lie algebra of the compact lie group if is a lie group a universal complexification is given by a complex lie group and a continuous homomorphism with the universal property that if is an arbitrary continuous homomorphism into a complex lie

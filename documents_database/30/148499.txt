it is typically used to measure and display the level or voltage of a video signal with respect to time the level of a video signal usually corresponds to the brightness or luminance of the part of the image being drawn onto a regular video screen at the same point in time a waveform monitor can be used to display the overall brightness of a television picture or it can zoom in to show one or two individual lines of the video signal it can also be used to visualize and observe special signals in the vertical blanking interval of a video signal as well as the colorburst between each line of video waveform monitors are used for the following purposes a waveform monitor is often used in conjunction with a vectorscope originally these were separate devices however modern waveform monitors include vectorscope functionality as a separate mode the combined device is simply called a waveform monitor originally waveform monitors were entirely analog devices the incoming analog video signal was filtered and amplified and the resulting voltage was used to drive the vertical axis of a cathode ray tube a sync stripper circuit was used to isolate the sync pulses

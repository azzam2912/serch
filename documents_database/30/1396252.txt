the new record always sets a tone but the catalog will be there she told billboard by utilizing the whole catalog you re able to tell a different story every night if you come to one of my shows there are a lot of songs and each night can be different when you have a big catalog why not give different songs an opportunity to come out and play on the band and crew there will be long days and long hours everyone has to have their chops up for a lot of songs once you ve been playing for a while four weeks into a tour your chops are tight and you know a lot more songs but when you re starting you have to really build your repertoire back up and the light guys and sound guys everybody s got to dial in and program their individual responsibilities and when you re changing the show every night that means you can t just sit back and do crack these are the songs she performed more than 20 of the time

there is a continuous supply of calcium ions into waterways from rocks organisms and soils calcium ions are consumed and removed from aqueous environments as they react to form insoluble structures such as calcium carbonate and calcium silicate which can deposit to form sediments or the exoskeletons of organisms calcium ions can also be utilized biologically as calcium is essential to biological functions such as the production of bones and teeth or cellular function the calcium cycle is a common thread between terrestrial marine geological and biological processes calcium moves through these different media as it cycles throughout the earth the marine calcium cycle is affected by changing atmospheric carbon dioxide due to ocean acidification calcium is stored in geologic reservoirs most commonly in the form of calcium carbonate or as calcium silicate calcium containing rocks include calcite dolomite phosphate and gypsum rocks slowly dissolve by physical and chemical processes carrying calcium ions into rivers and oceans calcium ions ca and magnesium ions mg have the same charge 2 and similar sizes so they react similarly and are able to substitute for each other in some minerals such as carbonates ca containing minerals are often more easily weathered than mg

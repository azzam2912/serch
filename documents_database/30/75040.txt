with a judicious choice for the single instruction and given infinite resources an oisc is capable of being a universal computer in the same manner as traditional computers that have multiple instructions oiscs have been recommended as aids in teaching computer architecture and have been used as computational models in structural computing research in a turing complete model each memory location can store an arbitrary integer anddepending on the modelthere may be arbitrarily many locations the instructions themselves reside in memory as a sequence of such integers there exists a class of universal computers with a single instruction based on bit manipulation such as bit copying or bit inversion since their memory model is finite as is the memory structure used in real computers those bit manipulation machines are equivalent to real computers rather than to turing machines currently known oiscs can be roughly separated into three broad categories bit manipulating machines are the simplest class a bit copying machine called bitbitjump copies one bit in memory and passes the execution unconditionally to the address specified by one of the operands of the instruction this process turns out to be capable of universal computation i e being able to execute

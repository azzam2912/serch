wort contains the sugars the most important being maltose and maltotriose that will be fermented by the brewing yeast to produce alcohol wort also contains crucial amino acids to provide nitrogen to the yeast as well as more complex proteins contributing to beer head retention and flavour the first step in wort production is to make malt from dried sprouted barley the malt is then run through a roller mill and cracked this cracked grain is then mashed that is mixed with hot water and steeped a slow heating process that enables enzymes to convert the starch in the malt into sugars at set intervals most notably when the mixture has reached temperatures of 45 62 and 73 c 113 144 and 163 f the heating is briefly halted the temperature of the mixture is usually increased to 78 c 172 f for mashout lautering is the next step which means the sugar extracted grist or solids remaining in the mash are separated from the liquid wort in homebrewing the malt making and mashing steps can be skipped by adding malt extract to water the mixture is then boiled to sanitize the wort and in the case of most beer

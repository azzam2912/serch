the manifold absolute pressure sensor provides instantaneous manifold pressure information to the engine s electronic control unit ecu the data is used to calculate air density and determine the engine s air mass flow rate which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion see stoichiometry and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing a fuel injected engine may alternatively use a mass airflow sensor maf sensor to detect the intake airflow a typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other whereas forced induction engines typically use both a maf sensor on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body and a map sensor on the intake tract pre turbo map sensor data can be converted to air mass data by using a second variable coming from an iat sensor intake air temperature sensor this is called the speed density method engine speed rpm is also used to determine where on a look up table to determine fuelling hence speed density engine speed air density the map sensor can also be used in obd ii on board diagnostics applications to test the egr exhaust gas recirculation valve for functionality an application typical in obd ii

nrf interactions typically take place above 1 mev and most nrf experiments target heavy nuclei such as uranium and thorium this process is used for scanning cargo for contraband its far more effective than just using x rays because x rays can only see the shape of the item in question with nuclear resonance fluorescence its possible to see what the molecular structure is and thus distinguish between salt and cocaine without even opening the container from national geographic magazine february 2018 article they are watching us by robert draper nrf reactions are the result of nuclear absorption and subsequent emission of high energy photons gamma rays as a gamma ray strikes the nucleus the nucleus becomes excited that is the nuclear system as a quantum mechanical ensemble is put into a state with a higher energy much like electronic excitation the nucleus will decay toward its ground state releasing a high energy photon at a number of possible discrete energies thus nrf can be quantified using spectroscopy nuclei can be identified by the distinct pattern of nrf emission peaks although nrf analysis is much less straightforward than typical electronic emissions as the energy of incident photons increases the average

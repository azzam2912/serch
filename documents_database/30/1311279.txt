species within the family have gelatinous basidiocarps fruit bodies that produce spores on septate basidia and as such were formerly referred to the heterobasidiomycetes or jelly fungi all appear to be saprotrophic growing on dead wood or plant remains less than 10 species are currently included within the hyaloriaceae but the family has not been extensively researched the family was established in 1900 by german mycologist gustav lindau to accommodate a single neotropical species hyaloria pilacre lindau considered his new family to be close to the tremellaceae but distinguished by the angiocarpous or gasteroid development of its fruit bodies meaning that the spore bearing hymenia were covered until maturity rather than exposed the hyaloriaceae were placed within the order tremellales by most subsequent authors until 1984 when american mycologist robert bandoni revised this group of fungi and placed the family within the auriculariales wells 1994 later extended the hyaloriaceae to include other genera with myxarioid basidia septate basidia with an enucleate stalk previously placed in the aporpiaceae or myxariaceae initial molecular research based on cladistic analysis of dna sequences has supported the placement of the hyaloriaceae within the auriculariales and has also supported wells placement of the genus myxarium within

cgi is an approach to teaching mathematics rather than a curriculum program at the core of this approach is the practice of listening to children s mathematical thinking and using it as a basis for instruction research based frameworks of children s thinking in the domains of addition and subtraction multiplication and division base ten concepts multidigit operations algebra geometry and fractions provide guidance to teachers about listening to their students case studies of teachers using cgi have shown the most accomplished teachers use a variety of practices to extend children s mathematical thinking it s a tenet of cgi that there is no one way to implement the approach and that teachers professional judgment is central to making decisions about how to use information about children s thinking the research base on children mathematical thinking upon which cgi is based shows that children are able to solve problems without direct instruction by drawing upon informal knowledge of everyday situations for example a study of kindergarten children showed that young children can solve problems involving what are normally considered advanced mathematics such as multiplication division and multistep problems by using direct modeling direct modeling is an approach to problem solving

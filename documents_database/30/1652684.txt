he is the founder president and chief scientific officer at genome international corporation a biotechnology bioinformatics and information technology firm based in madison wisconsin which develops computational genomics applications of next generation dna sequencing ngs and clinical decision support systems for analyzing patient genome data that aids in diagnosis and treatment of diseases dr senapathy is known for his contributions in genetics genomics and clinical genomics especially in the biology of rna splicing and the split structure of eukaryotic genes he developed the shapiro senapathy algorithm s s for predicting the splice sites exons and genes of eukaryotes which has become the primary methodology for discovering disease causing mutations in splice junctions the s s has been implemented in many gene finding and mutation detection tools that are used extensively in major clinical and research institutions around the world for uncovering mutations in thousands of patients with numerous diseases including cancers and inherited disorders it is increasingly used in the next generation sequencing era as it is widely realized that 50 of all diseases and adverse drug reactions in humans and other animals possibly occur within the splicing regions of genes the s s algorithm has been cited in 4

it is a part of the central china orogenic belt aligned in an east west orientation across central china and spans portions of shaanxi henan and gansu provinces along the qinling mountains which are one of the greatest mountain ranges in china the first materials involved in the qinling orogenic belt formed around 2 5 billion years ago whereas the main morphology of the belt now largely reflects the triassic collision between the north china plate and the south china plate and cenozoic extension across china during these 2 5 billion years various types of rocks have been formed here due to different tectonic processes and chemical reactions between rocks therefore geologists are able to reconstruct the evolution of mountain belt based on evidence preserved in these rocks throughout the long history of the evolution of qinling orogenic belt there were several cycles of plate collisions and plate separations together with ocean openings and closures occurred the process is known as a wilson cycle the qinling orogenic belt was formed largely because of the movements of north china block and yangtze block of the south china plate the qingling orogenic belt can be divided into two major regions the north

the attack was first published in 2002 by researchers nicolas courtois and josef pieprzyk it has caused some controversy as it was claimed to have the potential to break the advanced encryption standard aes cipher also known as rijndael faster than an exhaustive search since aes is already widely used in commerce and government for the transmission of secret information finding a technique that can shorten the amount of time it takes to retrieve the secret message without having the key could have wide implications the method has a high work factor which unless lessened means the technique does not reduce the effort to break aes in comparison to an exhaustive search therefore it does not affect the real world security of block ciphers in the near future nonetheless the attack has caused some experts to express greater unease at the algebraic simplicity of the current aes in overview the xsl attack relies on first analyzing the internals of a cipher and deriving a system of quadratic simultaneous equations these systems of equations are typically very large for example 8 000 equations with 1 600 variables for the 128 bit aes several methods for solving such systems are known in

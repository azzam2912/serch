the cell anode and cathode half cells are separated by two bars or slashes representing a salt bridge with the anode on the left and cathode on the right individual solid liquid or aqueous phases within each half cell are separated by a single bar concentrations of dissolved species in each phase written in parentheses and the state of each phase usually s solid l liquid g gas or aq aqueous solution is included in a subscript after the species name some examples of this notation are this means that the left electrode anode is made of zinc while the other one right cathode is composed of a silver wire covered by a silver chloride layer which is not soluble both of the electrodes are immersed into aqueous media where are present zinc and chloride ions this cell is very famous the daniell cell if the electrodes are connected a spontaneous reaction takes place zinc is oxidized and copper ions are reduced sometimes the state of each species into the cell is written for example in the zinc cell shown above we can write that zinc silver and silver chloride are solids while zinc cation and chloride anion are in

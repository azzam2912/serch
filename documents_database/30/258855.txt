it is found in the medulla oblongata normally the heart beats without nervous control but in some situations e g exercise body trauma the cardiovascular centre is responsible for altering the rate at which the heart beats it also mediates respiratory sinus arrhythmia when a change of blood ph is detected by central chemoreceptors or by peripheral chemoreceptors in aortic bodies and in carotid bodies or a change of blood pressure is detected by baroreceptors in the aortic sinuses or carotid sinuses the cardiovascular centre affects changes to the heart rate by sending a nerve impulse to the cardiac pacemaker or sa node via sympathetic fibres to cause faster and stronger cardiac muscle contraction and the vagus nerve to cause slower and less strong cardiac muscle contraction the cardiovascular centre also increases the stroke volume of the heart that is the amount of blood it pumps these two changes help to regulate the cardiac output so that a sufficient amount of blood reaches tissue hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine can affect the cardiovascular centre and cause it to increase the rate of impulses sent to the sinoatrial node or pacemaker resulting in faster and stronger cardiac muscle contraction and thus

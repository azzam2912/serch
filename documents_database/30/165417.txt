the beetles excavate tunnels in dead or stressed trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens their sole source of nutrition after landing on a suitable tree an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont the fungus penetrates the plant s xylem tissue extracts nutrients from it and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery ambrosia fungi are typically poor wood degraders and instead utilize less demanding nutrients the majority of ambrosia beetles colonize xylem sapwood and or heartwood of recently dead trees but some attack stressed trees that are still alive and a few species attack healthy trees species differ in their preference for different parts of trees different stages of deterioration and in the shape of their tunnels galleries however the majority of ambrosia beetles are not specialized to any taxonomic group of hosts unlike most phytophagous organisms including the closely related bark beetles one species of ambrosia beetle austroplatypus incompertus exhibits eusociality one of the few organisms outside of hymenoptera and isoptera to do so until recently ambrosia beetles have been placed in independent families scolytidae and platypodidae however they are in fact some of the

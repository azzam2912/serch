free mo s emphasis is on flexibility in track design and prototypical scenery and operations free mo was developed with the idea that a set of standards focusing mainly on module end plates would enable faithful modeling of prototype track plans and operations in a modular environment the length and track configuration of a free mo module or module set is up to the modeler free mo modules may be long or short straight or curved free mo modules may even be composed of several sections forming a module set the advent of digital command control has simplified the electrical wiring requirements for controlling trains and thereby gives free mo layouts unprecedented flexibility there are free mo groups all over north america modular model railroading developed as a means for hobbyists who lack a permanent layout want to meet other modelers and share their hobby or have a desire to learn more about the hobby these modelers participate in clubs or groups where members construct various modules that typically form an oval or square design free mo layouts on the other hand are point to point or point to loop and can be operated prototypically free mo modules typically have

this occurs most commonly after the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias in oncology and hematology this is a potentially fatal complication and patients at increased risk for tls should be closely monitored before during and after their course of chemotherapy tumor lysis syndrome is characterized by high blood potassium hyperkalemia high blood phosphate hyperphosphatemia low blood calcium hypocalcemia high blood uric acid hyperuricemia and higher than normal levels of blood urea nitrogen bun and other nitrogen containing compounds azotemia these changes in blood electrolytes and metabolites are a result of the release of cellular contents of dying cells into the bloodstream from breakdown of cells in this respect tls is analogous to rhabdomyolysis with comparable mechanism and blood chemistry effects but with different cause in tls the breakdown occurs after cytotoxic therapy or from cancers with high cell turnover and tumor proliferation rates the metabolic abnormalities seen in tumor lysis syndrome can ultimately result in nausea and vomiting but more seriously acute uric acid nephropathy acute kidney failure seizures cardiac arrhythmias and death acute uric acid nephropathy auan due to hyperuricosuria has been a dominant cause of acute kidney failure but with the advent of effective treatments for hyperuricosuria auan

cdk4 is a member of the cyclin dependent kinase family the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the ser thr protein kinase family this protein is highly similar to the gene products of s cerevisiae cdc28 and s pombe cdc2 it is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex that is important for cell cycle g1 phase progression the activity of this kinase is restricted to the g1 s phase which is controlled by the regulatory subunits d type cyclins and cdk inhibitor p16 this kinase was shown to be responsible for the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene product rb ser thr kinase component of cyclin d cdk4 dc complexes that phosphorylate and inhibit members of the retinoblastoma rb protein family including rb1 and regulate the cell cycle during g1 s transition phosphorylation of rb1 allows dissociation of the transcription factor e2f from the rb e2f complexes and the subsequent transcription of e2f target genes which are responsible for the progression through the g1 phase hypophosphorylates rb1 in early g1 phase cyclin d cdk4 complexes are major integrators of various mitogenic and antimitogenic signals also phosphorylates smad3 in a cell cycle dependent manner and represses its transcriptional

in other words polyl dspace log n where n denotes the input size and o 1 denotes a constant just as l p polyl qp however the only proven relationship between polyl and p is that polyl p it is unknown if polyl p if p polyl or if neither is contained in the other one proof that polyl p is that p has a complete problem under logarithmic space many one reductions but polyl does not due to the space hierarchy theorem the space hierarchy theorem guarantees that dspace log n dspace log n for all integers d 0 if polyl had a complete problem call it a it would be an element of dspace log n for some integer k 0 suppose problem b is an element of dspace log n dspace log n the assumption that a is complete implies the following o log n space algorithm for b reduce b to a in logarithmic space then decide a in o log n space this implies that b is an element of dspace log n and hence violates the space hierarchy theorem

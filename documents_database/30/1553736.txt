for example a tester wearing a head mounted display hmd or augmented reality contact lenses that places images of both the physical world and registered virtual graphical objects over the user s view of the world can detect virtual labels on areas of a system to clarify test operating instructions for a tester who is performing tests on a complex system in 2009 as a spin off to augmented reality for maintenance and repair armar alexander andelkovic coined the idea augmented reality based testing introducing the idea of using augmented reality together with software testing the test environment of technology is becoming more complex this puts higher demand on test engineers to have higher knowledge testing skills and work effective a powerful unexplored dimension that can be utilized is the virtual environment a lot of information and data that today is available but unpractical to use due to overhead in time needed to gather and present can with arbt be used instantly arbt can be of help in following test environments assembling and disassembling a test object can be learned out and practice scenarios can be run through to learn how to fix fault scenarios that may occur minimizing risk

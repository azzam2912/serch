the album was recorded entirely by matt mondanile and was the second full length ducktails album to be released in 2009 regarding the album s artwork mondanile noted it has this purple palm tree imagery kind of two images it s kind of just like each of my record covers i want to be pop art that goes along with the record cartoon to pop that s kind of my style taking that and seeing what you can do with it to make it weird fact magazine characterized landscapes as a series of soft focus aural polaroids calling it a breathtakingly pretty album whose sense of place is open and plural it can conjure or complement whatever landscape you will it to from a verdant forest to a sun scorched desert from an overcrowded city to an empty beach in a positive review for pitchfork david bevan praised matt mondanile s layered recording techniques writing landscapes is rarely anything but engaging wishes in particular is a slacker standout more harmonically rich more sweetly and appropriately lonesome than anything else here

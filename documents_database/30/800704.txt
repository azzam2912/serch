they consist of a loop of cells containing genetic information which flows continuously around the loop and out along an arm or pseudopod which will become the daughter loop the genes instruct it to make three left turns completing the loop which then disconnects from its parent in 1952 john von neumann created the first cellular automaton ca with the goal of creating a self replicating machine this automaton was necessarily very complex due to its computation and construction universality in 1968 edgar f codd reduced the number of states from 29 in von neumann s ca to 8 in his when christopher langton did away with the universality condition he was able to significantly reduce the automaton s complexity its self replicating loops are based on one of the simplest elements in codd s automaton the periodic emitter langton s loops run in a ca that has 8 states and uses the von neumann neighborhood with rotational symmetry the transition table can be found here as with codd s ca langton s loops consist of sheathed wires the signals travel passively along the wires until they reach the open ends when the command they carry is executed because of

the main reservoirs of stenotrophomonas are soil and plants stenotrophomonas species range from common soil organisms s nitritireducens to opportunistic human pathogens s maltophilia the molecular taxonomy of the genus is still somewhat unclear the most common species s maltophilia is very versatile and can be beneficial for plant growth and health can be used in agriculture biocontrol bioremediation and phytoremediation strategies as well as the production of biomolecules of economic value on the other hand some of s maltophilia strains are pathogenic to humans with multidrug resistant profile s indologenes can also cause or be part of polymicrobial infections in humans especially small children stenotrophomonas can also be phytopathogenic unlike closely related genera xylella and xanthomonas members of the genus stenotrophomonas have an important ecological role in the nitrogen and sulphur cycles stenotrophomonas species especially s maltophilia and s rhizophila are often found in association with plants such as cucumber oilseed rape potato strawberry alfalfa sunflower maize rice wheat various weeds willow and poplar stenotrophomonas can be isolated from the rhizosphere or from internal plant tissues particularly from the vascular tissues of the root and stem the first species described was s maltophila by hugh and ryschenko in 1961

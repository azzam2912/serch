for example the delta of an option is the value an option changes due to a 1 move in the underlying commodity or equity stock to calculate impact of prices the formula is impact of prices option delta price move so if the price moves 100 and the option s delta is 0 05 then the impact of prices is 0 05 to generalize then for example to yield curves the revaluation method recalculates the value of a trade based on the current and the prior day s prices the formula for impact of prices using the revaluation method is for some small value assets such as loose tools pnl unexplained is a critical metric that regulators and product control within a bank alike pay attention to pnl attribution is used to test the hypothesis that the risk factors identified for a risky position are sufficient to materially explain the value change expected from the risky position such that if position sensitivities to those risk factors are calculated then the value change observed over a day can be attributed to the market price change of those risk factors with the magnitude of the estimated as a sum product of the

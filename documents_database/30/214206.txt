individual or small group efforts or small science are still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions such as the large hadron collider costing between 5 and 10 billion while science and technology have always been important to and driven by warfare the increase in military funding of science following the second world war was on a scale wholly unprecedented james conant in a 1941 letter to chemical engineering news said that world war ii is a physicist s war rather than a chemist s a phrase that was cemented in the vernacular in post war discussion of the role that those scientists played in the development of new weapons and tools notably the proximity fuse radar and the atomic bomb the bulk of these last two activities took place in a new form of research facility the government sponsored laboratory employing thousands of technicians and scientists managed by universities in this case the university of california and the massachusetts institute of technology in the shadow of the first atomic weapons the importance of a strong scientific research establishment was apparent to any country

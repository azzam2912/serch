because virtually all molecules are fluxional in some respects e g bond rotations in most organic compounds the term fluxional depends on the context and the method used to assess the dynamics often a molecule is considered fluxional if its spectroscopic signature exhibits line broadening beyond that dictated by the heisenberg uncertainty principle due to chemical exchange in some cases where the rates are slow fluxionality is not detected spectroscopically but by isotopic labeling where such movement does not occur the molecule may be described as a semi rigid molecule the prototypical fluxional molecule is phosphorus pentafluoride its f nmr spectrum consists of a p coupled doublet indicating that the equatorial and axial fluorine centers interchange rapidly on the nmr timescale fluorine 19 nmr spectroscopy even at temperatures as low as 100 c fails to distinguish the axial from the equatorial fluorine environments the apparent equivalency arises from the low barrier for pseudorotation via the berry mechanism by which the axial and equatorial fluorine atoms rapidly exchange positions a well studied fluxional ion is the carbonium ion which is protonated methane ch in this unusual species whose ir spectrum was recently experimentally observed and more recently understood the barriers to

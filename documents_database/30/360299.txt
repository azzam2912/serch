in dairying the scc is an indicator of the quality of milk specifically its low likeliness to contain harmful bacteria and thus its high food safety white blood cells leukocytes constitute the majority of somatic cells in question the number of somatic cells increases in response to pathogenic bacteria like staphylococcus aureus a cause of mastitis the scc is quantified as cells per milliliter general agreement rests on a reference range of less than 100 000 cells ml for uninfected cows and greater than 250 000 for cows infected with significant pathogen levels several tests like the portascc milk test and the california mastitis test provide a cow side measure of somatic cell count the somatic cell count in the milk also increases after calving when colostrum is produced the methods of determining grade a milk quality are well established and are based on the somatic cell count and the bacteria plate count generally a lower somatic cell count indicates better animal health while the bacteria plate count indicates improved equipment sanitation somatic cells originate only from inside the animal s udder while the bacteria are usually from external contaminations such as insufficient cleaning of the milk transport equipment or

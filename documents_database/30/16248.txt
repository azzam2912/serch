a typical multimeter can measure voltage current and resistance analog multimeters use a microammeter with a moving pointer to display readings digital multimeters dmm dvom have a numeric display and may also show a graphical bar representing the measured value digital multimeters are now far more common due to their lower cost and greater precision but analog multimeters are still preferable in some cases for example when monitoring a rapidly varying value a multimeter can be a hand held device useful for basic fault finding and field service work or a bench instrument which can measure to a very high degree of accuracy multimeters are available in a wide range of features and prices cheap multimeters can cost less than us 10 while laboratory grade models with certified calibration can cost more than us 5 000 the first moving pointer current detecting device was the galvanometer in 1820 these were used to measure resistance and voltage by using a wheatstone bridge and comparing the unknown quantity to a reference voltage or resistance while useful in the lab the devices were very slow and impractical in the field these galvanometers were bulky and delicate the d arsonval weston meter movement uses

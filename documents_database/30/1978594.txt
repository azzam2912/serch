wair allows birds to run up steep or vertical inclines by flapping their wings scaling greater inclines than possible through running alone the wair origin of flight hypothesis proposes that the nascent wings of theropod dinosaurs were used to propel the animal up slopes such as cliffs or trees in a similar manner to that employed by modern birds and that powered flight eventually evolved from this usage during its proposal it was suggested that wair might have plausibly been used by feathered theropods like caudipteryx to develop aerial flight wing assisted incline running has been studied extensively in chicks of the chukar partridge alectoris chukar and has been observed in juveniles and adults of other species of galliformes as well as the rock dove columba livia in chukar chicks wair was experimentally demonstrated by comparing maximum inclines ascended by normal chicks to those with wing feathers trimmed or plucked entirely on both smooth and rough surfaces normal chicks were able to run up much steeper slopes than the other two groups reaching maximum angles of 105 from the horizontal chicks used running alone at slopes up to 45 then employed wing flapping at greater slopes and maximum slope successfully

learning can be supervised semi supervised or unsupervised deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks deep belief networks recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing audio recognition social network filtering machine translation bioinformatics drug design medical image analysis material inspection and board game programs where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases superior to human experts artificial neural networks anns were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems anns have various differences from biological brains specifically neural networks tend to be static and symbolic while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic plastic and analog deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces most modern deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks specifically convolutional neural networks cnn s although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer wise in

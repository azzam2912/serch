to be classified as such morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a panmictic population one with random mating put simply polymorphism is when there are two or more possibilities of a trait on a gene for example there is more than one possible trait in terms of a jaguar s skin colouring they can have light morph or dark morph colouring due to having more than one possible variation for this gene it is termed polymorphism however if the jaguar has only one possible trait for that gene it would be termed monomorphic for example if there was only one possible skin colour that a jaguar could have it would be termed monomorphic the term polyphenism can be used to clarify that the different forms arise from the same genotype genetic polymorphism is a term used somewhat differently by geneticists and molecular biologists to describe certain mutations in the genotype such as single nucleotide polymorphisms that may not always correspond to a phenotype but always corresponds to a branch in the genetic tree see below polymorphism is common in nature it is related to biodiversity genetic variation and adaptation polymorphism usually functions to

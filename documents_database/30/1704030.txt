despite often being noncoding dna some ultra conserved elements have been found to be transcriptionally active giving non coding rna molecules perfect conservation of these long stretches of dna is thought to imply evolutionary importance as these regions appear to have experienced strong negative purifying selection for 300 400 million years the probability of finding ultra conserved elements by chance under neutral evolution has been estimated at less than 10 in 2 9 billion bases 481 ultra conserved elements have been identified in the human genome a database collecting genomic information about ultra conserved elements ucbase that share 100 identity among human mouse and rat is available at http ucbase unimore it a small number of those which are transcribed have been connected with human carcinomas and leukemias for example tuc338 is strongly upregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells indeed uces are often affected by copy number variation in cancer cells much more than in healthy contexts suggesting that altering the copy number of ultraconserved elements may be deleterious and associated with cancer a study comparing ultra conserved elements between humans and the japanese puffer fish takifugu rubripes proposed an importance in vertebrate development several ultra conserved elements are located

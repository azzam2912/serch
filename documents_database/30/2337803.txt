for the formation of this atom scientists had to combine two fields of atomic physics bose einstein condensates and rydberg atoms rydberg atoms are formed by exciting a single atom into a high energy state in which the electron is very far from the nucleus bose einstein condensates are a state of matter that is produced at temperatures close to absolute zero polarons are induced by using a laser to excite rydberg atoms contained as impurities in a bose einstein condensate in those rydberg atoms the average distance between the electron and its nucleus can be as large as several hundred nanometres which is more than a thousand times the radius of a hydrogen atom under that circumstances the distance between the nucleus and the electron of the excited rydberg atoms is higher than the average distance of the atoms of the condensate as a result some atoms lie inside the orbit of the rydberg atom s electron as the atoms don t have an electric charge they only produce a minimal force on the electron however the electron is slightly scattered at the neutral atoms without even leaving its orbit and the weak bond that is generated between the

biological processes preferentially take up the lower mass isotope through kinetic fractionation however some abiotic processes do the same methane from hydrothermal vents can be depleted by up to 50 the standard established for carbon 13 work was the pee dee belemnite pdb and was based on a cretaceous marine fossil belemnitella americana which was from the peedee formation in south carolina this material had an anomalously high c c ratio 0 01118 and was established as c value of zero since the original pdb specimen is no longer available its c c ratio is currently back calculated from a widely measured carbonate standard nbs 19 which has a c value of 1 95 the c c ratio of nbs 19 is 0 011078 0 988922 0 011202 therefore the correct c c ratio of pdb derived from nbs 19 should be 0 011202 1 95 1000 1 0 011202 1 00195 0 01118 note that there is a widely used but incorrect pdb c c ratio of 0 0112372 which is the result of a sign error in the interconversion between standards use of the pdb standard gives most natural material a negative c a material with a ratio

this white solid is the most common soap it is found in many types of solid deodorants rubbers latex paints and inks it is also a component of some food additives and food flavorings characteristic of soaps sodium stearate has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts the carboxylate and the long hydrocarbon chain respectively these two chemically different components induce the formation of micelles which present the hydrophilic heads outwards and their hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails inwards providing a lipophilic environment for hydrophobic compounds the tail part dissolves the grease or dirt and forms the micelle it is also used in the pharmaceutical industry as a surfactant to aid the solubility of hydrophobic compounds in the production of various mouth foams sodium stearate is produced as a major component of soap upon saponification of oils and fats the percentage of the sodium stearate depends on the ingredient fats tallow is especially high in stearic acid content as the triglyceride whereas most fats only contain a few percent the idealized equation for the formation of sodium stearate from stearin the triglyceride of stearic acid follows purified sodium stearate can be made by neutralizing stearic acid with sodium hydroxide

kohman in 1947 kohman originally suggested nuclide as referring to a species of atom characterized by the constitution of its nucleus defined by containing a certain number of neutrons and protons the word thus was originally intended to focus on the nucleus a nuclide is a species of an atom with a specific number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus for example carbon 13 with 6 protons and 7 neutrons the nuclide concept referring to individual nuclear species emphasizes nuclear properties over chemical properties while the isotope concept grouping all atoms of each element emphasizes chemical over nuclear the neutron number has large effects on nuclear properties but its effect on chemical reactions is negligible for most elements even in the case of the very lightest elements where the ratio of neutron number to atomic number varies the most between isotopes it usually has only a small effect although it does matter in some circumstances for hydrogen the lightest element the isotope effect is large enough to strongly affect biological systems since isotope is the older term it is better known than nuclide and is still sometimes used in contexts where nuclide might be more appropriate such as nuclear

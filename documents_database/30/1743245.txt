the elliptic curve describing the square stella octangula numbers may be placed in the equivalent weierstrass form by the change of variables because the two factors and of the square number are relatively prime they must each be squares themselves and the second change of variables formula 3 and formula 4 leads to ljunggren s equation a theorem of siegel states that every elliptic curve has only finitely many integer solutions and found a difficult proof that the only integer solutions to his equation were and corresponding to the two square stella octangula numbers louis j mordell conjectured that the proof could be simplified and several later authors published simplifications the stella octangula numbers arise in a parametric family of instances to the crossed ladders problem in which the lengths and heights of the ladders and the height of their crossing point are all integers in these instances the ratio between the heights of the two ladders is a stella octangula number

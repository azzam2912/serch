these substances have very short lifetimes typically less than 6 months vsls are responsible for atmospheric damage once they enter the stratosphere and are a contributing factor to the destruction of ozone vsls are ozone depleting halogen containing substances found in the stratosphere these substances have very short lifetimes typically less than 6 months approximately 90 of vsls are produced by natural processes and their rate of production is increasing they are bromine compounds produced by seaweed and the ocean s phytoplankton only 10 of ozone deleting chlorine compounds are man made vsls are responsible for atmospheric damage once they enter the stratosphere and are a contributing factor to the destruction of the ozone layer in previous decades it was believed that the most significant factor in ozone depletion was the increase in chlorofluorocarbons cfcs currently vsls are increasing rapidly mainly due to industrial activities the primary vsls is n propyl bromide chbr it has been forecast that brominated vsls will increase to about 8 10 of the total vsls emission by the end of 21st century there has not been much research in this area although this is changing as more scientists study this substance to predict its long

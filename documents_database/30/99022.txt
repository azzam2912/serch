it is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data known as training data in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications such as email filtering and computer vision where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task machine learning is closely related to computational statistics which focuses on making predictions using computers the study of mathematical optimization delivers methods theory and application domains to the field of machine learning data mining is a field of study within machine learning and focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning in its application across business problems machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics the name machine learning was coined in 1959 by arthur samuel tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured

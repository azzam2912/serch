other phases which may or may not be present are a problem with n phases is called an n phase problem so a problem with set play and three tries for example is a five phase problem since the actual solution is also a phase each phase may contain a number of variations lines arising from alternatives after the initial move of a phase in a two mover for example variations in the post key play begin on black s first move but variations do not constitute distinct phases in themselves in many problems interest is created from the way in which the play in different phases relate to one another sometimes the play in different phases has similar or contrasting motivation sometimes the actual moves in different phases may change or transfer from one phase to another several basic ideas involving the relationship between different phases have been revisited again and again by composers and have acquired names for example in the zagoruiko at least two black defences are answered by different white continuations in at least three phases in the le grand in one phase move a is threatened and defence x is met by move b while

there are four different anatomical abnormalities that contribute to the disease all of which occur more commonly in brachycephalic breeds an elongated soft palate stenotic nares a hypoplastic trachea and everted laryngeal saccules a condition which occurs secondarily to the other abnormalities because all of these components make it more difficult to breathe in situations of exercise stress or heat an animal with these abnormalities may be unable to take deep or fast enough breaths to blow off carbon dioxide this leads to distress and further increases respiratory rate and heart rate creating a vicious circle that can quickly lead to a life threatening situation dogs experiencing a crisis situation due to brachycephalic syndrome typically benefit from oxygen cool temperatures sedatives and in some cases more advanced medical intervention including intubation muzzle length scales with the risks of brachycephalic syndrome other risk factors identified include neck girth and body condition score symptoms progress with age and typically become severe by 12 months despite observing clinical signs of airway obstructions some owners of brachycephalic breeds may perceive them as normal for the breed and may not seek veterinary intervention until a particularly severe attack happens after awaking from surgery most dogs

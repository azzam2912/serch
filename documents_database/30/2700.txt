as it expands the nozzle collimates the gas into a uniform supersonic beam that is essentially collision free and has a temperature that in the centre of mass frame can be significantly below that of the reservoir gas each nozzle produces a characteristic temperature this way any temperature between room temperature and about 10k can be achieved there are relatively few cresu apparatuses in existence for the simple reason that the gas throughput and pumping requirements are huge which makes them expensive to run two of the leading centres have been the university of rennes france and the university of birmingham uk a more recent development has been a pulsed version of the cresu which requires far less gas and therefore smaller pumps most species have a negligible vapour pressure at such low temperatures and this means that they quickly condense on the sides of the apparatus essentially the cresu technique provides a wall less flow tube which allows the kinetics of gas phase reactions to be investigated at much lower temperatures than otherwise possible chemical kinetics experiments can then be carried out in a pump probe fashion using a laser to initiate the reaction for example by preparing one

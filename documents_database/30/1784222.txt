it behaves as a potent agonist of the and opioid receptors with roughly equipotent affinity and also has similarly high affinity as well as subtype selectivity for the opioid receptor despite its peptidic nature upon systemic administration metkefamide rapidly penetrates the blood brain barrier and disperses into the central nervous system where it produces potent centrally mediated analgesic effects of which have been shown to be dependent on activity at both the and opioid receptors in addition on account of modifications to the n and c terminals metkefamide is highly stable against proteolytic degradation relative to many other opioid peptides as an example while its parent peptide met enkephalin has an in vivo half life of merely seconds metkefamide has a half life of nearly 60 minutes and upon intramuscular administration has been shown to provide pain relief that lasts for hours likely on account of its opioid activity clinical trials have found metkefamide to possess less of a tendency for producing many of the undesirable side effects usually associated with conventional opioids such as respiratory depression tolerance and physical dependence however it has been shown to cause some additional side effects that are considered unusual for standard opioid analgesics

it is near the lower limit of brightness for stars that can be seen with the naked eye having an apparent visual magnitude of 6 02 the estimated distance to this system is about 4 600 light years it is a member of the sgr ob7 cluster along with the o type star 15 sgr it is ionizing an h ii region along the western edge of the molecular cloud l291 mason et al 1998 found this to be a member of a speckle binary with an estimated orbital period of roughly 130 years and a magnitude difference of 0 4 both components show indications of a variable radial velocity suggesting that they are spectroscopic binaries making it a candidate quadruple star system however tokovinin 2008 considers it a triple star system orbital elements for the main spectroscopic binary components aa and ab were published by mayer et al 2014 giving an orbital period of 12 76 days and an eccentricity of 0 18 this system displays a merged stellar classification of o9 5 iii matching an blue hued o type giant star it shows a longitudinal magnetic field strength of and a projected rotational velocity of 51 km s

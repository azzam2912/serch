sadi services utilize semantic web technologies at every level of the web services stack services are described in owl dl where the property restrictions in owl classes are used to define the properties expected of the input and output data invocation of sadi services is achieved through http post of rdf data representing owl individuals instances of the defined input owl class and the resulting output data will be owl individuals of the defined output owl class sadi design patterns place a single unique constraint on the behaviour of the service in that the uri of the input individual and the uri of the output individual must be identical the consequence of this constraint is that the service provider must connect the output to the input through a defined predicate effectively the output is about the input and the relationship between input and output is explicit as such sadi services become the source of new linked data relating the input and output of a service and chains of sadi services produce uninterrupted linked data graphs sadi has been used in a number of bioinformatics data integration case studies and for semantic querying of relational data in clinical informatics settings

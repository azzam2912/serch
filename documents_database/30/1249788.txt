his activities include a wide range of issues surrounding the physics and technical applications of stochastic fluctuations noises in physical biological and technological systems including nanotechnology his earlier long term positions include the department of experimental physics university of szeged hungary jate 1982 1997 and angstrom laboratory uppsala university sweden 1997 2001 during the same periods he had also conducted scientific research in short term positions such as at the eindhoven university of technology netherlands 1986 1997 university of cologne germany 1989 1990 national research laboratory of metrology japan 1991 university of birmingham united kingdom 1993 and others he received his ms in physics from attila j zsef university jate hungary 1980 and doctoral degree in solid state physics at jate in 1984 he had no official phd adviser though his mentors were laszlo vize and miklos torok he received a docent in solid state physics habilitation from uppsala university sweden in 1994 he received a doctor of science physics from the hungarian academy of sciences in 2001 his main areas of interest have been related to stochastic fluctuations noise especially those related to the relevant laws limits and applications including the addressing of new or open questions or exposing

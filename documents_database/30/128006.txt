the x 2 was a rocket powered swept wing research aircraft developed jointly in 1945 by bell aircraft corporation the united states air force and the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca to explore aerodynamic problems of supersonic flight and to expand the speed and altitude regimes obtained with the earlier x 1 series of research aircraft the bell x 2 was developed to provide a vehicle for researching flight characteristics at speeds and altitudes in excess of the capabilities of the bell x 1 and d 558 ii while investigating aerodynamic heating problems in what was then called the thermal thicket the bell x 2 had a prolonged development period due to the advances needed in aerodynamic design control systems materials that retained adequate mechanical properties at high temperature and other technologies that had to be developed not only did the x 2 push the envelope of manned flight to speeds altitudes and temperatures beyond any other aircraft at the time it pioneered throttleable rocket motors in u s aircraft previously demonstrated on the me 163b during world war ii and digital flight simulation the xlr25 rocket engine built by curtiss wright was based on the smoothly variable thrust

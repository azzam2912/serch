it is equal to the molar mass m divided by the mass density it has the si unit cubic metres per mole m mol although it is more practical to use the units cubic decimetres per mole dm mol for gases and cubic centimetres per mole cm mol for liquids and solids the molar volume of a substance is defined as its molar mass divided by its density if the sample is a mixture containing n components the molar volume may be approximated as the sum of the molar volume of its individual components using the density of the mixture however many liquid liquid mixtures for instance mixing pure ethanol and pure water experience contraction or expansion upon mixing this effect is called excess volume for ideal gases the molar volume is given by the ideal gas equation this is a good approximation for many common gases at standard temperature and pressure the ideal gas equation can be rearranged to give an expression for the molar volume of an ideal gas hence for a given temperature and pressure the molar volume is the same for all ideal gases and is known to the same precision as the gas constant r

the aims of erd are a to reach a larger area from one surface drilling location and b to keep a well in a reservoir for a longer distance in order to maximize its productivity and drainage capability today s challenges in erd are hole cleaning managing the mechanical loads on the drill string and managing downhole pressure there is also the cost issue to consider early erd well definitions related wells to those that exceeded some step out vertical depth ratio often 2 1 however for most highly deviated wells in deepwater environments this definition clearly does not fit some methods have evolved to categorize wells according to their stepout within different vertical depth ranges erd wells then can be described conveniently as shallow intermediate deep and ultradeep other variants are associated with operating in deep water and high pressure high temperature environments currently there is no generally accepted erd well definition what exactly determines a well to be extended reach varies over time and location with the development of technologies and of experiences new technologies emerge that claims to be pushing the existing boundaries of erd one of these is the reelwell drilling method a drilling method solving

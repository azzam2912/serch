in the quark model they are understood to be bound states of a strange quark or antiquark and an up or down antiquark or quark kaons have proved to be a copious source of information on the nature of fundamental interactions since their discovery in cosmic rays in 1947 they were essential in establishing the foundations of the standard model of particle physics such as the quark model of hadrons and the theory of quark mixing the latter was acknowledged by a nobel prize in physics in 2008 kaons have played a distinguished role in our understanding of fundamental conservation laws cp violation a phenomenon generating the observed matter antimatter asymmetry of the universe was discovered in the kaon system in 1964 which was acknowledged by a nobel prize in 1980 moreover direct cp violation was discovered in the kaon decays in the early 2000s by the na48 experiment at cern and the ktev experiment at fermilab the four kaons are as the quark model shows assignments that the kaons form two doublets of isospin that is they belong to the fundamental representation of su 2 called the 2 one doublet of strangeness 1 contains the and the the antiparticles

this is important in understanding how a self reloading firearm works in the simplest terms the locked breech is one way to slow down the opening of the breech of a self reloading firearm when fired the source of power for the movement is recoil the principle of firing a projectile from a firearm is that when the propellant in a bullet s casing is ignited the propellant burns quickly for a very short time this creates a high pressure pocket of gas that expands pushing the projectile bullet out of the chamber and down the barrel of the firearm if the high pressure gas were not confined within certain parts of the weapon it could damage the firearm or injure the shooter a locked breech barrel confines the high pressure gas to the barrel allowing the gas to expand and cool without risk of damaging weapon or shooter because of the pressure drop a breech block can be opened in a self reloading firearm due to the recoil inertia generation by the movement of the projectile the main difference is that there is a very strong lock in the locked breech action where the blowback systems rely on the

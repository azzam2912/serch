it is known from a single fossil specimen consisting of a partial hind limb and foot which was found in fangou formation deposits in luonan county china the bones show uniquely primitive characteristics for its age and its describer considered that it was either a juvenile of a modern bird group or if an adult the only known non neornithine bird to have survived the cretaceous paleogene extinction event unusually for such a recent bird the bones of the foot are not completely fused to one another this characteristic is found in juvenile modern birds and in adults of more primitive non neornithean ornithurine birds all of which were assumed to have become extinct in the cretaceous paleogene extinction event despite a sparse late maastrichtian fossil record limited primarily to north america in 2007 mayr examined the bones and concluded that they represented an adult and probably did come from a non neornithine bird similar to apsaravis longrich and colleagues 2011 doubted this assessment noting that there is the possibility that the bones belonged to a juvenile but also noted that it was not impossible for some archaic birds to have persisted beyond the cretaceous period for some time and

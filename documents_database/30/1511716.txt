in q fish the technique uses labelled cy3 or fitc synthetic dna mimics called peptide nucleic acid pna oligonucleotides to quantify target sequences in chromosomal dna using fluorescent microscopy and analysis software q fish is most commonly used to study telomere length which in vertebrates are repetitive hexameric sequences ttaggg located at the distal end of chromosomes telomeres are necessary at chromosome ends to prevent dna damage responses as well as genome instability to this day the q fish method continues to be utilized in the field of telomere research due to the fact that pna backbones contain no charged phosphate groups binding between pna and dna is stronger than that of dna dna or dna rna duplexes q fish utilizes this unique characteristic of pnas where at low ionic strengths pnas can anneal to complementary single stranded dna sequences while single stranded dna cannot by using conditions that only allow labeled ccctaa pna to hybridize to ttaggg target sequences q fish is able to quantify the hybridization of pnas to telomeric sequences several hours prior to harvesting the cultured cells colcemid is added to the culture medium colcemid acts to arrest cells in the metaphase state by disrupting microtubules

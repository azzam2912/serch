on march 1 1978 it crashed during an aborted takeoff resulting in the deaths of four passengers the aircraft involved in the accident was a mcdonnell douglas dc 10 10 registered n68045 which had made its first flight in 1972 the aircraft began its take off from los angeles international airport at approximately 9 25 am during the take off roll the recapping tread of the no 2 tire on the left main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out that in turn imposed an overload on the no 1 tire on the same axle resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout pieces of metal from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the no 5 tire on the left main gear causing it to also blow out although the captain who was operating his last flight before retirement initiated the abort procedure at below v1 speed it became apparent the aircraft could not stop within the confines of the runway this was the direct result of the partial loss of braking power following the failure of the three tires on the left main gear and

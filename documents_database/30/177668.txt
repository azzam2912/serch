this algorithm is slow in practice because we need to search many such numbers and only a few satisfy the strict equation however n may also be factored if we can satisfy the weaker congruence of squares condition from here we easily deduce this means that n divides the product x y x y thus x y and x y each contain factors of n but those factors can be trivial in this case we need to find another x and y computing the greatest common divisors of x y n and of x y n will give us these factors this can be done quickly using the euclidean algorithm congruences of squares are extremely useful in integer factorization algorithms and are extensively used in for example the quadratic sieve general number field sieve continued fraction factorization and dixon s factorization conversely because finding square roots modulo a composite number turns out to be probabilistic polynomial time equivalent to factoring that number any integer factorization algorithm can be used efficiently to identify a congruence of squares it is also possible to use factor bases to help find congruences of squares more quickly instead of looking for formula 6 from the

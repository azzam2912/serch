the condition to pass through a given point p imposes a single linear condition so that conics c through p form a linear system of dimension 4 other types of condition that are of interest include tangency to a given line l in the most elementary treatments a linear system appears in the form of equations with and unknown scalars not both zero here c and c are given conics abstractly we can say that this is a projective line in the space of all conics on which we take as homogeneous coordinates geometrically we notice that any point q common to c and c is also on each of the conics of the linear system according to b zout s theorem c and c will intersect in four points if counted correctly assuming these are in general position i e four distinct intersections we get another interpretation of the linear system as the conics passing through the four given points note that the codimension four here matches the dimension one in the five dimensional space of conics note that of these conics exactly three are degenerate each consisting of a pair of lines corresponding to the formula 3 ways

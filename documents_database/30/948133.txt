with the goal of establishing transims as an ongoing public resource available to the transportation community transims is made available under the nasa open source agreement version 1 3 transims is an integrated set of tools to conduct regional transportation system analyses based on a cellular automata microsimulator it uses a new paradigm of modeling individual travelers and their multi modal transportation based on synthetic populations and their activities compared to other transportation aggregate models transims represents time consistently and continuously as well as detailed persons and households its time dependent routing and person based microsimulator also differ from other aggregate models the goal of the methodology is to load traffic onto the network and iterate towards the nash equilibrium submodules include population synthesizer activity generator route planner and microsimulator feedback from modules will be next input as the equilibration process iterates travelers are modeled to achieve a shorter path that is best for the overall population instead of a significantly better route one important constraint is that travelers choose a transportation mode according to travel surveys rather than to optimize their travel needs transims creates a road network a transit network as well as transit schedules in this step

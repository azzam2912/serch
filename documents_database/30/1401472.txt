it is of interest in the study of apicomplexan parasites specifically their evolution and accordingly their unique vulnerabilities to drugs the discovery of c velia has sparked renewed interest in protist research concerning both algae and parasites as well as free living unicells strict separation of botanical protists algae and zoological protists protozoa has been conventional but c velia may be regarded as a good example of a bridge linking both categories c velia has typical features of alveolates being phylogenetically related to apicomplexa a subgroup of alveolates and contains a photosynthetic plastid chloroplast while the apicomplexans have a non photosynthetic plastid called the apicoplast c velia is also related to another subgroup of alveolates the dinoflagellates of which most are photosynthetic c velia uses metabolites reduced carbon from its plastid as its primary energy source the same is true of the algal cousin of c velia another chromerid vitrella brassicaformis together these are phylogenetically the closest known autotrophic organisms to apicomplexans parasites in the apicomplexan genus plasmodium are the causative agents of malaria studies of c velia and v brassicaformis are broadly useful for understanding the biochemistry physiology and evolution of the malaria parasite other apicomplexan parasites and dinoflagellates

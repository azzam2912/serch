a major technology of regenerative medicine is tissue engineering which has variously been defined as an interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and the life sciences toward the development of biological substitutes that restore maintain or improve tissue function or the creation of new tissue by the deliberate and controlled stimulation of selected target cells through a systematic combination of molecular and mechanical signals tissue engineering emerged during the 1990s as a potentially powerful option for regenerating tissue and research initiatives were established in various cities in the usa and in european countries including the uk italy germany and switzerland and also in japan soon fledgling societies were formed in these countries in order to represent these new sciences notably the european tissue engineering society etes and in the usa the tissue engineering society tes soon to become the tissue engineering society international tesi and the regenerative medicine society rms because of the overlap between the activities of these societies and the increasing globalization of science and medicine considerations of a merger between tesi and etes and rms were initiated in 2004 and agreement was reached during 2005 about the formation of the consolidated society the tissue engineering

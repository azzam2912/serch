it is considered an enhanced oil recovery eor method and is the main type of thermal stimulation of oil reservoirs there are several different forms of the technology with the two main ones being cyclic steam stimulation and steam flooding both are most commonly applied to oil reservoirs which are relatively shallow and which contain crude oils which are very viscous at the temperature of the native underground formation steam injection is widely used in the san joaquin valley of california usa the lake maracaibo area of venezuela and the oil sands of northern alberta canada another contributing factor that enhances oil production during steam injection is related to near wellbore cleanup in this case steam reduces the viscosity that ties paraffins and asphaltenes to the rock surfaces while steam distillation of crude oil light ends creates a small solvent bank that can miscibly remove trapped oil this method also known as the huff and puff method consists of 3 stages injection soaking and production steam is first injected into a well for a certain amount of time to heat the oil in the surrounding reservoir to a recover approximately 20 of the original oil in place ooip compared to

part of the volcanic system of the east african rift it uniquely produces natrocarbonatite lava the 1960 eruption of ol doinyo lengai led to geological investigations that finally confirmed the view that carbonatite rock is derived from magma ol doinyo lengai is unique among active volcanoes in that it produces natrocarbonatite lava a unique occurrence of volcanic carbonatite a few older extinct carbonatite volcanoes are located nearby including homa mountain whereas most lavas are rich in silicate minerals the lava of ol doinyo lengai is a carbonatite it is rich in the rare sodium and potassium carbonates nyerereite and gregoryite due to this unusual composition the lava erupts at relatively low temperatures of approximately this temperature is so low that the molten lava appears black in sunlight rather than having the red glow common to most lavas it is also much more fluid than silicate lavas often less viscous than water the sodium and potassium carbonate minerals of the lavas erupted at ol doinyo lengai are unstable at the earth s surface and susceptible to rapid weathering quickly turning from black to grey in colour the resulting volcanic landscape is different from any other in the world the carbonatite ash

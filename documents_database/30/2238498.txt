the name stems from the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the distribution of galaxies the baryon wiggles the survey measured the redshift of 240 000 galaxies in the southern sky redshift is the increase in the wavelength of light emitted by a galaxy caused by its speed of motion away from an observer on earth enabling the distance of the galaxy from earth to be computed according to hubble s law the redshifts were measured using the aaomega spectrograph which can simultaneously analyse 392 galaxy spectra using optical fibres controlled by a robot positioner providing a superior mapping speed suitable targets were primarily selected by the orbiting galex satellite and to complete the survey required some 160 clear nights of telescope time the data enabled a three dimensional computer model of the galaxies to be calculated the large number of observations makes it possible to study variations in the distribution of the galaxies caused by such features as baryon acoustic oscillations the work was carried out by a core team of 14 australia based astronomers led by chris blake and including sarah brough warrick couch karl glazebrook greg poole tamara davis michael drinkwater russell jurek kevin pimbblet matthew colless

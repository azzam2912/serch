given a set s of polynomials in r a cylindrical algebraic decomposition is a decomposition of r into connected semialgebraic sets called cells on which each polynomial has constant sign either or 0 to be cylindrical this decomposition must satisfy the following condition if 1 k george e collins in 1975 together with an algorithm for computing it collins algorithm has a computational complexity that is double exponential in n this is an upper bound which is reached on most entries there are also examples for which the minimal number of cells is doubly exponential showing that every general algorithm for cylindrical algebraic decomposition has a double exponential complexity cad provides an effective version of quantifier elimination over the reals which has a much better computational complexity than that which results from the original proof of tarski seidenberg theorem it is efficient enough to be implemented on a computer it is one of the most important algorithms of computational real algebraic geometry searching to improve collins algorithm or to provide algorithms that have a better complexity for subproblems of general interest is an active field of research

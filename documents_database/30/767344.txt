this theory is the culmination of the life work of zellig harris with major publications toward the end of the last century operator grammar proposes that each human language is a self organizing system in which both the syntactic and semantic properties of a word are established purely in relation to other words thus no external system metalanguage is required to define the rules of a language instead these rules are learned through exposure to usage and through participation as is the case with most social behavior the theory is consistent with the idea that language evolved gradually with each successive generation introducing new complexity and variation operator grammar posits three universal constraints dependency certain words depend on the presence of other words to form an utterance likelihood some combinations of words and their dependents are more likely than others and reduction words in high likelihood combinations can be reduced to shorter forms and sometimes omitted completely together these provide a theory of language information dependency builds a predicate argument structure likelihood creates distinct meanings reduction allows compact forms for communication the fundamental mechanism of operator grammar is the dependency constraint certain words operators require that one or more words

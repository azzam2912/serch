one of the earliest reports of depletion forces that lead to particle coagulation is that of bondy who observed the separation or creaming of rubber latex upon addition of polymer depletant molecules sodium alginate to solution more generally depletants can include polymers micelles osmolytes ink mud or paint dispersed in a continuous phase depletion forces are often regarded as entropic forces as was first explained by the established asakura oosawa model in this theory the depletion force arises from an increase in osmotic pressure of the surrounding solution when colloidal particles get close enough such that the excluded cosolutes depletants cannot fit in between them because the particles were considered as hard core completely rigid particles the emerging picture of the underlying mechanism inducing the force was necessarily entropic the system of colloids and depletants in solution is typically modeled by treating the large colloids and small depletants as dissimilarly sized hard spheres hard spheres are characterized as non interacting and impenetrable spheres these two fundamental properties of hard spheres are described mathematically by the hard sphere potential the hard sphere potential imposes steric constraint around large spheres which in turn gives rise to excluded volume that is volume that

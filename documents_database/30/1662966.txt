it is a fine example of a precision sundial telling local apparent time with a scale to convert this to local mean time and is accurate to the nearest minute the sundial is now housed in the derby museum and art gallery the whitehurst family was known in derby as eminent mechanics john whitehurst 1713 1788 was born in congleton but came to derby where he entered business as a watch and clock maker he moved to london when appointed to the post of inspector of weights his nephew continued the business under the name of whitehurst son the family business was known for their turret clocks sundial construction is based on understanding the geometry of the solar system and particularly how the sun will cast a shadow onto a flat surface in this case a horizontal surface each day over a yearly cycle the shadow will be different from the day before and the shadow is specific to the location of the dial particularly its latitude the dial is designed to tell local apparent time so the longitude is not significant by this we mean that noon will be at the point when the sun is highest in sky

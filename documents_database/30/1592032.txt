the most common example is managing a host in a dmz from trusted networks or computers a jump server is a hardened and monitored device that spans two dissimilar security zones and provides a controlled means of access between them user access should be tightly controlled and monitored in the 1990s when co location facilities became more common there was a need to provide access between dissimilar security zones the jump server concept emerged to meet this need the jump server would span the two networks and typically be used in conjunction with a proxy service such as socks to provide access from an administrative desktop to the managed device as ssh tunneling became common jump servers became the de facto method of access jump servers are typically placed between a secure zone and a dmz to provide transparent management of devices on the dmz once a management session has been established the jump server acts as a single audit point for traffic and also a single place where user accounts can be managed a prospective administrator must log into the jump server in order to gain access to the dmz assets and all access can be logged for later

it is named after astrophysicists jonathan homer lane and robert emden the equation reads where formula 2 is a dimensionless radius and formula 3 is related to the density and thus the pressure by formula 4 for central density formula 5 the index formula 6 is the polytropic index that appears in the polytropic equation of state where formula 8 and formula 9 are the pressure and density respectively and formula 10 is a constant of proportionality the standard boundary conditions are formula 11 and formula 12 solutions thus describe the run of pressure and density with radius and are known as polytropes of index formula 6 if an isothermal fluid polytropic index tends to infinity is used instead of a polytropic fluid one obtains the emden chandrasekhar equation physically hydrostatic equilibrium connects the gradient of the potential the density and the gradient of the pressure whereas poisson s equation connects the potential with the density thus if we have a further equation that dictates how the pressure and density vary with respect to one another we can reach a solution the particular choice of a polytropic gas as given above makes the mathematical statement of the problem particularly succinct

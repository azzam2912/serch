it operated at the boulby underground laboratory north east england uk in the period 2006 2011 this was the last in a series of xenon based experiments in the zeplin programme pursued originally by the uk dark matter collaboration ukdmc the zeplin iii project was led by imperial college london and also included the rutherford appleton laboratory and the university of edinburgh in the uk as well as lip coimbra in portugal and itep moscow in russia it ruled out cross sections for elastic scattering of wimps off nucleons above 3 9 10 pb 3 9 10 cm from the two science runs conducted at boulby 83 days in 2008 and 319 days in 2010 11 direct dark matter search experiments look for extremely rare and very weak collisions expected to occur between the cold dark matter particles that are believed to permeate our galaxy and the nuclei of atoms in the active medium of a radiation detector these hypothetical elementary particles could be weakly interacting massive particles or wimps weighing as little as a few protons or as much as several heavy nuclei their nature is not yet known but no sensible candidates remain within the standard model of

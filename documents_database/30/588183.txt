the modules on the ic are typically semiconductor ip cores schematizing various functions of the computer system and are designed to be modular in the sense of network science the network on chip is a router based packet switching network between soc modules noc technology applies the theory and methods of computer networking to on chip communication and brings notable improvements over conventional bus and crossbar communication architectures networks on chip come in many network topologies many of which are still experimental as of 2018 networks on chip improve the scalability of systems on chip and the power efficiency of complex socs compared to other communication subsystem designs a very common noc used in contemporary personal computers is a graphics processing unit gpu which is commonly used in computer graphics video gaming and accelerating artificial intelligence they are an emerging technology with projections for large growth in the near future as manycore computer architectures become more common networks on chip can span synchronous and asynchronous clock domains known as clock domain crossing or use unclocked asynchronous logic nocs support globally asynchronous locally synchronous electronics architectures allowing each processor core or functional unit on the system on chip to have its

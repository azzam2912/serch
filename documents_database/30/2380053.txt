in the 1970s following post doctoral work at the stanford linear accelerator center slac in palo alto california he involved himself on high energy physics projects at cern in geneva switzerland where he worked initially as a member of the intersecting storage rings group in 1977 joined the team led by carlo rubbia and played an important role in the 1981 discovery of the w and z bosons della nigra and his colleague from imperial college london tejinder singh virdee were among the first to envisage a hermetic detector for the large hadron collider lhc based on a strong magnetic field the compact muon solenoid cms and was spokesman for the cms from 1992 until 2006 together with evidence from the a toroidal lhc apparatus atlas the cms experiments were crucial to the discovery of the higgs boson in 2012 as of 2018 he is physicist emeritus of the physics department of cern and cms emeritus at imperial college london della negra shared the 2013 special breakthrough prize in fundamental physics for the discovery of the higgs boson with his pioneering colleagues fabiola gianotti and peter jenni from atlas and tejinder singh virdee guido tonelli joe incandela and lyn evans

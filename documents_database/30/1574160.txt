it was described as type v referring to the secchi class for stars with emission lines it was formally named hd 5980 in the first henry draper catalogue where it was given the spectral type of oa indicating strong emission bands the spectral type was later refined to wa when the emission line o stars were recognised as a separate class later observations detected spectral and brightness variations and eclipses but it was thought to be a simple wr ob binary absorption lines in the spectrum that did not move during the binary orbit eventually led to the conclusion that hd 5980 was a triple system with a close eclipsing binary and a more distant class o supergiant in 1993 the spectrum began to change and the brightness increased beginning a dramatic change that has been interpreted as a unique type of lbv eruption since then the star has been intensively observed and modelled hd 5980 is visually a single star but the spectrum reveals three hot luminous components the physical parameters of the three stars are uncertain because of the difficulties of resolving their spectra the partial eclipses apparent intrinsic variations with the orbital phase and the strong variability

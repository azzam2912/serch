it derives from selective breeding the basuto pony with the addition of some arab and part arab blood the nooitgedachter is a rare breed with only about 400 purebreds in existence development of this breed began in 1951 when the south african department of agriculture bought a nucleus group of basuto type ponies in 1952 a breeding project began on the nooitgedacht research station this was done primarily to save the famous basuto from extinction but also because south africa needed an indigenous farm and riding horse adapted to conditions of the region due to large scale inbreeding in the past the breeders at nooitgedacht had to use extreme care for this reason a boer stallion and a partbred arab were used to a limited extent in addition to vonk a stallion selected from a departmental committee to be the founder of the breed the progeny of vonk dominated the breeding project to such an extent that nearly every member of the nooitgedacht breed today is a descendant of vonk through the sire dam or both the foaling percentage was very high ranging at 90 percent so strict was the selection that only one in four ponies were kept systematic

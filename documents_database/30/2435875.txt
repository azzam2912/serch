it is visible to the naked eye as a dim blue white hued point of light with a baseline apparent visual magnitude of 5 23 the system is drifting closer to the earth with a mean heliocentric radial velocity of 12 5 it is a probable member of the i lacertae ob association lac ob1 the primary component is a beta cephei variable with a stellar classification of b1 5iii matching a b type star with the luminosity class of a giant star it has been known to be variable for more than a century and has been extensively studied the variable radial velocity of the star was discovered by w s adams in 1912 and the light variations were established by 1919 the pulsational nature of the variability was shown by p ledoux in 1951 which led to one of the first world wide observing campaigns with the star as its target dutch mathematician f j m barning analyzed the resulting data in 1963 and found four separate cycles of variation by 1994 six periods had been confirmed the variable star designation of the primary is dd lacertae while 12 lacertae is the flamsteed designation in general terms it

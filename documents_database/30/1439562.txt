this phenomenon came to light with the advent of technologies such as ms2 tagging and single molecule rna fluorescence in situ hybridisation to detect rna production in single cells through precise measurements of rna number or rna appearance at the gene other more widespread techniques such as northern blotting microarrays rt pcr and rna seq measure bulk rna levels from homogenous population extracts these techniques lose dynamic information from individual cells and give the impression that transcription is a continuous smooth process observed at an individual cell level transcription is irregular with strong periods of activity interspersed by long periods of inactivity bursting may result from the stochastic nature of biochemical events superimposed upon a two step fluctuation in its most simple form the gene is proposed to exist in two states one where activity is negligible and one where there is a certain probability of activation only in the second state does transcription readily occur it seems likely that some rudimentary eukaryotes have genes which do not show bursting the genes are always in the permissive state with a simple probability describing the numbers of rnas generated more recent data indicate the two state model can be an oversimplification

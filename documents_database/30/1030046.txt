a workflow model allows to define the set of executables and scripts written in any scripting language along with their dependencies so proactive parallel suite can schedule and orchestrate executions while optimising the use of computational resources under the hood proactive parallel suite relies on an active object based java framework to optimise task distribution and ensure fault tolerance the model was created by denis caromel professor at university of nice sophia antipolis several extensions of the model were made later on by members of the oasis team at inria the book a theory of distributed objects presents the asp calculus that formalizes proactive features and provides formal semantics to the calculus together with properties of proactive program execution active objects are the basic units of activity and distribution used for building concurrent applications using proactive an active object runs with its own thread this thread only executes the methods invoked on this active object by other active objects and those of the passive objects of the subsystem that belongs to this active object with proactive the programmer does not have to explicitly manipulate thread objects unlike in standard java active objects can be created on any of the hosts

parsons october 11 1913april 18 2007 pioneered numerical control nc for machine tools in the 1940s these developments were done in collaboration with his chief engineer and vice president of engineering frank l stulen who parsons hired when he was head of the rotary wing branch of the propeller lab at wright patterson air force base in april 1946 together they were the first to use computer methods to solve machining problems in particular the accurate interpolation of the curves describing helicopter rotor blades in 1946 computer still meant a punched card operated calculation machine in 1948 parsons company parsons corporation of traverse city michigan was awarded a contract to make the challenging tapered wings for military aircraft they won the contract because they developed the computer support to do the difficult three dimensional interpolation for the complex shapes as well as the 800 steps long production cycle for the wing manufacturing ibm was one of the subcontractors as was mit which took care of the servomechanisms the latter lab boosted the developments of numerical control machining in the following decades by developing reliable servo control in 1952 and the apt automatic programmed tool programming language for nc machines it

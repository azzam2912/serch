while interactions with virgo s intracluster medium that is stripping ngc 4654 of its gas as the galaxy moves through it can explain its gas distribution its unable to explain the peculiarities on the distribution of its stars having been proposed that ngc 4654 interacted with its neighbor the spiral galaxy ngc 4639 about 500 million years ago producing this event the latter phenomenon while experimenting until the present day weak ram pressure stripping due to its motion within the virgo cluster despite suffering a loss of its neutral gas ngc 4654 does not suffer the deficiency of it that show many spiral galaxies of the virgo cluster and also has the star formation typical for a galaxy of its type

dr3 is a component gene allele of the ah8 1 haplotype in northern and western europeans genes between b8 and dr3 on this haplotype are frequently associated with autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with hla dr3 or hla dr4 some dr3 also react with hla dr17 and or hla dr18 the drb1 0304 primarily reacts with dr3 the serotypes of 0305 0306 0308 to 0331 are unknown hla dr3 is associated with early age onset myasthenia gravis hashimoto s thyroiditis along with dr5 primary sclerosing cholangitis and opportunistic infections in aids but lowered risk for cancers it is also associated with membranous glomerularnephritis drb1 0301 see hla dr17 drb1 0302 see hla dr18 drb1 0304 is associated with graves disease dr3 and or dq2 is associated with moreen s ulceration bout onset multiple sclerosis grave s disease and systemic lupus erythematosus dr3 dq2 linkage is associated with coeliac disease dermatitis herpetiformis diabetes mellitus type 1 dr3 dr2 is the serological marker for hla dq2 5cis isoform although it cannot identify the alpha 5 chain of hla dq dqa1 0501 gene is almost always found within the dr3 dq2 haplotype eurasia however in older studies dqa1 0505

the interest in organoscandium compounds is mostly academic but several compound classes find practical application in catalysis especially in polymerization a common precursor is scandium chloride as with the other elements in group 3 e g yttrium forming organoyttrium compounds and the lanthanides the dominant oxidation state for scandium in organometallic compounds is 3 electron configuration ar 3d4s the members of this group also have large ionic radii with vacant s p and d orbitals 88 pm for sc compared to 67 pm for al and as a result they behave as hard lewis acids and tend to have high coordination numbers of 9 to 12 the metal to ligand chemical bond is largely ionic most organoscandium compounds have at least one cyclopentadienyl cp ligand the dominant species are cpscx cpscx and cpsc the mononuclear compounds are of limited utility because of poor steric shielding which makes them prone to nucleophilic addition and solvent attack cpsccl can be synthesised from sodium cyclopentadienide chlorine can be replaced by a host of other ligands for example by an allyl group in reaction with allylmagnesium bromide cpscx compounds are dimers with x forming a bridging ligand dimerization is avoided in presence of coordinating

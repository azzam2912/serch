chromatography is able to separate substances based on differential adsorption of compounds to the adsorbent compounds move through the column at different rates allowing them to be separated into fractions the technique is widely applicable as many different adsorbents normal phase reversed phase or otherwise can be used with a wide range of solvents the technique can be used on scales from micrograms up to kilograms the main advantage of column chromatography is the relatively low cost and disposability of the stationary phase used in the process the latter prevents cross contamination and stationary phase degradation due to recycling column chromatography can be done using gravity to move the solvent or using compressed gas to push the solvent through the column a thin layer chromatograph can show how a mixture of compounds will behave when purified by column chromatography the separation is first optimised using thin layer chromatography before performing column chromatography a column is prepared by packing a solid absorbent into a cylindrical glass or plastic tube the size will depend on the amount of compound being isolated the base of the tube contains a filter either a cotton or glass wool plug or glass frit to hold the

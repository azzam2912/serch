there are various types of automatic lubricator which include various designs of displacement hydrostatic and mechanical lubricators the displacement lubricator was introduced in the united kingdom in 1860 by john ramsbottom it operates by allowing steam to enter a closed vessel containing oil after condensing the water sinks to the bottom of the vessel causing the oil to rise and overflow into delivery pipes the oil from the delivery pipes is introduced into the steam pipe where it is atomised and carried to the valves and cylinders in early applications in steam locomotives either two displacement lubricators one for each cylinder would be positioned at the front of the boiler near the valves often on either side of the smokebox or one lubricator would be placed behind the smokebox the behind smokebox configuration has the advantage that a good connection can be made to the steam pipe and was used by the great western railway it has the disadvantage that the lubricator s accessibility is reduced and additional drain pipes are required to be connected to the waste to avoid it dripping onto the boiler later types of lubricator from around 1887 referred to as the sight feed type allowed

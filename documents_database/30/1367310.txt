it is also known as familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcemia fbhh where there is usually a family history of hypercalcemia which is mild a urine calcium to creatinine ratio calcium sensing receptor casr gene expressed in parathyroid and kidney tissue these mutations decrease the receptor s sensitivity to calcium resulting in reduced receptor stimulation at normal serum calcium levels as a result inhibition of parathyroid hormone release does not occur until higher serum calcium levels are attained creating a new equilibrium this is the opposite of what happens with the casr sensitizer cinacalcet functionally parathyroid hormone pth increases calcium resorption from the bone and increases phosphate excretion from the kidney which increases serum calcium and decreases serum phosphate individuals with fhh however typically have normal pth levels as normal calcium homeostasis is maintained albeit at a higher equilibrium set point as a consequence these individuals are not at increased risk of the complications of hyperparathyroidism another form has been associated with chromosome 3q as most cases of fhh are asymptomatic and benign the diagnosis of fhh is less likely to be made typically diagnosis is made in the pursuit of uncovering the etiology of hypercalcemia calcium levels are often in the

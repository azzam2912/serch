plants serve as natural hosts there are currently 37 species in this family divided among 3 genera the largest of three genera is tymovirus with 27 species whereas the other genera marafivirus and maculavirus have 7 and 1 species respectively group ssrna the virions are non enveloped and isometric with a diameter of around 30 nm with an icosahedral structure and a triangulation number t 3 the linear genome is between of 6 7 5 kilobases in length and encodes one large open reading frame it is capped at the 5 terminus the 3 terminus may have a trna like structure or a polya tract depending upon the species the genome is relatively cytosine rich viral replication is cytoplasmic and is lysogenic entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell replication follows the positive stranded rna virus replication model positive stranded rna virus transcription is the method of transcription translation takes place by leaky scanning the virus exits the host cell by monopartite non tubule guided viral movement plants serve as the natural host the virus is transmitted via a vector insects transmission routes are vector and mechanical

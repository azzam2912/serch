found in vertebrates this 50 kda protein is being researched as a therapeutic candidate for treatment of such conditions as choroidal neovascularization heart disease and cancer in humans pigment epithelium derived factor is encoded by the serpinf1 gene pigment epithelium derived factor pedf was originally discovered by joyce tombran tink and lincoln johnson in the late 1980s this group was studying human retinal cell development by identifying secreted factors produced by the retinal pigmented epithelium rpe a layer of cells that supports the retina upon noticing rpe produced a factor that promoted the differentiation of primitive retinal cells into cells of a neuronal phenotype they set out to determine the identity of the factor they isolated proteins unique to rpe cells and tested the individual proteins for neurotrophic function meaning promoting a neuronal phenotype a neurotrophic protein around 50 kilodaltons kda was identified and temporarily named rpe 54 before being officially termed pigment epithelium derived factor soon thereafter the same laboratory sequenced the pedf protein and compared it to a human fetal eye library they found that pedf was a previously uncharacterized protein and a member of the serpin serine protease inhibitor family the gene encoding human pedf was localized

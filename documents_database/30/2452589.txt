it was discovered by william herschel on december 25 1835 at a distance of 60 milion light years it is one of the closer members of fornax cluster it is a member of fornax cluster and it is located about 24 from central galaxy ngc 1399 as twice as ngc 1387 the galaxy next to the ngc 1379 ngc 1387 is also the closest galaxy to this and it is in foreground from ngc 1379 ngc 1379 has a hubble classification of e0 which indicates it is no flattened galaxy it is also an early type galaxy like most other elliptical galaxies in the fornax cluster it size on night sky is 2 6 x 2 5 which is combined with the estimated distance proportional to real size of 50 000 light years despite their name early type galaxies are much older than spiral galaxies and mostly comprise old red colored stars very little star formation occurs in these galaxies the lack of star formation in elliptical galaxies appears to start at the center and then slowly propagates outward it is rich with globular cluster with an estimated number of cluster of 406 81 there are blue and red globular

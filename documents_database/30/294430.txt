it was commonly accepted that so long as a ship flew its ensign it was an active participant in battle prior to action it was an acceptable ruse to fly a false flag if a ship surrendered then it would take down its ensign which was known as striking the colors this is also the origin of the phrase to nail one s colours to the mast showing a determination to fight on and never surrender in practice warships would fly more than one battle ensign so that if the flag was destroyed or brought down during the fighting there would be no confusion conversely keeping the flag flying even though the ship might appear to be past fighting was a sign of determination rather than foolishness the german battleship bismarck continued to fly its battle ensign even after all its gun batteries had been silenced by british shells and sank with the ensign still flying the battle ensign was seen as an important element for the morale of the crew and was held in high regard if a warship was sinking and had to be abandoned flags such as the battle ensigns would be taken off the ship before

its length measures 8 3 mm the two small whorls of the protoconch are depressed and helicoid they have their axis at right angles to that of the succeeding turns in the first of which they are about one third immersed the 14 whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded slightly overhanging and ornamented by well developed somewhat sinuous rounded protractive axial ribs of which there are about 14 upon the third 16 upon the fourth and fifth 18 upon the sixth to eighth 20 upon the ninth to eleventh and 22 upon the twelfth and penultimate turns the intercostal spaces are almost equal to the ribs in width shallow terminating some little distance posterior to the summit of the succeeding whorl thus leaving a rather broad plain band above the suture in each turn the sutures are strongly constricted the periphery of the body whorl is well rounded the base of the shell is short and well rounded the entire surface of the spire and the base is marked by very fine closely spaced spiral striations the aperture is subquadrate the posterior angle is obtuse the outer lip is thin showing the external sculpture within the columella is slender

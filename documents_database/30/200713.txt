such a possibility was pointed out by the physicist lev landau and his colleagues the fact that couplings depend on the momentum or length scale is the central idea behind the renormalization group landau poles appear in theories that are not asymptotically free such as quantum electrodynamics qed or theory a scalar field with a quartic interaction such as may describe the higgs boson in these theories the renormalized coupling constant grows with energy a landau pole appears when the coupling becomes infinite at a finite energy scale in a theory purporting to be complete this could be considered a mathematical inconsistency a possible solution is that the renormalized charge could go to zero as the cut off is removed meaning that the charge is completely screened by quantum fluctuations vacuum polarization this is a case of quantum triviality which means that quantum corrections completely suppress the interactions in the absence of a cut off since the landau pole is normally identified through perturbative one loop or two loop calculations it is possible that the pole is merely a sign that the perturbative approximation breaks down at strong coupling perturbation theory may also be invalid if non adiabatic states exist

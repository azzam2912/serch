in 1970 yakov b zel dovich showed that for an ellipsoid of gas on a supergalactic scale an approximation can be used that will model the collapse as occurring most rapidly along the shortest axis resulting in a pancake form this approximation assumes that the ellipsoid of gas is sufficiently large that the effect of pressure is negligible and only gravitational attraction needs to be considered that is the gas will collapse without being significantly perturbed by outward pressure this assumption is especially valid if the collapse occurs before the recombination era that resulted in the formation of hydrogen atoms in 1989 zel dovich and s f shandarin showed that initial overlapping density fluctuations of random gaussian fields would result in dense pancakes filaments and compact clumps of matter this model became known as a top down model of galactic formation with the supergalactic condensation fragmenting into protogalaxies the formation of plane concentrations would compress the gas through shock waves generated during the collapse increasing the temperature at a higher level the collapse of larger structures according to the zel dovich approximation is known as second generation pancakes or superpancakes at still higher levels there is a transition to a

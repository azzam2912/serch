it can also form heterodimers with the related proteins cebp alpha cebp delta and cebp gamma the encoded protein is important in the regulation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses and has been shown to bind to the il 1 response element in the il 6 gene as well as to regulatory regions of several acute phase and cytokine genes in addition the encoded protein can bind the promoter and upstream element and stimulate the expression of the collagen type i gene cebp beta is critical for normal macrophage functioning an important immune cell sub type mice unable to express cebp beta have macrophages that cannot differentiate specialize and thus are unable to perform all their biological functions including macrophage mediated muscle repair observational work has shown that expression of cebp beta in blood leukocytes is positively associated with muscle strength in humans emphasizing the importance of the immune system and particularly macrophages in the maintenance of muscle function function of cebpb gene can be effectively examined by sirna knockdown based on an independent validation cebpb is capable of increasing the expression of several target genes among them some have specific role in the nervous system such as

it was pioneered by e j corey and d enders in 1976 and was further developed by d enders and his group this method is usually a three step sequence the first step is to form the hydrazone between s 1 amino 2 methoxymethylpyrrolidine samp or r 1 amino 2 methoxymethylpyrrolidine ramp and a ketone or aldehyde afterwards the hydrazone is deprotonated by lithium diisopropylamide lda to form an azaenolate which reacts with alkyl halides or other suitable electrophiles to give alkylated hydrazone species with the simultaneous generation of a new chiral center finally the alkylated ketone or aldehyde can be regenerated by ozonolysis or hydrolysis this reaction is a useful technique for asymmetric alkylation of ketones and aldehydes which are common synthetic intermediates for medicinally interesting natural products and other related organic compounds these natural products include c10 demethyl arteannuin b the structural analog of antimalarial artemisinin the polypropionate metabolite denticulatin a and b isolated from siphonaria denticulata zaragozic acid a a potent inhibitor of sterol synthesis and epothilone a and b which have been proven to be very effective anticancer drugs regioselective and stereoselective formation of carbon carbon bonds adjacent to carbonyl group is an important procedure in

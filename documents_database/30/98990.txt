that this is possible may seem counter intuitive as the common meanings of open and closed are antonyms but their mathematical definitions are not mutually exclusive a set is closed if its complement is open which leaves the possibility of an open set whose complement is also open making both sets both open and closed and therefore clopen in any topological space x the empty set and the whole space x are both clopen now consider the space x which consists of the union of the two open intervals 0 1 and 2 3 of r the topology on x is inherited as the subspace topology from the ordinary topology on the real line r in x the set 0 1 is clopen as is the set 2 3 this is a quite typical example whenever a space is made up of a finite number of disjoint connected components in this way the components will be clopen now let x be an infinite set under the discrete metricthat is two points p q in x have distance 1 if they re not the same point and 0 otherwise under the resulting metric space any singleton set is open hence any

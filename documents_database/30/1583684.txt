levi began his artistic career in the 1960s and early 70s producing highly abstract and very modernist pieces these employing exotic materials such as light fixtures and metallic parts by 1975 levi had transitioned to painting and drawing still lifes at first these were traditionally of mundane subjects later he would depict images from art history including figures originally created by the old masters around 1980 he made another important shift this time toward creating highly precise though subtly altered reproductions of pairs of female faces which were originally produced by other artists it is perhaps this work for which he is most well known since around 2000 josef levi has changed the style of his work yet again now he works entirely with computers using digital techniques to abstract greatly from art history and also from other sources two of the most important themes of josef levi s artwork are recognized to be the female form especially the face and the similarities in visual aesthetics which transcend cultures indeed since the date his first creations the vast majority of levi s material has been taken from female characters in the art of others and often multiple works are combined

it is integrated into a common platform together with the surgical tool navigator stn the surgical microscope navigator smn and the 6dof manipulator mkm developed by carl zeiss the ssn has been developed as a computer system for bone segment navigation in oral and maxillofacial surgery it allows a very precise repositioning of bone fragments with the advent of preoperative simulation and surgical planning the system has been developed since 1997 at the university of regensburg germany with the support of the carl zeiss company its principle is based on an infrared localisation system composed of an infrared camera and at least three infrared transmitters attached to each bony fragment the ssn is mainly used in orthognatic surgery surgical correction of dysgnathia but also for the surgical reconstruction of the orbit or other surgical interventions to the midface since 2001 at the university of heidelberg germany the ssn has been developed a markerless registration navigation system based on a native markerless ct or mri in this case the patient registration is obtained on the operating table using a surface scanner the ssn correlates the surface scan data gathered on the operating table with the skin surface reconstruction from the dataset

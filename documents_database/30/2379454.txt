as in the case of salen compound the actual ligand is usually the conjugate base salpn the divalent anion that result from the metal free compound by the loss of two hydroxyl protons this dianion is commonly denoted salpn in formulas of metal complexes the abbreviation salpn is also sometimes used for the structural isomer n n bis salicylidene 1 3 diaminopropane and its conjugate base the synthesis of salpn is achieved by a condensation reaction of 1 2 diaminopropane with salicylaldehyde salpn is used as a fuel additive as a metal deactivator in motor oils trace metals degrade the fuels by catalyzing oxidation processes that lead to gums and solids metal deactivators like salpn form stable coordination compounds with the metals suppressing their catalytic activity while salpn forms stable chelate complexes with many metals including copper iron chromium and nickel it is the coordination with copper that makes it a popular choice as a fuel additive copper has the highest catalytic activity in fuel and salpn forms a highly stable square planar complex with the metal salpn is preferred over salen possibly because it has higher solubility in non polar liquids

maui is capable of supporting multiple scheduling policies dynamic priorities reservations and fairshare capabilities it improves the manageability and efficiency of machines ranging from clusters of a few processors to multi teraflops supercomputers maui is available for use and modification for non commercial usage maui was most heavily developed during the mid 90s development slowed into the 2000s although an active community around the usage of maui still exists its development was made possible by the support of cluster resources inc now adaptive computing and the contributions of many individuals and sites including the u s department of energy pnnl the center for high performance computing at the university of utah chpc ohio supercomputer center osc university of southern california usc sdsc mhpcc byu ncsa and many others it may be downloaded modified and redistributed maui cluster scheduler is currently maintained and supported by adaptive computing inc although most new development has come to a standstill a next generation non open source scheduler is part of the moab cluster suite and borrows many of the same concepts found in maui maui s developers state that the licence satisfies some definitions of open source software and that it is not available

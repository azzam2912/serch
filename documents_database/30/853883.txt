he pioneered studies on global climate and calculated temperature of earth considering simple physical model of equilibrium in which the incoming solar radiation absorbed by the earth s system is balanced by the energy re radiated to space as thermal energy budyko s groundbreaking book heat balance of the earth s surface published in 1956 transformed climatology from a qualitative into a quantitative physical science these new physical methods based on heat balance were quickly adopted by climatologists around the world in 1963 budyko directed the compilation of an atlas illustrating the components of the earth s heat balance ethnically belarussian budyko earned his m sc in 1942 from the division of physics of the leningrad polytechnic institute as a researcher at the leningrad geophysical observatory he received his doctorate in physical and mathematical sciences in 1951 budyko served as deputy director of the geophysical observatory until 1954 as director until 1972 and as head of the division for physical climatology at the observatory from 1972 until 1975 in that year he was appointed director of the division for climate change research at the state hydrological institute in st petersburg he was the first researcher to discuss the pleistocene megafauna

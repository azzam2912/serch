it is a belt of multi deformed metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks intruded by a series of diorite to granite plutons forming the western part of the wopmay orogenic system the 1 9 ga billion years ago hottah terrane is separated from the archean rocks of the orogen by the north trending wopmay fault zone and overprinted by the 1 875 1 85 ga great bear magmatism the hottah terrane is a proposed microcontinent which collided with the archean slave craton at ca 1 88 ga after which the westward subduction of an ancient ocean in front of the slave craton ceased and the great bear magmatic zone formed this view was however challenged by in their model the hottah terrane was detached from the slave craton south of its present location in modern coordinates and made a northward voyage along an active margin similar to that of baja california peninsula and its chain of volcanoes the hottah terrane according to their dating evidence share the same tectonic history as several domains south and east of it domains that were tied to the slave craton ca 1 97 ga the active margin in which the hottah terrane was born began at

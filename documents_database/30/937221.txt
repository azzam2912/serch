this beneficial property has been described as follows despite its simplicity the trimean is a remarkably efficient estimator of population mean more precisely for a large data set over 100 points from a symmetric population the average of the 20th 50th and 80th percentile is the most efficient 3 point l estimator with 88 efficiency for context the best 1 point estimate by l estimators is the median with an efficiency of 64 or better for all n while using 2 points for a large data set of over 100 points from a symmetric population the most efficient estimate is the 29 midsummary mean of 29th and 71st percentiles which has an efficiency of about 81 using quartiles these optimal estimators can be approximated by the midhinge and the trimean using further points yield higher efficiency though it is notable that only 3 points are needed for very high efficiency

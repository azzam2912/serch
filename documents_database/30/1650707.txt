the human eyes move rapidly and repeatedly focusing on a single point for only a short period of time before moving to the next point these rapid eye movements are called saccades if a video camera were to perform such high speed changes in focal points the image on screen would be a blurry nauseating mess despite this rapidly changing input to the visual system the normal experience is of a stable visual world an example of perceptual constancy transsaccadic memory is a system that contributes to this stability transsaccadic memory is a relatively new topic of interest in the field of psychology conflicting views and theories have spurred several types of experiments intended to explain transsaccadic memory and the neural mechanisms involved mcconkie s and currie s saccade target theory is similar to research by schneider who came up with a similar reference object theory both theories hypothesize that each saccade is preceded by processes in the visual system that chose an object as the target for the next fixation point the object is usually located in peripheral vision the object s features are stored as a mental representation in transsaccadic memory for identification of future fixations these target

in humans transaldolase is encoded by the taldo1 gene the following chemical reaction is catalyzed by transaldolase the pentose phosphate pathway has two metabolic functions 1 generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced nadph for reductive biosynthesis and 2 formation of ribose which is an essential component of atp dna and rna transaldolase links the pentose phosphate pathway to glycolysis in patients with deficiency of transaldolase there s an accumulation of erythritol from erythrose 4 phosphate d arabitol and ribitol the deletion in 3 base pairs in the taldo1 gene results in the absence of serine at position 171 of the transaldolase protein which is part of a highly conserved region suggesting that the mutation causes the transaldolase deficiency that is found in erythrocytes and lymphoblasts the deletion of this amino acid can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatosplenomegaly enlarged spleen and liver during early infancy transaldolase is also a target of autoimmunity in patients with multiple sclerosis transaldolase is a single domain composed of 337 amino acids the core structure is an barrel similar to other class i aldolases made up of eight parallel sheets and seven helices there are also seven additional helices that are not part of

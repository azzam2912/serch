it is mostly made of molecular hydrogen and helium in roughly solar proportions other chemical compounds are present only in small amounts and include methane ammonia hydrogen sulfide and water although water is thought to reside deep in the atmosphere its directly measured concentration is very low the nitrogen sulfur and noble gas abundances in jupiter s atmosphere exceed solar values by a factor of about three the atmosphere of jupiter lacks a clear lower boundary and gradually transitions into the liquid interior of the planet from lowest to highest the atmospheric layers are the troposphere stratosphere thermosphere and exosphere each layer has characteristic temperature gradients the lowest layer the troposphere has a complicated system of clouds and hazes comprising layers of ammonia ammonium hydrosulfide and water the upper ammonia clouds visible at jupiter s surface are organized in a dozen zonal bands parallel to the equator and are bounded by powerful zonal atmospheric flows winds known as jets the bands alternate in color the dark bands are called belts while light ones are called zones zones which are colder than belts correspond to upwellings while belts mark descending gas the zones lighter color is believed to result from ammonia

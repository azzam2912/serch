the species may be the most common trematode endemic to the united states the life cycle of the n salmincola requires three hosts the first intermediate host is an juga plicifera stream snail the second intermediate host is a salmonid fish though some non salmonid fishes also play a role lastly the definitive host is most commonly a canid though many other mammals are also definitive hosts including humans transmission of n salmincola to the definitive host occurs upon ingestion of parasite infected fish the parasite is most known for its association with salmon poisoning disease which left untreated is fatal to dogs and other canids however canids are affected by the neorickettsia helminthoeca bacteria for which n salmincola acts as a vector and not by the parasite itself very few known cases of naturally acquired human infection with n salmincola are found in the literature though it is likely that many cases are unreported since most people are asymptomatic or symptomatic with non specific symptoms like gastrointestinal discomfort disease caused by n salmincola or nanophyetiasis is easily preventable by thoroughly cooking fish before consumption there are no known cases of human infection by the rickettsia bacteria carried by n

the mouse analogue is called rit1 or bcl11b and is located on mouse chormosome 12 this gene encodes a c2h2 type zinc finger protein and is closely related to bcl11a a gene whose translocation may be associated with b cell malignancies the specific function of this gene has not yet been determined but it could also be involved in some malignancies two alternatively spliced transcript variants which encode distinct isoforms have been reported recent research suggests that bcl11b is crucial for ameloblasts the cells that produce tooth enamel to form and work properly bcl11b has been shown to interact with coup tfi bcl11b is closely connected with immune regulation and for so its mutation can lead to a scid phenotype this so called immunodeficiency 49 omim 617237 is classified as t b nk scid it is characterised by a lack of t lymphocytes and its malfunctioning specifically in proliferative response on the other hand b cells and nk cells counts and functions are not impaired the symptoms of scid caused by bcl11b mutation apart from immunity defects typically include teeth abnormalities craniofacial dimorphism different types of dermatitis as well the intellectual development is significantly impaired the disease has a very

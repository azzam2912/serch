fossils have been recovered in mongolia with more fragmentary remains found further afield in parts of china although many species have been named modern paleontologists recognize only one t bataar as valid some experts see this species as an asian representative of the north american genus tyrannosaurus this would make the genus tarbosaurus redundant tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus if not synonymous are considered to be at least closely related genera alioramus also from mongolia has previously been thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of tarbosaurus though this has since been disproven with the discovery of qianzhousaurus and the description of the alioramini like most known tyrannosaurids tarbosaurus was a large bipedal predator weighing up to five tonnes and equipped with about sixty large teeth it had a unique locking mechanism in its lower jaw and the smallest forelimbs relative to body size of all tyrannosaurids renowned for their disproportionately tiny two fingered forelimbs tarbosaurus lived in a humid floodplain criss crossed by river channels in this environment it was an apex predator probably preying on other large dinosaurs like the hadrosaur saurolophus or the sauropod nemegtosaurus tarbosaurus is represented by dozens of fossil specimens including several complete skulls

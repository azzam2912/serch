smoke point values can vary greatly depending on factors such as the volume of oil utilized the size of the container the presence of air currents the type and source of light as well as the quality of the oil and its acidity content otherwise known as free fatty acid ffa content the more ffa an oil contains the quicker it will break down and start smoking the higher in quality and the lower in ffa the higher the smoke point it is important to consider however that the ffa only represents typically less than 1 of the total oil and consequently renders smoke point a poor indicator of the capacity of a fat or oil to withstand heat the smoke point of an oil correlates with its level of refinement many cooking oils have smoke points above standard home cooking temperatures smoke point decreases at different pace in different oils considerably above the temperature of the smoke point is the flash point the point at which the vapours from the oil can ignite in air given an ignition source the following table presents smoke points of various fats and oils hydrolysis and oxidation are the two primary degradation processes

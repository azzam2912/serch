l1 comprise approximately 17 of the human genome the majority of l1 in the human genome are inactive however some retained the ability to retrotranspose human l1 has been reported to have transferred to the genome of the gonorrhea bacteria a typical l1 element is approximately 6 000 base pairs long and consists of two non overlapping open reading frames orf which are flanked by utr and target site duplications in humans orf2 is thought to be translated by an unconventional termination reinitiation mechanism while mouse l1s contain an internal ribosome entry site ires upstream of each orf the 5 untranslated region utr of the l1 element contains a strong internal rna polymerase ii transcription promoter in sense the 5 utr of mouse l1s contain a variable number of gc rich tandemly repeated monomers of around 200bp followed by a short non monomeric region human 5 utrs are 900bp in length and do not contain repeated motifs all families of human l1s harbor in their most 5 extremity a binding motif for the transcription factor yy1 younger families have also two binding sites for sox family transcription factors and both yy1 and sox sites were shown to be required for

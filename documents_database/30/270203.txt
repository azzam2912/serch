in most cases an increase of severity of symptoms is also noted anticipation is common in trinucleotide repeat disorders such as huntington s disease and myotonic dystrophy where a dynamic mutation in dna occurs all of these diseases have neurological symptoms prior to the understanding of the genetic mechanism for anticipation it was debated whether anticipation was a true biological phenomenon or whether the earlier age of diagnosis was related to heightened awareness of disease symptoms within a family trinucleotide repeats are apparent in a number of loci in the human genome they have been found in introns exons and 5 or 3 utr s they consist of a pattern of three nucleotides e g cgg which is repeated a number of times during meiosis unstable repeats can undergo triplet expansion see later section in this case the germ cells produced have a greater number of repeats than are found in the somatic tissues the mechanism behind the expansion of the triplet repeats is not well understood one hypothesis is that the increasing number of repeats influence the overall shape of the dna which can have an effect on its interaction with dna polymerase and thus the expression of the

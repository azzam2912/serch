parallel tree contraction was introduced by gary l miller and john h reif and has subsequently been modified to improve efficiency by x he and y yesha hillel gazit gary l miller and shang hua teng and many others tree contraction has been used in designing many efficient parallel algorithms including expression evaluation finding lowest common ancestors tree isomorphism graph isomorphism maximal subtree isomorphism common subexpression elimination computing the 3 connected components of a graph and finding an explicit planar embedding of a planar graph based on the research and work on parallel tree contraction various algorithms have been proposed targeting to improve the efficiency or simplicity of this topic this article hereby focuses on a particular solution which is a variant of the algorithm by miller and reif and its application over the past several decades there has been significant research on deriving new parallel algorithms for a variety of problems with the goal of designing highly parallel polylogarithmic depth work efficient linear in the sequential running time algorithms for some problems tree turns out to be a nice solution addressing these problems we can sometimes get more parallelism simply by representing our problem as a tree considering a

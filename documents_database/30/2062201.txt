however 3d slash is specifically meant for designing 3d printable objects in relation with the stone cutter metaphor therefore it provides an original 3d slash toolset such as the hammer to remove a cuboid the trowel to add a cuboid the chisel to remove slices of cuboids the brush to set the color of cuboids the wood filler to add a slice of cuboids the milling machine to remove adjacent cuboids volume picture projection on cuboid to help cutting your object out according to the picture shape 3d slash app offers complementary advanced tools complex geometrical shapes to handle cylinder sphere or cone the bucket to fill in with cuboid an identified volume cut copy paste functions therefore curved shapes cylinder sphere cone are also approximated by the small cuboids of the octree 3d slash particularity is also based on its stl files standard 3d printing file format import export function 3d slash algorithm computes the mesh approximation thanks to the octree s cuboids import and the reverse operation for the export computation of the octree s mesh envelope 3d slash enables community links with the possibility to share like and re use 3d designs among members printing is directly

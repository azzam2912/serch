the concept is used in the brewing and wine making industries specific gravity is measured by a hydrometer refractometer pycnometer or oscillating u tube electronic meter the density of a wort is largely dependent on the sugar content of the wort during alcohol fermentation yeast converts sugars into carbon dioxide and alcohol the decline in the sugar content and the presence of ethanol which is appreciably less dense than water drop the density of the wort the percentage of alcohol can be calculated from the difference between the original gravity abbreviated og of the wort and the current specific gravity abbreviated sg of wort by monitoring the decline in sg over time the brewer obtains information about the health and progress of the fermentation and determines that it is complete when gravity stops declining if the fermentation is finished the specific gravity is called the final gravity abbreviated fg for example for a typical strength beer og could be 1 050 and fg could be 1 010 several different scales have been used for measuring the original gravity for historical reasons the brewing industry largely uses the plato scale p which is essentially the same as the brix scale used

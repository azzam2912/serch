research has recently shown that beaked and blue whales are sensitive to mid frequency active sonar and move rapidly away from the source of the sonar a response that disrupts their feeding and can cause mass strandings some marine animals such as whales and dolphins use echolocation or biosonar systems to locate predators and prey it is conjectured that active sonar transmitters could confuse these animals and interfere with basic biological functions such as feeding and mating the study has shown whales experience decompression sickness a disease that forces nitrogen into gas bubbles in the tissues and is caused by rapid and prolonged surfacing although whales were originally thought to be immune to this disease sonar has been implicated in causing behavioral changes that can lead to decompression sickness the sofar channel short for sound fixing and ranging channel or deep sound channel dsc is a horizontal layer of water in the ocean centered around the depth at which the speed of sound is at a minimum the sofar channel acts as a waveguide for sound and low frequency sound waves within the channel may travel thousands of miles before dissipating this phenomenon is an important factor in submarine warfare

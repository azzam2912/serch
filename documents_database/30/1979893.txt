below the capping inversion 10 60 of cbl depth also called entrainment zone in the daytime cbl is divided into two sub layers mixed layer 35 80 of cbl depth and surface layer 5 10 of cbl depth the mixed layer the major part of cbl has a nearly constant distribution of quantities such as potential temperature wind speed moisture and pollutant concentration because of strong buoyancy generated convective turbulent mixing parameterization of turbulent transport is used to simulate the vertical profiles and temporal variation of quantities of interest because of the randomness and the unknown physics of turbulence however turbulence in the mixed layer is not completely random but is often organized into identifiable structures such as thermals and plumes in the cbl simulation of these large eddies is quite different from simulation of smaller eddies generated by local shears in the surface layer non local property of the large eddies should be accounted for in the parameterization the mean characteristics of the three layers of the cbl are as follows 1 the surface layer is a very shallow region close to the ground bottom 5 to 10 of cbl it is characterized by a superadiabatic lapse rate moisture

drawing on this knowledge both ren just ha y and antoine c sar becquerel posited a relationship between mechanical stress and electric charge however experiments by both proved inconclusive the piezoelectric effect results from the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and electrical states in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry the piezoelectric effect is a reversible process materials exhibiting the piezoelectric effect the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied mechanical force also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field for example lead zirconate titanate crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0 1 of the original dimension conversely those same crystals will change about 0 1 of their static dimension when an external electric field is applied to the material the inverse piezoelectric effect is used in the production of ultrasonic sound waves the pyroelectric effect by which a material generates an electric potential in response to a temperature change was studied by carl linnaeus and franz aepinus in the mid 18th century drawing on this knowledge both ren just ha y and antoine c sar becquerel posited a

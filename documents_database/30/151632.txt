kdfs can be used to stretch keys into longer keys or to obtain keys of a required format such as converting a group element that is the result of a diffie hellman key exchange into a symmetric key for use with aes keyed cryptographic hash functions are popular examples of pseudorandom functions used for key derivation key derivation functions are also used in applications to derive keys from secret passwords or passphrases which typically do not have the desired properties to be used directly as cryptographic keys in such applications it is generally recommended that the key derivation function be made deliberately slow so as to frustrate brute force attack or dictionary attack on the password or passphrase input value such use may be expressed as where is the derived key is the key derivation function is the original key or password is a random number which acts as cryptographic salt and refers to the number of iterations of a sub function the derived key is used instead of the original key or password as the key to the system the values of the salt and the number of iterations if it is not fixed are stored with the hashed

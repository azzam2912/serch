these are distinguished from seismic intensity scales that categorize the intensity or severity of ground shaking quaking caused by an earthquake at a given location magnitudes are usually determined from measurements of an earthquake s seismic waves as recorded on a seismogram magnitude scales vary on what aspect of the seismic waves are measured and how they are measured different magnitude scales are necessary because of differences in earthquakes the information available and the purposes for which the magnitudes are used the earth s crust is stressed by tectonic forces when this stress becomes great enough to rupture the crust or to overcome the friction that prevents one block of crust from slipping past another energy is released some of it in the form of various kinds of seismic waves that cause ground shaking or quaking magnitude is an estimate of the relative size or strength of an earthquake and thus its potential for causing ground shaking it is approximately related to the released seismic energy intensity refers to the strength or force of shaking at a given location and can be related to the peak ground velocity with an isoseismal map of the observed intensities see illustration an earthquake

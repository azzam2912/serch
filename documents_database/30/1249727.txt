this state is thought to consist of asymptotically free strong interacting quarks and gluons which are ordinarily confined by color confinement inside atomic nuclei or other hadrons this is in analogy with the conventional plasma where nuclei and electrons confined inside atoms by electrostatic forces at ambient conditions can move freely artificial quark matter which has been produced at brookhaven national laboratory s relativistic heavy ion collider and cern s large hadron collider can be produced in only minute quantities and is unstable and impossible to contain and will radioactively decay within a fraction of a second into stable particles through hadronization the produced hadrons or their decay products and gamma rays can then be detected in the quark matter phase diagram qgp is placed in the high temperature high density regime whereas ordinary matter is a cold and rarefied mixture of nuclei and vacuum and the hypothetical quark stars would consist of relatively cold but dense quark matter it is believed that up to a few milliseconds after the big bang known as the quark epoch the universe was in a quark gluon plasma state the strength of the color force means that unlike the gas like plasma quark

there are many genera with around 400 species worldwide especially in the tropics and subtropics only 5 species of mantispa occur in europe about long and with a wingspan of some mantidflies such as climaciella brunnea euclimacia nodosa are wasp mimics but most are brownish with green yellow and sometimes red hues the vernacular and scientific names are derived from their mantis like appearance as their spiny raptorial front legs are modified to catch small insect prey and are very similar to the front legs of mantids the only difference is that the pincers lack footpads and are not used for walking at all the adults are predatory insects that are often nocturnal and are sometimes attracted by porch lights or blacklights they are usually green brown yellow and sometimes pink and have four membranous wings which may sometimes be patterned especially in wasp mimicking species but are usually clear adult mantidflies are predators of suitably sized insects which they catch as mantids do however the underlying mechanisms for the prey capture behavior are different in mantidflies and mantids mantidflies are active hunters but as with other neuroptera they are cumbersome fliers symphrasinae larvae are sedentary parasitoids on bee wasp

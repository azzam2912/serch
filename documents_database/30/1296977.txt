in september 2014 he founded the npo luciaoptics to support the use of super resolution microscopy in the fields of molecular biology biomedicine microbiology virology pharmaceutical sciences and diagnosis his actual microscope vertico smi is the world s fastest nano light microscope that allows large scale investigation of supramolecular complexes including living cell conditions it allows 3 d imaging of biological preparations marked with conventional fluorescent dyes and reaches a resolution of 10 nm in 2d and 40 nm in 3d this nanoscope has therefore the potential to add substantially to the current revolution in optical imaging which will affect the entire molecular biology medical and pharmaceutical research the technology allows the development of new strategies for the prevention the lowering of risk and therapeutic treatment of diseases following a few semesters studying philosophy and history at freiburg university and munich university cremer studied physics in munich with financial support from the studienstiftung des deutschen volkes and completed his ph d in genetics and biophysics in freiburg this was followed by post doctoral studies at the institute for human genetics at freiburg university several years in the united states at the university of california and his habilitation in general human

national institute of standards and technology nist in 2001 aes is a subset of the rijndael block cipher developed by two belgian cryptographers vincent rijmen and joan daemen who submitted a proposal to nist during the aes selection process rijndael is a family of ciphers with different key and block sizes for aes nist selected three members of the rijndael family each with a block size of 128 bits but three different key lengths 128 192 and 256 bits aes has been adopted by the u s government and is now used worldwide it supersedes the data encryption standard des which was published in 1977 the algorithm described by aes is a symmetric key algorithm meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data in the united states aes was announced by the nist as u s fips pub 197 fips 197 on november 26 2001 this announcement followed a five year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated before the rijndael cipher was selected as the most suitable see advanced encryption standard process for more details aes became effective as a federal government standard on may 26 2002 after approval by

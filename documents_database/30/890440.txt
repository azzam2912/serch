it is distinguished by the large leaf like fluted edges on its shell called scutes and a byssal opening that is small compared to those of other members of the subfamily tridacnindae normal coloration of the mantle ranges from browns and purples to greens and yellows arranged in elongated linear or spot like patterns tridacna squamosa grows to across sessile in adulthood the clam s mantle tissues act as a habitat for the symbiotic single celled dinoflagellate algae zooxanthellae from which it gets a major portion of its nutrition by day the clam spreads out its mantle tissue so that the algae receive the sunlight they need to photosynthesize the native range spans from south africa to the red sea and to the marshall islands tridacna squamosa is sometimes kept in aquaria where it requires a moderate amount of care this species is a relatively hardy member of the tridacnidae a moderate amount of light is required by this species because it relies on zooxanthellae for part of its nutrition these dinoflagellates use the mantle as a habitat however it is not nearly as dependent on this photosynthesis as other tridacnids such as tridacna crocea or t maxima and it

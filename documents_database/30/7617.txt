the latin name was first used in the 16th century the ancient form is unknown the plates of lorica segmentata armour were soft iron inside and some at least were mild steel on the outside making the plates hardened against damage without becoming brittle this case hardening was done deliberately by packing organic matter tightly around them and heating them in a forge transferring carbon from the burnt materials into the surface of the metal the strips were arranged horizontally on the body overlapping downwards and they surrounded the torso in two halves being fastened at the front and back the upper body and shoulders were protected by additional strips shoulder guards and breast and backplates the form of the armour allowed it to be stored very compactly since it was possible to separate it into four sections each of which would collapse on itself into a compact mass the fitments that closed the various plate sections together buckles lobate hinges hinged straps tie hooks tie rings etc were made of brass in later variants dating from around 75 80 a d the fastenings of the armour were simplified bronze hinges were removed in favour of simple rivets belt fastenings

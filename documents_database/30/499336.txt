it is a speciality of naples as its name indicates the other variety originated in bologna and is known in italian as rag bolognese or rag alla bolognese the neapolitan type is made from three main parts a soffritto meat and tomato sauce however a major difference is how the meat is used as well as the amount of tomato in the sauce bolognese versions use very finely chopped meat while neapolitan versions use whole meat taking it from the casserole when cooked and serving it as a second course or with pasta also the neapolitan soffritto contains much more onion compared to the bolognese preferences for ingredients also differ in naples white wine is replaced by red wine butter by lard or olive oil and lots of basil leaves are used where bolognese rag has no herbs in the neapolitan recipe the content may well be enriched by adding raisins pine nuts and involtini with different fillings milk or cream is not used and a relative abundance of tomato sauce in flavour in contrast to bolognese use of a minimal amount is preferred the tomato season is much longer in more southern naples than in more northern bologna like

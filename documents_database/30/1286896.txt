it has geometry conformal adaptive binary tree mesh generation tool which creates 3 d grid from cad surfaces for liquid devices pumplinx has a cavitation model to account for the effect of liquid vapor free dissolved gas and liquid compressibility pumplinx provides templates for different categories of devices including axial piston pumps centrifugal pumps gerotors gear pumps progressive cavity pumps propellers radial piston pumps rotary vane pumps submersible pumps and valves those templates create an initial grid for special rotors for example grids around gears of a gear pump and then re meshes the grid for a moving simulation and provide device specific input and output the output from the code include velocities pressures temperatures and gas volume fractions of the flow field together with integrated engineering data such as loads and torques pumplinx uses a single graphical user interface gui for grid generation model set up execution and post processing the software is used primarily by component and system engineers in the automotive hydraulic and aerospace industry as a virtual test bed to study efficiency cavitation pressure ripple and noise for hydrodynamic pumps and fluid power equipment

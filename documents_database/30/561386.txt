humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration of human dives and allow different types of work to be done in ambient pressure diving the diver is directly exposed to the pressure of the surrounding water the ambient pressure diver may dive on breath hold or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface supplied diving and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness dcs after long duration deep dives atmospheric diving suits ads may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure crewed submersibles can extend depth range and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans the environment exposes the diver to a wide range of hazards and though the risks are largely controlled by appropriate diving skills training types of equipment and breathing gases used depending on the mode depth and purpose of diving it remains a relatively dangerous activity diving activities are restricted to maximum depths of about for recreational scuba diving for commercial saturation diving and wearing atmospheric suits diving is also restricted to conditions which are not excessively hazardous

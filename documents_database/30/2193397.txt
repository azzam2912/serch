the game has the following components the game is a sequential game with three steps for each consumer producer pair we analyze the game using backward induction step 3 is simple each consumer just selects the cheapest facility step 2 is also quite simple suppose a producer p has its facility in location l then the price it takes from consumer c must be at least cost c l suppose the locations are ordered in increasing order of the cost i e the locations are l1 l2 such that cost c l1 potential game the potential is the total social welfare when a new producer enters the game the increase in social welfare exactly equals the producer s profit therefore this step has a pure nash equilibrium and the entire game has a pure subgame perfect equilibrium moreover every maximum welfare outcome is also a maximum potential outcome so it must also be a nash equilibrium this means that the price of stability is 1 the facility location game may have other pure nash equilibria in which the social welfare is not maximal however it is possible to prove that the social welfare in such equilibria is at least half

endogenous retrotransposons are hypothesized to target gene poor chromosomal targets in order to reduce the chance of inactivating host genes ty1 ty4 integrate upstream of pol iii promoters while ty5 targets integration to loci bound in heterochromatin in the case of ty5 this likely occurs by means of an interaction between the c terminus of integrase and a target protein the tight targeting patterns seen for the ty elements are thought to be a means to limit damage to its host which has a very gene dense genome ty5 was discovered in the mid 90s in the laboratory of daniel voytas at iowa state university ty5 is used as a model system by which to understand the biology of the telomere and heterochromatin the ty5 retrotransposon is used as a genetic model to study the architecture and dynamics of the telomeres and heterochromatin heterochromatin in s cerevisiae is composed of a wide array of proteins and plays several roles the first stage of heterochromatin formation requires dna binding proteins which interact with specific cis dna sequences at the telomeres rdna and hm loci these proteins including rap1p and the origin recognition complex orc serve as a platform for other proteins

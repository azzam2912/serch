tuning two tones to a unison will present a peculiar effect when the two tones are close in pitch but not identical the difference in frequency generates the beating the volume varies like in a tremolo as the sounds alternately interfere constructively and destructively as the two tones gradually approach unison the beating slows down and may become so slow as to be imperceptible as the two tones get further apart their beat frequency starts to approach the range of human pitch perception the beating starts to sound like a note and a combination tone is produced this combination tone can also be referred to as a missing fundamental as the beat frequency of any two tones is equivalent to the frequency of their implied fundamental frequency this phenomenon is best known in acoustics or music though it can be found in any linear system according to the law of superposition two tones sounding simultaneously are superimposed in a very simple way one adds their amplitudes if a graph is drawn to show the function corresponding to the total sound of two strings it can be seen that maxima and minima are no longer constant as when a pure note

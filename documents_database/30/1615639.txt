while the term originally applied mainly to cottages it may be loosely applied to any tied accommodation from a small flat to a large house the concept is generally associated with agriculture but may occur in a wide range of occupations the concept has been in use at least since the 18th century there has been considerable debate particularly in the 20th century over whether the system is fair to occupiers and a number of laws have been enacted or amended to improve their security of tenure the concept still exists though in a substantially different form from the original idea partly as a result of the enclosure acts of the 18th and 19th centuries which denied hitherto free access by working class people to common land rural people became more dependent upon paid agricultural work this was a key theme in thomas hardy s novel tess of the d urbervilles counterintuitively the rise of tied accommodation made rural workers less secure tied accommodation became a common practice in 19th and 20th century rural england where the property owner which might be an estate a public or private institution or a farmer could control who lived in the property rent

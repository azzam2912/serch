it consists of finding an optimal assignment of a set of weapons of various types to a set of targets in order to maximize the total expected damage done to the opponent the basic problem is as follows notice that as opposed to the classic assignment problem or the generalized assignment problem more than one agent i e weapon can be assigned to each task i e target and not all targets are required to have weapons assigned thus we see that the wta allows one to formulate optimal assignment problems wherein tasks require cooperation among agents additionally it provides the ability to model probabilistic completion of tasks in addition to costs both static and dynamic versions of wta can be considered in the static case the weapons are assigned to targets once the dynamic case involves many rounds of assignment where the state of the system after each exchange of fire round is considered in the next round while the majority of work has been done on the static wta problem recently the dynamic wta problem has received more attention in spite of the name there are nonmilitary applications of the wta the main one is to search for

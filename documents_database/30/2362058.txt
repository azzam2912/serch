the island formed within the last six to seven million years and is primarily mafic rock with some felsic rock geologists debate the exact origins of the island and some have proposed that ascension island may overly a diverted shallow mantle plume alternately the island may have originated from anomalously enriched magma originally at the mid atlantic ridge but now situated to the west of it the petrology of ascension is unusual compared to most other volcanic islands which only have a few mafic and felsic endmembers such as basalt or rhyolite ascension has a full range from some of the most mafic to most felsic this includes basalt hawaiite mugearite benmoreite trachyte and rhyolite potassium argon dating indicates that the oldest rocks exposed above the water are one million year old rhyolites geologists have divided the island s mafic and felsic rocks into different named sequences and sub divided mafic rocks based on their ratio of zirconium and niobium the sister s peak region in northwest ascension has intermediate mafic lava flows scoria cones and mafic ash fall deposits near long beach the flows formed approximately 829 000 years ago and range between basalt hawaiite and mugearite compositions benmoreite

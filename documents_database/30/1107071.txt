renewable technologies can enhance energy security in electricity generation heat supply and transportation access to cheap energy has become essential to the functioning of modern economies however the uneven distribution of fossil fuel supplies among countries and the critical need to widely access energy resources has led to significant vulnerabilities threats to global energy security include political instability of energy producing countries manipulation of energy supplies competition over energy sources attacks on supply infrastructure as well as accidents and natural disasters energy security therefore has become fundamental from many perspectives and is being therefore increasingly at the centre of legal and policy issues linked to social economic and development matters the fukushima i nuclear accidents in japan have brought new attention to how national energy systems are vulnerable to natural disasters with climate change already bringing more weather and climate extremes these threats to our old energy systems provide a rationale for investing in renewable energy shifting to renewable energy can help us to meet the dual goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions thereby limiting future extreme weather and climate impacts and ensuring reliable timely and cost efficient delivery of energy investing in renewable energy can have significant dividends for

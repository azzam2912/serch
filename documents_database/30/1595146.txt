it is one of the few proteas that grow into trees and the only one that has usable timber the waboom is a slow growing tree with very thick white grey bark that varies considerably in height it is normally about 5 meters tall but in good conditions it may reach a height of up to 10 meters with a trunk diameter of 1 meter however on the cape peninsula they are typically much smaller the young leaves are crimson but they become a bluish sea green colour in later life large bisexual flower heads appear all through the year especially in winter and bear sweet nectar small nuts are released about a year after flowering the natural range of the waboom is from the cape peninsula all the way to the bokkeveld escarpment and into the eastern cape it grows on mountain slopes of all altitudes and in the right conditions they can form large open woodlands though they are not threatened in many areas they have been cleared for timber often to be replaced by commercial pine plantations

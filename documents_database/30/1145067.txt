over 30 publications exist describing its use first for nucleosome positioning from valouev et al transcriptional profiling or strand sensitive rna seq with cloonan et al single cell transcriptional profiling with tang et al and ultimately human resequencing with mckernan et al the method used by this machine sequencing by ligation has been reported to have some issue sequencing palindromic sequences a library of dna fragments is prepared from the sample to be sequenced and is used to prepare clonal bead populations that is only one species of fragment will be present on the surface of each magnetic bead the fragments attached to the magnetic beads will have a universal p1 adapter sequence attached so that the starting sequence of every fragment is both known and identical emulsion pcr takes place in microreactors containing all the necessary reagents for pcr the resulting pcr products attached to the beads are then covalently bound to a glass slide primers hybridize to the p1 adapter sequence within the library template a set of four fluorescently labelled di base probes compete for ligation to the sequencing primer specificity of the di base probe is achieved by interrogating every 1st and 2nd base in each

this is also enough to handle signed numbers from 2048 to 2047 this is higher precision than a slide rule or most analog computers twelve bits could also store two six bit characters note six bit isn t enough for two cases unlike fuller ascii character set nd code was one such 6 bit character encoding that included upper case alphabetic digit a subset of punctuation and a few control characters the nd812 s basic configuration has a main memory of 4 096 twelve bit words with a 2 microsecond cycle time memory is expandable to 16k words in 4k word increments bits within the word are numbered from most significant bit bit 11 to least significant bit bit 0 the programming model consists of four accumulator registers two main accumulators j and k and two sub accumulators r and s a rich set of arithmetic and logical operations are provided for the main accumulators and instructions are provided to exchange data between the main and sub accumulators conditional execution is provided through skip instructions a condition is tested and the subsequent instruction is either executed or skipped depending on the result of the test the subsequent instruction is usually

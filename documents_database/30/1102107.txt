the environment present in the human mouth is suited to the growth of characteristic microorganisms found there it provides a source of water and nutrients as well as a moderate temperature resident microbes of the mouth adhere to the teeth and gums to resist mechanical flushing from the mouth to stomach where acid sensitive microbes are destroyed by hydrochloric acid anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity include actinomyces arachnia bacteroides bifidobacterium eubacterium fusobacterium lactobacillus leptotrichia peptococcus peptostreptococcus propionibacterium selenomonas treponema and veillonella genera of fungi that are frequently found in the mouth include candida cladosporium aspergillus fusarium glomus alternaria penicillium and cryptococcus among others bacteria accumulate on both the hard and soft oral tissues in biofilms bacterial adhesion is particularly important for oral bacteria oral bacteria have evolved mechanisms to sense their environment and evade or modify the host bacteria occupy the ecological niche provided by both the tooth surface and gingival epithelium however a highly efficient innate host defense system constantly monitors the bacterial colonization and prevents bacterial invasion of local tissues a dynamic equilibrium exists between dental plaque bacteria and the innate host defense system of particular interest is the role of oral microorganisms in the two major

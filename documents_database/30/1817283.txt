the first such result was published by john kingman who showed that when the utilisation parameter of an m m 1 queue is near 1 a scaled version of the queue length process can be accurately approximated by a reflected brownian motion heavy traffic approximations are typically stated for the process x t describing the number of customers in the system at time t they are arrived at by considering the model under the limiting values of some model parameters and therefore for the result to be finite the model must be rescaled by a factor n denoted and the limit of this process is considered as n there are three classes of regime under which such approximations are generally considered theorem 1 consider a sequence of g g 1 queues indexed by formula 3 for queue formula 3 let formula 5 denote the random inter arrival time formula 6 denote the random service time let formula 7 denote the traffic intensity with formula 8 and formula 9 let formula 10 denote the waiting time in queue for a customer in steady state let formula 11 and formula 12 suppose that formula 13 formula 14 and formula 15 then provided

once mounted on a helicopter or an unmanned aerial vehicle uav it incorporates visual information from a digital camera and elevation data from a light detection and ranging lidar system to create a two and three dimensional colored map with orthorectified 4 to 6 inch resolution buckeye has been used by deployed personnel from the topographic engineering center to support operations in both afghanistan and iraq including operation iraqi freedom in 2007 it was named by the army as one of the top ten inventions of 2006 in 2004 the u s army engineer research and development center erdc in vicksburg mississippi developed the buckeye system in an effort to provide more accurate geospatial information during asymmetric warfare at the time buckeye provided a higher resolution imagery than controlled image base 1 cib1 which was the military standard in terms of resolution range for digital imagery initially buckeye was designed to provide imagery for change detection applications for detection of improvised explosive devices ieds however the time delay that occurred every time the geospatial information was delivered to the ground station caused buckeye to be more effectively used as a tool for digitally mapping urban areas than finding ieds the

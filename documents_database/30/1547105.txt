the original version of the hoek brown criterion was developed by evert hoek and e t brown in 1980 for the design of underground excavations in 1988 the criterion was extended for applicability to slope stability and surface excavation problems an update of the criterion was presented in 2002 that included improvements in the correlation between the model parameters and the geological strength index gsi the basic idea of the hoek brown criterion was to start with the properties intact rock and to add factors to reduce those properties because of the existence of joints in the rock although a similar criterion for concrete had been developed in 1936 the significant tool that the hoek brown criterion gave design engineers was a quantification of the relation between the stress state and bieniawski s rock mass rating rmr the hoek brown failure criterion is used widely in mining engineering design the hoek brown criterion has the form where formula 2 is the effective maximum principal stress formula 3 is the effective minimum principal stress and formula 4 are materials constants in terms of the mean normal stress formula 5 and maximum shear stress formula 6 where we can convert the above

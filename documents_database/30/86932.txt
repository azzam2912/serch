femurs or femora or thigh bone is the proximal bone of the hindlimb in tetrapod vertebrates and of the human thigh the head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee joint by most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body the femur is also the longest bone in the human body the femur is the only bone in the upper leg the two femurs converge medially toward the knees where they articulate with the proximal ends of the tibiae the angle of convergence of the femora is a major factor in determining the femoral tibial angle human females have wider pelvic bones causing their femora to converge more than in males in the condition genu valgum knock knee the femurs converge so much that the knees touch one another the opposite extreme is genu varum bow leggedness in the general population of people without either genu valgum or genu varum the femoral tibial angle is about 175 degrees the femur is the longest and by some measures the strongest bone in the human

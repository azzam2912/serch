meredith newquay u k formerly malawi and her co workers in the period 1975 1988 the minute almost smooth shell length 2 0 2 4 mm resembles that of the genus streptostele but is characterized by three fold apertural dentition and just under six whorls this taxon may represent a new genus the specific name streptostelopsis is of the resemblance of streptostele it is latinized greek for streptostele like and refers to the likeness to shells of the streptaxid genus streptostele the kindred epithet streptosteloides already exists in the family streptaxidae the original combination was opeas streptosteloides von martens 1897 but this taxon appears to be a streptaxid now named streptostele streptosteloides von martens 1897 in view of the similarity of the names and probable causes for confusion in possibly closely allied genera the epithet streptostelopsis was proposed this minute land snail lives at series of localities of mainly between 1000 and 1500 m a s l in malawi south of about 11 s bruggen 2007 presumed that this almost certainly is not a malawi endemic many localities are sufficiently close to the borders of at least zambia and mozambique to predict occurrence in those countries particularly as suitable habitat

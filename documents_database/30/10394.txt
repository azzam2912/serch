by convention the primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino terminal n end to the carboxyl terminal c end protein biosynthesis is most commonly performed by ribosomes in cells peptides can also be synthesized in the laboratory protein primary structures can be directly sequenced or inferred from dna sequences amino acids are polymerised via peptide bonds to form a long backbone with the different amino acid side chains protruding along it in biological systems proteins are produced during translation by a cell s ribosomes some organisms can also make short peptides by non ribosomal peptide synthesis which often use amino acids other than the standard 20 and may be cyclised modified and cross linked peptides can be synthesised chemically via a range of laboratory methods chemical methods typically synthesise peptides in the opposite order to biological protein synthesis starting at the c terminus protein sequence is typically notated as a string of letters listing the amino acids starting at the amino terminal end through to the carboxyl terminal end either a three letter code or single letter code can be used to represent the 20 naturally occurring amino acids as well as mixtures or ambiguous amino

in the era of sail powered warships with their intrinsic limitations of speed and manoeverability the practice of ramming opponents fell by default into disuse although the concept remained alive with the advent of steam powered vessels with their enhanced speed and lack of dependence for direction on the wind the ram as a potent weapon of attack gained credibility in naval circles and in ship constructors departments this first became apparent in the american civil war when many attempts were made by ships on both sides to ram their opponents with almost uniform lack of success the confederate virginia ex merrimack rammed and sank the federal cumberland but lost her ram and suffered significant structural damage the battle which most influenced the exaggerated faith in the ram as a weapon was the battle of lissa between austria hungary and italy in 1866 the austrian ferdinand max rammed the stationary italian re d italia which immediately heeled over and sank this resulted in all ironclad battleships designed for the next forty years being built to carry a ram a weapon which while causing the loss of a number of ships accidentally never sank another major enemy warship of any nationality

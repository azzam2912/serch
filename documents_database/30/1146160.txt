serge belongie and jitendra malik proposed the term in their paper matching with shape contexts in 2000 the shape context is intended to be a way of describing shapes that allows for measuring shape similarity and the recovering of point correspondences the basic idea is to pick n points on the contours of a shape for each point p on the shape consider the n 1 vectors obtained by connecting p to all other points the set of all these vectors is a rich description of the shape localized at that point but is far too detailed the key idea is that the distribution over relative positions is a robust compact and highly discriminative descriptor so for the point p the coarse histogram of the relative coordinates of the remaining n 1 points is defined to be the shape context of formula 2 the bins are normally taken to be uniform in log polar space the fact that the shape context is a rich and discriminative descriptor can be seen in the figure below in which the shape contexts of two different versions of the letter a are shown a and b are the sampled edge points of the two

shin tibia and fibula and the proximal tarsal bones i e astragalus and calcaneum the ankle joint of therian mammals marsupials and placentals is a crurotarsal joint with the main joint of ankle bending between the tibia and the astragalus the calcaneum has no contact with the tibia but forms a heel to which muscles can attach a group of archosauriform diapsids crurotarsi including living crocodilians and their extinct relatives is named after specialized crurotarsal joint in the skeletons of the members of this group located between their fibula and calcaneum with a hemicylindrical condyle on the calcaneum articulating against fibula this joint is present in the skeletons of suchians including crocodilians and phytosaurs and was cited as one of the characters supporting uniting these two groups in a clade to the exclusion of avemetatarsalian archosaurs birds and their extinct relatives however according to a study published in 2011 suchians are more closely related to avemetatarsalia than to phytosaurs there is however not enough information to find out whether the aforementioned crurotarsal joint evolved independently in suchians and in phytosaurs or whether it was already present in the skeleton of their most recent common ancestor and secondarily lost in avemetatarsalians

21 is a set of 8 pieces for solo piano written by robert schumann in 1838 the novelletten were composed during february 1838 a period of great struggle for the composer schumann originally intended the eight pieces to be performed together as a group though they are often performed separately with great success this set of pieces is an excellent example of schumann s keyboard style this piece contains 7 sections alternating between a staccato march and flowing legato passages the piece is a modified rondo form this virtuosic piece is graceful and effective an intermezzo section in the middle contrasts and varies the piece this piece displays the composer s sense of humour through the use of rapid staccato chords an intermezzo section in the middle of the piece is used to contrast this piece is quite loosely organized in terms of structure it is an interesting waltz that uses cross rhythms and syncopation effectively this piece is in the form of a polonaise its principal section contains three main ideas which are then overcome by the persistent rhythms of the trio section this piece uses an increasing tempo to characterize the progression of sections starting from the staccato

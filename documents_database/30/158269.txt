a common approach brute force attack is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and to check them against an available cryptographic hash of the password the purpose of password cracking might be to help a user recover a forgotten password installing an entirely new password is less of a security risk but it involves system administration privileges to gain unauthorized access to a system or to act as a preventive measure whereby system administrators check for easily crackable passwords on a file by file basis password cracking is utilized to gain access to digital evidence to which a judge has allowed access when a particular file s permissions are restricted the time to crack a password is related to bit strength see password strength which is a measure of the password s entropy and the details of how the password is stored most methods of password cracking require the computer to produce many candidate passwords each of which is checked one example is brute force cracking in which a computer tries every possible key or password until it succeeds more common methods of password cracking such as dictionary attacks pattern checking word list substitution etc attempt to reduce the

the former formalism represent the data structures aspects while the latter stands for the behavioral and concurrent aspects of systems in order to deal with large specifications some structuring capabilities have been introduced the object oriented paradigm has been adopted which means that a co opn specification is a collection of objects which interact concurrently cooperation between the objects is achieved by means of a synchronization mechanism i e each object event may request to be synchronized with some methods parameterized events of one or a group of partners by means of a synchronization expression a co opn specification consists of a collection of two different modules the abstract data type modules and the object modules the abstract data type modules concern the data structure component of the specifications and many sorted algebraic specifications are used when describing these modules furthermore the object modules represent the concept of encapsulated entities that possess an internal state and provide the exterior with various services for this second sort of modules an algebraic net formalism has been adopted algebraic petri nets a kind of high level nets are a great improvement over the petri nets i e petri nets tokens are replaced with

rosenzweig is a professor of chemistry and molecular biosciences at northwestern university she was born in 1967 in pittsburgh pennsylvania she received her ba in chemistry from amherst college in 1988 and her ph d from massachusetts institute of technology in 1994 at mit rosenzweig worked under the supervision of stephen j lippard where she pioneered the structural studies of the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase from methyloccous capsulatus her current research interests include structural biology and bioinorganic chemistry metal uptake and transport oxygen activation by metalloenzymes and characterization of membrane protein for her work she has been recognized by a number of national and international awards including the macarthur genius award in 2003 rosenzweig determined the molecular structures of nature s main methane oxidation catalysts methane monooxygenases mmo are metalloenzymes found in the family of methanotrophic bacteria these enzymes belong in the oxidoreductase class they activate carbon hydrogen bonds to selectively install oxygen onto their substrate two major species of mmo exist soluble mmo smmo and particulate mmo pmmo despite mediating the same chemical reaction these two enzymes structure and mechanism are significantly different since the early 1990s rosenzweig has studied mmo enzymes in various biological systems her team

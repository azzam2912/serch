in an astronomical context relativistic beaming commonly occurs in two oppositely directed relativistic jets of plasma that originate from a central compact object that is accreting matter accreting compact objects and relativistic jets are invoked to explain the following observed phenomena x ray binaries gamma ray bursts and on a much larger scale active galactic nuclei agn quasars are also associated with an accreting compact object but are thought to be merely a particular variety of agn beaming affects the apparent brightness of a moving object just as a lighthouse affects the appearance of its light source the light appears dim or unseen to a ship except when the rotating beacon is directed towards it when it then appears bright this so called lighthouse effect illustrates how important the direction of motion relative to the observer is consider a cloud of gas moving relative to the observer and emitting electromagnetic radiation if the gas is moving towards the observer it will be brighter than if it were at rest but if moving away it will appear fainter the magnitude of the effect is illustrated by the agn jets of the galaxies m87 and 3c 319 see images at right m87

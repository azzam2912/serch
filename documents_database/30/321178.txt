drm exposes an api that user space programs can use to send commands and data to the gpu and perform operations such as configuring the mode setting of the display drm was first developed as the kernel space component of the x server s direct rendering infrastructure but since then it has been used by other graphic stack alternatives such as wayland user space programs can use the drm api to command the gpu to do hardware accelerated 3d rendering and video decoding as well as gpgpu computing the linux kernel already had an api called fbdev used to manage the framebuffer of a graphics adapter but it couldn t be used to handle the needs of modern 3d accelerated gpu based video hardware these devices usually require setting and managing a command queue in their own memory to dispatch commands to the gpu and also require management of buffers and free space within that memory initially user space programs such as the x server directly managed these resources but they usually acted as if they were the only ones with access to them when two or more programs tried to control the same hardware at the same time and

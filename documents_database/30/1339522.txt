since the mid 1970s nanoindentation has become the primary method for measuring and testing very small volumes of mechanical properties nanoindentation also called depth sensing indentation or instrumented indentation gained popularity with the development of machines that could record small load and displacement with high accuracy and precision the load displacement data can be used to determine modulus of elasticity hardness yield strength fracture toughness scratch hardness and wear properties there are many types of nanoindenters in current use differing mainly on their tip geometry among the numerous available geometries are three and four sided pyramids wedges cones cylinders filaments and spheres several geometries have become a well established common standard due to their extended use and well known properties such as berkovich cube corner vickers and knoop nanoindenters to meet the high precision required nanoindenters must be made following the definitions of iso 14577 2 and be inspected and measured with equipment and standards traceable to the national institute of standards and technology nist the tip end of the indenter can be made sharp flat or rounded to a cylindrical or spherical shape the material for most nanoindenters is diamond and sapphire although other hard materials can be used

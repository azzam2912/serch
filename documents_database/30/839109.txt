all but one coastal species c ranunculus are found in inland waters such as springs pools creeks and streams most species live in extreme environments for example several species of chlamydogobius are found in the water that emerges from geothermal springs such as the dalhousie goby found in the waters around dalhousie springs these fish can live in water with a wide range of temperatures ph salinity and oxygen levels for example they are found in water with a ph between 6 8 and 9 0 and temperatures between they can tolerate salinity as high as 60 parts per thousand almost twice that of sea water they have been found in water with extremely low oxygen levels as low as 0 8 ppm their water habitats often exhibit oxygen levels below 5 milligrams of oxygen per litre to cope with extremely low oxygen levels they will emerge from the water to gulp air known as aerial respiration they also will position themselves over beds of algae to capture the produced oxygen they will hide in the mud and silt at the bottom of a stream or in a plant or under a rock to avoid more extreme water temperatures sometimes

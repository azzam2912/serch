voerner in 1986 the name was reassigned to a protein isolated from sheep wool follicles the human tchh is located on the long q arm of chromosome 1 at region 2 band 1 sub band 3 1q21 3 from base pair 152 105 403 to base pair 152 116 368 map this region in chromosome 1q21 is known as the epidermal differentiation complex since it harbors over fifty other genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation gene coding sequence contains 5829 nucleotides gene orthologs were identified in most mammals including mice chickens rats pigs sheep horses and other species trichohyalin is highly expressed in the inner root sheath cells of the hair follicle and medulla it was also detected in the granular layer and stratum corneum of normal epidermis newborn human foreskin epidermis the hard palate in the nail matrix the filiform papillae of dorsal tongue epithelium and in rodent forestomack the protein forms frequent links between the heads and tails of the keratin chains and thus participates in keratin intermediate filaments kif inter filamentous cross linking it also carries a function of a major reinforcement cross bridging protein for the cell envelope ce barrier structure of the irs and participates in

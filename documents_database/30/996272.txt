it is named after james joseph sylvester sylvester s criterion states that a hermitian matrix m is positive definite if and only if all the following matrices have a positive determinant in other words all of the leading principal minors must be positive an analogous theorem holds for characterizing positive semidefinite hermitian matrices except that it is no longer sufficient to consider only the leading principal minors a hermitian matrix m is positive semidefinite if and only if all principal minors of m are nonnegative the proof is only for nonsingular hermitian matrix with coefficients in formula 2 therefore only for nonsingular real symmetric matrices positive definite or semidefinite matrix a symmetric matrix a whose eigenvalues are positive 0 is called positive definite and when the eigenvalues are just nonnegative 0 a is said to be positive semidefinite theorem i a real symmetric matrix a has nonnegative eigenvalues if and only if a can be factored as a b b and all eigenvalues are positive if and only if b is nonsingular theorem ii the cholesky decomposition the symmetric matrix a possesses positive pivots if and only if a can be uniquely factored as a rr where r is an

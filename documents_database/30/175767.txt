this strategy enables the video signal to be transmitted more efficiently through long distances in general video modulation means that a higher frequency carrier wave is modified according to the original video signal in this way carrier wave contains the information in the video signal then the carrier will carry the information in the form of radio frequency rf signal when carrier reaches its destination the video signal is extracted from the carrier by decoding in other words the video signal is first combined with a higher frequency carrier wave so that carrier wave contains the information in video signal the combined signal is called radio frequency signal at the end of this transmitting system the rf signals stream from a light sensor and hence the receivers can obtain the initial data in the original video signal there are many application of video modulation these applications all utilized the efficiency of video modulation in order to minimize costs there are some important concepts needed to be understand in order to fully comprehend the video modulation video signals are usually encoded into binary digit 0 1 or seven digit pulse code modulation pcm which is a method used to digitally represent

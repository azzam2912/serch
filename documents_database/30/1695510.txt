the physical finding of detrusor pressurization of insufficient strength or duration to ensure timely and efficient bladder emptying is properly termed detrusor underactivity du abrams et al 2002 historically uab and du as well as others such as bladder underactivity have been often used interchangeably rigby d 2005 leading to both terminologic and pathophysiologic confusion patients with uab have a diminished sense of bladder filling and consequently are often found to have du as an underlying finding however bladder outlet obstruction and less frequently volume hypersensitivity oab can be associated with uab symptoms chapple et al 2015 without diagnostic evaluation the cause of uab is unclear as there are multiple possible causes uab symptoms can accurately reflect impaired bladder emptying due either to du or obstruction normal or large storage volumes elevated post void residual volume or can result from a sense of incomplete emptying of a hypersensitive bladder small storage volumes normal or elevated postvoid residual volume uab potentially might also result from inaccurate perceptions of bladder function such as in neurologic or psychiatric disease du itself is often linked to a weak detrusor muscle impaired contractility however this association is weak both uab and du have been associated

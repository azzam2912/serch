it was first introduced by chris harris and mike stephens in 1988 upon the improvement of moravec s corner detector compared to the previous one harris corner detector takes the differential of the corner score into account with reference to direction directly instead of using shifting patches for every 45 degree angles and has been proved to be more accurate in distinguishing between edges and corners since then it has been improved and adopted in many algorithms to preprocess images for subsequent applications a corner is a point whose local neighborhood stands in two dominant and different edge directions in other words a corner can be interpreted as the junction of two edges where an edge is a sudden change in image brightness corners are the important features in the image and they are generally termed as interest points which are invariant to translation rotation and illumination although corners are only a small percentage of the image they contain the most important features in restoring image information and they can be used to minimize the amount of processed data for motion tracking image stitching building 2d mosaics stereo vision image representation and other related computer vision areas in order to

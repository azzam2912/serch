ellison marshall is an innovator in the field of high energy electron positron annihilation making many personal contributions he was the first at the positron electron tandem ring accelerator petra e e collider at the deutsches elektronen synchrotron desy to determine the electroweak properties of leptons and then quarks these papers become templates for other experimenters over the next ten years he performed the definitive analysis of the world s electron positron data to produce what are now the textbook results for the quantum chromodynamics qcd fine structure constant and the fermion electroweak interaction parameters in 1984 he published a novel method for isolating bottom quark events and then used the method to measure the b electroweak properties showing that it belonged to a weak isospin doublet state and hence that the top quark exists this was one of the most significant physics results from petra he has been a group leader at rutherford appleton laboratory ral since the 1980s and in the 1990s prepared an experiment at the electron proton collider hadron elektron ringanlage hera at desy marshall was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1995 and is a fellow of the institute of physics finstp

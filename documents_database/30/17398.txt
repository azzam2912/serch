the total pressure of an ideal gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture the partial pressure of a gas is a measure of thermodynamic activity of the gas s molecules gases dissolve diffuse and react according to their partial pressures and not according to their concentrations in gas mixtures or liquids this general property of gases is also true in chemical reactions of gases in biology for example the necessary amount of oxygen for human respiration and the amount that is toxic is set by the partial pressure of oxygen alone this is true across a very wide range of different concentrations of oxygen present in various inhaled breathing gases or dissolved in blood the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are important parameters in tests of arterial blood gases but can also be measured in for example cerebrospinal fluid the symbol for pressure is usually p or p which may use a subscript to identify the pressure and gas species are also referred to by subscript when combined these subscripts are applied recursively examples dalton s law expresses the fact that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is

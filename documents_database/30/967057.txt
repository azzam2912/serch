when one or more of these vertical or horizontal elements that meet are required by the local building code to have a fire resistance rating the resulting opening that makes up the joint must be firestopped in order to restore the required compartmentalisation such joints are often subject to movement as a function of the building s design basis for a sample certification listing indicating fire tested motion click here firestops must be able to demonstrate the ability to withstand operational movement prior to fire testing firestops for such building joints can be qualified to ul 2079 tests for fire resistance of building joint systems whether or not the building elements forming the joint have a fire resistance rating the joint design must still consider the anticipated operational movement of each joint timing is also important as freshly poured concrete shrinks particularly during the first few months of a new building potentially causing joint size changes firestopping at the perimeter slab edge which is gaps between the floors and the backpan of the curtain wall or precast concrete panels slow the passage of fire and combustion gases between floors the firestop at the perimeter slab edge is considered a continuation

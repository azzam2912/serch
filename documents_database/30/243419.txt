it is typically used in morphological operations such as dilation erosion opening and closing as well as the hit or miss transform according to georges matheron knowledge about an object e g an image depends on the manner in which we probe observe it in particular the choice of a certain structuring element for a particular morphological operation influences the information one can obtain there are two main characteristics that are directly related to structuring elements structuring elements are particular cases of binary images usually being small and simple in mathematical morphology binary images are subsets of a euclidean space r or the integer grid z for some dimension d here are some examples of widely used structuring elements denoted by b in the discrete case a structuring element can also be represented as a set of pixels on a grid assuming the values 1 if the pixel belongs to the structuring element or 0 otherwise when used by a hit or miss transform usually the structuring element is a composite of two disjoint sets two simple structuring elements one associated to the foreground and one associated to the background of the image to be probed in this case an

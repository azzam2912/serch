its primary purpose is machine to machine communication rather than communication between humans the code set includes all units defined in iso 1000 iso 2955 1983 ansi x3 50 1986 hl7 and env 12435 and explicitly and verifiably addresses the naming conflicts and ambiguities in those standards to resolve them it provides for representations of units in 7 bit ascii for machine to machine communication with unambiguous mapping between case sensitive and case insensitive representations a reference open source implementation is available as a java applet also an osgi based implementation at eclipse foundation units are represented in ucum with reference to a set of seven base units the ucum base units are the meter for measurement of length the second for time the gram for mass the coulomb for charge the kelvin for temperature the candela for luminous intensity and the radian for plane angle the ucum base units form a set of mutually independent dimensions as required by dimensional analysis some of the ucum base units are different from the si base units ucum is compatible with but not isomorphic with si there are four differences between the two sets of base units each unit represented in ucum

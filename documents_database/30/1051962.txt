in the first phase of room and pillar mining tunnels are advanced into the coal or ore body in a rectangular pattern resembling city streets pillars are left between tunnels to support the weight of the overburden the first phase is known as mining on the advance from the entrance toward the further reaches of the reserve in the second phase once advance mining has been completed pillars are removed on the retreat removing or pulling pillars begins far from the entrance and proceeds toward the entrance as the pillars are removed the mine collapses because nothing remains to support the roof and overburden removing pillars causes stresses within the mine to shift and must be planned and executed carefully to reduce danger to miners and control the amount of stress exerted on remaining pillars and the mine floor tunnels only make up about 15 of the reserve so during advance mining only about 15 of the coal or ore is removed during retreat mining an additional 75 of coal or ore may be removed because pillars make up much more of the reserve bringing the total recovery of the resource to as much as 90 retreat mining is a

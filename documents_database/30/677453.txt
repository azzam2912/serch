they are the coefficients of the eulerian polynomials the eulerian polynomials are defined by the exponential generating function the eulerian polynomials can be computed by the recurrence an equivalent way to write this definition is to set the eulerian polynomials inductively by other notations for a n m are e n m and formula 7 in 1755 leonhard euler investigated in his book institutiones calculi differentialis polynomials etc see the facsimile these polynomials are a shifted form of what are now called the eulerian polynomials a x for a given value of n 0 the index m in a n m can take values from 0 to n 1 for fixed n there is a single permutation which has 0 ascents n n 1 n 2 1 there is also a single permutation which has n 1 ascents this is the rising permutation 1 2 3 n therefore a n 0 and a n n 1 are 1 for all values of n reversing a permutation with m ascents creates another permutation in which there are n m 1 ascents therefore a n m a n n m 1 values of a n m can be calculated by hand for

it is a type of hot air engine converting a temperature difference into motion there is a hot side and a cold side to the engine providing there is a large enough temperature difference between the two sides the engine will run the manson guise engine is probably the simplest type of hot air engines having only a single con rod with a displacer piston and power piston that move at the same time manson guise engines seem to be fairly unique in the fact that they can run in either direction flywheel can run clockwise or anti clockwise manson guise engines share some similarities with stirling engines but with two major differences firstly with a stirling engine the air inside is repeatedly heated and cooled with a manson guise engine the manson engine draws in and expels air secondly a manson guise engine is able to have a single connecting rod and counterintuitively the displacer piston and power piston are on the same shaft and move at the same time at the top dead centre and bottom dead centre valves open briefly with the rest of the time the valves being closed both the displacer piston and power piston

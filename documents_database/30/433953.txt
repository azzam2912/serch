the osteostracans were more similar to lampreys than to jawed vertebrates in possessing two pairs of semicircular canals in the inner ear as opposed to the three pairs found in the inner ears of jawed vertebrates they are thought to be the sister group to pituriaspids and together these two taxa of jawless vertebrates are the sister group of gnathostomes several synapomorphies support this hypothesis such as the presence of sclerotic ossicles paired pectoral fins a dermal skeleton with three layers a basal layer of isopedin a middle layer of spongy bone and a superficial layer of dentin and perichondral bone most osteostracans had a massive cephalothorac shield but all middle and late devonian species appear to have had a reduced thinner and often micromeric dermal skeleton this reduction may have occurred at least three times independently because the pattern of reduction is different in each taxon they were probably relatively good swimmers possessing dorsal fins paired pectoral fins and a strong tail the shield of bone covering the head formed a single piece and so presumably did not grow during adult life however the way in which the bone was laid down makes it possible to examine the imprints

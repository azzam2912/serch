if is the entire function defined by means of the reciprocal gamma function then the bessel clifford function is defined by the series the ratio of successive terms is z k n k which for all values of z and n tends to zero with increasing k by the ratio test this series converges absolutely for all z and n and uniformly for all regions with bounded z and hence the bessel clifford function is an entire function of the two complex variables n and z it follows from the above series on differentiating with respect to x that formula 3 satisfies the linear second order homogeneous differential equation this equation is of generalized hypergeometric type and in fact the bessel clifford function is up to a scaling factor a pochhammer barnes hypergeometric function we have unless n is a negative integer in which case the right hand side is undefined the two definitions are essentially equivalent the hypergeometric function being normalized so that its value at z 0 is one the bessel function of the first kind can be defined in terms of the bessel clifford function as when n is not an integer we can see from this

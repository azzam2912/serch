the technique usually involves exsanguination of the target region which forces blood out of the extremity followed by the application of pneumatic tourniquets to safely stop blood flow the anesthetic agent is intravenously introduced into the limb and allowed to diffuse into the surrounding tissue while tourniquets retain the agent within the desired area the use of tourniquets and injected anesthesia to induce localized anesthesia was first introduced by august bier in 1908 he used an esmarch bandage to exsanguinate the arm and injected procaine between two tourniquets to rapidly induce anesthetic and analgesic effects in the site though it proved effective ivra remained relatively unpopular until c mck holmes reintroduced it in 1963 today the technique is common due to its economy rapid recovery reliability and simplicity protocols vary depending on local standard procedures and the extremity being operated on a vast majority of practitioners begin by exsanguinating the limb as bier did with an elastic bandage esmarch bandage squeezing blood proximally toward the heart then pneumatic tourniquets are applied to the limb and inflated 30mmhg above arterial pressure to occlude all blood vessels and then the elastic bandage is removed a high dose of local anesthetic typically lidocaine

they are created out of a bose einstein condensate of atoms that are output coupled using various techniques much like an optical laser an atom laser is a coherent beam that behaves like a wave there has been some argument that the term atom laser is misleading indeed laser stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation which is not particularly related to the physical object called an atom laser and perhaps describes more accurately the bose einstein condensate bec the terminology most widely used in the community today is to distinguish between the bec typically obtained by evaporation in a conservative trap from the atom laser itself which is a propagating atomic wave obtained by extraction from a previously realized bec some ongoing experimental research tries to obtain directly an atom laser from a hot beam of atoms without making a trapped bec first the first pulsed atom laser was demonstrated at mit by professor wolfgang ketterle et al in november 1996 ketterle used an isotope of sodium and used an oscillating magnetic field as their output coupling technique letting gravity pull off partial pieces looking much like a dripping tap see movie in external links from the

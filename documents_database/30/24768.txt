similar to all other amino acids it contains an amino group and a carboxylic acid its amino group is in the protonated nh form under physiological conditions while its carboxylic acid group is deprotonated coo under physiological conditions aspartic acid has an acidic side chain chcooh which reacts with other amino acids enzymes and proteins in the body under physiological conditions ph 7 4 in proteins the side chain usually occurs as the negatively charged aspartate form coo it is a non essential amino acid in humans meaning the body can synthesize it as needed it is encoded by all the codons gau and gac aspartate is one of two amino acids commonly found in mammals in proteins aspartate sidechains are often hydrogen bonded to form asx turns or asx motifs which frequently occur at the n termini of alpha helices the isomer of asp is one of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids i e the building blocks of proteins aspartic acid like glutamic acid is classified as an acidic amino acid with a pk of 3 9 however in a peptide this is highly dependent on the local environment and could be as high as 14 asp is pervasive

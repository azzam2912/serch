retro bolting can be contrasted with re bolting which is the replacement of existing bolts on a climb with new bolts there are many ethical issues relating to retro bolting which can divide climbers into two camps those for and those against new climbing routes are produced by a first ascentionist fa scoping out an unclimbed line deciding to climb a certain section of rock and ultimately climbing it typically this first person then gets to name the climb and give it a grading the route is then generally recorded in a guidebook for posterity the climb is defined by the style that this person did the climb in that is how much protection did they use was it traditional did they use bolts or was there a mix of both climbing ethics dictate that a climber should attempt to complete the climb in the same style as the fa or better this means that they should use the same type of protection without adding any extra bolts retro bolting is the act of adding additional bolts to a climb that the first ascentionist never needed added hence making the route either easier or less dangerous proponents of retro bolting

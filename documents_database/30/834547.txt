it might be due to not getting enough air energy fuel or electric spark fuel starvation a mechanical failure or in response to a sudden increase in engine load this increase in engine load is common in vehicles with a manual transmission when the clutch is released too suddenly the ways in which a car can stall are usually down to the driver especially with a manual transmission for instance if a driver takes their foot off the clutch too quickly while stationary then the car will stall taking the foot off the clutch slowly will stop this from happening stalling also happens when the driver forgets to depress the clutch and or change to neutral while coming to a stop stalling can be dangerous especially in heavy traffic a car fitted with an automatic transmission could also have its engine stalled when the vehicle is travelling in the opposite direction to the selected gear for example if the selector is in the d position and the car is moving backwards on a steep enough hill to overcome the torque from the torque converter the engine will stall due to the fact that the engine is forced to turn in

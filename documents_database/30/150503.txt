the cooling power is provided by the heat of mixing of the helium 3 and helium 4 isotopes the dilution refrigerator was first proposed by heinz london in the early 1950s and was experimentally realized in 1964 in the kamerlingh onnes laboratorium at leiden university the refrigeration process uses a mixture of two isotopes of helium helium 3 and helium 4 when cooled below approximately 870 millikelvins the mixture undergoes spontaneous phase separation to form a he rich phase the concentrated phase and a he poor phase the dilute phase as shown in the phase diagram at very low temperatures the concentrated phase is essentially pure he while the dilute phase contains about 6 6 he and 93 4 he the working fluid is he which is circulated by vacuum pumps at room temperature the he enters the cryostat at a pressure of a few hundred millibar in the classic dilution refrigerator known as a wet dilution refrigerator the he is precooled and purified by liquid nitrogen at 77 k and a he bath at 4 2 k next the he enters a vacuum chamber where it is further cooled to a temperature of 1 2 1 5 k by

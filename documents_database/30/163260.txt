medical grade soda lime includes an indicating dye that changes color when the soda lime reaches its carbon dioxide absorbing capacity to ensure that a soda lime canister co absorber is functioning properly it should not be used if the indicating dye is activated standard anaesthesia machines typically contain up to 2 kg of soda lime granules lithium hydroxide lioh is the alkali hydroxide with the lowest molecular weight 24 g mol li 7 g mol and is therefore used as co absorbent in space flights since the apollo program to spare weight at launch during apollo 13 flight the crew sheltered in the lunar module started suffering from high co levels and had to adapt spare absorbent cartridges from the apollo capsule to the lem system recent generation of co absorbents have been developed to reduce the risk of formation of toxic by products as a result of the interaction between the absorbent and inhaled anesthetics some absorbents made from lithium hydroxide lioh are also available for this purpose exhaled gas must be passed through a carbon dioxide scrubber where the carbon dioxide is absorbed before the gas is made available to be breathed again in rebreathers the scrubber

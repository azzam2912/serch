the primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem these two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally there are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue the vascular cambium and the cork cambium all the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant the cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water minerals and nutrients throughout the plant it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes the individual cells of phloem are connected end to end just as the sections of a pipe might be as the plant grows new vascular tissue differentiates in the growing tips of the plant the new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue maintaining its connection throughout the plant the vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long discrete strands called vascular bundles these bundles include both xylem and phloem as well as supporting and protective cells in stems and roots the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem in the stems of some asterales dicots there may

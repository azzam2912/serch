it aims to describe the distribution of the electric potential in solution in the direction normal to a charged surface this distribution is important to determine how the electrostatic interactions will affect the molecules in solution from the poisson boltzmann equation many other equations have been derived with a number of different assumptions the poisson boltzmann equation describes a model proposed independently by louis george gouy and david leonard chapman in 1910 and 1913 respectively in the gouy chapman model a charged solid comes into contact with an ionic solution creating a layer of surface charges and counter ions or double layer due to thermal motion of ions the layer of counter ions is a diffuse layer and is more extended than a single molecular layer as previously proposed by hermann helmholtz in the helmholtz model the stern layer model goes a step further and takes into account the finite ion size the gouy chapman model explains the capacitance like qualities of the electric double layer a simple planar case with a negatively charged surface can be seen in the figure below as expected the concentration of counter ions is higher near the surface than in the bulk solution the

michael ross and f fahroo the ross fahroo pseudospectral methods are a broad collection of pseudospectral methods for optimal control examples of the ross fahroo pseudospectral methods are the pseudospectral knotting method the flat pseudospectral method the legendre gauss radau pseudospectral method and pseudospectral methods for infinite horizon optimal control the ross fahroo methods are based on shifted gaussian pseudospectral node points the shifts are obtained by means of a linear or nonlinear transformation while the gaussian pseudospectral points are chosen from a collection of gauss lobatto or gauss radau distribution arising from legendre or chebyshev polynomials the gauss lobatto pseudospectral points are used for finite horizon optimal control problems while the gauss radau pseudospectral points are used for infinite horizon optimal control problems the ross fahroo methods are founded on the ross fahroo lemma they can be applied to optimal control problems governed by differential equations differential algebraic equations differential inclusions and differentially flat systems they can also be applied to infinite horizon optimal control problems by a simple domain transformation technique the ross fahroo methods have been implemented in many practical applications and laboratories around the world in 2006 nasa used the ross fahroo method to implement the

data grids make this possible through a host of middleware applications and services that pull together data and resources from multiple administrative domains and then present it to users upon request the data in a data grid can be located at a single site or multiple sites where each site can be its own administrative domain governed by a set of security restrictions as to who may access the data likewise multiple replicas of the data may be distributed throughout the grid outside their original administrative domain and the security restrictions placed on the original data for who may access it must be equally applied to the replicas specifically developed data grid middleware is what handles the integration between users and the data they request by controlling access while making it available as efficiently as possible the adjacent diagram depicts a high level view of a data grid middleware provides all the services and applications necessary for efficient management of datasets and files within the data grid while providing users quick access to the datasets and files there is a number of concepts and tools that must be available to make a data grid operationally viable however at the same

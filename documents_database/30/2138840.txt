with a mass of just under 14 earth masses and a radius approximately 4 3 times that of earth s it is likely something akin to a mini neptune despite the initially strong belief that the planet was not covered in clouds like the gas giants we are familiar with in our solar system the exoplanet s atmosphere was first observed by researchers akihiko fukui norio narita and kenji kuroda at the university of tokyo in 2013 and afterwards fukui commented suppose the atmosphere consists of hydrogen and helium the mass of the atmosphere would be 5 20 of the total mass of the planet comparing that to the fact that the mass of earth s atmosphere is about one ten thousandth of a percent 0 0001 of the total mass of the earth this planet has a considerably thick atmosphere recently in 2015 a team using the las cumbres observatory global telescope lcogt network reported their detection of rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere of this planet in the las cumbres researchers paper published in the astrophysical journal they conclude that the most plausible explanation for the scattering effect to be an atmosphere made predominantly of hydrogen and helium causing

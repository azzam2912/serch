capsules are distinguished from satellites primarily by the ability to survive reentry and return a payload to the earth s surface from orbit capsules make up the majority of crewed spacecraft designs although one crewed spaceplane has launched to orbit current examples of crewed capsules include soyuz shenzhou orion cst 100 and dragon 2 future examples of crewed capsules include federation historic examples of crewed capsules include vostok mercury voskhod gemini and the apollo command module a crewed space capsule must be able to sustain life in the vacuum of space with an often demanding thermal and radiation environment many systems are necessary to accomplish this including a reaction control system an environmental life support system insulation seats that can restrain weightless astronauts communications antennas docking hardware a launch abort system and more space capsules have typically been smaller than in diameter due to launch vehicle aerodynamic requirements the capsule design is both volumetrically efficient and structurally strong so it is typically possible to construct small capsules of performance comparable to lifting body or spaceplane designs in all but lift to drag ratio for less cost the soyuz spacecraft is an example most space capsules have used an ablative heat

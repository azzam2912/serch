it is an isomer of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid although phthalic acid is of modest commercial importance the closely related derivative phthalic anhydride is a commodity chemical produced on a large scale phthalic acid is produced by the catalytic oxidation of naphthalene or ortho xylene directly to phthalic anhydride and a subsequent hydrolysis of the anhydride phthalic acid was first obtained by french chemist auguste laurent in 1836 by oxidizing naphthalene tetrachloride believing the resulting substance to be a naphthalene derivative he named it naphthalic acid after the swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac determined its correct formula laurent gave it its present name manufacturing methods in the nineteenth century included oxidation of naphthalene tetrachloride with nitric acid or better oxidation of the hydrocarbon with fuming sulfuric acid using mercury or mercury ii sulfate as a catalyst naphthalene on oxidation with potassium permanganate or potassium dichromate gives phthalic acid it is a dibasic acid with p k s of 2 89 and 5 51 the monopotassium salt potassium hydrogen phthalate is a standard acid in analytical chemistry typically phthalate esters are prepared from the widely available phthalic anhydride reduction of phthalic acid with sodium amalgam in the presence

this type of control chart is used for characteristics that can be measured on a continuous scale such as weight temperature thickness etc for example one might take a sample of 5 shafts from production every hour measure the diameter of each and then plot for each sample the average of the five diameter values on the chart for the purposes of control limit calculation the sample means are assumed to be normally distributed an assumption justified by the central limit theorem the x bar chart is always used in conjunction with a variation chart such as the formula 1 and r chart or formula 1 and s chart the r chart shows sample ranges difference between the largest and the smallest values in the sample while the s chart shows the samples standard deviation the r chart was preferred in times when calculations were performed manually as the range is far easier to calculate than the standard deviation with the advent of computers ease of calculation ceased to be an issue and the s chart is preferred these days as it is statistically more meaningful and efficient depending on the type of variation chart used the average sample range

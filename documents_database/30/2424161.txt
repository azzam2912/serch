mechanical pulp can also be bleached to increase the brightness but retaining the lignin in the pulp industrial mechanical pulping started in the 1840s with groundwood pulping producing the pulp from grinding this made wood fibers the main raw material in paper instead of textile fibers later the chemical pulping processes started dominating for many paper types today the groundwood pulping mills are few but the mechanical pulping processes employing refiners are still important in the pulp and paper industry the mechanical pulps are primarily used in newspaper and magazine paper and the chemimechanical pulps for cardboard and soft paper mechanical pulp is very different from the pulp produced in the chemical processes the sulfite process and the kraft process the chemical methods gives paper with higher strength and pulp that can be bleached further than the mechanical pulps a benefit from the mechanical processes is that they have a high yield usually between 90 and 98 which means that nearly all the wood is used the yield of the kraft process is only about 50 which makes the demand of wood twice as high for the same amount of produced pulp another benefit of the mechanical pulps is the

artificial pancreatic technology mimics the secretion of these hormones into the bloodstream in response to the body s changing blood glucose levels maintaining balanced blood sugar levels is crucial to the function of the brain liver and kidneys therefore for type 1 patients it is necessary that the levels be kept balanced when the body cannot produce insulin itself the artificial pancreas is a broad term for different bio engineering strategies currently in development to achieve these requirements different bio engineering approaches under consideration include the medical equipment approach involves combining a continuous glucose monitor and an implanted insulin pump that can function together with a computer controlled algorithm to replace the normal function of the pancreas the development of continuous glucose monitors has led to the progress in artificial pancreas technology using this integrated system the original devices for use in type 1 diabetes were blood glucose meters continuous blood glucose monitors are one of the set of devices that make up an artificial pancreas device system the other being an insulin pump and a glucose meter to calibrate the device continuous glucose monitors are a more recent breakthrough and have begun to hit the markets for patient use

the encoding is defined by the unicode standard and was originally designed by ken thompson and rob pike the name is derived from unicode or universal coded character set transformation format 8 bit it was designed for backward compatibility with ascii code points with lower numerical values which tend to occur more frequently are encoded using fewer bytes the first 128 characters of unicode which correspond one to one with ascii are encoded using a single byte with the same binary value as ascii so that valid ascii text is valid utf 8 encoded unicode as well since ascii bytes do not occur when encoding non ascii code points into utf 8 utf 8 is safe to use within most programming and document languages that interpret certain ascii characters in a special way such as slash in filenames backslash in escape sequences and in printf since 2009 utf 8 has been the dominant encoding of any kind not just of unicode encodings for the world wide web and declared mandatory for all things by whatwg and accounts for 94 1 of all web pages some of which are simply ascii as it is a subset of utf 8 and 96

they are transmitted by bat flies which act as an insect vector as well as the parasite s site of sporogeny polychromophilus follows a fairly typical haemospororidian lifecycle with gametocytes and gametes restricted to the bloodstream of the host and meronts infecting organs most notably the lungs and the liver the type species is polychromophilus melanipherus and was described by dionisi in 1898 polychromophilus was first described by dionisi in 1898 who also differentiated between the first two species polychromophilus murinus and polychromophilus melanipherus both of these original species were named after their primary hosts vespertilio murinus and miniopterus schreibersi respectively in 1906 schingareff managed to observe and describe merozoites within macrophages of myotis daubentoni and miniopterus schreibersi and suspected that nycteribiid flies acted as insect vectors this was not evidenced until corradetti discovered sporozoites within such flies in 1936 and was further supported by later research the genus was divided into two subgenera polychromophilus and bioccala but the subgenus bioccala was raised to genus status in 1984 this genus along with haemoproteus and hepatocystis appears to be a sister clade to plasmodium it appears to have evolved from the avian saurian clade of plasmodium polychromophilus sporozoites remain within the

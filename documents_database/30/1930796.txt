circulation evaporation incorporates the use of both heat exchangers and flash separation units in conjunction with circulation of the solvent in order to remove liquid mixtures without conventional boiling there are two types of circulation evaporation natural circulation evaporators and forced circulation evaporators both of which are still currently used in industry today although forced circulation systems which have a circulation pump as opposed to natural systems with no driving force have a much wider range of appropriate uses evaporators are designed with two key objectives is the equipment to be selected best suited for the duty and is the arrangement the most efficient and economical heat transfer greatly affects evaporator design as it represents the greatest cost in its operation the most suitable evaporator will have the highest heat transfer coefficient per dollar of equipment cost in optimising the design of an evaporator another important consideration is the steam economy kg of solvent evaporated per kilogram of steam used the best way to achieve high economies which can be well over 100 is to use multiple effect evaporator whereby the vapour from one evaporator or effect is used to heat the feed in the next effect where boiling occurs

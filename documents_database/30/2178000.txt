the technology is based on aerobic granulation and is a modification of the activated sludge process aerobic granular sludge can be formed by applying specific process conditions that favour slow growing organisms such as paos polyphosphate accumulating organisms and gaos glycogen accumulating organisms another key part of granulation is selective washing whereby slow settling floc like sludge is discharged as waste sludge and faster settling biomass is retained at the full scale the nereda system consists of a cyclical process with three main cycle components or phases namely simultaneous fill and draw aeration reaction and settling the aerobic granules form excellent settling properties allowing for higher biomass concentrations 8g l the non use of secondary clarifiers and the exclusion of major sludge recycle pumping in the nereda system the result is a compact reduced plant footprints simple system that requires significantly less chemicals and energy when compared to conventional activated sludge cas systems the theory of this technology has proven to work in the field and currently about 30 wastewater treatment plants worldwide are operational under construction or under design varying in size from 5 000 up to 858 000 person equivalent the nereda technology is an invention of the

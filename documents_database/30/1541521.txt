it is usually non metallic and can be of different nature depending on its source inclusions can create problems in the casting when they are large and in too high concentration here are examples of problems related to inclusions in contact with ambient air liquid aluminium reacts with the oxygen and form an oxide film layer gamma alo this layer becomes thicker with time when molten aluminium is disturbed this oxide film gets mixed inside the melt in primary aluminium production aluminium carbides alc originates from the reduction of alumina where carbon anodes and cathodes are in contact with the mix later in the process any carbon tools in contact with the liquid aluminium can react and create carbides in aluminium alloys containing magnesium magnesium oxides mgo cuboids mgalo cuboid and metallurgical spinel mgal2o4 spinel can form they result from the reaction between magnesium and oxygen in the melt more of them will form with time and temperature spinel can be highly detrimental because of its big size and high hardness particles of refractory material in contact with aluminium can detach and become inclusions we can find graphite inclusions c alumina inclusions alpha alo cao sio after some time graphite

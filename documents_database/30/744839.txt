the homotopy must be a 1 parameter family of immersions similar to homotopy classes one defines two immersions to be in the same regular homotopy class if there exists a regular homotopy between them regular homotopy for immersions is similar to isotopy of embeddings they are both restricted types of homotopies stated another way two continuous functions formula 1 are homotopic if they represent points in the same path components of the mapping space formula 2 given the compact open topology the space of immersions is the subspace of formula 2 consisting of immersions denote it by formula 4 two immersions formula 5 are regularly homotopic if they represent points in the same path component of formula 4 the whitney graustein theorem classifies the regular homotopy classes of a circle into the plane two immersions are regularly homotopic if and only if they have the same turning number equivalently total curvature equivalently if and only if their gauss maps have the same degree winding number stephen smale classified the regular homotopy classes of a k sphere immersed in formula 7 they are classified by homotopy groups of stiefel manifolds which is a generalization of the gauss map with here k

he was awarded the 1983 nobel prize for physics with william a fowler for theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars his mathematical treatment of stellar evolution yielded many of the current theoretical models of the later evolutionary stages of massive stars and black holes the chandrasekhar limit is named after him chandrasekhar worked on a wide variety of physical problems in his lifetime contributing to the contemporary understanding of stellar structure white dwarfs stellar dynamics stochastic process radiative transfer the quantum theory of the hydrogen anion hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability turbulence equilibrium and the stability of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium general relativity mathematical theory of black holes and theory of colliding gravitational waves at the university of cambridge he developed a theoretical model explaining the structure of white dwarf stars that took into account the relativistic variation of mass with the velocities of electrons that comprise their degenerate matter he showed that the mass of a white dwarf could not exceed 1 44 times that of the sun the chandrasekhar limit chandrasekhar revised the models of stellar dynamics first outlined by jan oort and others by considering the effects of

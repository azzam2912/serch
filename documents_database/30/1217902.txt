at the time the design work on the aircraft was started the standard class was new and described a very simple aircraft with terminal velocity dive brakes fixed landing gear and no water ballast by the time the 1 34 had flown in 1969 the standard class rules had changed to allow essentially unrestricted sailplanes with a 15 metre 49 2 feet wingspan the sgs 1 34 is of all metal aluminum semi monocoque construction all surfaces are aluminum covered with the exception of the rudder which is covered in aircraft fabric the 1 34 has the originally specified terminal velocity dive brakes that limit the glider to below redline speeds in a vertical dive developing and testing these proved expensive and time consuming and this also extended the aircraft s development time the 1 34 was the first schweizer design to depart from using a naca airfoil the 1 34 has no wing washout and instead uses a wortmann fx 61 163 airfoil at the wing root transitioning to a wortmann fx 61 126 airfoil at the wing tip the tip airfoil stalls at a higher angle of attack ensuring that the wing root stalls first the one company

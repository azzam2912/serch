the adjective gravitational is derived from the symmetry of a gravitational theory namely from general covariance a gravitational anomaly is generally synonymous with diffeomorphism anomaly since general covariance is symmetry under coordinate reparametrization i e diffeomorphism general covariance is the basis of general relativity the classical theory of gravitation moreover it is necessary for the consistency of any theory of quantum gravity since it is required in order to cancel unphysical degrees of freedom with a negative norm namely gravitons polarized along the time direction therefore all gravitational anomalies must cancel out the anomaly usually appears as a feynman diagram with a chiral fermion running in the loop a polygon with n external gravitons attached to the loop where formula 1 where formula 2 is the spacetime dimension consider a classical gravitational field represented by the vielbein formula 3 and a quantized fermi field formula 4 the generating functional for this quantum field is formula 5 where formula 6 is the quantum action and the formula 7 factor before the lagrangian is the vielbein determinant the variation of the quantum action renders formula 8 in which we denote a mean value with respect to the path integral by the bracket

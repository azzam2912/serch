by one of several methods an air compressor forces more and more air into a storage tank increasing the pressure when tank pressure reaches its engineered upper limit the air compressor shuts off the compressed air then is held in the tank until called into use the energy contained in the compressed air can be used for a variety of applications utilizing the kinetic energy of the air as it is released and the tank depressurizes when tank pressure reaches its lower limit the air compressor turns on again and re pressurizes the tank an air compressor must be differentiated from a pump because it works for any gas air while pumps work on a liquid compressors can be classified according to the pressure delivered they can also be classified according to the design and principle of operation there are numerous methods of air compression divided into either positive displacement or roto dynamic types positive displacement compressors work by forcing air in a chamber whose volume is decreased to compress the air once the maximum pressure is reached a port or valve opens and air is discharged into the outlet system from the compression chamber common types of positive displacement

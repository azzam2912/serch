this process of subdividing gives rise to a representation of objects within the space in the form of a tree data structure known as a bsp tree binary space partitioning was developed in the context of 3d computer graphics in 1969 where the structure of a bsp tree allows for spatial information about the objects in a scene that is useful in rendering such as objects being ordered from front to back with respect to a viewer at a given location to be accessed rapidly other applications of bsp include performing geometrical operations with shapes constructive solid geometry in cad collision detection in robotics and 3d video games ray tracing and other applications that involve the handling of complex spatial scenes in 1993 doom was the first video game to make use of bsp after john carmack utilized the most efficient 1991 algorithms describing front to back rendering with the use of a specialized data structure to record parts of the screen that had been drawn already prior to that wolfenstein 3d had made use of ray casting quake utilized developments in 1992 regarding a pre processing step that generated potentially visible sets binary space partitioning is a generic process

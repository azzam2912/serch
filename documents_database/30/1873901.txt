the law accounts for the approximate color constancy in the human visual system it is the oldest and most widely used law to quantify color adaptation and is used widely in the field of vision and chromatic adaptation the von kries coefficient law compensates for the illumination change using a purely diagonal scaling of the cone absorptions while the law does not provide a precise indication of the correction it typically provides a reasonable approximation the von kries coefficient law built upon theories and research done by hermann von helmholtz a german physicist and physician helmholtz asserted that the nervous substance in question is less sensitive to reacting light falling on it than the rest of the retina that was not previously stimulated helmholtz along with thomas young proposed the trichromatic theory or the young helmholtz theory that stated that the retina contains three types of cones which respond to light of three different wavelengths corresponding to red green or blue activation of these cones in different combinations and to different degrees results in the perception of other colors while von kries and the other researchers did not have the means to test out the results of his stated law

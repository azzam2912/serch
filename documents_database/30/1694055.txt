part of the auditory brainstem response abr the ffr reflects sustained neural activity integrated over a population of neural elements the brainstem response can be divided into transient and sustained portions namely the onset response and the frequency following response ffr it is often phase locked to the individual cycles of the stimulus waveform and or the envelope of the periodic stimuli it has not been well studied with respect to its clinical utility although it can be used as part of a test battery for helping to diagnose auditory neuropathy this may be in conjunction with or as a replacement for otoacoustic emissions in 1930 wever and bray discovered a potential called the wever bray effect they originally believed that the potential originated from the cochlear nerve but it was later discovered that the response is non neural and is cochlear in origin specifically from the outer hair cells this phenomenon came to be known as the cochlear microphonic cm the ffr may have been accidentally discovered back in 1930 however renewed interest in defining the ffr did not occur until the mid 1960s while several researchers raced to publish the first detailed account of the ffr the term

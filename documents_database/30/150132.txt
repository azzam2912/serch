for proteins a sequence motif is distinguished from a structural motif a motif formed by the three dimensional arrangement of amino acids which may not be adjacent an example is the n glycosylation site motif where the three letter abbreviations are the conventional designations for amino acids see genetic code when a sequence motif appears in the exon of a gene it may encode the structural motif of a protein that is a stereotypical element of the overall structure of the protein nevertheless motifs need not be associated with a distinctive secondary structure noncoding sequences are not translated into proteins and nucleic acids with such motifs need not deviate from the typical shape e g the b form dna double helix outside of gene exons there exist regulatory sequence motifs and motifs within the junk such as satellite dna some of these are believed to affect the shape of nucleic acids see for example rna self splicing but this is only sometimes the case for example many dna binding proteins that have affinity for specific dna binding sites bind dna in only its double helical form they are able to recognize motifs through contact with the double helix s major

it merges at the nano scale into nanoelectromechanical systems nems and nanotechnology mems are also referred to as micromachines in japan or micro systems technology mst in europe mems are made up of components between 1 and 100 micrometers in size i e 0 001 to 0 1 mm and mems devices generally range in size from 20 micrometres to a millimetre i e 0 02 to 1 0 mm although components arranged in arrays e g digital micromirror devices can be more than 1000 mm they usually consist of a central unit that processes data an integrated circuit chip such as microprocessor and several components that interact with the surroundings such as microsensors because of the large surface area to volume ratio of mems forces produced by ambient electromagnetism e g electrostatic charges and magnetic moments and fluid dynamics e g surface tension and viscosity are more important design considerations than with larger scale mechanical devices mems technology is distinguished from molecular nanotechnology or molecular electronics in that the latter must also consider surface chemistry the potential of very small machines was appreciated before the technology existed that could make them see for example richard feynman s famous 1959

it is the uppermost of the three formations found in the stormberg group of the greater karoo supergroup rocks and represents the final phase of preserved sedimentation of the karoo basin the clarens formation is composed nearly entirely of fine to medium grained thickly bedded sandstones that range from pale orange or pinkish to cream in color it is characterized by its remarkable gross lithological uniformity and that its deposits mainly outcrop as high cliffs these clarens formation cliffs frequently contain shallow caves and overhangs at the contact of the underlying upper elliot formation uef due to processes of erosion this particular feature of the clarens formation lead to the initial naming of these rocks the cave sandstone in older literature it is thought that the geographical range of the clarens formation was much greater millions of years ago covering most of southern africa in a vast sand dune environment which stretched out from the main karoo basin westwards into namibia and into zimbabwe in the northeast there has been very little recent research undertaken on clarens formation but overall due to the dominant nature of the sandstones the clarens formation is considered to have been deposited in an arid

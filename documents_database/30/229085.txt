it can be prepared by slowly adding excess bromine to a hot solution of phenolsulfonphthalein in glacial acetic acid as an acid base indicator its useful range lies between ph 3 0 and 4 6 it changes from yellow at ph 3 0 to blue at ph 4 6 this reaction is reversible bromophenol blue is structurally related to phenolphthalein a popular indicator bromophenol is also used as a color marker to monitor the process of agarose gel electrophoresis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis since bromophenol blue carries a slight negative charge at moderate ph it will migrate in the same direction as dna or protein in a gel the rate at which it migrates varies according to gel density and buffer composition but in a typical 1 agarose gel in a 1x tae buffer or tbe buffer bromophenol blue migrates at the same rate as a dna fragment of about 300 base pairs in 2 agarose as 150 bp xylene cyanol and orange g may also be used for this purpose bromophenol blue is also used as a dye at neutral ph the dye absorbs red light most strongly and transmits blue light solutions of the dye therefore are blue

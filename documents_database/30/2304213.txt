chemically it is a form of prussian blue although several chemical industry processes could produce it it is particularly associated with coal gasification and older town gasworks it has been recognised as a problem effluent and land contaminant since the early industrial period and the first gasworks at the start of the 19th century as a visible proof of contamination blue billy is an important signifier in contaminated land remediation projects and its discovery especially if undisclosed may be a cause of contract disputes as one of a range of ferric ferrocyanides blue billy is a compound of iron carbon and nitrogen processes producing ammonia or cyanides in the presence of iron may give rise to it most commonly it is found around old gasworks part of the gas production process producing town gas by the gasification of coal involves a liquid bubbler scrubber to remove ammonia compounds including ammonium cyanide compounds from the raw gas if left untreated these could cause corrosion in gas pipework a further process to make the gas less toxic by removing hydrogen sulphide and hydrogen cyanide the purifier passed the gas over trays of ferric oxide as bog iron ore similar to red rust

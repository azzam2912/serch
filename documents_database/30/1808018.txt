g mckendrick and w o kermack published their theory in a set of three articles from 1927 1932 and 1933 while kermack mckendrick theory was indeed the source of sir models and their relatives kermack and mckendrick were thinking of a more subtle and empirically useful problem than the simple compartmental models discussed here the text is somewhat difficult to read compared to modern papers but the important feature is it was a model where the age of infection affected the transmission and removal rates because of their seminal importance to the field of theoretical epidemiology these articles were republished in the bulletin of mathematical biology in 1991 in its initial form kermack mckendrick theory is a compartmental differential equation model that structures the infectioned population in terms of age of infection while using simple compartments for people who are susceptible s and recovered removed r specified initial conditions would change over time according to where formula 4 is a dirac delta function and the infection pressure only in the special case when the removal rate formula 6 and the transmission rate formula 7 are constant for all ages does the substitution formula 8 transform their theory into the simple

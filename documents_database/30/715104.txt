it can be composed of 4 different amino acid sequences giving tyrocidine a d see figure 1 tyrocidine is the major constituent of tyrothricin which also contains gramicidin tyrocidine was the first commercially available antibiotic but has been found to be toxic toward human blood and reproductive cells the function of tyrocidine within its host b brevis is thought to be regulation of sporulation tyrocidines a b and c are cyclic decapeptides the biosynthesis of tyrocidine involves three enzymes parts of its sequence are identical to gramicidin s in 1939 the american microbiologist ren dubos discovered the soil microbe bacillus brevis he observed the ability of the microbe to decompose the capsule of pneumococcus bacterium rendering it harmless from the soil microbe b brevis he isolated tyrothricin which had a high toxicity to a large range of bacteria tyrothricin was later found to be a mixture of the peptides gramicidin and tyrocidine these were observed to have toxic effects in red blood cells and reproductive cells in humans however if applied externally as an ointment tyrocidine could also be used as a potent antimicrobial agent dubos s discovery helped revive interest in research on penicillin tyrocidine has a unique mode

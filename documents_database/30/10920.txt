usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms for find or find and replace operations on strings or for input validation it is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory the concept arose in the 1950s when the american mathematician stephen cole kleene formalized the description of a regular language the concept came into common use with unix text processing utilities different syntaxes for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s one being the posix standard and another widely used being the perl syntax regular expressions are used in search engines search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors in text processing utilities such as sed and awk and in lexical analysis many programming languages provide regex capabilities either built in or via libraries the phrase regular expressions and consequently regexes is often used to mean the specific standard textual syntax distinct from the mathematical notation described below for representing patterns for matching text each character in a regular expression that is each character in the string describing its pattern is either a metacharacter having a special meaning or a regular character that has a literal meaning for example in the regex

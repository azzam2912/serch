for example a grocery store might enter into a contract with the farmer who grows oranges under which the farmer would supply the grocery store with as many oranges as the store could sell the farmer could sue for breach of contract if the store were thereafter to purchase oranges for this purpose from any other party the converse of this situation is an output contract in which one buyer agrees to purchase however much of a good or service the seller is able to produce several problems typically arise with requirements contracts the first is consideration there would technically be no breach of the contract if the buyer bought nothing because the buyer is agreeing to buy only as much as the buyer needs in the above example the grocery store might void its obligation to buy from the farmer by deciding not to carry oranges courts generally sidestep the concern that the buyer is not actually required to buy anything by noting that the contract is nonetheless the surrender of the right to buy from another party put simply t he buyer under a requirements contract does not promise to buy as much as she desires to buy

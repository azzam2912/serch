it models a black hole as a thin classically radiating surface or membrane at or vanishingly close to the black hole s event horizon this approach to the theory of black holes was created by kip s thorne r h price and d a macdonald thorne 1994 relates that this approach to studying black holes was prompted by the realisation by hanni ruffini wald and cohen in the early 1970s that since an electrically charged pellet dropped into a black hole should still appear to a distant outsider to be remaining just outside the event horizon if its image persists its electrical fieldlines ought to persist too and ought to point to the location of the frozen image 1994 pp 406 if the black hole rotates and the image of the pellet is pulled around the associated electrical fieldlines ought to be pulled around with it to create basic electrical dynamo effects see dynamo theory further calculations yielded properties for a black hole such as apparent electrical resistance pp 408 since these fieldline properties seemed to be exhibited down to the event horizon and general relativity insisted that no dynamic exterior interactions could extend through the horizon it was considered

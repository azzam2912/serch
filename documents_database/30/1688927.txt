one can derive an electric radiation reaction force for an accelerating charged particle caused by the particle emitting electromagnetic radiation likewise a magnetic radiation reaction force can be derived for an accelerating magnetic moment emitting electromagnetic radiation similar to the electric radiation reaction force three conditions must be met in order to derive the following formula for the magnetic radiation reaction force first the motion of the magnetic moment must be periodic an assumption used to derive the force second the magnetic moment is traveling at non relativistic velocities that is much slower than the speed of light finally this only applies to the realm of classical physics since the magnetic moment is proportional to velocity this force is proportional to the fifth derivative of the position as a function of time sometimes somewhat facetiously referred to as the crackle unlike the abraham lorentz force the force points in the direction opposite of the crackle mathematically the magnetic radiation reaction force is given by where note that this formula applies only for non relativistic velocities physically a time changing magnetic moment emits radiation similar to the larmor formula of an accelerating charge since momentum is conserved the magnetic moment is

it is also known as the double commutant or second commutant and is written formula 1 the bicommutant is particularly useful in operator theory due to the von neumann double commutant theorem which relates the algebraic and analytic structures of operator algebras specifically it shows that if m is a unital self adjoint operator algebra in the c algebra b h for some hilbert space h then the weak closure strong closure and bicommutant of m are equal this tells us that a unital c subalgebra m of b h is a von neumann algebra if and only if formula 2 and that if not the von neumann algebra it generates is formula 3 the bicommutant of s always contains s so formula 4 on the other hand formula 5 so formula 6 i e the commutant of the bicommutant of s is equal to the commutant of s by induction we have and for n 1 it is clear that if s and s are subsets of a semigroup if it is assumed that formula 10 and formula 11 this is the case for instance for von neumann algebras then the above equality gives

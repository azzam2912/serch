biomolecular engineers integrate knowledge of biological processes with the core knowledge of chemical engineering in order to focus on molecular level solutions to issues and problems in the life sciences related to the environment agriculture energy industry food production biotechnology and medicine biomolecular engineers purposefully manipulate carbohydrates proteins nucleic acids and lipids within the framework of the relation between their structure see nucleic acid structure carbohydrate chemistry protein structure function see protein function and properties and in relation to applicability to such areas as environmental remediation crop and livestock production biofuel cells and biomolecular diagnostics the thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular recognition in enzymes antibodies dna hybridization bio conjugation bio immobilization and bioseparations are studied attention is also given to the rudiments of engineered biomolecules in cell signaling cell growth kinetics biochemical pathway engineering and bioreactor engineering during world war ii the need for large quantities of penicillin of acceptable quality brought together chemical engineers and microbiologists to focus on penicillin production this created the right conditions to start a chain of reactions that lead to the creation of the field of biomolecular engineering biomolecular engineering was first defined in 1992 by the u s national institutes of health as

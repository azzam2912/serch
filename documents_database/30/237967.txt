to maintain a clear distinction between attested and reconstructed forms comparative linguists prefix an asterisk to any form that is not found in surviving texts a number of methods for carrying out language classification have been developed ranging from simple inspection to computerised hypothesis testing such methods have gone through a long process of development the fundamental technique of comparative linguistics is to compare phonological systems morphological systems syntax and the lexicon of two or more languages using techniques such as the comparative method in principle every difference between two related languages should be explicable to a high degree of plausibility and systematic changes for example in phonological or morphological systems are expected to be highly regular i e consistent in practice the comparison may be more restricted e g just to the lexicon in some methods it may be possible to reconstruct an earlier proto language although the proto languages reconstructed by the comparative method are hypothetical a reconstruction may have predictive power the most notable example of this is saussure s proposal that the indo european consonant system contained laryngeals a type of consonant attested in no indo european language known at the time the hypothesis was vindicated

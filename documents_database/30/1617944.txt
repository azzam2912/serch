internationally he is best known for his scientific biography of christiaan huygens andriesse studied applied physics at delft university of technology where he specialized in radiation physics in 1969 he received his phd degree from the same university with a thesis on the scattering of neutrons in gaseous argon 36 after that he initiated a research project on the force between noble gas atoms he then worked at the kapteyn observatory in roden part of the university of groningen in 1978 he was the first to calculate the radiation of interstellar dust with a fluctuating temperature only after the turn of the century infrared observations from space showed the calculated spectrum to be characteristic of all galaxies in 1979 andriesse came up with a theory for the mass loss of stars there are two classic explanations for the mass loss of stars by stellar winds for stars of high luminosity radiation pressure is the driving force for fainter stars like the sun the stellar wind is driven by mechanical effects such as shock waves or magnetic fields to what level a stellar wind swells depends on accidental features of the mechanism the strength of the wind is not easily related

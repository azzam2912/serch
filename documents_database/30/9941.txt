the intensity of each pixel is variable in color imaging systems a color is typically represented by three or four component intensities such as red green and blue or cyan magenta yellow and black in some contexts such as descriptions of camera sensors pixel refers to a single scalar element of a multi component representation called a photosite in the camera sensor context although sensel is sometimes used while in yet other contexts it may refer to the set of component intensities for a spatial position the word pixel is a portmanteau of pix from pictures shortened to pics and el for element similar formations with el include the words voxel and texel the word pixel was first published in 1965 by frederic c billingsley of jpl to describe the picture elements of video images from space probes to the moon and mars billingsley had learned the word from keith e mcfarland at the link division of general precision in palo alto who in turn said he did not know where it originated mcfarland said simply it was in use at the time circa 1963 the word is a combination of pix for picture and element the word pix appeared

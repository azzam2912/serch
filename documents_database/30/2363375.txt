powders are particulate discrete solid particles of size ranging from nanometres to millimetres that generally flow freely when shaken or tilted the bulk powder properties are the combined effect of particle properties by the conversion of food products in solid state into powdery form for ease of use processing and keeping quality various terms are used to indicate the particulate solids in bulk such as powder granules flour and dust though all these materials can be treated under powder category these common terminologies are based on the size or the source of the materials the particle size distribution shape and surface characteristics and the density of the powders are highly variable and depend on both the characteristics of the raw materials and processing conditions during their formations these parameters contribute to the functional properties of powders including flowability packaging density ease of handling dust forming mixing compressibility and surface activity food powder may be amorphous or crystalline in their molecular level structure depending on the process applied the powders can be produced in either of these forms powders in crystalline state possess defined molecular alignment in the long range order while amorphous state is disordered more open and porous common

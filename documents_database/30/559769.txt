in particular in gauge theory with formula 1 extended supersymmetry the moduli space of vacua is a special k hler manifold and its k hler potential is constrained by above conditions in the original derivation by nathan seiberg and edward witten they extensively used holomorphy and electric magnetic duality to constrain the prepotential namely the metric of the moduli space of vacua consider the example with gauge group su n the classical potential is this must vanish on the moduli space so vacuum expectation value of can be gauge rotated into cartan subalgebra so it is a traceless diagonal complex matrix because the fields formula 3 no longer have vanishing vacuum expectation value because these are now heavy due to the higgs effect they should be integrated out in order to find the effective formula 1 abelian gauge theory this can be expressed in terms of a single holomorphic function f in terms of this prepotential the lagrangian can be written in the form the first term is a perturbative loop calculation and the second is the instanton part where k labels fixed instanton numbers from this we can get the mass of the bps particles one way to interpret

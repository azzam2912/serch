adjacent phytochoria do not usually have a sharp boundary but rather a soft one a transitional area in which many species from both regions overlap the region of overlap is called a vegetation tension zone in traditional schemes areas in phytogeography are classified hierarchically according to the presence of endemic families genera or species e g in floral or floristic phytogeographic zones and regions or also in kingdoms regions and provinces sometimes including the categories empire and domain however some authors prefer not to rank areas referring to them simply as areas regions in a non hierarchical sense or phytochoria systems used to classify vegetation can be divided in two major groups those that use physiognomic environmental parameters and characteristics and those that are based on floristic i e shared genera and species relationships phytochoria are defined by their plant taxonomic composition while other schemes of regionalization e g vegetation type physiognomy plant formations biomes may variably take in account depending on the author the apparent characteristics of a community the dominant life form environment characteristics the fauna associated anthropic factors or political conservationist issues several systems of classifying geographic areas where plants grow have been devised most systems are

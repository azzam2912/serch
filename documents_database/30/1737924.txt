the fifth falconsat spacecraft to be launched it carries four technology development and ionospheric research experiments the satellite was constructed and is operated by the united states air force academy usa 221 is a spacecraft measuring by by it operates in a low earth orbit with an apogee of a perigee of and 72 degrees of orbital inclination the space plasma characterization source spcs studies how a cold gas ammonia thruster and a hall effect thruster behave in space and how they affect the spacecraft s surroundings meanwhile the wafer integrated spectrometer wispers will observe the plume generated by the hall thruster allowing a comparison to be made to theoretical data the other two experiments will study the earth s ionosphere smartmesa the smart miniaturized electrostatic analyzer was designed to record the ion density of the ionosphere as well as the temperature to allow a study of how temperature affects ion density it is a reflight of the original smartmesa mission which was lost when falconsat 2 failed to achieve orbit the receiver uhf vhf signal strength or russ experiment is intended to receive radio signals in the uhf and vhf bands to determine the levels and effects of ionospheric

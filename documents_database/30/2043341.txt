it has been investigated in animals as a potential treatment for cocaine dependence the ec values of 5 chloro mt in evoking the in vitro release of serotonin 5 ht dopamine da and norepinephrine ne in rat synaptosomes were reported as 16 nm 54 nm and 3434 nm with an ne da ratio of 63 6 and a da 5 ht ratio of 3 38 indicating that it is a highly specific and well balanced sdra however 5 chloro mt has also been found to act as a potent full agonist of the 5 ht receptor with an ec value of 6 27 nm and an efficacy of 105 and almost assuredly acts as a potent agonist of other serotonin receptors as well 5 chloro mt was found to not reliably produce intracranial self administration in rats or substitute for cocaine in rats or monkeys it was found through study of 5 chloro mt in rhesus monkeys that norepinephrine release has minimal influence on the abuse potential of monoamine releasing agents and that loss of norepinephrine release activity does not affect efficacy in reducing cocaine self administration in sdras relative to serotonin norepinephrine dopamine releasing agents sndras such as naphthylisopropylamine

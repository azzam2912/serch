the story focuses on eurydice s choice to return to earth with orpheus or to stay in the underworld with her father a character created by ruhl ruhl made several changes to the original myth s story line the most noticeable of these changes was that in the myth orpheus succumbs to his desires and looks back at eurydice while in ruhl s version eurydice calls out to orpheus causing him to look back perhaps in part because of her fear of reentering the world of the living and perhaps as a result of her desire to remain in the land of the dead with her father ruhl s script has been explicitly written so as to be a playground for the designer of the sets the play had its world premiere at madison repertory theatre madison wisconsin on september 2003 the play next was produced at berkeley repertory theatre california in october to november 14 2004 directed by les waters associate artistic director the cast featured maria dizzia as eurydice and daniel talbott as orpheus it next was presented at yale repertory theatre new haven connecticut in september 2006 to october 14 directed by les waters with maria dizzia

it was developed in the 1930s by melvin mooney for a specific temperature scorch time describes how long it will take the material to vulcanize for example a scorch time at ambient temperature indicates the rubber will be able to remain unvulcanized at room temperature for an extended period of time the mooney machine itself consists of a cylindrical serrated metal disk designed to hold a material sample without slippage during rotation this disk is surrounded by a die chamber where the rubber is pressed with 2500 pounds of force the rubber is then warmed for two minutes next the serrated disk is rotated in one direction only at a speed of 2 revolutions per minute while the torque required to rotate the disk is recorded the torque decrease per time can be directly related to viscosity as the material further warms during initial rotation of the serrated disk and the rubber begins to shear the viscosity lowers and torque required decreases eventually the torque will reach an inflection point where the rubber begins to vulcanize and torque begins increasing a shear pin on the machine prevents damage as the testing material stiffens comparing the torque versus time curves for

this is considered as one of the simplest unsteady problem that have exact solution for the navier stokes equations the impulse movement of semi infinite plate was studied by keith stewartson consider an infinitely long plate which suddenly made to move with constant velocity formula 1 in the formula 2 direction which is located at formula 3 in an infinite domain of fluid which is at rest initially everywhere the incompressible navier stokes equations reduce to where formula 5 is the kinematic viscosity the initial and the no slip condition on the wall are the last condition is due to the fact that the motion at formula 3 is not felt at infinity the flow is only due to the motion of the plate there is no imposed pressure gradient the problem on the whole is similar to the one dimensional heat conduction problem hence a self similar variable can be introduced substituting this the partial differential equation reduces it to ordinary differential equation with boundary conditions the solution to the above problem can be written in terms of complementary error function the force per unit area exerted on the plate is instead of using a step boundary condition for

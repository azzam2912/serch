in plants they are referred to as metamers or more concretely phytomers in animals zoologists define metamery as a mesodermal event resulting in serial repetition of unit subdivisions of ectoderm and mesoderm products endoderm is not involved in metamery segmentation is not the same concept as metamerism segmentation can be confined only to ectodermally derived tissue e g in the cestoda tapeworms metamerism is far more important biologically since it results in metameres also called somites that play a critical role in advanced locomotion one can divide metamerism into two main categories in addition an animal may be classified as pseudometameric meaning that it has clear internal metamerism but no corresponding external metamerism as is seen for example in monoplacophora humans and other chordates are conspicuous examples of organisms that have metameres intimately grouped into tagmata in the chordata the metameres of each tagma are fused to such an extent that few repetitive features are directly visible intensive investigation is necessary to discern the metamerism in the tagmata of such organisms examples of detectable evidence of vestigially metameric structures include branchial arches and cranial nerves some schemes regard the concept of metamerism as one of the four principles of construction

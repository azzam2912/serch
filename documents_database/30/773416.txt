for example a short circuit is a fault in which current bypasses the normal load an open circuit fault occurs if a circuit is interrupted by some failure in three phase systems a fault may involve one or more phases and ground or may occur only between phases in a ground fault or earth fault current flows into the earth the prospective short circuit current of a predictable fault can be calculated for most situations in power systems protective devices can detect fault conditions and operate circuit breakers and other devices to limit the loss of service due to a failure in a polyphase system a fault may affect all phases equally which is a symmetrical fault if only some phases are affected the resulting asymmetrical fault becomes more complicated to analyse the analysis of these types of faults is often simplified by using methods such as symmetrical components the design of systems to detect and interrupt power system faults is the main objective of power system protection a transient fault is a fault that is no longer present if power is disconnected for a short time and then restored or an insulation fault which only temporarily affects a device

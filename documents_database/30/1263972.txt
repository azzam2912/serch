by convention these applied methods are beyond simple geometry such as differential and integral calculus difference and differential equations matrix algebra mathematical programming and other computational methods proponents of this approach claim that it allows the formulation of theoretical relationships with rigor generality and simplicity mathematics allows economists to form meaningful testable propositions about wide ranging and complex subjects which could less easily be expressed informally further the language of mathematics allows economists to make specific positive claims about controversial or contentious subjects that would be impossible without mathematics much of economic theory is currently presented in terms of mathematical economic models a set of stylized and simplified mathematical relationships asserted to clarify assumptions and implications broad applications include formal economic modeling began in the 19th century with the use of differential calculus to represent and explain economic behavior such as utility maximization an early economic application of mathematical optimization economics became more mathematical as a discipline throughout the first half of the 20th century but introduction of new and generalized techniques in the period around the second world war as in game theory would greatly broaden the use of mathematical formulations in economics this rapid systematizing of economics alarmed

the most obvious is in polar regions where the force exerted on the needle of a magnetic compass is nearly vertical and gyrocompasses become unstable due to the rotation of the earth magnetic compasses are also susceptible to disruption from magnetic fields other than the earth s such as those produced by the hulls of some metal vehicles or craft before the advent of electronic navigational aids such as gps the most reliable way to ascertain north in such circumstances was through the use of an astrocompass the earth s axis of rotation remains for all intents and purposes stationary throughout the year thus with knowledge of the current time and geographical position in the form of latitude and longitude which are set on the instrument using dials an astrocompass can be sighted on to any astronomical object with a known position to give an extremely accurate reading in its most basic form the astrocompass consists of a base plate marked with the points of the compass with a mechanism known as an equatorial drum mounted on it on this drum is a set of adjustable sights and a scale of declination more advanced versions may have built in chronometers

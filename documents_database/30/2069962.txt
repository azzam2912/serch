the combination of helium s extremely low molecular weight and weak interatomic reactions yield interesting properties when helium is cooled below its critical temperature of 5 2 k to form a liquid even at absolute zero 0k helium does not condense to form a solid in this state the zero point vibrational energies of helium are comparable to very weak interatomic binding interactions thus preventing lattice formation and giving helium its fluid characteristics within this liquid state helium has two phases referred to as helium i and helium ii helium i displays thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of classical fluids along with quantum characteristics however below its lambda point of 2 17 k helium transitions to he ii and becomes a quantum superfluid with zero viscosity under extreme conditions such as when cooled beyond t helium has the ability to form a new state of matter known as a bose einstein condensate bec in which the atoms virtually lose all their energy without energy to transfer between molecules the atoms begin to aggregate creating an area of equivalent density and energy from observations liquid helium only exhibits super fluidity because it contains isolated islands of becs which have well defined magnitude

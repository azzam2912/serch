this geometry makes the motion of the cones remain coaxial with no sliding motion between the raceways and the od of the rollers this conical geometry creates a linear contact patch which permits greater loads to be carried than with spherical ball bearings which have point contact the geometry means that the tangential speeds of the surfaces of each of the rollers are the same as their raceways along the whole length of the contact patch and no differential scrubbing occurs the rollers are stabilized and restrained by a flange on the inner ring against which their large end slides which stops the rollers from popping out due to the pumpkin seed effect of their conical shape the larger the half angles of these cones the larger the axial force that the bearing can sustain tapered roller bearings are separable into a cone assembly and a cup the non separable cone assembly consists of the inner ring the rollers and a cage that retains evenly spaces the rollers the cup is simply the outer ring internal clearance is established during mounting by the axial position of the cone relative to the cup although preloaded installations without clearance are common metric

this family encodes type ii membrane bound glycoproteins with diverse enzymatic functions using different donor substrates udp galactose and udp n acetylglucosamine and different acceptor sugars n acetylglucosamine galactose n acetylgalactosamine the beta3galt genes are distantly related to the drosophila brainiac gene and have the protein coding sequence contained in a single exon the beta3galt proteins also contain conserved sequences not found in the beta4galt or alpha3galt proteins the carbohydrate chains synthesized by these enzymes are designated as type 1 whereas beta4galt enzymes synthesize type 2 carbohydrate chains the ratio of type 1 type 2 chains changes during embryogenesis by sequence similarity the beta3galt genes fall into at least two groups beta3galt4 and 4 other beta3galt genes beta3galt1 3 beta3galt5 this gene encodes the most probable candidate for synthesis of the type 1 lewis antigens which are frequently found to be elevated in gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers the encoded protein is inactive with n linked glycoproteins and functions in mucin glycosylation five transcript variants have been described which differ in the 5 utr all transcript variants encode an identical protein

they are unicellular species which exist individually or in chains or groups depending on the species their sizes can range from a few micrometers m to a few hundred micrometers unlike higher plants microalgae do not have roots stems or leaves they are specially adapted to an environment dominated by viscous forces microalgae capable of performing photosynthesis are important for life on earth they produce approximately half of the atmospheric oxygen and use simultaneously the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to grow photoautotrophically microalgae together with bacteria form the base of the food web and provide energy for all the trophic levels above them microalgae biomass is often measured with chlorophyll a concentrations and can provide a useful index of potential production the standing stock of microphytes is closely related to that of its predators without grazing pressures the standing stock of microphytes dramatically decreases the biodiversity of microalgae is enormous and they represent an almost untapped resource it has been estimated that about 200 000 800 000 species in many different genera exist of which about 50 000 species are described over 15 000 novel compounds originating from algal biomass have been chemically determined most of these microalgae species produce

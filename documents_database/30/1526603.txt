the heavier group 6 elements molybdenum and tungsten form organometallic compounds similar to those in organochromium chemistry but higher oxidation states tend to be more common molybdenum hexacarbonyl is the precursor to many substituted derivatives it reacts with organolithium reagents to give anionic acyls which can be o alkylated to give fischer carbenes mo co reacts with arenes to give piano stool complexes such as mesitylene molybdenum tricarbonyl cycloheptatrienemolybdenum tricarbonyl which is related to arene mo co reacts with trityl salts to give the cycloheptatrienyl complex reduction of mo co gives mo co which is formally mo ii co free mo 0 compounds tend to be more reducing and kinetically labile than the carbonyl complexes examples include bis benzene molybdenum mo ch and tris butadiene molybdenum such compounds can be prepared by metal vapor synthesis and reductive routes from molybdenum v chloride halogenation of mo co gives mo ii carbonyl halides which are also versatile precursors one large collection of compounds have the formula cr mo co x derived from cyclopentadienylmolybdenum tricarbonyl dimer x halide hydride alkyl treating molybdenum ii acetate with methyllithium gives li mo ch with the formula of the type cpmox molybdocene dichloride x cl and molybdocene

the aortic valve may need to be replaced because current methods for aortic valve replacement include open heart surgery minimally invasive cardiac surgery mics and transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr during the late 1940s and early 1950s the first surgical approaches towards treating aortic valve stenosis had limited success the first attempts were valvotomies i e cutting the valve while the heart is pumping a ball valve prosthesis placed on the descending thoracic aorta heterotopically was developed by hufnagel harvey and others to address aortic stenosis but had disastrous complications later with the innovation of cardiopulmonary bypass the ball valve prosthesis was placed orthotopically i e in same place as the original aortic valve this first generation of prosthetic valves was durable but needed intense anti coagulation and cardiac hemodynamics were compromised during the mid 1950s a single leaflet prosthesis was developed by bahnson et al in early 1960 ross and barratt boyes used allografts tissue prosthetic valves were introduced in 1965 by binet in paris but they degenerated quickly because the tissue was insufficiently preserved carpentier solved this problem by introducing glutaraldehyde preserved stent mounted porcine valves the aortic valve is semilunar half moon shaped with three cusps it

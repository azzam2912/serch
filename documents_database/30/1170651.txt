it was designed to support large complex projects written in any number of programming languages primarily c c qbs is an all in one tool that generates a build graph from a high level project description like its predecessor qmake and additionally undertakes the task of executing the commands in the low level build graph like make qbs was originally created by nokia and is now primarily developed by the qt company who distributes it along with their qt toolkit it integrates with the qt framework and automates the creation of moc meta object compiler and rcc resource compiler sources which are used in qt s meta object system and in the integration of binary resources e g pictures the developers hope to eventually push for qbs to replace qmake as qt s own build system qbs is unique in that it has no mechanism for in source builds guaranteeing the ability to create several builds from a single source tree including building them from a single command invocation and in parallel this is a key feature ensuring that source files remain unaffected if a build directory is removed and that no output artifacts are written into the source directory

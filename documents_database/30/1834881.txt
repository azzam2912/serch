duke professor of biochemistry at duke university she received her phd in biophysics from brandeis university and did her postdoctoral work with dr thomas a steitz at yale university in 2009 dr beese was elected to the national academy of sciences her research interests include structural biochemistry of dna replication and human dna mismatch repair and its connection to carcinogenesis she is also interested in protein prenylation enzymes as targets for structure based discovery of anticancer therapeutics and re purposing of such therapeutics to treat pathogenic fungi and malaria in 2008 beese published her research on candida albicans geranylgeranyltransferase 1 ggtase 1 protein structure candida albican is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in the human microbiota in immune compromised individual c albicans result in infections that display resistance to anti fungal therapies the investigation and discovery of the structure of an ggtases 1 of candida albicans provides more information for scientists to understand the protein s importance in the survival of the pathogen and suggests its potential to be targeted for disease treatment while at duke university in 2011 beese along with her colleague eugene wu investigated the structural adaptation of dna polymerase observed during the recognition and correction of

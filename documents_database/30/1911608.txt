early versions of the software had three modules road notes where a surveyor enters their field notes grade design and plan view the program is a forest road design system that allows people to easily determine where the best extraction paths would be for timber or other wilderness based primary resources especially the alignment of the roads needed for the extraction of the resource and the insertion of the machinery needed to extract it it utilizes 3d approximations of the environment and allows individuals to pre plan their projects it is able to accept data produced by hand by surveyors or produce approximations based upon other variables terrain tools is a civil engineering software product that is available for professional engineers but also targets the userbase of individual researchers or small budget groups with a freeware version of its software it accepts survey data into its program in order to plot coordinates visually and statistically for the user softreeoptimal is a mathematical technique to automatically determine the lowest cost vertical alignment for corridor based infrastructure projects such as roads pipelines and railways it was developed by the university of b c and softree technical systems inc in 2012 based on

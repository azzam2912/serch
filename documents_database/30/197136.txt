although each step is linear in the sampled values and in the position the interpolation as a whole is not linear but rather quadratic in the sample location bilinear interpolation is one of the basic resampling techniques in computer vision and image processing where it is also called bilinear filtering or bilinear texture mapping suppose that we want to find the value of the unknown function f at the point x y it is assumed that we know the value of f at the four points q x y q x y q x y and q x y we first do linear interpolation in the x direction this yields we proceed by interpolating in the y direction to obtain the desired estimate note that we will arrive at the same result if the interpolation is done first along the y direction and then along the x direction an alternative way to write the solution to the interpolation problem is where the coefficients are found by solving the linear system yielding the result if a solution is preferred in terms of f q then we can write where the coefficients are found by solving if we choose a coordinate system

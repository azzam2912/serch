in particular it can be used to double a cube it can be defined as the cissoid of a circle and a line tangent to it with respect to the point on the circle opposite to the point of tangency in fact the family of cissoids is named for this example and some authors refer to it simply as the cissoid it has a single cusp at the pole and is symmetric about the diameter of the circle which is the line of tangency of the cusp the line is an asymptote it is a member of the conchoid of de sluze family of curves and in form it resembles a tractrix the word cissoid comes from the greek kissoeid s ivy shaped from kissos ivy and oeid s having the likeness of the curve is named for diocles who studied it in the 2nd century bce let the radius of c be a by translation and rotation we may take o to be the origin and the center of the circle to be a 0 so a is 2 a 0 then the polar equations of l and c are by construction the distance from the origin to a

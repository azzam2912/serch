essentially the task group provided a mechanism for implementing quality of service qos at the media access control mac level although this technique is commonly referred to as ieee 802 1p the group s work with the new priority classes and generic attribute registration protocol garp was not published separately but was incorporated into a major revision of the standard ieee 802 1d 1998 which got later on incorporated into ieee 802 1q 2014 standard the work also required a short amendment extending the frame size of the ethernet standard by four bytes which was published as ieee 802 3ac in 1998 the qos technique developed by the working group also known as class of service cos is a 3 bit field called the priority code point pcp within an ethernet frame header when using vlan tagged frames as defined by ieee 802 1q it specifies a priority value of between 0 and 7 inclusive that can be used by qos disciplines to differentiate traffic eight different classes of service are available as expressed through the 3 bit pcp field in an ieee 802 1q header added to the frame the way traffic is treated when assigned to any particular

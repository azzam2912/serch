it formally defines signals connecting between a dte data terminal equipment such as a computer terminal and a dce data circuit terminating equipment or data communication equipment such as a modem the standard defines the electrical characteristics and timing of signals the meaning of signals and the physical size and pinout of connectors the current version of the standard is tia 232 f interface between data terminal equipment and data circuit terminating equipment employing serial binary data interchange issued in 1997 the rs 232 standard had been commonly used in computer serial ports and is still widely used in industrial communication devices a serial port complying with the rs 232 standard was once a standard feature of many types of computers personal computers used them for connections not only to modems but also to printers computer mice data storage uninterruptible power supplies and other peripheral devices rs 232 when compared to later interfaces such as rs 422 rs 485 and ethernet has lower transmission speed short maximum cable length large voltage swing large standard connectors no multipoint capability and limited multidrop capability in modern personal computers usb has displaced rs 232 from most of its peripheral interface roles many computers

conceptually the oxidation state which may be positive negative or zero is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were 100 ionic with no covalent component this is never exactly true for real bonds the term oxidation was first used by antoine lavoisier to signify reaction of a substance with oxygen much later it was realized that the substance upon being oxidized loses electrons and the meaning was extended to include other reactions in which electrons are lost regardless of whether oxygen was involved oxidation states are typically represented by integers which may be positive zero or negative in some cases the average oxidation state of an element is a fraction such as for iron in magnetite the highest known oxidation state is reported to be 9 in the tetroxoiridium ix cation it is predicted that even a 10 oxidation state may be achievable by platinum in the tetroxoplatinum x cation the lowest oxidation state is 4 as for carbon in methane or for chromium in cr co the increase in oxidation state of an atom through a chemical reaction is known as an oxidation a decrease in oxidation state is

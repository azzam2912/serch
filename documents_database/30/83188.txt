it is known variously as in this article the generic term overhead line is used as used by the international union of railways an overhead line is designed on the principle of one or more overhead wires or rails particularly in tunnels situated over rail tracks raised to a high electrical potential by connection to feeder stations at regular intervals the feeder stations are usually fed from a high voltage electrical grid electric trains that collect their current from overhead lines use a device such as a pantograph bow collector or trolley pole it presses against the underside of the lowest overhead wire the contact wire current collectors are electrically conductive and allow current to flow through to the train or tram and back to the feeder station through the steel wheels on one or both running rails non electric locomotives such as diesels may pass along these tracks without affecting the overhead line although there may be difficulties with overhead clearance alternative electrical power transmission schemes for trains include third rail ground level power supply batteries and electromagnetic induction to achieve good high speed current collection it is necessary to keep the contact wire geometry within defined limits this

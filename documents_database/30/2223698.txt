like other types of thrust reversals it temporarily divert the engine exhaust thrust forward to provide deceleration this type of thrust reverser is suitable for engines of or greater thrust the part that provides reverse thrust for thrust reversal is the deflector doors bucket with aerodynamic contour on both inner and outer surface at the tailpipe of a jet engine the doors are in a deployed location when thrust reversal takes effect and at stowed location when otherwise when deployed the doors block the airflow in the end of the engine in this case airflow passes through the inner surface and travels frontward to provide force opposite to the heading of the aircraft when stowed the doors seamlessly connect to the rest parts of the engine to provide a streamlined outer surface a pair of beams are located in the left and right of the engines with a sled in each of them the two doors are connected to both sleds by two rods each a hydraulic actuator connected to each sled is placed in each beam the actuator extends to deploy the thrust reversal and retracts to stow the thrust reversal in a way that the rods push the

green cell stands for global renewable electrical energy network cell the concept resulted from a thought experiment process involving engineers working for the abb group that took place on march 13 2009 in oslo norway the concept was subsequently introduced in an abb magazine and remains under development as part of an open innovation process the propulsion of merchant ships is responsible for approximately 4 of global carbon dioxide emissions the industry itself estimated its carbon footprint at 3 3 in 2007 the industry responded officially as early as 2003 by calling for measures to limit or reduce the emissions from international shipping in order to envision solutions to this challenge a team of engineers and consultants associated with abb set up a thought experiment that would pose the question how could you power the commercial fleet without fossil fuels the core team consisted of three electrical engineers jaakko aho jukka varis and klaus v nska all of finland this group laid down a core set of design principles around fossil free marine propulsion and described a hypothetical system that was later called the green cell shipping concept the green cell is at the core of the shipping concept each

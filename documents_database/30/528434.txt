it is reduced to the above simplified normal form by ikeda daido and akimoto formula 2 stands for the electric field inside the resonator at the n th step of rotation in the resonator and formula 3 and formula 4 are parameters which indicates laser light applied from the outside and linear phase across the resonator respectively in particular the parameter formula 5 is called dissipation parameter characterizing the loss of resonator and in the limit of formula 6 the ikeda map becomes a conservative map the original ikeda map is often used in another modified form in order to take the saturation effect of nonlinear dielectric medium into account a 2d real example of the above form is where u is a parameter and for formula 11 this system has a chaotic attractor this shows how the attractor of the system changes as the parameter formula 12 is varied from 0 0 to 1 0 in steps of 0 01 the ikeda dynamical system is simulated for 500 steps starting from 20000 randomly placed starting points the last 20 points of each trajectory are plotted to depict the attractor note the bifurcation of attractor points as formula 12 is

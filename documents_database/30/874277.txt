hill built by shorts as a private research venture to test the concept of the aero isoclinic wing it was the first aircraft to incorporate this feature it was in effect a one third scale glider version of keith lucas ambitious preliminary design p d 1 intended to meet the air ministry s v bomber specification b 35 46 which was the basis for the avro vulcan the handley page victor and the vickers valiant after extensive testing with wind tunnel and flutter models the design team proposed that a manned glider be built shorts belfast undertook construction on a single seat glider incorporating the aero isoclinic wing originated by professor hill this radical wing configuration was designed to maintain a constant angle of incidence regardless of flexing by placing the torsion box well back in the wing so that the air loads acting in the region of the quarter chord line have a considerable moment arm about it the torsional instability and tip stalling characteristics of conventional swept wings were recognised at the time together with their tendency to aileron reversal and flutter at high speed it was to prevent these effects that the aero isoclinic wing was designed

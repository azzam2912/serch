constructed in 1966 it was remotely controlled from jodrell bank observatory and was mainly used as part of the merlin radio telescope network it was designed by charles husband at the instigation of bernard lovell funding for the telescope was obtained in 1963 from the dsir the telescope was designed by husband and co consulting engineers and was constructed by fairey engineering it started observations in july 1967 the telescope could be controlled either locally or by remote control over uhf and microwave links from jodrell bank observatory normally the latter similar to the mark ii it had an elliptical dish with a major axis of 125 ft 38 1m and a minor axis of 83 ft 4 in 25 4m unlike the mark ii however the dish is constructed of a wire mesh with the wires apart set to an accuracy of when pointed to the horizon the telescope was 81 efficient at wavelengths of 21 cm the hydrogen line dropping to 45 at 11 cm when the bowl was pointed to the horizon the structure deformed slightly under gravity meaning that the telescope becomes 14 efficient at 11 cm the focus cabin was an 8 foot cube also

similar to the closely related genera of monilaria and meyerophytum these leaf pairs alternate consecutively between two different types of leaf growth heterophylly and during the exceptionally hot summer they remain inactive in a dry sheath when fused together into a cone shaped corpuscle this leaf pair is referred to as the plant s mitre and this is the origin of the genus name the two separate leaves of the free leaf pair are rounded triangular to tongue shaped the fused leaf pair forms a cone shaped to cylindrical corpuscle which bears two smaller ear like anthers at the top this fused corpuscle dries out in the plant s dormancy period eventually becoming a papery sheath in which the new separate leaf pair forms in cultivation the plants are not difficult to grow however they require deep well drained sandy soil and sufficient sun exposure they are also adapted to very dry summers and watering mainly over the winter their period of growth is primarily over late autumn and winter they are slow growing maturing over many decades and are difficult to propagate by cuttings consequently seed is the preferred means of propagation

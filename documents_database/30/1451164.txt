the principle has wide applicability in pharmacology physiology nutrition biochemistry and system dynamics it applies whenever a drug or nutrient is infused or ingested at a relatively constant rate and when a constant fraction is eliminated during each time interval under these conditions any change in the rate of infusion leads to an exponential increase or decrease until a new level is achieved this behavior is also called an approach to steady state because rather than causing an indefinite increase or decrease a natural balance is achieved when the rate of infusion or production is balanced by the rate of loss an especially important use of the plateau principle is to study the renewal of tissue constituents in the human and animal body in adults daily synthesis of tissue constituents is nearly constant and most constituents are removed with a first order reaction rate applicability of the plateau principle was recognized during radioactive tracer studies of protein turnover in the 1940s by rudolph schoenheimer and david rittenberg unlike the case with drugs the initial amount of tissue or tissue protein is not zero because daily synthesis offsets daily elimination in this case the model is also said to approach a

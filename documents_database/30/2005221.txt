the system was implemented in 2014 and is a replacement for the northeast snowfall impact scale nesis system which the national climatic data center ncdc began using in 2005 the ncdc has retroactively assigned rsi values to almost 600 historical storms since 1900 the index makes use of population and regional differences to assess the impact of snowfall for example areas which receive very little snowfall on average may be more adversely affected than other regions and so the index will grant storms in those regions higher severity in each region four thresholds are set based on climatological records for example in the northeast a typical location will get 16 inches of snow about once every 10 years and 20 inches about once every 25 so the thresholds are 4 10 20 and 30 inches for each threshold and each region a baseline area and population are determined for a given storm the area that exceeds a particular threshold will be normalized by the baseline value for example for a storm in the northeast the area receiving at least 4 inches of snow is divided by 149 228 square miles and the population affected is divided by 51 553 600

various counting methodologies have been developed over the years to determine the number present in the water being observed methods used for counting bacterioplankton include epifluorescence microscopy flow cytometry measures of productivity through frequency of dividing cells fdc thymine incorporation and leucine incorporation factors such as salinity temperature latitude various nutrient levels water movement and the presence of other organisms can affect bacterioplankton enumeration changes in these factors affect the bacterioplankton count causing it to vary by body of water location distance from shore and season bacterioplankton count is usually expressed in cells per ml cells ml in understanding marine microbiology and the aquatic ecosystem bacterioplankton counts can be useful observation of bacterioplankton number can provide more information in the following epifluorescence microscopy is an advanced optical microscope technique that relies on the use of fluorescent dyes that bind to specific biological markers which then emit a distinctive emission spectra that is identified through the lens fluorescent dyes include dapi acridine orange sybr green 1 and yo pro 1 all of which are capable of staining both dna and rna structures in biological samples such as bacteria and viruses however dna staining is primarily used for bacterial cell identification with

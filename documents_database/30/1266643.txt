it is an instance of a dirac type operator let formula 1 be a compact riemannian manifold of even dimension formula 2 let be the exterior derivative on formula 4 th order differential forms on formula 1 the riemannian metric on formula 1 allows us to define the hodge star operator formula 7 and with it the inner product on forms denote by the adjoint operator of the exterior differential formula 10 this operator can be expressed purely in terms of the hodge star operator as follows now consider formula 12 acting on the space of all forms formula 13 one way to consider this as a graded operator is the following let formula 14 be an involution on the space of all forms defined by it is verified that formula 12 anti commutes with formula 14 and consequently switches the formula 18 eigenspaces formula 19 of formula 14 consequently definition the operator formula 22 with the above grading respectively the above operator formula 23 is called the signature operator of formula 1 in the odd dimensional case one defines the signature operator to be formula 25 acting on the even dimensional forms of formula 1 if formula 27 so

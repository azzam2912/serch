the unit cell is a parallelepiped defined by the lengths of its edges formula 1 and angles between them formula 2 consider a system of periodic structure in space and use formula 3 formula 4 and formula 5 as the three independent period vectors forming a right handed triad which are also the edge vectors of a cell of the system then any vector formula 6 in cartesian coordinates can be written as a linear combination of the period vectors our task is to calculate the scalar coefficients known as fractional coordinates formula 8 formula 9 and formula 10 assuming formula 6 formula 12 formula 4 and formula 5 are known for this purpose let us calculate the following cell surface area vector then and the volume of the cell is if we do a vector inner dot product as follows then we get similarly we arrive at and if there are many formula 6s to be converted with respect to the same period vectors to speed up we can have where in crystallography the lengths formula 29 formula 30 formula 31 of and angles formula 32 formula 33 formula 34 between the edge period vectors formula 12 formula 4

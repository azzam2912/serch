it participates in the complement system ending with cell death there are four different c5 convertases able to specifically convert the protein c5 to c5a and c5b fragments two of the convertases are physiological complement enzymes associate to the cell surface and mediate the classical pathway c4b2b3b or c4b2a3b depending on source or the alternative pathway c3bbbc3b of complement system two fluid phase c5 convertases have been described the classical pathway enzyme c4b2boxy3b and the cobra venom factor dependent c5 convertase cvfbb cell bound c3 and c5 convertase differ in their c3b requirement c3 convertase c3bbb need only one molecule of c3b to form whereas two or more c3b are required for generation of c5 convertase c3bbb it means when c3b is randomly distributed on the surface of a cell only c3 convertase activity appears after addition of factors b and d however when c3b is distributed in clusters c3 and c5 convertase activity is generated upon addition of factors b and d the classical pathway c5 convertase is composed of the larger fragments of complement proteins c4b c2b produced by cleavage mediated by c1 complex and c3b produced by cleavage mediated by the classical pathway c3 convertase c4bc2b the

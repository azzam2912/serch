in 1920 the royal w rttemberg state railways along with the other german state railways l nderbahnen were merged into the deutsche reichsbahn the w rttemberg state railway first divided its locomotives into classes in 1845 this first categorisation into classes i to vii was based on the order in which individual vehicles were procured the scheme proved to be unworkable in practice so in 1858 a new system was introduced as follows in several cases the previous classes were simply redesignated in other cases new locomotives and rebuilds were grouped together into one class despite being of different designs over the course of time the shortcomings of the system became apparent in particular the division of locomotives into light and heavy groups was unfortunate the classification scheme was also no longer sufficient for new locomotives as a result it was changed slightly in 1892 on retirement classes that became free were used again individual classes were differentiated by means of lower case letters in order to be able to indicate certain characteristics as well as by arabic numerals to distinguish the individual designs furthermore several special abbreviations were introduced such as kl for small locomotives dw for steam railbuses

its central ideas were developed by danish mathematician jakob nielsen and bear his name the theory developed in the study of the so called minimal number of a map f from a compact space to itself denoted mf f this is defined as where indicates homotopy of mappings and fix g indicates the number of fixed points of g the minimal number was very difficult to compute in nielsen s time and remains so today nielsen s approach is to group the fixed point set into classes which are judged essential or nonessential according to whether or not they can be removed by a homotopy nielsen s original formulation is equivalent to the following we define an equivalence relation on the set of fixed points of a self map f on a space x we say that x is equivalent to y if and only if there exists a path c from x to y with f c homotopic to c as paths the equivalence classes with respect to this relation are called the nielsen classes of f and the nielsen number n f is defined as the number of nielsen classes having non zero fixed point index sum nielsen

examples include deciding whether a project should be allowed to go forward in a zone of a certain risk or designing structures to withstand events with a certain return period the following analysis assumes that the probability of the event occurring does not vary over time and is independent of past events recurrence interval formula 1 for floods the event may be measured in terms of m s or height for storm surges in terms of the height of the surge and similarly for other events the theoretical return period between occurrences is the inverse of the average frequency of occurrence for example a 10 year flood has a 1 10 0 1 or 10 chance of being exceeded in any one year and a 50 year flood has a 0 02 or 2 chance of being exceeded in any one year this does not mean that a 100 year flood will happen regularly every 100 years or only once in 100 years despite the connotations of the name return period in any given 100 year period a 100 year event may occur once twice more or not at all and each outcome has a probability that can be computed

rebreather diving is used by recreational military and scientific divers in applications where it has advantages over open circuit scuba and surface supply of breathing gas is impracticable the main advantages of rebreather diving are extended gas endurance and lack of bubbles rebreathers are generally used for scuba applications but are also occasionally used for bailout systems for surface supplied diving gas reclaim systems used for deep heliox diving use similar technology to rebreathers as do saturation diving life support systems but in these applications the gas recycling equipment is not carried by the diver atmospheric diving suits also use rebreather technology to recycle breathing gas but this article covers the technology hazards and procedures of ambient pressure rebreathers carried by the diver rebreathers are more complex to use than open circuit scuba and have more potential points of failure so acceptably safe use requires a greater level of skill attention and situational awareness which is usually derived from understanding the systems diligent maintenance and overlearning the practical skills of operation and fault recovery at shallow depths a diver using open circuit breathing apparatus typically only uses about a quarter of the oxygen in the air that is breathed in

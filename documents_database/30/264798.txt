it has the useful properties that all points on the map are at proportionally correct distances from the center point and that all points on the map are at the correct azimuth direction from the center point a useful application for this type of projection is a polar projection which shows all meridians lines of longitude as straight with distances from the pole represented correctly the flag of the united nations contains an example of a polar azimuthal equidistant projection while it may have been used by ancient egyptians for star maps in some holy books the earliest text describing the azimuthal equidistant projection is an 11th century work by al biruni the projection appears in many renaissance maps and gerardus mercator used it for an inset of the north polar regions in sheet 13 and legend 6 of his well known 1569 map in france and russia this projection is named postel projection after guillaume postel who used it for a map in 1581 many modern star chart planispheres use the polar azimuthal equidistant projection a point on the globe is chosen as the center in the sense that mapped distances and azimuth directions from that point to any

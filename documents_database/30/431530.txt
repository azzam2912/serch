this moduli space is the essence of the gromov witten invariants which find application in enumerative geometry and type iia string theory the idea of stable map was proposed by maxim kontsevich around 1992 and published in because the construction is lengthy and difficult it is carried out here rather than in the gromov witten invariants article itself fix a closed symplectic manifold formula 1 with symplectic form formula 2 let formula 3 and formula 4 be natural numbers including zero and formula 5 a two dimensional homology class in formula 1 then one may consider the set of pseudoholomorphic curves where formula 8 is a smooth closed riemann surface of genus formula 3 with formula 4 marked points formula 11 and is a function satisfying for some choice of formula 2 tame almost complex structure formula 14 and inhomogeneous term formula 15 the perturbed cauchy riemann equation typically one admits only those formula 3 and formula 4 that make the punctured euler characteristic formula 19 of formula 20 negative then the domain is stable meaning that there are only finitely many holomorphic automorphisms of formula 20 that preserve the marked points the operator formula 22 is elliptic and thus

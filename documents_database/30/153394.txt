it is a heat resistant and strong synthetic fibre developed in the early 1970s by the dutch company akzo division enka later akzo industrial fibers the research name of the para aramid fibre was originally fiber x but it was soon called arenka although the dutch para aramid fiber was developed only a little later than dupont s kevlar introduction of twaron as a commercial product came much later than kevlar due to financial problems at the akzo company in the 1970s this is a chronology of the development of twaron twaron is a p phenylene terephthalamide p p pta the simplest form of the aabb para polyaramide p p pta is a product of p phenylene diamine ppd and terephthaloyl dichloride tdc to dissolve the aromatic polymer twaron used a co solvent of n methyl pyrrolidone nmp and an ionic component calcium chloride cacl to occupy the hydrogen bonds of the amide groups the invention of this specific process was done in 1974 at akzo research laboratory in arnhem by a team consisting of leo vollbracht teun veerman assistant of leo vollbracht and wim engelhard trainee who actually discovered nmp as the appropriate solvent to keep the growing polymer

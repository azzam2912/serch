only one fifth of its surface area is exposed bedrock the rest being covered by ice the exposed surface is approximately 410 000 km the geology of greenland is dominated by crystalline rocks of the precambrian shield the crystalline rocks of the nuuk qeqertarsuatsiaat area comprise some of the oldest bedrock in greenland which covers most of western greenland the surface has been altered several times and has an appearance as though it were shaped billions of years ago this is one of the reasons why the nuuk area is extraordinary and also because the particular climate zone for the area limits the vegetation which makes it possible to observe impressive km scale megascopic textures the bedrock around nuuk consists of two major lithologic packages the dark melanocratic amitsoq gneiss which is intruded by and complexly folded into the younger leucocratic nuuk gneiss this western gneiss complex is approximately 3600 million years old the isua greenstone belt in the isukasia area southwest greenland is extraordinary in that it contains some of the oldest bedrock on the planet approximately 3800 million years old the bedrock is not nearly as metamorphosed as the surrounding gneiss bedrock and is therefore of interest for

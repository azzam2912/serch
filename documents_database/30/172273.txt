higher ocean surface topography in the western pacific than in the indian ocean drives upper thermocline water from the north pacific through the western route of the makassar strait to either directly exit through the lombok strait or flow eastward into the banda sea weaker flow of saltier and denser south pacific water passes over the lifamatola passage into the banda sea where these water masses are mixed due to tidal effects ekman pumping and heat and fresh water flux at the ocean surface from the banda sea the itf exits timor ombai and lombok passages the location and topography of the channels that make up the itf are shown in the figure lombok strait is 300m deep and roughly 35 km wide and the currents vary between 0 286 m s 0 6 mi hr eastward to 0 67 m s westward and average 0 25 m s westward currents in ombai vary between 0 12 m s eastward to 0 16 m s westward averaging 0 11 m s westward and are funneled within the 1250m deep and 35 km wide passage timor passage which is 1890 m deep by 160 km wide is the widest of the

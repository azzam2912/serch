crystal structures allowed for a model in which the enzyme undergoes a 2 a shuttle like motion of its heterodimers to perform the catalysis the protein encoded by the human pdha2 gene is part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex the entire human complex is 9 5 mda in size and has been described as 60 meric meaning there are over 60 components that are assembled to make the entire complex these subunits are conserved across many species as the function of this complex is essential for the generation of atp for all eukaryotes each component is responsible for the catalysis of one step in this pathway this complex exists for the purpose of channeling the intermediates of each reaction to the next enzyme thus greatly increasing the rate of reaction the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate with the final product being acetyl coa overall the complex catalyzes five reactions with the overall reaction being pyruvate coa nad acetyl coa co there are three different coenzymes required throughout the 5 steps that this complex carries out thiamine pyrophosphate tpp lipoamide and coenzyme a this step is only one of the central metabolic pathway carried

it is one answer to the question of what in special relativity corresponds to the rigid body of non relativistic classical mechanics the concept was introduced by max born 1909 who gave a detailed description of the case of constant proper acceleration which he called hyperbolic motion when subsequent authors such as paul ehrenfest 1909 tried to incorporate rotational motions as well it became clear that born rigidity is a very restrictive sense of rigidity leading to the herglotz noether theorem according to which there are severe restrictions on rotational born rigid motions it was formulated by gustav herglotz 1909 who classified all forms of rotational motions and in a less general way by fritz noether 1909 as a result born 1910 and others gave alternative less restrictive definitions of rigidity born rigidity is satisfied if the orthogonal spacetime distance between infinitesimally separated curves or worldlines is constant or equivalently if the length of the rigid body in momentary co moving inertial frames measured by standard measuring rods i e the proper length is constant and is therefore subjected to lorentz contraction in relatively moving frames born rigidity is a constraint on the motion of an extended body achieved by

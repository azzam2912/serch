this shared secret may be directly used as a key or to derive another key the key or the derived key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher it is a variant of the diffie hellman protocol using elliptic curve cryptography the following example will illustrate how a key establishment is made suppose alice wants to establish a shared key with bob but the only channel available for them may be eavesdropped by a third party initially the domain parameters that is formula 1 in the prime case or formula 2 in the binary case must be agreed upon also each party must have a key pair suitable for elliptic curve cryptography consisting of a private key d a randomly selected integer in the interval formula 3 and a public key represented by a point formula 4 where formula 5 that is the result of adding formula 6 to itself formula 7 times let alice s key pair be formula 8 and bob s key pair be formula 9 each party must know the other party s public key prior to execution of the protocol alice computes point formula 10 bob computes point formula

the root word is the primary lexical unit of a word and of a word family this root is then called the base word which carries the most significant aspects of semantic content and cannot be reduced into smaller constituents content words in nearly all languages contain and may consist only of root morphemes however sometimes the term root is also used to describe the word minus its inflectional endings but with its lexical endings in place for example chatters has the inflectional root or lemma chatter but the lexical root chat inflectional roots are often called stems and a root in the stricter sense may be thought of as a monomorphemic stem the traditional definition allows roots to be either free morphemes or bound morphemes root morphemes are essential for affixation and compounds however in polysynthetic languages with very high levels of inflectional morphology the term root is generally synonymous with free morpheme many such languages have a very restricted number of morphemes that can stand alone as a word yup ik for instance has no more than two thousand the root of a word is a unit of meaning morpheme and as such it is an abstraction though

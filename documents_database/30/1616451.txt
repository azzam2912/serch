the object experiencing fission is usually a cell but the term may also refer to how organisms bodies populations or species split into discrete parts the fission may be binary fission in which a single organism produces two parts or multiple fission in which a single entity produces multiple parts organisms in the domains of archaea and bacteria reproduce with binary fission this form of asexual reproduction and cell division is also used by some organelles within eukaryotic organisms e g mitochondria binary fission results in the reproduction of a living prokaryotic cell or organelle by dividing the cell into two parts each with the potential to grow to the size of the original the single dna molecule first replicates then attaches each copy to a different part of the cell membrane when the cell begins to pull apart the replicated and original chromosomes are separated the consequence of this asexual method of reproduction is that all the cells are genetically identical meaning that they have the same genetic material barring random mutations unlike the processes of mitosis and meiosis used by eukaryotic cells binary fission takes place without the formation of a spindle apparatus on the cell like in

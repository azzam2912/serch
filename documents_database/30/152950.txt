the significance of positive linear functionals lies in results such as riesz markov kakutani representation theorem when v is a complex vector space it is assumed that for all v 0 f v is real as in the case when v is a c algebra with its partially ordered subspace of self adjoint elements sometimes a partial order is placed on only a subspace w of v and the partial order does not extend to all of v in which case the positive elements of v are the positive elements of w by abuse of notation this implies that for a c algebra a positive linear functional sends any x in v equal to s s for some s in v to a real number which is equal to its complex conjugate and therefore all positive linear functionals preserve the self adjointness of such x this property is exploited in the gns construction to relate positive linear functionals on a c algebra to inner products let m be a c algebra more generally an operator system in a c algebra a with identity 1 let m denote the set of positive elements in m a linear functional on m is

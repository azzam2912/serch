the metal centres in the copper proteins can be classified into several types blue copper protein the blue copper protein owes their name to the intense blue coloration of corresponding cu ii ions the blue copper protein often called as moonlighting protein which means a protein can perform more than one function copper is an essential metal in living organisms the most important role of copper protein in living systems is as an outer sphere electron transfer agent in this role both cu i and cu ii play major role the cu in the oxidized copper protein accepts one electron to form cu in the reduced protein the cu in the blue copper protein has major impact on protein geometry the geometric distortion has an effect on the d orbital splitting pattern and energies the geometry distortion happens because the ligand positions the donors in a distorted geometry the blue copper protein geometry has no jahn teller jt distortion of the cu d ion since these large structural changes associated with redox states are due to a jt distorting force present in typical which is ordinary cu complexes with monodentate ligands oxidized cu d centers leading to a tetragonal i

despite having a very low energy to weight ratio and a low energy to volume ratio its ability to supply high surge currents means that the cells have a relatively large power to weight ratio these features along with their low cost make them attractive for use in motor vehicles to provide the high current required by automobile starter motors as they are inexpensive compared to newer technologies lead acid batteries are widely used even when surge current is not important and other designs could provide higher energy densities in 1999 lead acid battery sales accounted for 40 45 of the value from batteries sold worldwide excluding china and russia equivalent to a manufacturing market value of about 15 billion large format lead acid designs are widely used for storage in backup power supplies in cell phone towers high availability settings like hospitals and stand alone power systems for these roles modified versions of the standard cell may be used to improve storage times and reduce maintenance requirements gel cells and absorbed glass mat batteries are common in these roles collectively known as vrla valve regulated lead acid batteries the electrical energy produced by a discharging lead acid battery can

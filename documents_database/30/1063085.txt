this expansion makes it useful as a specialty packing material which forms to the shape of the product being packaged and produces a high thermal insulating value with virtually no air infiltration otto bayer 1902 1982 is credited with the invention of polyurethane in 1937 he succeeded in synthesizing polyurethane foam by exploring his basic idea that mixing small volumes of chemical substances could create dry foam materials polyurethane was further developed for different applications ranging from shoe soles and cushions to industrial uses in the 1940s rigid foam was applied to airplanes and in 1979 polyurethane began being used as building insulation r value is the term given to thermal resistance to heat flow the higher the r value of an insulation product the more effective the insulation properties spray polyurethane foam comes in a range of densities and cel structure low density foams are referred to as open cel spf while higher density foams are referred to as closed cel foam 1 8 2 pound polyurethane foam has the highest r value of readily available spray foam insulation used in homes and buildings polyurethane is a closed cell foam insulation material that initially contains a low conductivity gas

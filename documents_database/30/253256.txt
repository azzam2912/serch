the proportion of astrocytes in the brain is not well defined depending on the counting technique used studies have found that the astrocyte proportion varies by region and ranges from 20 to 40 of all glia they perform many functions including biochemical support of endothelial cells that form the blood brain barrier provision of nutrients to the nervous tissue maintenance of extracellular ion balance and a role in the repair and scarring process of the brain and spinal cord following traumatic injuries research since the mid 1990s has shown that astrocytes propagate intercellular ca waves over long distances in response to stimulation and similar to neurons release transmitters called gliotransmitters in a ca dependent manner data suggest that astrocytes also signal to neurons through ca dependent release of glutamate such discoveries have made astrocytes an important area of research within the field of neuroscience astrocytes are a sub type of glial cells in the central nervous system they are also known as astrocytic glial cells star shaped their many processes envelop synapses made by neurons astrocytes are classically identified using histological analysis many of these cells express the intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap several forms of astrocytes exist

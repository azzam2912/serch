the purity requirement varies with the application for example a h ice can tolerate low hydrogen purity where a hydrogen fuel cell requires high hydrogen purity to prevent catalyst poisoning in the first generation of fuel cells catalysts like palladium ruthenium and platinum are used in combination with hydrogen production from hydrocarbons which results in performance degradation the catalyst poisoning induced by some impurities like carbon monoxide formic acid or formaldehyde can be reversed with a high purity hydrogen stream presence of other impurities like sulfurs may lead to permanent degradation of the fuel cells the kind of impurities and their level depends on the h production process e g steam methane reforming electrolysis but impurities can also be introduced due to transport cleaning of the refueling station leakages or maintenance in europe the directive 2014 94 eu on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure states that the hydrogen purity dispensed by hydrogen refuelling points shall comply with the technical specifications included in the iso 14687 2 standard iso 14687 2 specifies maximum impurities levels for particles and several gaseous impurities for many compounds the limit values are very low including total sulfur 4 nmol mol or carbon monoxide 200

micro lathes are related to full sized lathes but are distinguished by their small size and differing capabilities application use and locations sometimes referred to as desktop lathes or table top lathes micro lathes can be comfortably used in areas where a full sized lathe would be impractical micro lathes are well suited for use in restricted spaces where heavy machining or high accuracy are not requirements micro lathes find a place in homes basements and garages as they are a popular tool for hobbyists they are commonly sold through hobby catalogs and hobby websites micro lathes are preferred over larger lathes by some professionals commonly locksmiths jewelers designers and engineers for prototyping or fabrication work despite a more available price point and lower rigidity than their larger counterparts micro lathes still operate within the required tolerances of many tasks this makes them particularly useful in applications where small precision pieces are needed for projects like miniature engines that require fine detail and mechanical accuracy small ultra precision and diamond turning lathes exist but have little in common with a desktop style micro lathe other than form factor the smallest cnc micro lathe was made by researchers at the mechanical

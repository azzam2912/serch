common sweat diagnostic tests include testing for cystic fibrosis and illicit drugs most testing of human sweat is in reference to the eccrine sweat gland which in contrast to the apocrine sweat gland has a lower composition of oils although sweat is mostly water there are many solutes which are found in sweat that have at least some relation to biomarkers found in blood these include sodium na chloride cl potassium k ammonium nh alcohols lactate peptides proteins development of devices sensing techniques and biomarker identification in sweat continues to be an expanding field for medical diagnostics and athletics applications some of the earliest published studies on sweat composition date back to the 19th century further studies in the 20th century began to solidify understanding of the physiology and pharmacology of the eccrine sweat gland in vivo and in vitro studies from this time period and even those continuing today have identified numerous structural nuances and new molecules present within sweat the first commercially adopted use for sweat diagnostics included testing of sodium and chloride levels in children for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis today one of the most popular devices for this testing is the macroduct sweat collection system

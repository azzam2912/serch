let g be a group of homeomorphisms from x to x then we say that the action of the group g at a point formula 1 is freely discontinuous if there exists a neighborhood u of x such that formula 2 for all formula 3 excluding the identity such a u is sometimes called a nice neighborhood of x the set of points at which g is freely discontinuous is called the free regular set and is sometimes denoted by formula 4 note that formula 5 is an open set if y is a subset of x then y g is the space of equivalence classes and it inherits the canonical topology from y that is the projection from y to y g is continuous and open note that formula 6 is a hausdorff space the open set is the free regular set of the modular group formula 8 on the upper half plane h this set is called the fundamental domain on which modular forms are studied

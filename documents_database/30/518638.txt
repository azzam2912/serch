the technique was developed around 1890 by henri pad but goes back to georg frobenius who introduced the idea and investigated the features of rational approximations of power series the pad approximant often gives better approximation of the function than truncating its taylor series and it may still work where the taylor series does not converge for these reasons pad approximants are used extensively in computer calculations they have also been used as auxiliary functions in diophantine approximation and transcendental number theory though for sharp results ad hoc methods in some sense inspired by the pad theory typically replace them given a function f and two integers m 0 and n 1 the pad approximant of order m n is the rational function which agrees with f x to the highest possible order which amounts to equivalently if r x is expanded in a maclaurin series taylor series at 0 its first m n terms would cancel the first m n terms of f x and as such the pad approximant is unique for given m and n that is the coefficients formula 4 can be uniquely determined it is for reasons of uniqueness that the zero order term at

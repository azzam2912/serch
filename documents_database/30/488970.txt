this work was completed by fred sanger and his team in 1977 in 1962 walter fiers and robert sinsheimer had already demonstrated the physical covalently closed circularity of x174 dna nobel prize winner arthur kornberg used x174 as a model to first prove that dna synthesized in a test tube by purified enzymes could produce all the features of a natural virus ushering in the age of synthetic biology in 1972 1974 jerard hurwitz sue wickner and reed wickner with collaborators identified the genes required to produce the enzymes to catalyze conversion of the single stranded form of the virus to the double stranded replicative form in 2003 it was reported by craig venter s group that the genome of x174 was the first to be completely assembled in vitro from synthesized oligonucleotides the x174 virus particle has also been successfully assembled in vitro recently it was shown how its highly overlapping genome can be fully decompressed and still remain functional this bacteriophage has a circular single stranded dna genome of 5386 nucleotides encoding 11 proteins of these 11 genes only 8 are essential to viral morphogenesis the gc content is 44 and 95 of nucleotides belong to coding genes

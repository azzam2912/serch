the term stadia comes from a greek unit of length stadion equal to 600 greek feet pous which was the typical length of a sports stadium of the time stadiametric rangefinding is used for surveying and in the telescopic sights of firearms artillery pieces or tank guns as well as some binoculars and other optics it is still widely used in long range military sniping but in many professional applications it is being replaced with microwave infrared or laser rangefinding methods although much easier to use electronic rangefinders can give away the shooter s position to a well equipped adversary and the need for accurate range estimation existed for much longer than electronic rangefinders small and rugged enough to be suitable for military use the stadia method is based upon the principle of similar triangles this means that for a triangle with a given angle the ratio of opposite side length to adjacent side length see tangent is constant by using a reticle with marks of a known angular spacing the principle of similar triangles can be used to find either the distance to objects of known size or the size of objects at a known distance in either case

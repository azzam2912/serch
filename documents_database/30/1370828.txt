as retrotransposons they mobilize through reverse transcription of their mrna and integration of the newly created cdna into another location their mechanism of retrotransposition is shared with retroviruses with the difference that most ltr retrotransposons do not form infectious particles that leave the cells and therefore only replicate inside their genome of origin their size ranges from a few hundred base pairs to 25kb like the ogre retrotransposon in the pea genome in plant genomes ltr retrotransposons are the major repetitive sequence class e g able to constitute more than 75 of the maize genome ltr retrotransposons have direct long terminal repeat that range from 100 bp to over 5 kb in size ltr retrotransposons are further sub classified into the ty1 copia like pseudoviridae ty3 gypsy like metaviridae and bel pao like groups based on both their degree of sequence similarity and the order of encoded gene products ty1 copia and ty3 gypsy groups of retrotransposons are commonly found in high copy number up to a few million copies per haploid nucleus in animals fungi protista and plants genomes bel pao like elements have so far only been found in animals all functional ltr retrotransposons encode a minimum of

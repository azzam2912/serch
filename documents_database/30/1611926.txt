the biomarkers can be used to diagnose alzheimer s disease ad in a very early stage but they also provide objective and reliable measures of disease progress it is imperative to diagnose ad disease as soon as possible because neuropathologic changes of ad precede the symptoms by years it is well known that beta amyloid a is a good indicator of ad disease which has facilitated doctors to accurately pre diagnose cases of ad disease when a peptide is released by proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein some a peptides that are solubilized are detected in csf and blood plasma which makes ab peptides a promising candidate for biological markers it has been shown that the beta amyloid biomarker shows 80 or above sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing ad from dementia it is believed that beta amyloid as a biomarker will provide a future for diagnosis of ad and eventually treatment of ad a is composed of a family of peptides produced by proteolytic cleavage of the type i transmembrane spanning glycoprotein amyloid precursor protein app senile plaque a protein species ends in residue 40 or 42 but it is suspected that a 42 form is crucial in the pathogenesis

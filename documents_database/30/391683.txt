most notably brandon carter showed in 1968 that the magnetic moment of such an object would match that of an electron this is interesting because calculations ignoring special relativity and treating the electron as a small rotating sphere of charge give a magnetic moment that is off by roughly a factor of 2 the so called gyromagnetic ratio however carter s calculations also show that a would be black hole with these parameters would be super extremal thus unlike a true black hole this object would display a naked singularity meaning a singularity in spacetime not hidden behind an event horizon it would also give rise to closed timelike curves standard quantum electrodynamics qed currently the most comprehensive theory of particles treats the electron as a point particle there is no evidence that the electron is a black hole or naked singularity furthermore since the electron is quantum mechanical in nature any description purely in terms of general relativity is inadequate hence the existence of a black hole electron remains strictly theoretical a paper published in 1938 by albert einstein leopold infeld and banesh hoffmann showed that if elementary particles are treated as singularities in spacetime it is unnecessary to

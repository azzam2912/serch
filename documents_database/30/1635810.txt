that is it is a regular grid of cells each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells the time reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule possibly on a much larger neighborhood several methods are known for defining cellular automata rules that are reversible these include the block cellular automaton method in which each update partitions the cells into blocks and applies an invertible function separately to each block and the second order cellular automaton method in which the update rule combines states from two previous steps of the automaton when an automaton is not defined by one of these methods but is instead given as a rule table the problem of testing whether it is reversible is solvable for block cellular automata and for one dimensional cellular automata but is undecidable for other types of cellular automata reversible cellular automata form a natural model of reversible computing a technology

an important special case is that every continuous function from a bounded closed interval to the real numbers is uniformly continuous suppose that formula 1 and formula 2 are two metric spaces with metrics formula 3 and formula 4 respectively suppose further that formula 5 is continuous and that formula 1 is compact we want to show that formula 7 is uniformly continuous that is for every formula 8 there exists formula 9 such that for all points formula 10 in the domain formula 1 formula 12 implies that formula 13 fix some positive formula 8 then by continuity for any point formula 15 in our domain formula 1 there exists a positive real number formula 17 such that formula 18 when formula 19 is within formula 20 of formula 15 let formula 22 be the open formula 23 neighborhood of formula 15 i e the set since each point formula 15 is contained in its own formula 22 we find that the collection formula 28 is an open cover of formula 1 since formula 1 is compact this cover has a finite subcover that subcover must be of the form for some finite set of points formula 32 each

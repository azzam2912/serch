the carrier underlying set associated with a unit type can be any singleton set there is an isomorphism between any two such sets so it is customary to talk about the unit type and ignore the details of its value one may also regard the unit type as the type of 0 tuples i e the product of no types the unit type is the terminal object in the category of types and typed functions it should not be confused with the zero or bottom type which allows no values and is the initial object in this category similarly the boolean is the type with two values the unit type is implemented in most functional programming languages the void type that is used in some imperative programming languages serves some of its functions but because its carrier set is empty it has some limitations as detailed below several computer programming languages provide a unit type to specify the result type of a function with the sole purpose of causing a side effect and the argument type of a function that does not require arguments in c c c d and java codice 19 is used to designate a function that

this would be the last time the band would use the shortened moniker rez although a variety of band members have contributed songs to the rez catalog over the years this is the first rez album completely written by a single individual in this case bassist roy montroy ever since silence screams rez stock in trade has been blues based hard rock and this album keeps to that formula without exception as a result critical reaction to this album was mixed the primary difference between this album and the three prior efforts is that the lyrics are more personal in nature centering on individuals and events that took place within and without the jesus people usa community in urban chicago numbers focuses on a vietnam veteran who represents all the broken disenfranchised individuals that jpusa ministers to every day while empty hearts which kicks off the album with a stirring duet between co lead singers glenn and wendi kaiser is about a death that actually took place just outside the kaisers apartment window on a brighter note dead to the world is an uplifting story of a drug addicted prostitute whose conversion to christ changed her life completely all songs

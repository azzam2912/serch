this is one of the most important factors in understanding human group differences in iq test scores and other measures of cognitive ability it is estimated that genes contribute about 20 40 of the variance in intelligence in childhood and about 80 in old age thus the environment and its interaction with genes account for a high proportion of the variation in intelligence seen in groups of young children and for a small proportion of the variation observed in groups of mature adults historically there has been great interest in the field of intelligence research to determine environmental influences on the development of cognitive functioning in particular fluid intelligence as defined by its stabilization at 16 years of age despite the fact that intelligence stabilizes in early adulthood it is thought that genetic factors come to play more of a role in our intelligence during middle and old age and that the importance of the environment dissipates as babies our neuronal connections are completely undifferentiated neurons make connections with neighboring neurons and these become more complex and more idiosyncratic as the child ages up until the age of 16 when this process halts this is also the time frame for

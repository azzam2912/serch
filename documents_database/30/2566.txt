it is usually accessed by a microsequencer early types of control store took the form of diode arrays that were accessed via address decoders but were later implemented as writable microcode that was stored in a form of read only memory called a writable control store the outputs generally had to go through a register to prevent a race condition from occurring the register was clocked by the clock signal of the system it was running on early control stores were implemented as a diode array accessed via address decoders a form of read only memory this tradition dates back to the program timing matrix on the mit whirlwind first described in 1947 modern vlsi processors instead use matrices of field effect transistors to build the rom and or pla structures used to control the processor as well as its internal sequencer in a microcoded implementation ibm system 360 used a variety of techniques ccros card capacitor read only storage on the model 30 tros transformer read only storage on the model 40 and bcros balanced capacitor read only storage on the model 50 some computers were built using writable microcode rather than storing the microcode in rom or hard

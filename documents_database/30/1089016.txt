the il represents the level of trustworthiness of an object this mechanism s goal is to use pre existing integrity control policies and the involved objects il to selectively restrict the access permissions in contexts that are considered to be potentially less trustworthy compared with other contexts running under the same user account that are more trusted mandatory integrity control is defined using a new access control entry ace type to represent the object s il in its security descriptor in windows access control lists acls are used to grant access rights read write and execute permissions and privileges to users or groups an il is assigned to a subject s access token when initialized when the subject tries to access an object for example a file the security reference monitor compares the integrity level in the subject s access token against the integrity level in the object s security descriptor windows restricts the allowed access rights depending on whether the subject s il is higher or lower than the object and depending on the integrity policy flags in the new access control entry ace the security subsystem implements the integrity level as a mandatory label to distinguish it from

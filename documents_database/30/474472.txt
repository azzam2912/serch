translational and rotational motions cancel at the pivot when an impulsive blow is struck at the center of percussion the center of percussion is often discussed in the context of a bat racquet door sword or other extended object held at one end the same point is called the center of oscillation for the object suspended from the pivot as a pendulum meaning that a simple pendulum with all its mass concentrated at that point will have the same period of oscillation as the compound pendulum in sports the center of percussion of a bat or racquet is related to the so called sweet spot but the latter is also related to vibrational bending of the object imagine a rigid beam suspended from a wire by a fixture that can slide freely along the wire at point p as shown in the figure an impulsive blow is applied from the left if it is below the center of mass cm it will cause the beam to rotate counterclockwise around the cm and also cause the cm to move to the right the center of percussion cp is below the cm if the blow falls above the cp the rightward translational

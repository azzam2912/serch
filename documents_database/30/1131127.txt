coli and m tuberculosis genomes in humans this enzyme is encoded by the phgdh gene 3 phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase catalyzes the transition of 3 phosphoglycerate into 3 phosphohydroxypyruvate which is the committed step in the phosphorylated pathway of l serine biosynthesis it is also essential in cysteine and glycine synthesis which lie further downstream this pathway represents the only way to synthesize serine in most organisms except plants which uniquely possess multiple synthetic pathways nonetheless the phosphorylated pathway that phgdh participates in is still suspected to have an essential role in serine synthesis used in the developmental signaling of plants because of serine and glycine s role as neurotrophic factors in the developing brain phgdh has been shown to have high expression in glial and astrocyte cells during neural development 3 phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase works via an induced fit mechanism to catalyze the transfer of a hydride from the substrate to nad a required cofactor in its active conformation the enzyme s active site has multiple cationic residues that likely stabilize the transition state of the reaction between the negatively charged substrate and nad the positioning is such that the substrate s alpha carbon and the c4 of the nicotinamide ring are

they are characterised by the presence of a ring of interlocking cytoskeletal denticles which provide support for the cell and allow for adhesion to surfaces including fish tissue trichodinids are members of the peritrichous ciliates a paraphyletic group within the oligohymenophorea specifically they are mobiline peritrichs because they are capable of locomotion as opposed to sessiline peritrichs such as vorticella and epistylis which adhere to the substrate via a stalk or lorica there are over 150 species in the genus trichodina trichodinella tripartiella hemitrichodina paratrichodina and vauchomia are similar genera trichodinids are round ciliates that may be disc shaped or hemispherical the cytostome cell mouth is on the surface that faces away from the host this is termed the oral surface the other side or aboral surface attaches to the skin of the host or other substrate there is a spiral of cilia leading towards the cytostome and several rings of cilia at the periphery of the cell responsible for creating adhesive suction and locomotory power in the taxonomy of trichodinids the exact number shape and arrangement of the cytoskeletal denticles is critical for determining taxonomic relationships these characters are usually revealed by silver nitrate staining of microscope slides which

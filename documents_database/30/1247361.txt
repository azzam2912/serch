azurin moderates single electron transfer between enzymes associated with the cytochrome chain by undergoing oxidation reduction between cu i and cu ii each monomer of an azurin tetramer has a molecular weight of approximately 14kda contains a single copper atom is intensively blue and has a fluorescence emission band centered at 308 nm azurins and pseudoazurins participate in the denitrification processes in bacteria including the gram negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa by interacting with cytochrome c551 azurin from p aeruginosa is a type i blue copper protein cupredoxin while cytochrome c551 9 kda is a haem containing cytochrome azurin possesses a relatively large hydrophobic patch close to the active site and two residues in this hydrophobic patch met 44 and met 64 are believed to be involved in its interaction with the redox partners cytochrome c551 and nitrite reductase although unrelated to its electron transfer property azurin has been found to have anticancer properties through its interaction with tumor suppressor protein p53 in its oxidized form azurin cuaz receives an electron from its redox partner and is reduced according to the following reaction cuaz e cuaz the redox potential is 310 mv the highly interconnected beta sheet structure of azurin is

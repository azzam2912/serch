coal refining or upgrading technologies are typically pre combustion treatments and or processes that alter the characteristics of a coal before it is burned the goals of pre combustion coal upgrading technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when coal is burned depending on the situation pre combustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to post combustion technologies to control emissions from coal fueled boilers a primary benefit of refined coal is the capacity to reduce the net volume of carbon emissions that is currently emitted from power generators and would reduce the amount of emissions that is proposed to be managed via emerging carbon sequestration methodologies refined coal technologies have primarily been developed in the united states several similar technologies have been researched developed and tested in victoria australia including the densified coal technology coldry process developed to alter the chemical bonds of brown coal to create a product that is cleaner stable not prone to spontaneous combustion exportable and of sufficiently high calorific value to be a black coal equivalent coal upgrading technology refers to a class of technologies developed to remove moisture and certain pollutants from low rank coals such as

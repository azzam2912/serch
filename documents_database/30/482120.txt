the carry select adder is simple but rather fast having a gate level depth of formula 3 the carry select adder generally consists of two ripple carry adders and a multiplexer adding two n bit numbers with a carry select adder is done with two adders therefore two ripple carry adders in order to perform the calculation twice one time with the assumption of the carry in being zero and the other assuming it will be one after the two results are calculated the correct sum as well as the correct carry out is then selected with the multiplexer once the correct carry in is known the number of bits in each carry select block can be uniform or variable in the uniform case the optimal delay occurs for a block size of formula 4 when variable the block size should have a delay from addition inputs a and b to the carry out equal to that of the multiplexer chain leading into it so that the carry out is calculated just in time the formula 3 delay is derived from uniform sizing where the ideal number of full adder elements per block is equal to the square root of

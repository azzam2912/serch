its cumulative distribution function is the logistic function which appears in logistic regression and feedforward neural networks it resembles the normal distribution in shape but has heavier tails higher kurtosis the logistic distribution is a special case of the tukey lambda distribution the probability density function of the logistic distribution is given by because this function can be expressed in terms of the square of the hyperbolic secant function sech it is sometimes referred to as the sech square d distribution the logistic distribution receives its name from its cumulative distribution function which is an instance of the family of logistic functions the cumulative distribution function of the logistic distribution is also a scaled version of the hyperbolic tangent in this equation x is the random variable is the mean and s is a scale parameter proportional to the standard deviation the inverse cumulative distribution function quantile function of the logistic distribution is a generalization of the logit function its derivative is called the quantile density function they are defined as follows an alternative parameterization of the logistic distribution can be derived by expressing the scale parameter formula 17 in terms of the standard deviation formula 18 using the substitution

while this is a noble goal in reality it typically fragments into multiple models it is useful to recognize this fact of life and work with it strategic design is a set of principles for maintaining model integrity distilling the domain model and working with multiple models multiple models are in play on any large project yet when code based on distinct models is combined software becomes buggy unreliable and difficult to understand communication among team members becomes confusing it is often unclear in what context a model should not be applied therefore explicitly define the context within which a model applies explicitly set boundaries in terms of team organization usage within specific parts of the application and physical manifestations such as code bases and database schemas keep the model strictly consistent within these bounds but don t be distracted or confused by issues outside when a number of people are working in the same bounded context there is a strong tendency for the model to fragment the bigger the team the bigger the problem but as few as three or four people can encounter serious problems yet breaking down the system into ever smaller contexts eventually loses a valuable

it was the successor to the ferranti mark 1 adding a floating point unit for improved performance and increased reliability by replacing the williams tube memory with core memory and using more solid state components the computer had roughly 2000 vacuum tubes mostly type cv2179 a2134 pentodes el81 pentodes and cv2493 ecc88 double triodes and 2000 germanium diodes nineteen mercuries were sold before ferranti moved on to newer designs when the mark i started running in 1951 reliability was poor the primary concern was the drum memory system which broke down all the time additionally the machine used 4 200 thermionic valves mostly ef50 pentodes and diodes that had to be replaced constantly the williams tubes used as random access memory and registers were reliable but required constant maintenance as soon as the system went into operation teams started looking at solutions to these problems one team decided to produce a much smaller and more cost effective system built entirely with transistors it first ran in november 1953 and is believed to be the first entirely transistor based computer metropolitan vickers later built this commercially as the metrovick 950 delivering seven at the time transistors were very expensive compared to

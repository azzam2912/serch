the theory is also often referred to by the acronym mog mo dified g ravity scalar tensor vector gravity theory also known as modified gravity mog is based on an action principle and postulates the existence of a vector field while elevating the three constants of the theory to scalar fields in the weak field approximation stvg produces a yukawa like modification of the gravitational force due to a point source intuitively this result can be described as follows far from a source gravity is stronger than the newtonian prediction but at shorter distances it is counteracted by a repulsive fifth force due to the vector field stvg has been used successfully to explain galaxy rotation curves the mass profiles of galaxy clusters gravitational lensing in the bullet cluster and cosmological observations without the need for dark matter on a smaller scale in the solar system stvg predicts no observable deviation from general relativity the theory may also offer an explanation for the origin of inertia stvg is formulated using the action principle in the following discussion a metric signature of formula 1 will be used the speed of light is set to formula 2 and we are using the

it uses keccak a hash function eventually standardized to sha 3 these two are different and should not be confused since version 1 0 ethash has been designed to be asic resistant via memory hardness harder to implement in special asic chips and easily verifiable it also uses a slightly modified version of earlier dagger and hashimoto hashes to remove computational overhead previously referred to as dagger hashimoto the ethash function has evolved over time ethash uses an initial 1 gb dataset known as the ethash dag and a 16 mb cache for light clients to hold these are regenerated every 30 000 blocks known as an epoch miners grab slices of the dag to generate mix hashes using transaction and receipt data along with a cryptographic nonce to generate a hash below a dynamic target difficulty in april 2018 the first asic miners for ethash the asic resistant hash were announced by bitmain fear of over influence from bitmain and 51 attacks prompted discussions of bricking the devices forcing asic miners into hard mode mining or continuing or expediting development and eventual release of casper vitalik buterin the co founder ethereum considers asic miners to not be a threat

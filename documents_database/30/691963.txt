it gets the energy it needs to run from temperature and atmospheric pressure changes in the environment and can run for years without human intervention the clock is driven by a mainspring which is wound by the expansion and contraction of liquid and gaseous ethyl chloride in an internal hermetically sealed bellows the ethyl chloride vaporises into an expansion chamber as the temperature rises compressing a spiral spring with a fall in temperature the gas condenses and the spring slackens this motion constantly winds the mainspring a temperature variation of only one degree in the range between and or a pressure variation of 3 mmhg is sufficient for two days operation in order to run the clock on this small amount of energy everything inside the atmos has to work in as friction free a manner as possible for timekeeping it uses a torsion pendulum which consumes less energy than an ordinary pendulum the torsion pendulum has a period of precisely one minute thirty seconds to rotate in one direction and thirty seconds to return to the starting position this is thirty times slower than the 0 994 m 39 1 in seconds pendulum typically found in a longcase clock

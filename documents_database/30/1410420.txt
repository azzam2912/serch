in the southwestern part of mainland this sequence can be seen to rest unconformably on a moinian type metamorphic basement metamorphic rocks are exposed near stromness and yesnaby on mainland and on graemsay most of the basement consists of granitic gneisses and later minor intrusions these rocks are similar to those seen in northern caithness and have been correlated with the loch eil group of the late proterozoic moine sequence the unconformity at the base of the overlying devonian rocks is highly irregular with the exposed basement forming hills in this buried land surface the stratigraphic breakdown of the devonian sequence has traditionally been into lower middle and upper ors due to a general lack of biostratigraphic control these divisions are now known to approximate to the lower middle and upper divisions of the devonian rocks of probable lower devonian age are exposed near yesnaby on western mainland a ridge of granitic basement divides the hara ebb formation a sequence of breccias conglomerates and sandstones deposited in an alluvial fan setting from the yesnaby sandstone which was deposited in an aeolian setting the contact with the overlying middle devonian lacustrine lower stromness flagstones is an angular unconformity most of the

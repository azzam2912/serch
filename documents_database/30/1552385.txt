they are a special case of circuits the object is a labeled directed acyclic graph the nodes of which evaluate to sets of natural numbers the leaves are finite sets and the gates are set operations or arithmetic operations as an algorithmic problem the problem is to find if a given natural number is an element of the output node or if two circuits compute the same set decidability is still an open question a natural number circuit is a circuit i e a labelled directed acyclic graph of in degree at most 2 the nodes of in degree 0 the leaves are finite sets of natural numbers the labels of the nodes of in degree 1 are where formula 1 and the labels of the nodes of in degree 2 are and where formula 2 formula 3 and and with the usual set meaning the subset of circuits which do not use all of the possible labels are also studied one can ask for circuits which use all the labels all these problems are equivalent the first problem is reducible to the second one by taking the intersection of the output gate and n indeed the new output get

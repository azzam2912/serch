intended to offer structural simplifications when compared with monoplanes it had a disappointing performance and was soon abandoned in a long series of single engine fighters built by dewoitine from the d 1 of 1922 to the 1940 d 521 the dewoitine d 15 was the only biplane an attempt to design a competitive but structurally less complicated machine it was a single bay biplane with wings of unequal span mounted without stagger braced by pairs of outward sloping parallel interplane struts cross wire bracing and n form cabane struts ailerons were fitted only on the longer upper wing in plan the unswept wings had constant chord and straight edges ending in angled tips they were metal structures entirely fabric covered the d 15 s tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage was similar in plan and structure to the wing the fin and rudder were triangular the latter mounted on a rudder post only just ahead of the tailplane trailing edge extended down to the keel the d 15 s flat sided fuselage had steel longerons and duralumin tube cross members the sides were fabric covered but the curved ventral and dorsal decking was metal the front of its

aperture rank currently goes approximately by the usable physical aperture size and not by aperture synthesis although interferometers attained some of the highest angular resolutions at visible and infrared wavelengths compared to traditional telescopes diverging methods of construction and use for reflecting telescopes in that area make comparing synthesized aperture irregular for instance keck i or ii alone has less angular resolution than the keck interferometer keck i ii together however the keck interferometer is used for a much narrower range of type of observations ultimately a valid comparison between two telescopes must take into consideration more specifications when a general measurement becomes obtuse aperture of the primary mirror alone can be poor measure of a reflective telescope s significance for example the hubble space telescope has only a primary mirror in addition many large or significant telescopes are not optical and or reflecting however many famous optical telescopes have had large apertures on their primary mirror with corresponding good angular resolution including optical observatories including uv visible and some optical infrared telescopes near infrared covers from about 1901 to 2001 with some flexibility to accommodate ambiguity in classification for example some 2002 telescope if it was nearly operation in

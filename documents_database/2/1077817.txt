this is achieved by dynamically controlling the turbine tip clearance during normal cruise flight the engine is exposed to many loads such as intense heat and centrifugal force this causes expansion of certain components and alters the gap between the turbine casing and tips of the spinning turbine blades the amount of air leaking around past the edge of the blades without passing through them is critical to engine performance and fuel efficiency for this reason since the late 1960s blade tip sealing has taken on a prominent role in aircraft engine design the acc system dynamically controls the high pressure turbine hpt blade clearance this can be achieved in numerous ways hpt high pressure turbine blade tip clearance has a significant impact on fuel burn and emissions blade tip sealing has been a challenging problem since the development of the gas turbine engine it is such because the clearance between the blade tips and surrounding casing shroud tends to vary due primarily to changes in thermal and mechanical loads on the rotating turbine wheel and stationary stator turbine casing structures using acc gives significant benefits in cruise fuel burn range and payload capability for long range aircraft one common

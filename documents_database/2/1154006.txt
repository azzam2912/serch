this is intended to improve the response time for applications such as web portals geo replication can be achieved using software hardware or a combination of the two geo replication software is a network performance enhancing technology that is designed to provide improved access to portal or intranet content for uses at the most remote parts of large organizations it is based on the principle of storing complete replicas of portal content on local servers and then keeping the content on those servers up to date using heavily compressed data updates geo replication technologies are used to provide replication of the content of portals intranets web applications content and data between servers across wide area networks wan to allow users at remote sites to access central content at lan speeds geo replication software can improve the performance of data networks that suffer limited bandwidth latency and periodic disconnection terabytes of data can be replicated over a wide area network giving remote sites faster access to web applications geo replication software uses a combination of data compression and content caching technologies differencing technologies can also be employed to reduce the volume of data that has to be transmitted to keep portal

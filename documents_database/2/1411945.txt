a table formula 1 is subject to a join dependency if formula 1 can always be recreated by joining multiple tables each having a subset of the attributes of formula 1 if one of the tables in the join has all the attributes of the table formula 1 the join dependency is called trivial the join dependency plays an important role in the fifth normal form also known as project join normal form because it can be proven that if a scheme formula 5 is decomposed in tables formula 6 to formula 7 the decomposition will be a lossless join decomposition if the legal relations on formula 5 are restricted to a join dependency on formula 5 called formula 10 another way to describe a join dependency is to say that the relationships in the join dependency are independent of each other unlike in the case of functional dependencies there is no sound and complete axiomatization for join dependencies though axiomatization exist for more expressive dependency languages such as full typed dependencies however implication of join dependencies is decidable let formula 5 be a relation schema and let formula 12 be a decomposition of formula 5 the relation formula 14

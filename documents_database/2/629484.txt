these nonclassic eicosanoids are generally short lived being rapidly converted from epoxides to less active or inactive dihydroxy eicosatrienoic acids dihetres by a widely distributed cellular enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase seh also termed epoxide hydrolase 2 the eets consequently function as transiently acting short range hormones that is they work locally to regulate the function of the cells that produce them i e they are autocrine agents or of nearby cells i e they are paracrine agents the eets have been most studied in animal models where they show the ability to lower blood pressure possibly by a stimulating arterial vasorelaxation and b inhibiting the kidney s retention of salts and water to decrease intravascular blood volume in these models eets prevent arterial occlusive diseases such as heart attacks and brain strokes not only by their anti hypertension action but possibly also by their anti inflammatory effects on blood vessels their inhibition of platelet activation and thereby blood clotting and or their promotion of pro fibrinolytic removal of blood clots with respect to their effects on the heart the eets are often termed cardio protective beyond these cardiovascular actions that may prevent various cardiovascular diseases studies have implicated the eets

the tool advocated by plato in these constructions is a divider or collapsing compass that is a compass that collapses whenever it is lifted from a page so that it may not be directly used to transfer distances the modern compass with its fixable aperture can be used to transfer distances directly and so appears to be a more powerful instrument however the compass equivalence theorem states that any construction via a modern compass may be attained with a collapsing compass this can be shown by establishing that with a collapsing compass given a circle in the plane it is possible to construct another circle of equal radius centered at any given point on the plane this theorem is proposition ii of book i of euclid s elements the proof of this theorem has had a chequered history the following construction and proof of correctness are given by euclid in his elements although there appear to be several cases in euclid s treatment depending upon choices made when interpreting ambiguous instructions they all lead to the same conclusion and so specific choices are given below given points a b and c construct a circle centered at a with radius the

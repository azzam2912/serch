it contains the major subgroups avialae deinonychosauria oviraptorosauria and therizinosauria ornitholestes and the alvarezsauroidea are also often included together with the next closest sister group the ornithomimosauria maniraptora comprises the more inclusive clade maniraptoriformes maniraptorans first appear in the fossil record during the jurassic period see eshanosaurus and are regarded as surviving today as living birds maniraptorans are characterized by long arms and three fingered hands though reduced or fused in some lineages as well as a half moon shaped semi lunate bone in the wrist carpus maniraptorans are the only dinosaurs known to have breast bones ossified sternal plates in 2004 tom holtz and halszka osm lska pointed out six other maniraptoran characters relating to specific details of the skeleton unlike most other saurischian dinosaurs which have pubic bones that point forward several groups of maniraptorans have an ornithischian like backwards pointing hip bone a backward pointing hip characterizes the therizinosaurs dromaeosaurids avialans and some primitive troodontids the fact that the backward pointing hip is present in so many diverse maniraptoran groups has led most scientists to conclude that the primitive forward pointing hip seen in advanced troodontids and oviraptorosaurs is an evolutionary reversal and that these groups evolved

the transform can be easily extended to multidimensional signals such as images where the time domain is replaced with the space domain this algorithm was introduced in 1989 by st phane mallat it has as theoretical foundation the device of a finitely generated orthogonal multiresolution analysis mra in the terms given there one selects a sampling scale j with sampling rate of 2 per unit interval and projects the given signal f onto the space formula 1 in theory by computing the scalar products where formula 3 is the scaling function of the chosen wavelet transform in practice by any suitable sampling procedure under the condition that the signal is highly oversampled so is the orthogonal projection or at least some good approximation of the original signal in formula 1 the mra is characterised by its scaling sequence and its wavelet sequence some coefficients might be zero those allow to compute the wavelet coefficients formula 10 at least some range k m j 1 without having to approximate the integrals in the corresponding scalar products instead one can directly with the help of convolution and decimation operators compute those coefficients from the first approximation formula 11 for the discrete wavelet

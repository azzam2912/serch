department of energy doe built from 1978 through 1984 and officially shut down on september 30 2014 the nsls was considered a second generation synchrotron the nsls experimental floor consists of two electron storage rings an x ray ring and a vuv vacuum ultraviolet ring which provide intense focused light spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from the infrared through x rays the properties of this light and the specially designed experimental stations called beamlines allow scientists in many fields of research to perform experiments not otherwise possible at their own laboratories ground was broken for the nsls on september 28 1978 the vuv ring began operations in late 1982 and the x ray ring was commissioned in 1984 in 1986 a second phase of construction expanded the nsls by which added offices laboratories and room for new experimental equipment after 32 years of producing synchrotron light the final stored beam was dumped at 16 00 edt on 30 september 2014 and nsls was officially shut down during the construction of the nsls two scientists renate chasman and george kenneth green invented a special periodic arrangement of magnetic elements a magnetic lattice to provide optimized bending and focusing of electrons the design

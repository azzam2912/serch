nurture debate as the human species exhibits sexual dimorphism many traits show significant variation not just between populations but also between the sexes human variability is attributed to a combination of environmental and genetic sources including for the genetic variables listed above few of them are controlled by simple mendelian inheritance most are polygenic or are determined by a complex combination of genetics and environment many genetic differences polymorphisms have little effect on health or reproductive success but help to distinguish one population from another it is helpful for researchers in the field of population genetics to study ancient migrations and relationships between population groups other important factors of environmental factors include climate and disease climate has effects on determining what kinds of human variation are more adaptable to survive without much restrictions and hardships for example people who live in a climate where there is a lot of exposure to sunlight have a darker color of skin tone evolution has caused production of folate folic acid from uv radiation thus giving them darker skin tone with more melanin to make sure child development is smooth and successful conversely people who live farther away from the equator have a lighter

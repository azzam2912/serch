mary magdalene there is some uncertainty over the name of the founder the obituary of the convent calendar states that richard holte and christina his wife the daughter of thomas cobreth founded the house and geoffrey fitz peter founded the first church but leland states that the founders were roger cobreth and his son thomas the cobreth family clearly had close associations with the priory since various members were benefactors and one dame diana cobreth had her heart buried before the high altar the original temporary church or chapel was replaced in 1234 by a stone church founded by richard de herriard several other members of the de herriard family were benefactors of the convent in 1316 the priory s finances were in a poor state due to negligence and poor administration and the nuns were dispersing since no provisions were being made for their food this was perhaps related to the famines of 1315 and subsequent years the archbishop of canterbury instituted a commission with full powers to visit the nunnery and to inquire correct reform and punish the excesses of delinquents this seems to have turned matters around by the 1320s however in 1398 and again in 1404

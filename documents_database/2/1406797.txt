a formula is satisfiable if it is possible to find an interpretation model that makes the formula true a formula is valid if all interpretations make the formula true the opposites of these concepts are unsatisfiability and invalidity that is a formula is unsatisfiable if none of the interpretations make the formula true and invalid if some such interpretation makes the formula false these four concepts are related to each other in a manner exactly analogous to aristotle s square of opposition the four concepts can be raised to apply to whole theories a theory is satisfiable valid if one all of the interpretations make s each of the axioms of the theory true and a theory is unsatisfiable invalid if all one of the interpretations make s each of the axioms of the theory false it is also possible to consider only interpretations that make all of the axioms of a second theory true this generalization is commonly called satisfiability modulo theories the question whether a sentence in propositional logic is satisfiable is a decidable problem in general the question whether sentences in first order logic are satisfiable is not decidable in universal algebra and equational theory the methods

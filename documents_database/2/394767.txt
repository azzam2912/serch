the possible conformations are combinations of anti conformations and gauche conformations and are anti anti anti gauche gauche gauche and gauche gauche of which the last one is especially energetically unfavorable in macromolecules such as polyethylene pentane interference occurs between every fifth carbon atom the 1 3 diaxial interactions of cyclohexane derivatives is a special case of this type of interaction although there are additional gauche interactions shared between substituents and the ring in that case a clear example of the syn pentane interaction is apparent in the diaxial versus diequatorial heats of formation of cis 1 3 dialkyl cyclohexanes relative to the diequatorial conformer the diaxial conformer is 2 3 kcal mol higher in energy than the value that would be expected based on gauche interactions alone pentane interference helps explain molecular geometries in many chemical compounds product ratios and purported transition states one specific type of syn pentane interaction is known as 1 3 allylic strain or a strain for instance in certain aldol adducts with 2 6 disubstituted aryl groups the molecular geometry has the vicinal hydrogen atoms in an antiperiplanar configuration both in a crystal lattice x ray diffraction and in solution proton nmr coupling constants

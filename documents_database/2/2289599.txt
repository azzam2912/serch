tricarbon monosulfide is a heterocumulene or thiocumulene consisting of a straight chain of three carbon atoms and a terminal sulfur atom the dipole moment of tricarbon monosulfide is 3 704 debye the bond lengths are 1 275 for terminal c c bond 1 292 for internal bond and 1 535 for the c s bond the similar bond lengths between the carbon atoms indicate they each have a double bond nature the rotational constants for cccs are b 2890 38000 mhz and d 0 00022416 there is a characteristic infrared absorption band at 2047 5 cm due to stretching of a c c bond along with the related dicarbon monosulfide ccs tricarbon monosulfide was made by a glow discharge though carbon disulfide vapour in helium microwave emission lines from rotational transitions matched up with previously unknown molecular lines from the taurus molecular cloud 1 maximal concentrations occurred with a carbon disulfide pressure of 0 02 torr in molecular clouds the formation mechanism is speculated to be ccs ch cccs h on dust grains in space the formation mechanism is theorised to be ccc hs c hsh cccs h when irradiated with visible or uv light this reaction has been reproduced

k boehme regular operators are a subclass of mikusi ski operators that are defined as equivalence classes of convolution quotients of functions on formula 1 the original construction of boehmians gives us a space of generalized functions that includes all regular operators and has the algebraic character of convolution quotients on the other hand it includes all distributions eliminating the restriction of regular operators to formula 1 since the boehmians were introduced in 1981 the framework of boehmians has been used to define a variety of spaces of generalized functions on formula 3 and generalized integral transforms on those spaces it was also applied to function spaces on other domains like locally compact groups and manifolds let formula 4 be an arbitrary nonempty set and let formula 5 be a commutative semigroup acting on formula 4 let formula 7 be a collection of sequences of elements of formula 5 such that the following two conditions are satisfied 1 if formula 9 then formula 10 2 if formula 11 and formula 12 for some formula 13 and all formula 14 then formula 15 now we define a set of pairs of sequences formula 16 in formula 17 we introduce an equivalence

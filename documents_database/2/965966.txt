the technique is extremely useful in current laboratory practice because it provides a rapid and inexpensive access to custom made oligonucleotides of the desired sequence whereas enzymes synthesize dna and rna only in a 5 to 3 direction chemical oligonucleotide synthesis does not have this limitation although it is most often carried out in the opposite 3 to 5 direction currently the process is implemented as solid phase synthesis using phosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from protected 2 deoxynucleosides da dc dg and t ribonucleosides a c g and u or chemically modified nucleosides e g lna or bna to obtain the desired oligonucleotide the building blocks are sequentially coupled to the growing oligonucleotide chain in the order required by the sequence of the product see synthetic cycle below the process has been fully automated since the late 1970s upon the completion of the chain assembly the product is released from the solid phase to solution deprotected and collected the occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits for the length of synthetic oligonucleotides up to about 200 nucleotide residues because the number of errors accumulates with the length of the oligonucleotide being synthesized products are often isolated by

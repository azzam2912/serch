quantum tunnelling is not predicted by the laws of classical mechanics where surmounting a potential barrier requires enough potential energy quantum tunnelling plays an essential role in several physical phenomena such as the nuclear fusion that occurs in main sequence stars like the sun it has important applications in the tunnel diode quantum computing and in the scanning tunnelling microscope the effect was predicted in the early 20th century and its acceptance as a general physical phenomenon came mid century fundamental quantum mechanical concepts are central to this phenomenon which makes quantum tunnelling one of the novel implications of quantum mechanics quantum tunneling is projected to create physical limits to the size of the transistors used in microprocessors due to electrons being able to tunnel past them if the transistors are too small tunnelling is often explained in terms of the heisenberg uncertainty principle that the quantum object can be known as a wave or as a particle in general quantum tunnelling was developed from the study of radioactivity which was discovered in 1896 by henri becquerel radioactivity was examined further by marie curie and pierre curie for which they earned the nobel prize in physics in 1903 ernest rutherford

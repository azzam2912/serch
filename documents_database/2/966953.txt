it also maintains a message retransmission list mrl routing table entries contain distance to a destination node the previous and next nodes along the route and is tagged to identify the route s state whether it is a simple path loop or invalid route storing the previous and successive nodes assists in detecting loops and avoiding the counting to infinity problem a shortcoming of distance vector routing the link cost table maintains the cost of the link to its nearest neighbors nodes within direct transmission range and the number of timeouts since successfully receiving a message from the neighbor nodes periodically exchange routing tables with their neighbors via update messages or whenever the link state table changes the mrl maintains a list of which neighbors are yet to acknowledged an update message so they can be retransmitted if necessary where no change in the routing table a node is required to transmit a hello message to affirm its connectivity when an update message is received a node updates its distance table and reassesses the best route paths it also carries out a consistency check with its neighbors to help eliminate loops and speed up convergence wrp has the same advantage

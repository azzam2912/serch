its primary function is packaging very long dna molecules into a more compact denser shape which prevents the strands from becoming tangled and plays important roles in reinforcing the dna during cell division preventing dna damage and regulating gene expression and dna replication during mitosis and meiosis chromatin facilitates proper segregation of the chromosomes in anaphase the characteristic shapes of chromosomes visible during this stage are the result of dna being coiled into highly condensed networks of chromatin the primary protein components of chromatin are histones which bind to dna and function as anchors around which the strands are wound in general there are three levels of chromatin organization many organisms however do not follow this organization scheme for example spermatozoa and avian red blood cells have more tightly packed chromatin than most eukaryotic cells and trypanosomatid protozoa do not condense their chromatin into visible chromosomes at all prokaryotic cells have entirely different structures for organizing their dna the prokaryotic chromosome equivalent is called a genophore and is localized within the nucleoid region the overall structure of the chromatin network further depends on the stage of the cell cycle during interphase the chromatin is structurally loose to allow access to

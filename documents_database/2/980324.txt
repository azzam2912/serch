the smith waterman algorithm serves as the basis for multi sequence comparisons identifying the segment with the maximum local sequence similarity see sequence alignment this algorithm is used for identifying similar dna rna and protein segments he was director of the biomolecular engineering research center at boston university for twenty years and is now professor emeritus smith obtained his bachelor s degree in 1963 from the physics department purdue university followed by a phd in 1969 in the physics department university of colorado at boulder after his phd smith did postdoctoral research from march 1969 to august 1971 in the department of biophysics and genetics university of colorado medical school boulder his research is centered on the application of various computer science and mathematical methods for the discovery of the syntactic and semantic patterns in nucleic acid and amino acid sequences in recent years this has focus on molecular evolution of protein families such as the wd repeat beta propellers translation associated gtpase and the ribosomal proteins he is known for the creation of the smith waterman algorithm smith has held the following appointments smith was awarded the iscb senior scientist award and elected iscb fellow in 2009 by the

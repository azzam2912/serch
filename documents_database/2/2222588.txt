the power law for cache misses was first established by c k chow in his 1974 paper supported by experimental data on hit ratios for stack processing by richard mattson in 1971 the power law of cache misses can be used to narrow down the cache sizes to practical ranges given a tolerable miss rate as one of the early steps while designing the cache hierarchy for a uniprocessor system the power law for cache misses can be stated as where m is the miss rate for a cache of size c and m is the miss rate of a baseline cache the exponent is workload specific and typically ranges from 0 3 to 0 7 the power law can only give an estimate of the miss rate only up to a certain value of cache size a large enough cache eliminates capacity misses and increasing the cache size further will not reduce the miss rate any further contrary to the power law s prediction the validity of the power law of cache misses also depends on the size of working memory set in a given process and also on the temporal re reference pattern of cache blocks in a

conventional alcoholic fermentation involves crushing the grapes to free the juice and pulp from the skin with yeast serving to convert sugar into ethanol carbonic maceration ferments most of the juice while it is still inside the grape although grapes at the bottom of the vessel are crushed by gravity and undergo conventional fermentation the resulting wine is fruity with very low tannins it is ready to drink quickly but lacks the structure for long term aging in the most extreme case such as with beaujolais nouveau the period between picking and bottling can be less than six weeks during carbonic maceration an anaerobic environment is created by pumping carbon dioxide into a sealed container filled with whole grape clusters the carbon dioxide gas permeates through the grape skins and begins to stimulate fermentation at an intracellular level the entire process takes place inside each single intact berry ethanol is produced as a by product of this process but studies have shown that other unique chemical reactions take place that have a distinctive effect on the wine the process of carbonic maceration occurs naturally in a partial state without deliberate intervention and has occurred in some form throughout history if

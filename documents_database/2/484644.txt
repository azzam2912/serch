while an ordinary camera captures light across three wavelength bands in the visible spectrum red green and blue rgb spectral imaging encompasses a wide variety of techniques that go beyond rgb spectral imaging may use the infrared the visible spectrum the ultraviolet x rays or some combination of the above it may include the acquisition of image data in visible and non visible bands simultaneously illumination from outside the visible range or the use of optical filters to capture a specific spectral range it is also possible to capture hundreds of wavelength bands for each pixel in an image multispectral imaging captures a small number of spectral bands typically three to fifteen through the use of varying filters and illumination many off the shelf rgb cameras will detect a small amount of near infrared nir light a scene may be illuminated with nir light and simultaneously an infrared passing filter may be used on the camera to ensure that visible light is blocked and only nir is captured in the image industrial military and scientific work however uses sensors built for the purpose hyperspectral imaging is another subcategory of spectral imaging which combines spectroscopy and digital photography in hyperspectral imaging

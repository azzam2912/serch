it has various descriptions all of which are of algorithmic nature it has many remarkable properties and it has applications in combinatorics and other areas such as representation theory the correspondence has been generalized in numerous ways notably by knuth to what is known as the robinson schensted knuth correspondence and a further generalization to pictures by zelevinsky the simplest description of the correspondence is using the schensted algorithm a procedure that constructs one tableau by successively inserting the values of the permutation according to a specific rule while the other tableau records the evolution of the shape during construction the correspondence had been described in a rather different form much earlier by robinson in an attempt to prove the littlewood richardson rule the correspondence is often referred to as the robinson schensted algorithm although the procedure used by robinson is radically different from the schensted algorithm and almost entirely forgotten other methods of defining the correspondence include a nondeterministic algorithm in terms of jeu de taquin the bijective nature of the correspondence relates it to the enumerative identity where formula 2 denotes the set of partitions of or of young diagrams with squares and denotes the number of standard

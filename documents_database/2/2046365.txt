the reversal of jupiter s migration is likened to the path of a sailboat changing directions tacking as it travels against the wind the planetesimal disk is truncated at 1 0 au by jupiter s migration limiting the material available to form mars jupiter twice crosses the asteroid belt scattering asteroids outward then inward the resulting asteroid belt has a small mass a wide range of inclinations and eccentricities and a population originating from both inside and outside jupiter s original orbit debris produced by collisions among planetesimals swept ahead of jupiter may have driven an early generation of planets into the sun in the grand tack hypothesis jupiter underwent a two phase migration after its formation migrating inward to 1 5 au before reversing course and migrating outward jupiter s formation took place near the ice line at roughly 3 5 au after clearing a gap in the gas disk jupiter underwent type ii migration moving slowly toward the sun with the gas disk if uninterrupted this migration would have left jupiter in a close orbit around the sun like recently discovered hot jupiters in other planetary systems saturn also migrated toward the sun but being smaller it migrated

silk in its raw state consists of two main proteins sericin and fibroin with a glue like layer of sericin coating two singular filaments of fibroin called brins the silk worm produces fibroin with three chains the light heavy and the glycoprotein p25 the heavy and light chains are linked by a disulphide bond and p25 associates with disulphide linked heavy and light chains by noncovalent interactions p25 is plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the complex the heavy fibroin protein consists of layers of antiparallel beta sheets its primary structure mainly consists of the recurrent amino acid sequence gly ser gly ala gly ala the high glycine and to a lesser extent alanine content allows for tight packing of the sheets which contributes to silk s rigid structure and tensile strength a combination of stiffness and toughness make it a material with applications in several areas including biomedicine and textile manufacture fibroin is known to arrange itself in three structures called silk i ii and iii silk i is the natural form of fibroin as emitted from the bombyx mori silk glands silk ii refers to the arrangement of fibroin molecules in spun silk which has greater

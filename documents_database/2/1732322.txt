the length measures 2 2 mm the whorls of the protoconch are small completely obliquely immersed in the first post nuclear turn above which the tilted edge of the last volution only projects the five whorls of the teleoconch are slightly rounded strongly tabulatedly shouldered at the summit and decidedly sulcate at the periphery they are marked by strong well rounded curved somewhat retractive axial ribs of which 22 occur upon the second 26 upon the third and 30 upon the penultimate turn on the first they are obsolete the intercostal spaces are well impressed about as wide as the ribs the posterior edge of the peripheral sulcus coincides with the summits of the whorls which render the sutures profoundly channeled the sulcus is bordered on each side by a well rounded slender spiral cord which forms low tubercles at the junction with the ribs the peripheral sulcus is crossed by the undiminished axial ribs which break it up into a series of deep pits the base of the body whorl is somewhat attenuated with a shallow pit at the umbilical region it is marked by the continuations of the axial ribs which here have a decidedly retractive slant and

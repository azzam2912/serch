it then encodes the ramification data for prime ideals of the ring of integers it was introduced by richard dedekind in 1882 if o is the ring of integers of k and tr denotes the field trace from k to the rational number field q then is an integral quadratic form on o its discriminant as quadratic form need not be 1 in fact this happens only for the case k q define the inverse different or codifferent or dedekind s complementary module as the set i of x k such that tr xy is an integer for all y in o then i is a fractional ideal of k containing o by definition the different ideal is the inverse fractional ideal i it is an ideal of o the ideal norm of is equal to the ideal of z generated by the field discriminant d of k the different of an element of k with minimal polynomial f is defined to be f if generates the field k and zero otherwise we may write where the run over all the roots of the characteristic polynomial of other than itself the different ideal is generated by the differents of all

this is in contrast to disc integration which integrates along the axis parallel to the axis of revolution the shell method goes as follows consider a volume in three dimensions obtained by rotating a cross section in the plane around the axis suppose the cross section is defined by the graph of the positive function on the interval then the formula for the volume will be if the function is of the coordinate and the axis of rotation is the axis then the formula becomes if the function is rotating around the line or the formulas become and the formula is derived by computing the double integral in polar coordinates consider the volume depicted below whose cross section on the interval 1 2 is defined by in the case of disk integration we would need to solve for given because the volume is hollow in the middle we will find two functions one that defines the inner solid and one that defines the outer solid after integrating these two functions with the disk method we subtract them to yield the desired volume with the shell method all we need is the following formula by expanding the polynomial the integral becomes

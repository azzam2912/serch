it records all the species found between two lines and how far they are for a certain place or area and how many of them there are an interrupted belt transect records all the species found in quadrats square frames placed at certain intervals along a line the belt transect method is similar to the line transect method but gives information on abundance as well as presence or absence of species it may be considered as a widening of the line transect to form a continuous belt or series of quadrats in this method the transect line is laid out across the area to be surveyed and a quadrat is placed on the first marked point on the line these marked points should be a set amount of space apart the plants and or animals inside the quadrat are then identified and their abundance estimated animals can be counted within the quadrat or collected while it is usual to estimate the percentage cover of plant species cover is the area of the quadrat occupied by the above ground parts of a species when viewed from above the canopies of the plants inside the quadrat will often overlap each other so

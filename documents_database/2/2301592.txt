this intronless gene encodes a member of the dnaj molecular chaperone homology domain containing protein family this gene is deleted in williams syndrome a multisystem developmental disorder caused by the deletion of contiguous genes at 7q11 23 the dnajc30 gene is an intronless gene composed of only one exon with the chromosome location 7q11 23 in humans its open reading frame orf consists of 681 bp in the human cdna and 660 bp in the mouse cdna which encode proteins of 226 and 219 residues respectively they are members of the dnaj molecular chaperone homology domain containing protein family dnajc30 is expressed in many tissues including the brain heart kidney liver lung spleen stomach and testis though no transcripts were found in colon small intestine and muscle this protein has been found to localize to the cytosol and mitochondria of cells though its exact biological function has yet to be elucidated the centromeric location of dnajc30 on the chromosome has led merla et al to postulate that it may contribute to functions such as subtle defects in cognition transient hypercalcemia and gastrointestinal problems experienced by williams beuren syndrome patients this gene is one of several contiguous genes located at 7q11

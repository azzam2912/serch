an active transformation is a transformation which actually changes the physical position alibi elsewhere of a point or rigid body which can be defined in the absence of a coordinate system whereas a passive transformation is merely a change in the coordinate system in which the object is described alias other name change of coordinate map or change of basis by transformation mathematicians usually refer to active transformations while physicists and engineers could mean either both types of transformation can be represented by a combination of a translation and a linear transformation put differently a passive transformation refers to description of the same object in two different coordinate systems on the other hand an active transformation is a transformation of one or more objects with respect to the same coordinate system for instance active transformations are useful to describe successive positions of a rigid body on the other hand passive transformations may be useful in human motion analysis to observe the motion of the tibia relative to the femur that is its motion relative to a local coordinate system which moves together with the femur rather than a global coordinate system which is fixed to the floor as an example

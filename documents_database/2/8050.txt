the arithmetic mean of a set of numbers x x x is typically denoted by formula 1 pronounced x bar if the data set were based on a series of observations obtained by sampling from a statistical population the arithmetic mean is the sample mean denoted formula 1 to distinguish it from the mean of the underlying distribution the population mean denoted formula 3 or formula 4 pronounced mew mju in probability and statistics the population mean or expected value are a measure of the central tendency either of a probability distribution or of the random variable characterized by that distribution in the case of a discrete probability distribution of a random variable x the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value that is it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of x and its probability p x and then adding all these products together giving formula 5 an analogous formula applies to the case of a continuous probability distribution not every probability distribution has a defined mean see the cauchy distribution for an example moreover for some distributions the mean is infinite for a

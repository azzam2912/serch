the project ended in 2002 when the advanced space transportation program was reorganized and all speculative research less than technology readiness level 3 was cancelled during its six years of operational funding this program received a total investment of 1 2 million the breakthrough propulsion physics project addressed a selection of incremental and affordable research questions towards the overall goal of propellantless propulsion hyperfast travel and breakthrough propulsion methods it selected and funded five external projects two in house tasks and one minor grant at the end of the project conclusions into fourteen topics including these funded projects were summarized by program manager marc g millis of these six research avenues were found to be nonviable four were identified as opportunities for continued research and four remain unresolved one in house experiment tested the schlicher thruster antenna claimed by schlicher to generate thrust no thrust was observed another experiment examined a gravity shielding mechanism claimed by podkletnov and nieminen experimental investigation on the bppp and other experiments found no evidence of the effect research on quantum tunneling was sponsored by the bppp it was concluded that this is not a mechanism for faster than light travel other approaches categorized as

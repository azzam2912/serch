like the unibus and q bus before it it uses memory mapped i o but has 32 bit address and data paths the vaxbi is a multiplexed bus with fully distributed arbitration and geographic addressing all of the logic required to implement a vaxbi interface is contained within a single custom integrated circuit the biic and the physical layout and printed wiring board layout for compliant cards is tightly specified right down to the location of the dual amber status leds that are required the portion of the card that is reserved for the bus interface is referred to as the vaxbi corner vaxbi licensees were given the appropriate engineering drawings to allow them to exactly replicate a compliant card vaxbi cards mount into backplanes using a zif connector depending on the backplane design cards can be loaded from the top or the front side of the backplane no cable connections are permitted on the cards all connections are made via three uncommitted rows of backplane connectors similarly no configuration jumpers are permitted on the cards all setup is done by jumpers inserted on the backplane connectors or via software configuration originally conceived by its engineers to be an open

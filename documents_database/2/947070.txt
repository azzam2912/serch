this increase can cause the drag coefficient to rise to more than ten times its low speed value the value of the drag divergence mach number is typically greater than 0 6 therefore it is a transonic effect the drag divergence mach number is usually close to and always greater than the critical mach number generally the drag coefficient peaks at mach 1 0 and begins to decrease again after the transition into the supersonic regime above approximately mach 1 2 the large increase in drag is caused by the formation of a shock wave on the upper surface of the airfoil which can induce flow separation and adverse pressure gradients on the aft portion of the wing this effect requires that aircraft intended to fly at supersonic speeds have a large amount of thrust in early development of transonic and supersonic aircraft a steep dive was often used to provide extra acceleration through the high drag region around mach 1 0 this steep increase in drag gave rise to the popular false notion of an unbreakable sound barrier because it seemed that no aircraft technology in the foreseeable future would have enough propulsive force or control authority to overcome

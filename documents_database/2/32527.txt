methylation is a form of alkylation with a methyl group rather than a larger carbon chain replacing a hydrogen atom these terms are commonly used in chemistry biochemistry soil science and the biological sciences in biological systems methylation is catalyzed by enzymes such methylation can be involved in modification of heavy metals regulation of gene expression regulation of protein function and rna processing in vitro methylation of tissue samples is also one method for reducing certain histological staining artifacts the counterpart of methylation is called demethylation in biological systems methylation is accomplished by enzymes methylation can modify heavy metals regulate gene expression rna processing and protein function it has been recognized as a key process underlying epigenetics the methylation cycle in medicine relates to the metabolism of various systems including dn and the production of glutathione faulty methylation cycle has been related to various abnormal conditions including myalgic encephalomyelitis me cfs methanogenesis the process that generates methane is the result of a series of methylation reactions these reactions are affected by a set of enzymes harbored by a family of anaerobic microbes in reverse methanogenesis methane serves as the methylating agent a wide variety of phenols undergo o methylation to

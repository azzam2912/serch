it carried instruments to measure temperature and velocity with taken at 1 khz temperature and conductivity taken at 100 hz and temperature conductivity pressure and dye concentration at 10 hz spurv ii was quite a bit different in its 1975 operational state than its final 1979 state the instrumentation and the internal recording system capacity were significantly increased and all of the sensors temperature and velocity at 1 khz temperature conductivity and velocity at 100 hz and more precisely temperature conductivity dye concentration and pressure depth at 10 hz could be recorded for up to 6 hours spurv ii was used to measure submarine wakes at the st croix tracking range in the coral trail experiment 1975 and again in hydro 1979 the 10 hz temperature and conductivity sensors were located at 1 3 2 3 and 1 meter vertically to accurately measure spatial and temporal correlations of temperature conductivity and velocity that were found in the wake dyed versus not in the wake no dye

the concept involved regauging existing gauge lines to standard gauge and linking them to the shinkansen network to allow through running while the track gauge was widened the loading gauge remained unchanged requiring the construction of new shinkansen trains with a narrower cross section these would be capable of running at high speed the e6 series trains have a maximum speed capability of 320 km h on shinkansen tracks either on their own or coupled to full sized sets and run at conventional narrow gauge speeds around 130 km h on the mini shinkansen tracks speeds on converted lines would also be raised where possible the first mini shinkansen route to be built was the yamagata shinkansen converted from the 87 1 km section of the u main line between fukushima on the tohoku shinkansen and yamagata in yamagata prefecture work started in 1988 with yamagata shinkansen services commencing on 1 july 1992 services were operated by a new fleet of 400 series shinkansen trains at up to 240 km h on the t hoku shinkansen and 130 km h on the yamagata shinkansen section the success of this initiative led to the conversion of a further 61 5 km

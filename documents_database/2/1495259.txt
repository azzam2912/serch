through a cube whose sides have length 1 without splitting the cube into two pieces its side length is approximately 6 larger than that of the unit cube through which it passes the problem of finding the largest square that lies entirely within a unit cube is closely related and has the same solution the original proposition posed by prince rupert of the rhine was that a cube could be passed through a hole made in another cube of the same size without splitting the cube into two pieces if two points are placed on two adjacent edges of a unit cube each at a distance of 3 4 from the point where the two edges meet then the distance between the two points will be these two points together with a second set of two points placed symmetrically on the opposite face of the cube form the four vertices of a square that lies entirely within the unit cube this square extruded in both directions perpendicularly to itself forms the hole through which a cube larger than the original one up to side length formula 2 may pass the parts of the unit cube that remain after emptying this

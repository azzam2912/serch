the result of such an arrangement is an elevated probability for an international conflagration since the case of an actor attacking another power would almost certainly trigger whether intentionally or not a multinational conflict potentially involving many more actors than the original two states which had attacked and been attacked respectively according to sworn agreements or treaties no member state has the option to refuse to participate in this involvement once the states have agreed to the alliance they are bound by obligation to join in the hostilities or conflagration as soon as they have begun in one state though this obligation is not always honoured an empirical example of the chain ganging dilemma is world war i when italy decided to part from the triple alliance both austria hungary and germany were alone for the most part in europe though bulgaria and the ottoman empire joined austria hungary and germany to form the central powers and surrounded by the allied powers the defeat of either of the two would severely weaken the remaining member according to kenneth waltz the defeat or defection of a major ally would have shaken the balance each state was constrained to adjust its strategy

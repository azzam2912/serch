it is also known as cacnl1a3 and the dihydropyridine receptor dhpr so named due to the blocking action dhp has on it this gene encodes one of the five subunits of the slowly inactivating l type voltage dependent calcium channel in skeletal muscle cells mutations in this gene have been associated with hypokalemic periodic paralysis thyrotoxic periodic paralysis and malignant hyperthermia susceptibility ca1 1 is a voltage dependent calcium channel found in the transverse tubule of muscles in skeletal muscle it associates with the ryanodine receptor ryr1 of the sarcoplasmic reticulum via a mechanical linkage it senses the voltage change caused by the end plate potential from nervous stimulation and propagated by sodium channels as action potentials to the t tubules it was previously thought that when the muscle depolarises the calcium channel opens allowing calcium in and activating ryr1 which mediates much greater calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum this is the first part of the process of excitation contraction coupling which ultimately causes the muscle to contract calcium entry through cav1 1 is not required in skeletal muscle as it is in cardiac muscle cav1 1 undergoes a conformational change which allosterically activates ryr1 in hypokalemic periodic paralysis

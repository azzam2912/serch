the nac flows northward east of the grand banks from 40 n to 51 n before turning sharply east to cross the atlantic it transports more warm tropical water to northern latitudes than any other boundary current more than 40 sv in the south and 20 sv as it crosses the mid atlantic ridge it reaches speeds of 2 knots near the north american coast directed by topography the nac meanders heavily but in contrast to the meanders of the gulf stream the nac meanders remain stable without breaking off into eddies the colder parts of the gulf stream turn northward near the tail of the grand banks at 50 w where the azores current branches off to flow south of the azores from there the nac flows northeastward east of the flemish cap 47 n 45 w approaching the mid atlantic ridge it then turns eastward and becomes much broader and more diffuse it then splits into a colder northeastern branch and a warmer eastern branch as the warmer branch turns southward most of the subtropical component of the gulf stream is diverted southward and as a consequence the north atlantic is mostly supplied by subpolar waters including a

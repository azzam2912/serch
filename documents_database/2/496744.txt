in econometrics it is most commonly used in time series analysis to test for the presence of a structural break at a period which can be assumed to be known a priori for instance a major historical event such as a war in program evaluation the chow test is often used to determine whether the independent variables have different impacts on different subgroups of the population suppose that we model our data as if we split our data into two groups then we have and the null hypothesis of the chow test asserts that formula 4 formula 5 and formula 6 and there is the assumption that the model errors formula 7 are independent and identically distributed from a normal distribution with unknown variance let formula 8 be the sum of squared residuals from the combined data formula 9 be the sum of squared residuals from the first group and formula 10 be the sum of squared residuals from the second group formula 11 and formula 12 are the number of observations in each group and formula 13 is the total number of parameters in this case 3 then the chow test statistic is the test statistic follows the f

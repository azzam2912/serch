although in the shikimate pathway arogenate and prephenate dehydrogenase catalyze different reactions they can at times be used interchangeably this enzyme so far has been found in sixteen different organisms twelve different kinds of bacteria mostly cyanobacteria and four different kinds of plants mostly different kinds of beans bacteria organisms examples acenitobacter calcoaceticus fischerella sp flavobacterium so comamonas testosteroni and nostoc sp plant organisms phaseolus coccineus phaseolus vulgaris vicia faba vigna radiata present in the shikimate pathway in the pathway to synthesize tyrosine a non essential amino acid in both plants and animals it catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation reaction of prephenate to 4 hydroxyphenylpyruvate in enzymology a prephenate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction thus the two substrates of this enzyme are prephenate and nad whereas its 3 products are 4 hydroxyphenylpyruvate co and nadh this enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases specifically those acting on the ch ch group of donor with nad or nadp as acceptor the systematic name of this enzyme class is prephenate nad oxidoreductase decarboxylating other names in common use include hydroxyphenylpyruvate synthase and chorismate mutase prephenate dehydrogenase this enzyme participates in phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and novobiocin biosynthesis also

the problem was that at various times in the 20th century some objects in the universe were estimated to be older than the time elapsed since the big bang as estimated from measurements of the expansion rate of the universe known as the hubble constant denoted h this is more correctly called the hubble parameter since it generally varies with time if so this would represent a contradiction since objects such as galaxies stars and planets could not have existed in the extreme temperatures and densities shortly after the big bang since around 1997 2003 the problem is believed to be solved by most cosmologists modern cosmological measurements lead to a precise estimate of the age of the universe i e time since the big bang of 13 8 billion years and recent age estimates for the oldest objects are either younger than this or consistent allowing for measurement uncertainties following theoretical developments of the friedmann equations by alexander friedmann and georges lema tre in the 1920s and the discovery of the expanding universe by edwin hubble in 1929 it was immediately clear that tracing this expansion backwards in time predicts that the universe had almost zero size at a

it was described by paolo ruffini in 1804 ruffini s rule is a special case of synthetic division when the divisor is a linear factor the rule establishes a method for dividing the polynomial by the binomial to obtain the quotient polynomial the algorithm is in fact the long division of p x by q x to divide p x by q x the b values are the coefficients of the result r x polynomial the degree of which is one less than that of p x the final value obtained s is the remainder the polynomial remainder theorem asserts that this remainder is equal to p r the value of the polynomial at r a worked example of polynomial division as described above let we want to divide p x by q x using ruffini s rule the main problem is that q x is not a binomial of the form x r but rather x r we must rewrite q x in this way now we apply the algorithm 1 write down the coefficients and r note that as p x didn t contain a coefficient for x we ve written 0 2 pass the first coefficient down

it evolved in the 1980s to meet increasing efficiency requirements for high power rf amplifiers in radio transmitters the primary commercial use of iots is in uhf television transmitters where they have mostly replaced klystrons because of their higher efficiencies 35 to 40 and smaller size iots are also used in particle accelerators they are capable of producing power output up to about 30 kw continuous and 7 mw pulsed and gains of 20 23 db at frequencies up to about a gigahertz the inductive output tube iot was invented in 1938 by andrew v haeff a patent was later issued for the iot to andrew v haeff and assigned to the radio corporation of america rca during the 1939 new york world s fair the iot was used in the transmission of the first television images from the empire state building to the fair grounds rca sold a small iot commercially for a short time under the type number 825 it was soon made obsolete by newer developments and the technology lay more or less dormant for years the inductive output tube has re emerged within the last twenty years after having been discovered to possess particularly suitable characteristics

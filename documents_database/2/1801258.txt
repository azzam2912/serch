it is the largest of the three sporadic conway groups and can be obtained as the quotient of co group of automorphisms of the leech lattice that fix the origin by its center which consists of the scalar matrices 1 it also appears at the top of the automorphism group of the even 26 dimensional unimodular lattice ii some rather cryptic comments in witt s collected works suggest that he found the leech lattice and possibly the order of its automorphism group in unpublished work in 1940 the outer automorphism group is trivial and the schur multiplier has order 2 co has 4 conjugacy classes of involutions these collapse to 2 in co but there are 4 elements in co that correspond to a third class of involutions in co an image of a dodecad has a centralizer of type 2 m 2 which is contained in a maximal subgroup of type 2 m an image of an octad or 16 set has a centralizer of the form 2 o 2 a maximal subgroup the smallest faithful permutation representation of co is on the 98280 pairs v v of norm 4 vectors there is a matrix representation of dimension 24

informally it states that two different analytic functions which do not grow very fast at infinity can not coincide at the integers the theorem may be obtained from the phragm n lindel f theorem which is itself an extension of the maximum modulus theorem carlson s theorem is typically invoked to defend the uniqueness of a newton series expansion carlson s theorem has generalized analogues for other expansions assume that satisfies the following three conditions the first two conditions bound the growth of at infinity whereas the third one states that vanishes on the non negative integers then is identically zero the first condition may be relaxed it is enough to assume that is analytic in continuous in and satisfies for some real values to see that the second condition is sharp consider the function it vanishes on the integers however it grows exponentially on the imaginary axis with a growth rate of and indeed it is not identically zero a result due to relaxes the condition that vanish on the integers namely rubel showed that the conclusion of the theorem remains valid if vanishes on a subset of upper density 1 meaning that this condition is sharp meaning that

that is given a matrix and a column vector of response variables the goal is to find here means that each component of the vector should be non negative and denotes the euclidean norm non negative least squares problems turn up as subproblems in matrix decomposition e g in algorithms for parafac and non negative matrix tensor factorization the latter can be considered a generalization of nnls another generalization of nnls is bounded variable least squares bvls with simultaneous upper and lower bounds the nnls problem is equivalent to a quadratic programming problem where and this problem is convex as is positive semidefinite and the non negativity constraints form a convex feasible set the first widely used algorithm for solving this problem is an active set method published by lawson and hanson in their 1974 book solving least squares problems in pseudocode this algorithm looks as follows this algorithm takes a finite number of steps to reach a solution and smoothly improves its candidate solution as it goes so it can find good approximate solutions when cut off at a reasonable number of iterations but is very slow in practice owing largely to the computation of the pseudoinverse variants of

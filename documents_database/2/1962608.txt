at the university of regensburg germany working with rainer rudolph and rainer jaenicke he performed his postdoctoral research in the lab of ira pastan at the national cancer institute of the national institutes of health in bethesda usa before becoming assistant professor at the university of regensburg and subsequently full professor and chair of biotechnology at the tum molecular chaperones are an essential class of proteins that aid other proteins to obtain their biologically active structure and inhibit off pathway side reactions during protein maturation buchner s work focuses on understanding mechanisms of molecular chaperones in a quantitative and mechanistic manner his work has contributed to our understanding of the chaperone cycle of the bacterial chaperone groel and now lays a particular emphasis on small heat shock proteins shsps the hsp90 chaperone machinery and the role of molecular chaperones in antibody folding buchner s work established shsps as molecular chaperones and has significantly contributed to our understanding of their function and mode of activation his work on antibody folding delivered important insight in the mechanisms of how antibodies fold and are scrutinized by the cellular chaperone machinery a major focus of johannes buchner s lab is the hsp90 chaperone machine

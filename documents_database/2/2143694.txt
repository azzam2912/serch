it was discovered by the scottish astronomer james dunlop on may 13 1826 who described it as a small well defined rather bright nebula about 20 in diameter the cluster is located 5 arc minutes east northeast of the star g scorpii and is some 44 000 light years from the sun this is one of the most massive and luminous globular clusters in the milky way with an estimated 1 6 million solar masses of stars it is located in the bulge of the galaxy at a distance of from the core and is considered metal rich that is it has a relatively high abundance of elements with higher mass than helium the core region of the cluster subtends an angle of 0 11 arc minutes compared to the half mass radius of 0 64 arc minutes the density of stars in the core region is indicated by the luminosity density the cluster has a half light radius of this cluster has an abnormally large number of rr lyrae variables 68 candidates as of 2006 and their periods are longer than is typical for their respective metallicities the mean period for the cluster s rrab stars is 0 759

specifically the information obtained will help address future human exploration objectives as dust sizes and shapes daily weather report and information on the radiation and wind patterns on mars that are critical for proper design of in situ resource utilization systems meda is a follow on project from rems of the curiosity rover mission meda has an increased scope with greater data collection on mars dust which contributes to overall mars program objectives and discovery goals the instrument suite is being developed and provided by the spanish astrobiology center at the spanish national research council in madrid spain the principal investigator is jos antonio rodr guez manfredi dust dominates mars weather the way that water dominates earth s weather martian weather cannot be predicted unless dust behavior is studied and understood in the weather context meda is a suite of environmental sensors designed to record dust optical properties and six atmospheric parameters wind speed direction pressure relative humidity air temperature ground temperature and radiation uv visible and ir ranges of the spectrum the technology used on meda was inherited from the rems package operating on the curiosity rover and the twins package on insight lander the sensors are located on

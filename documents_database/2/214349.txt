these sedimentary formations were deposited into the red basin 375 to 350 million years ago when active faults were altering the landscape the combined effects of wind from the tanami desert and rainfall over millions of years shaped the domes weathering also helped create this marvel water seeps into the rock and at night it expands as it gets colder this creates small cracks which eventually wears out the rock the range is found on the plains fringing the eastern kimberley region the ranges consist of stacks of ancient seabeds with layers of dolomite contained throughout them a diameter circular topographic feature is clearly visible on satellite images of the bungle bungle range it is believed that this feature is the eroded remnant of a very ancient meteorite impact crater and is known as the piccaninny impact structure the unusual orange and dark grey banding on the conical rock formations is caused by differences in the layers of sandstone the darker bands are on the layers of rock which hold more moisture and are a dark algal or cyanobacteria growth the orange colored layers are stained with iron and manganese mineral deposits contained within the sandstone the bungle bungle range

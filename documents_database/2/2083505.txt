first formed in 2001 the vpl is part of the nasa astrobiology institute nai and connects more than fifty researchers at twenty institutions together in an interdisciplinary effort vpl is also part of the nexus for exoplanet system science nexss network with principal investigator victoria meadows leading the nexss vpl team the first task considers observations of our solar system planets moons and the asteroid belt to explore processes necessary for habitable environments and for exoplanet model confirmation specifically observations of europa venus earth mars and the asteroid belt have helped researchers in task a address their goals our only data point of a habitable planet today is earth however our planet has not always been habitable the early earth serves as an example of an exoplanet the vpl research has contributed to the understanding of our early planet task b combines geological and biological data with ecosystem and photo chemical models to showcase how planet earth has changed throughout its history this task uses observational data models and orbital dynamics to explore the distribution of habitable worlds in the universe the vpl team studies the effects of galactic stellar and planetary environments on planetary habitability task d incorporates vpl

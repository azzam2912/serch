it often arises in the power analysis of statistical tests in which the null distribution is perhaps asymptotically a chi square distribution important examples of such tests are the likelihood ratio tests let formula 9 be k independent normally distributed random variables with means formula 10 and unit variances then the random variable is distributed according to the noncentral chi square distribution it has two parameters formula 12 which specifies the number of degrees of freedom i e the number of formula 13 and formula 14 which is related to the mean of the random variables formula 13 by formula 14 is sometimes called the noncentrality parameter note that some references define formula 14 in other ways such as half of the above sum or its square root this distribution arises in multivariate statistics as a derivative of the multivariate normal distribution while the central chi square distribution is the squared norm of a random vector with formula 19 distribution i e the squared distance from the origin of a point taken at random from that distribution the non central formula 8 is the squared norm of a random vector with formula 21 distribution here formula 22 is a zero

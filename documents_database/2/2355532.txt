in 2015 the department of energy nuclear science advisory committee nsac named the construction of an electron ion collider one of the top priorities for the near future in nuclear physics in the united states in the us both brookhaven national laboratory and thomas jefferson national accelerator facility have proposed designs for an eic in europe cern has plans for the lhec there are also chinese and russians plans for an electron ion collider brookhaven national laboratory s conceptual design erhic proposes upgrading the existing relativistic heavy ion collider which collides beams light to heavy ions including polarized protons with a polarized electron facility jefferson lab s conceptual design jleic formerly known as meic proposes upgrading the existing cebaf 12 gev electron accelerator with an electron ring built from magnets previously used in the pep ii accelerator and an ion complex built from new magnets the lhec would make use of the existing lhc accelerator and add an electron accelerator to collide electrons with the hadrons in order to allow understanding of spin dependence of the electron nucleon collisions both the ion beam and the electron beam must be polarized achieving and maintaining high levels of polarization is challenging nucleons

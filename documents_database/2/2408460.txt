it is distributed throughout the insect s internal body cavity the haemocoel in close proximity to the epidermis digestive organs and ovaries its main functions are nutrient storage and metabolism for which it is commonly compared to a combination of adipose tissue and liver in mammals however it may also serve a variety of other roles such as endocrine regulation systemic immunity vitellogenesis and housing of microbial symbionts its presence structure cellular composition location and functions vary widely among insects even between different species of the same genus or between developmental stages of the same individual with other specialized organs taking over some or all of its functions the fat body serves different roles including lipid storage and metabolism endocrine regulation and immunity the fat body is of mesodermal origin and is normally composed of a network of thin sheets ribbons or small nodules suspended in hemocoel by connective tissue and tracheae so that most of its cells are in direct contact with hemolymph the fat body has been best studied in insects nevertheless it has been identified in other arthropod phyla including chelicerata crustaceans and all major classes of myriapoda although not all subtaxa

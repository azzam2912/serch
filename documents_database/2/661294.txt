a number of techniques including fertilization by iron urea and phosphorus have been proposed john martin director of the moss landing marine laboratories hypothesized that the low levels of phytoplankton in these regions are due to a lack of iron to test this hypothesis known as the iron hypothesis he arranged an experiment using samples of clean water from antarctica iron was added to some of these samples after several days the phytoplankton in the samples with added iron grew much more than in the untreated samples this led martin to speculate that increased iron concentrations in the oceans could partly explain past ice ages this experiment was followed by a larger field experiment ironex i where 445 kg of iron was added to a patch of ocean near the gal pagos islands the levels of phytoplankton increased three times in the experimental area the success of this experiment and others led to proposals to use this technique to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

species of microcotyle are ectoparasites that affect their host by attaching themselves as larvae on the gills of the fish and grow into adult stage this larval stage is called oncomiracidium and is characterized as free swimming and ciliated species of microcotyle have only one host in their entire life cycle different species of microcotyle inhabit marine and freshwater and they can also infect different species of fishes they are uniquely characterized by their haptor having a lot of tiny clamps on the lateral margins although not really known to cause that much damage in marine wildlife some of them are reported to cause agricultural problems like microcotyle sebastis as an example microcotyle sebastis commonly affects sebastes schlegeli a maricultured fish in korea individuals of species of microcotyle like any typical polyopisthocotylean monogenean have an anterior organ called prohaptor which is mainly used for feeding and attachment although the prohaptor is not the primary attachment organ it is used to anchor the body of the parasite while the opisthaptor is being repositioned the opisthaptor is found in all microcotyle species and it is an important attachment organ that allows these ectoparasites to latch onto their hosts located at the anterior

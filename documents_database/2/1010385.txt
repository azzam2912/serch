theoretically intel also dropped support for intel s pentium 4 and pentium d processors with this chipset although late pentium 4 processors including both the 32 bit only 5x0 and the 32 bit 64 bit 5x1 and a few others were fully supported it is notable for providing the first commodity support of ddr3 sdram it also supports ddr2 sdram the choice is made by the motherboard manufacturer and some manufacturers supported both ddr3 and ddr2 on the same motherboard but only one memory type at a time often 4 ddr2 or 2 ddr3 as in the gigabyte ga ep35c ds3l r but ddr3 only models such as the gigabyte ga ep35t ds3l r and the ddr2 only models such as the gigabyte ga ep35 ds3l r were also made concurrently another notable point is that it does not provide parallel ata support most 2007 motherboards added pata support via a jmicron jmb361 or jmb363 chip

the abbreviation refers to the homologies to the caenorhabditis elegans sma small worm phenotype and drosophila mad mothers against decapentaplegic family of genes there are three distinct sub types of smads receptor regulated smads r smads common partner smads co smads and inhibitory smads i smads the eight members of the smad family are divided among these three groups trimers of two receptor regulated smads and one co smad act as transcription factors that regulate the expression of certain genes the r smads consist of smad1 smad2 smad3 smad5 and smad8 9 and are involved in direct signaling from the tgf b receptor smad4 is the only known human co smad and has the role of partnering with r smads to recruit co regulators to the complex finally smad6 and smad7 are i smads that work to suppress the activity of r smads while smad7 is a general tgf b signal inhibitor smad6 associates more specifically with bmp signaling r co smads are primarily located in the cytoplasm but accumulate in the nucleus following tgf b signaling where they can bind to dna and regulate transcription however i smads are predominantly found in the nucleus where they can act as

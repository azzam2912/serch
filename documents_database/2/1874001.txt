this replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process however real world data such as images video and sensor data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features an alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination without relying on explicit algorithms feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised supervised feature learning is learning features from labeled data the data label allows the system to compute an error term the degree to which the system fails to produce the label which can then be used as feedback to correct the learning process reduce minimize the error approaches include dictionary learning develops a set dictionary of representative elements from the input data such that each data point can be represented as a weighted sum of the representative elements the dictionary elements and the weights may be found by minimizing the average representation error over the input data together with l1 regularization on the weights to enable sparsity i

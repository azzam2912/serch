the massive ordnance penetrator and the improved version of the gbu 28 bomb known as egbu 28 it was developed in collaboration between the us air force and the ellwood national forge company the development of eglin steel was commissioned to find a low cost replacement for strong and tough but expensive superalloy steels such as af 1410 aermet 100 hy 180 and hp9 4 20 30 a high performance casing material is required so the weapon survives the high impact speeds required for deep penetration the material has a wide range of other applications from missile parts and tank bodies to machine parts the material can be less expensive because it can be ladle refined it does not require vacuum processing unlike some other high performance alloys eglin steel can be welded easily broadening the range of its application also it uses roughly half as much nickel as other superalloys substituting silicon to help with toughness and particles of vanadium carbide and tungsten carbide for additional hardness and high temperature strength the material also involves chromium tungsten and low to medium amounts of carbon which contribute to the material s strength and hardness at room temperature es 1 s

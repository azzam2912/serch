recorded in new york in 1985 and released on the relaunched blue note label the allmusic review by michael g nastos called it a most satisfying session with few if any commercial concessions and noted if any purist mainstream jazz listeners ever had problems with these musicians going for a buck by putting more r b into their music all is forgiven with the issuance of this marvelous album which is more of a showcase for their true colors and collective musicianship beyond their commercialized efforts burrell and washington proved to be a fine pairing a subtle effective jazz partnership a reviewer of dusty groove noted grover washington jr on blue note but sounding really great here in the company of guitarist kenny burrell very much back to the more basic reed work of his roots and away from some of the smoother settings of his bigger dates from a few years before kenny s well crafted guitar lines really direct the set spinning out with energy and soul and shaping the sound in tones that work especially well with washington s soprano sax lines all compositions by kenny burrell except where noted

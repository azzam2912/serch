however it was not all plain sailing with just 3 points from the first 6 games all was not looking good at the start of the campaign but a single defeat in the next 14 games put dumbarton back on track when the final game arrived against berwick rangers only a win could secure the championship while a draw would confirm promotion with a defeat consigning dumbarton to another season in the lower division all went well in front of a massive 9 000 home crowd a 4 2 win being recorded and first division football next season in the scottish cup dumbarton lost out to raith rovers in the fourth round the league cup at the start of the season was for some unknown reason a complete disaster after the previous season s success and a full squad to choose from dumbarton were unable to bring about a repeat and with a single win and a draw from the six sectional games there was to be no further interest in the competition the season commenced with a new sponsored competition the drybrough cup played for by the four top scoring sides from the two divisions in the previous season

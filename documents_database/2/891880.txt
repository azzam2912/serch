it is a deeply colored solid that is not soluble in basic water the name is often abbreviated as ppix the protoporphyrin ix molecule contains the porphine core a tetrapyrrole macrocycle that shows marked aromatic character the molecule is essentially planar except for the n h bonds that are bent out of the plane of the rings in opposite trans directions the general term protoporphyrin refers to porphine derivatives that have the outer hydrogen atoms in the four pyrrole rings replaced by four methyl groups m two vinyl groups v and two propionic acid groups p the roman numeral ix indicates that these chains occur in the circular order mv mv mp pm around the outer cycle the numbering of the variants is traditional and not entirely systematic the compound is encountered in nature in the form of complexes where the two inner hydrogen atoms are replaced by a divalent metal cation when complexed with an iron ii ferrous cation the molecule is called heme hemes are prosthetic groups in some important proteins these heme containing proteins include hemoglobin myoglobin and cytochrome c complexes can also be formed with other metal ions such as zinc the compound is synthesized from

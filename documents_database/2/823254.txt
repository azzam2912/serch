the songs on the album were written by paul kennerley and are performed by waylon jennings jessi colter john dillon and steve cash each singer took on a separate and distinct persona portraying different characters in an attempt to show the confederacy and the concept of southern pride through said characters eyes in essence therefore white mansions is a concept album eric clapton played guitar on several tracks the album charted at 38 on the country billboard chart and 181 on the billboard 200 in his autobiography waylon jennings claims kennerley was inspired to compose the songs after hearing that s why the cowboys sings the blues on london radio which had appeared on jennings 1975 lp dreaming my dreams and declared white mansions is a lovely record and it touched me in a deeply personal way as a man whose house is built on a civil war battlefield and a southerner though it probably went over the heads of its intended audience making the album was one of my most enjoyable experiences the album was re released in 1999 in a two for one package with the legend of jesse james a 1980 concept album conceived by kennerley the

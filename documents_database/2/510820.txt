the result of this union is the production of a zygote cell or fertilized egg initiating prenatal development scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century the process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum the most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation follows with ovulation and finishes with fertilization various exceptions to this sequence are possible including artificial insemination in vitro fertilization external ejaculation without copulation or copulation shortly after ovulation upon encountering the secondary oocyte the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg the sperm plasma then fuses with the egg s plasma membrane the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the fallopian tube to reach the uterus in vitro fertilization ivf is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb in vitro the sperm binds through the corona radiata a layer of follicle cells on the outside of the secondary oocyte fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell known as zygote the successful fusion of gametes forms a

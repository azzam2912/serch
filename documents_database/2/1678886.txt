the aerosphere is viewed as habitat and the way that organisms respond to and take advantage of the dynamic aeroscape has relevance to the ecology evolution and conservation of many of the world s bird bat insect and plant species the interactions and properties in the aerosphere the zone that is closest to the earth s surface provide selective pressures that influence the size and shape of organisms their behavioral sensory metabolic and respiratory functions in contrast to organisms that spend their entire lives on land or in water organisms that use the aerosphere are almost immediately affected by changing conditions such as winds air density oxygen concentrations precipitation air temperature sunlight polarized light moonlight and geomagnetic and gravitational forces aeroecology has relied upon traditional ecological field studies such as direct observation or detection of organisms flying overhead e g moon watching thermal cameras or bioacoustics however the field has been greatly advanced by the inclusion of remotely sensed data in particular doppler weather radar or nexrad in march 2012 an international and interdisciplinary radar aeroecology workshop was held at the national weather center on the university of oklahoma campus in norman ok usa experts in the fields of ecology

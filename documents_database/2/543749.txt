in general a midsegment of a triangle is a line segment which joins the midpoints of two sides of the triangle it is parallel to the third side and has a length equal to half the length of the third side the medial triangle can also be viewed as the image of triangle abc transformed by a homothety centered at the centroid with ratio 1 2 thus the sides of the medial triangle are half and parallel to the corresponding sides of triangle abc hence the medial triangle is inversely similar and shares the same centroid and medians with triangle abc it also follows from this that the perimeter of the medial triangle equals the semiperimeter of triangle abc and that the area is one quarter of the area of triangle abc furthermore the four triangles that the original triangle is subdivided into by the medial triangle are all mutually congruent by sss so their areas are equal and thus the area of each is 1 4 the area of the original triangle the orthocenter of the medial triangle coincides with the circumcenter of triangle abc this fact provides a tool for proving collinearity of the circumcenter centroid and orthocenter

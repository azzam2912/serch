each icosahedron is composed of twelve boron atoms two oxygen atoms are located in the interstices along the 111 rhombohedral direction due to its short interatomic bond lengths and strongly covalent character bo displays a range of outstanding physical and chemical properties such as great hardness close to that of rhenium diboride and boron nitride low mass density high thermal conductivity high chemical inertness and excellent wear resistance bo can be synthesized by reducing bo with boron or by oxidation of boron with zinc oxide or other oxidants these boron suboxide materials formed at or near ambient pressure are generally oxygen deficient and non stoichiometric bo xbo powders were usually used as starting materials in the reported methods for bo synthesis oxygen deficient boron suboxide bo xicosahedral particles which are neither single crystals nor quasicrystals but twinned groups of twenty tetrahedral crystals bo of the rhombohedral boron type has been investigated because of its ceramic nature hardness high melting point chemical stability and low density as a new structural material in addition to this these borides have unique bonding not easily accessible by the usual valence theory although an x ray emission spectroscopic method indicated a probable parameter range for

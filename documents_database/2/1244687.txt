the prototypes for this type of frame were the two locomotives imported in 1900 from baldwin locomotive works in the usa that had been similarly classified as the s 2 5 in 1904 maffei built ten engines that shared many of the same components as the s 3 5 which was developed in parallel for example they did not use a wider firebox which would have been possible given the wheel arrangement in order to be able to use one that could be used on the s 3 5 so the firebox was only around 90 mm wider than the bar frame of the locomotive for manufacturing reasons the sole bar was still not made of one piece but forged from several bars for the first time in bavaria a driving wheel diameter of 2 000 mm was chosen instead of the 1 870 mm diameter hitherto the norm for express train locomotives like the locomotives imported from the united states they had a four cylinder compound engine however the usual european von borries configuration with two inside and two outside cylinders was used instead of the vauclain compound system on test runs one of the locomotives reached 135 km

although rc 4000 itself was not very successful it was nevertheless extremely influential sparking the microkernel concept that dominated operating system research through the 1970s and 1980s the system is also known as monitor and somewhat confusingly simply rc 4000 depending on the reference for clarity this article will use the term monitor monitor was created largely by one programmer per brinch hansen who worked at regnecentralen where the rc 4000 was being designed leif svalgaard participated in the implementation and testing of monitor brinch hansen found that no existing operating system was suited to the new machine and was tired of having to adapt existing systems he felt that a better solution was to build an underlying kernel which he referred to as the nucleus that could be used to build up an operating system from interacting programs unix for instance uses small interacting programs for many tasks transferring data through a system known as pipes however a large amount of fundamental code is buried in the kernel itself notably things like file systems and program control monitor would remove this code as well making almost the entire system a set of interacting programs reducing the kernel nucleus to

knockout rats can mimic human diseases and are important tools for studying gene function functional genomics and for drug discovery and development the production of knockout rats was not economically or technically feasible until 2008 technology developed through funding from the national institutes of health nih and work accomplished by the members of the knock out rat consortium korc led to cost effective methods to create knockout rats the importance of developing the rat as a more versatile tool for human health research is evidenced by the 120 million investment made by the nih via the rat genome sequencing project consortium resulting in the draft sequence of a laboratory strain of the brown or norway rat rattus norvegicus additional developments with zinc finger nuclease technology in 2009 led to the first knockout rat with targeted germline transmitted mutations knockout rat disease models for parkinson s alzheimer s hypertension and diabetes using zinc finger nuclease technology are being commercialized by sage labs mice rats and humans share all but approximately 1 of each other s genes making rodents good model organisms for studying human gene function both mice and rats are relatively small easily handled have a short generation time and

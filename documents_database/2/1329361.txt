the coordinates time series which can be either in two dimensions x y or in three dimensions x y z is referred to as a trajectory the trajectory is typically analyzed using statistical methods to extract information about the underlying dynamics of the particle these dynamics can reveal information about the type of transport being observed e g thermal or active the medium where the particle is moving and interactions with other particles in the case of random motion trajectory analysis can be used to measure the diffusion coefficient in life sciences single particle tracking is broadly used to quantify the dynamics of molecules furthermore exogenous particles are employed as probes to assess the mechanical properties of the medium a technique known as passive microrheology this technique has been applied to investigate the motion of lipids and proteins within membranes molecules in the nucleus and cytoplasm organelles and molecules therein lipid granules vesicles and particles introduced in the cytoplasm or the nucleus additionally single particle tracking has been extensively used in the study of reconstituted lipid bilayers intermittent diffusion between 3d and either 2d e g a membrane or 1d e g a dna polymer phases and synthetic entangled actin

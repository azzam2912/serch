diamondoids also known as nanodiamonds or condensed adamantanes may include one or more cages adamantane diamantane triamantane and higher polymantanes as well as numerous isomeric and structural variants of adamantanes and polymantanes these diamondoids occur naturally in petroleum deposits and have been extracted and purified into large pure crystals of polymantane molecules having more than a dozen adamantane cages per molecule these species are of interest as molecular approximations of the diamond cubic framework terminated with c h bonds cyclohexamantane may be thought of as a nanometer sized diamond of approximately examples include one tetramantane isomer is the largest ever diamondoid prepared by organic synthesis using a keto carbenoid reaction to attach cyclopentane rings longer diamondoids have been formed from diamantane dicarboxylic acid the first ever isolation of a wide range of diamondoids from petroleum took place in the following steps a vacuum distillation above 345 c the equivalent atmospheric boiling point then pyrolysis at 400 to 450 c in order to remove all non diamondoid compounds diamondoids are thermodynamically very stable and will survive this pyrolysis and then a series of high performance liquid chromatography separation techniques in one study a tetramantane compound is fitted with thiol groups at

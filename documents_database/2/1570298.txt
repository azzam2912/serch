the theory was inspired by the wheeler feynman absorber theory for electrodynamics when feynman as a graduate student lectured on the wheeler feynman absorber theory in the weekly physics seminar at princeton albert einstein was in the audience and stated at question time that he was trying to achieve the same thing for gravity stephen hawking showed in 1965 that the theory is incompatible with an expanding universe because the wheeler feynman advanced solution would diverge however at that time the accelerating expansion of the universe was not known which resolves the divergence issue because of the cosmic event horizon the discovery of the accelerated expansion is fairly recent and it earned the nobel prize in 2011 the hoyle narlikar theory reduces to einstein s general relativity in the limit of a smooth fluid model of particle distribution constant in time and space hoyle narlikar s theory is consistent with some cosmological tests unlike the standard cosmological model the quasi steady state hypothesis implies the universe is eternal according to narlikar multiple mini bangs would occur at the center of quasars with various creation fields or c field continuously generating matter out of empty space due to local concentration of

by contrast an operation that may take an infinite number of input values is said to be infinitary in standard mathematics an operation is by definition finitary therefore these terms are used only in the context of infinitary logic a finitary argument is one which can be translated into a finite set of symbolic propositions starting from a finite set of axioms in other words it is a proof including all assumptions that can be written on a large enough sheet of paper by contrast infinitary logic studies logics that allow infinitely long statements and proofs in such a logic one can regard the existential quantifier for instance as derived from an infinitary disjunction the emphasis on finitary methods has historical roots in the early 20th century logicians aimed to solve the problem of foundations that is answer the question what is the true base of mathematics the program was to be able to rewrite all mathematics using an entirely syntactical language without semantics in the words of david hilbert referring to geometry it does not matter if we call the things chairs tables and beer mugs or points lines and planes the stress on finiteness came from the idea

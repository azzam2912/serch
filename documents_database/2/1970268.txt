the latter completed acquisition of the former s stake in 2013 its production involves gravity feeding a molten polymer composed of extruded polypropylene and other polyolefins through a four storey chamber this creates sheets of the substrate used as the base material by many central banks in the printing of polymer banknotes polypropylene is processed to create pellets these pellets are extruded from a core extruder in conjunction with polyolefin pellets from two skin layer extruders and are combined into a molten polymer this consists of a 37 5 m thick polypropylene sheet sandwiched between two 0 1 m polyolefin sheets creating a thin film 37 7 m thick the molten polymer undergoes snap cooling as it passes by gravity feeding through a brass mandrel which imparts on the thin film many properties including its transparency the cast tube material is then reheated and blown into a large bubble using air pressure and temperature at the base of the four storey chamber convergence rollers collapse the tube into a flat sheet consisting of two layers of the thin film this creates the base biaxially oriented polypropylene substrate of 75 4 m thickness called clarityc by innovia films the base substrate

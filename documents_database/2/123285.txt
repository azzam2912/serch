the most widely known type of matrix pseudoinverse is the moore penrose inverse which was independently described by e h moore in 1920 arne bjerhammar in 1951 and roger penrose in 1955 earlier erik ivar fredholm had introduced the concept of a pseudoinverse of integral operators in 1903 when referring to a matrix the term pseudoinverse without further specification is often used to indicate the moore penrose inverse the term generalized inverse is sometimes used as a synonym for pseudoinverse a common use of the pseudoinverse is to compute a best fit least squares solution to a system of linear equations that lacks a unique solution see below under applications another use is to find the minimum euclidean norm solution to a system of linear equations with multiple solutions the pseudoinverse facilitates the statement and proof of results in linear algebra the pseudoinverse is defined and unique for all matrices whose entries are real or complex numbers it can be computed using the singular value decomposition in the following discussion the following conventions are adopted for formula 21 a pseudoinverse of formula 22 is defined as a matrix formula 23 satisfying all of the following four criteria known as the

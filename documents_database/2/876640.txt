the closer the physical location of two genes on the dna the less likely they are to be separated by a crossing over event in the case of male drosophila there is complete absence of recombinant types due to absence of crossing over this means that all of the genes that start out on a single chromosome will end up on that same chromosome in their original configuration in the absence of recombination only parental phenotypes are expected genetic linkage is the tendency of alleles which are located closely together on a chromosome to be inherited together during the process of meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms during the process of meiosis homologous chromosomes pair up and can exchange corresponding sections of dna as a result genes that were originally on the same chromosome can finish up on different chromosomes this process is known as genetic recombination the rate of recombination of two discrete loci corresponds to their physical proximity alleles that are closer together have lower rates of recombination than those that are located far apart the distance between two alleles on a chromosome can be determined by calculating the percentage or recombination between two loci these probabilities of recombination

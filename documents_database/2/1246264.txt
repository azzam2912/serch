she is focused on understanding the molecular controls used by plants to seasonally judge when to flower she is specifically interested in vernalisation the acceleration of flowering in plants by exposure to periods of prolonged cold dean was educated at the university of york where she was awarded a bachelor of arts degree in biology in 1978 and a ph d in biology in 1982 dean s research has been funded by the biotechnology and biological sciences research council european research council eu marie curie and embo and focuses on research on gene regulation and the intersection of chromatin transcription and non coding rnas her goal is to understand the chromatin dynamics that enable switching between epigenetic states and quantitative regulation of gene expression this mechanistic analysis is focused on one gene encoding the floral repressor flc epigenetic switching and quantitative regulation of flc play a central role in seasonal timing in plants this acceleration of flowering by prolonged cold is a classic epigenetic process called vernalisation flc regulation involves an antisense mediated chromatin mechanism that coordinately influences transcription initiation and elongation as plants overwinter flc expression is then epigenetically silenced through a cold induced cis based polycomb switching mechanism

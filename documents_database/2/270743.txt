it is most important in western music theory where it represents the frequency ratio musical interval of a semitone in twelve tone equal temperament this number was proposed for the first time in relationship to musical tuning in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it allows measurement and comparison of different intervals frequency ratios as consisting of different numbers of a single interval the equal tempered semitone for example a minor third is 3 semitones a major third is 4 semitones and perfect fifth is 7 semitones a semitone itself is divided into 100 cents 1 cent formula 3 the twelfth root of two to 20 significant figures is fraction approximations in order of accuracy are and its numerical value has been computed to at least twenty billion decimal digits since a musical interval is a ratio of frequencies the equal tempered chromatic scale divides the octave which has a ratio of 2 1 into twelve equal parts applying this value successively to the tones of a chromatic scale starting from a above middle c known as a with a frequency of 440 hz produces the following sequence of pitches the final a a 880 hz is exactly twice the frequency

it has a combined apparent visual magnitude of 2 88 which is bright enough to be viewed with the naked eye based upon parallax measurements this system is located at a distance of roughly 640 light years 196 parsecs from earth this is a spectroscopic binary system which means that the presence of an orbiting companion has been revealed by radial velocity variations in the spectrum of the primary the two components are orbiting each other with a period of 14 days at a high orbital eccentricity of 0 55 the secondary component has about 6 13 of the primary s mass and may have a stellar classification in the range from a6 v to k1 v there may be a third component to this system with an orbital period of roughly 9 428 days 25 8 years although this has not been conclusively demonstrated if this component exists it would have about 51 139 of the primary s mass this high level of uncertainty is because the inclination of the orbit is not known the primary component of this system epsilon persei a is a massive star with 12 16 times the sun s mass and near eight times

this field develops computational and mathematical methods for solving problems pertaining to medical images and their use for biomedical research and clinical care the main goal of mic is to extract clinically relevant information or knowledge from medical images while closely related to the field of medical imaging mic focuses on the computational analysis of the images not their acquisition the methods can be grouped into several broad categories image segmentation image registration image based physiological modeling and others medical image computing typically operates on uniformly sampled data with regular x y z spatial spacing images in 2d and volumes in 3d generically referred to as images at each sample point data is commonly represented in integral form such as signed and unsigned short 16 bit although forms from unsigned char 8 bit to 32 bit float are not uncommon the particular meaning of the data at the sample point depends on modality for example a ct acquisition collects radiodensity values while a mri acquisition may collect t1 or t2 weighted images longitudinal time varying acquisitions may or may not acquire images with regular time steps fan like images due to modalities such as curved array ultrasound are also common

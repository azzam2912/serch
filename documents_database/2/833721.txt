they are used by viruses to insert their genetic material into the host genomes the ltrs are partially transcribed into an rna intermediate followed by reverse transcription into complementary dna cdna and ultimately dsdna double stranded dna with full ltrs the ltrs then mediate integration of the retroviral dna via an ltr specific integrase into another region of the host chromosome the first ltr sequences were derived by a p czernilofsky and j shine in 1977 and 1980 retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv use this basic mechanism as 5 and 3 ltrs are identical upon insertion the difference between paired ltrs can be used to estimate the age of ancient retroviral insertions this method of dating is used by paleovirologists though it fails to take into account confounding factors such as gene conversion and homologous recombination the hiv 1 ltr is 634 bp in length and like other retroviral ltrs is segmented into the u3 r and u5 regions u3 and u5 has been further subdivided according to transcription factor sites and their impact on ltr activity and viral gene expression the multi step process of reverse transcription results in the placement of two identical ltrs each consisting

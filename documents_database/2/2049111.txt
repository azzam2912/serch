376 7 ohms if a transmission line composed of straight parallel perfect conductors in free space is terminated by space cloth that is normal to the transmission line then that transmission line is terminated by its characteristic impedance the calculation of the characteristic impedance of a transmission line composed of straight parallel good conductors may be replaced by the calculation of the d c resistance between electrodes placed on a two dimensional resistive surface this equivalence can be used in reverse to calculate the resistance between two conductors on a resistive sheet if the arrangement of the conductors is the same as the cross section of a transmission line of known impedance for example a pad surrounded by a guard ring on a printed circuit board pcb is similar to the cross section of a coaxial cable transmission line the figure to the right shows a coaxial cable terminated by space cloth in the case of a closed structure like a coaxial cable the space cloth may be trimmed to the boundary of the outer conductor the computation of resistance between the conductors can be computed with 2d electromagnetic field solver methods including the relaxation method and analog methods using

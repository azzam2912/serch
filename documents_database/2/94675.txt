furthermore many interesting topological spaces can be embedded in the hilbert cube that is can be viewed as subspaces of the hilbert cube see below the hilbert cube is best defined as the topological product of the intervals 0 1 n for n 1 2 3 4 that is it is a cuboid of countably infinite dimension where the lengths of the edges in each orthogonal direction form the sequence formula 1 the hilbert cube is homeomorphic to the product of countably infinitely many copies of the unit interval 0 1 in other words it is topologically indistinguishable from the unit cube of countably infinite dimension if a point in the hilbert cube is specified by a sequence formula 2 with formula 3 then a homeomorphism to the infinite dimensional unit cube is given by formula 4 it is sometimes convenient to think of the hilbert cube as a metric space indeed as a specific subset of a separable hilbert space i e a hilbert space with a countably infinite hilbert basis for these purposes it is best not to think of it as a product of copies of 0 1 but instead as as stated above for topological properties

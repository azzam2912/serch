its purpose is to make lifting the load more efficient which saves energy and is less taxing on the lifting machine counterweights are often used in traction lifts elevators cranes and funfair rides in these applications the expected load multiplied by the distance that load will be spaced from the central support called the tipping point must be equal to the counterweight s mass times its distance from the tipping point in order to prevent over balancing either side this distance times mass is called the load moment a counterbalance is a weight or force that balances or offsets another as when two objects of equal weight power or influence are acting in opposition to each other the objects are then said to be in counterbalance trebuchet there are five major components of a trebuchet beam counterweight frame guide chute and sling after the counterweight drops from a platform on the frame gravity pulls the counterweight and pivots the beam without the counterweight the beam could not complete the arc that allows the sling to accurately release the projectile crankshaft a counterweight is also used in many rotating systems to reduce vibrations due to imbalances in the rotating assembly a

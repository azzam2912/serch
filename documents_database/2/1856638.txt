this differs from a natural circulation boiler which relies on current density to circulate water inside the boiler in some forced circulation boilers the water is circulated twenty times the rate of evaporation in water tube boilers the way the water is recirculated inside the boiler before becoming steam can be described as either natural circulation or forced circulation in a water tube boiler the water is recirculated inside until the vapor pressure of the water overcomes the vapor pressure inside the stream drum and becomes saturated steam the forced circulation boiler begins the same as a natural circulation boiler at the feed water pump water is introduced into the steam drum and is circulated around the boiler leaving only as steam what makes the forced circulation boiler different is its use of a secondary pump that circulates water through the boiler the secondary pump takes the feed water going to the boiler and raises the pressure of the water going in in a natural circulation boilers the circulation of water is dependent on the differential pressures caused by the change of density in the water as it is heated that is to say that as the water is heated

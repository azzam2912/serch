and administered intravenously as the sodium salt eritoran tetrasodium toll like receptors tlrs play an important role in the innate immune system they recognise microbes and activate inflammatory immune responses toll like receptor 4 tlr4 detects lipopolysaccharides found in most gram negative bacteria because of its similarity to the lipopolysaccharide lipid a eritoran acts as tlr4 antagonist and so blocks the excessive reaction triggered by this receptor while eritoran did not perform well in the treatment of sepsis it was shown to combat another related phenomenon called cytokine storm in influenza cases involving certain virus strains involving preliminary experimentation on mice not in other animals or humans led by a university of maryland school of medicine researcher a further study in mice and rats by the same group showed it prevented acute lung injury a cytokine storm can help to cause sepsis and can in concert with it or by itself cause serious illness or death if not soon controlled mortality rates for sepsis cytokine storm and especially septic shock and organ dysfunction are still quite high despite progress made this is in no small part due to the prevalence of nosocomial hospital acquired infections as well as ongoing mutations

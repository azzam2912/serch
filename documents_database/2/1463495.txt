swine sea mammals and felines serve as natural hosts there are currently only two species in this genus including the type species vesicular exanthema of swine virus diseases associated with this genus include respiratory disease feline calicivirus fcv conjunctivitis and respiratory disease other unofficial vesi like viruses include canine calicivirus san miguel sealion virus vesivirus cro1 and walrus calicivirus virions consist of a capsid virus capsid is non enveloped and are round with icosahedral symmetry and triangulation number t 3 the isometric capsid has a diameter of 35 39 nm empty virions have diameter of 23 nm with triangulation number t 1 the capsid surface structure reveals a regular pattern with distinctive features including 32 cup shaped depressions the capsomer arrangement is clearly visible viral replication is cytoplasmic entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors which mediates endocytosis replication follows the positive stranded rna virus replication model positive stranded rna virus transcription is the method of transcription translation takes place by rna termination reinitiation swine sea mammals and felines serve as the natural host transmission routes are air borne particles the molecular mass mr of virions is 15 x 106 virions have a buoyant density

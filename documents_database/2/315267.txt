introduced in the fall of 1932 for the 1933 models it was pontiac s most powerful engine at the time and the least expensive eight cylinder engine built by an american automotive manufacturer during its 21 year run displacement of the eight increased twice as platforms grew it was superseded by pontiac s new v8 the 287 in 1955 the straight 8 was dubbed the silver streak at pontiac division powered by the eight a pontiac was promoted as a likable automobile with enough power under the hood to get the job done in affordable luxury however by the early 1950s overhead valve v8s from sister divisions cadillac buick and oldsmobile as well as new overhead valve v8s from ford motor company and chrysler corporation made the silver streak all but obsolete in power it was a quiet smooth running engine that served the needs of the 1930s and 40s american consumer adequately for power if not reliability or economy but by 1954 the engine was decidedly eclipsed not only by competing auto makers but by general motors own divisions products as well further hamstringing the silver streak was the aged but cheap to produce flathead configuration interesting to note

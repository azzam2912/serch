the gyron junior was a scaled down derivative of the de havilland gyron the gyron junior was a two fifths flow scale version of the existing gyron engine it started as project study number 43 in 1954 and the first prototype ran in august 1955 it powered the blackburn buccaneer s 1 twin engined naval strike aircraft the engine was rather unreliable and considered short of thrust the later buccaneer s 2 used the more powerful rolls royce spey engine the engine had variable inlet guide vanes as used on many other engines necessary for accelerating from idle to high thrust however on the gyron junior positioning of the vanes was not reliable and could cause surging which in turn could prevent accelerating to higher thrust levels a possibly unique feature on this engine was valve controlled cooling air to the turbine blades the engine had to supply air for the aircraft s boundary layer control system and the resulting thrust loss was unacceptable to regain the thrust the turbine temperature limit was raised by using turbine blade cooling selected only with blowing on in december 1970 a buccaneer was lost after one engine surged and failed to accelerate on

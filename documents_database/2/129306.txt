these play a central role in morphogenesis the creation of body structures which in turn is central to evolutionary developmental biology evo devo the regulator can be dna rna protein and complexes of these the interaction can be direct or indirect through transcribed rna or translated protein in general each mrna molecule goes on to make a specific protein or set of proteins in some cases this protein will be structural and will accumulate at the cell membrane or within the cell to give it particular structural properties in other cases the protein will be an enzyme i e a micro machine that catalyses a certain reaction such as the breakdown of a food source or toxin some proteins though serve only to activate other genes and these are the transcription factors that are the main players in regulatory networks or cascades by binding to the promoter region at the start of other genes they turn them on initiating the production of another protein and so on some transcription factors are inhibitory in single celled organisms regulatory networks respond to the external environment optimising the cell at a given time for survival in this environment thus a yeast cell finding

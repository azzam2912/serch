bunched logic provides primitives for reasoning about resource composition which aid in the compositional analysis of computer and other systems it has category theoretic and truth functional semantics which can be understood in terms of an abstract concept of resource and a proof theory in which the contexts in an entailment judgement a are tree like structures bunches rather than lists or multi sets as in most proof calculi bunched logic has an associated type theory and its first application was in providing a way to control the aliasing and other forms of interference in imperative programs the logic has seen further applications in program verification where it is the basis of the assertion language of separation logic and in systems modelling where it provides a way to decompose the resources used by components of a system the deduction theorem of classical logic relates conjunction and implication bunched logic has two versions of the deduction theorem formula 3 and formula 4 are forms of conjunction and implication that take resources into account explained below in addition to these connectives bunched logic has a formula sometimes written i or emp which is the unit of in the original version of bunched

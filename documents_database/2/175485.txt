epic theatre is not meant to refer to the scale or the scope of the work but rather to the form that it takes epic theatre emphasizes the audience s perspective and reaction to the piece through a variety of techniques that deliberately cause them to individually engage in a different way the purpose of epic theatre is not to encourage an audience to suspend their disbelief but rather to force them to see their world as it is the term epic theatre comes from erwin piscator who coined it during his first year as director of berlin s volksb hne 1924 27 piscator aimed to encourage playwrights to address issues related to contemporary existence this new subject matter would then be staged by means of documentary effects audience interaction and strategies to cultivate an objective response epic theatre incorporates a mode of acting that utilises what brecht calls gestus one of brecht s most important aesthetic innovations prioritised function over the sterile dichotomical opposition between form and content epic theatre and its many forms is a response to richard wagner s idea of gesamtkunstwerk or total artwork which intends each piece of art is composed of each other art

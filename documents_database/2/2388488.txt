lithuania is a country in the baltic region of northern eastern europe the basement rock of lithuania is made up of the west lithuanian granitic massif aluminous schist metabasic rocks reaching granulite grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies and gneiss and the southeast lithuanian zone granitoids plagiomicrocline granite and migmatite the massif has some notable mesoproterozoic dike swarms in the southeast granitoids alternate with metagraywacke amphibolite and rare dolomite marble mica schist and microgneiss metamorphic rocks typically reach amphibolite facies and ultramafic or mafic intrusions are common an angular unconformity separates weathered basement rock from the merkys formation fanglomerates formed in the neoproterozoic salica formation arkose and siltstone overlies these units overlain in the east by the kieva formation with siltstone clay and sandstone sedimentary rocks up to 2 3 kilometers thick define the entire phanerozoic rock record dark green clay with sandstone and siltstone interbeds together up to 40 meters thick overlies vendian age rocks defining the lower cambrian and the start of the paleozoic it is overlain by the lontova stage clays the vergale stage has an angular unconformity with basement rocks in the east and contains brown oolitic ironstone sandstone siltstone and argillite up to 45

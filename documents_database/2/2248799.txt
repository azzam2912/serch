one can change this orientation by steps in which a single edge is reversed subject to the same constraints it is pspace complete to determine whether there exists a sequence of moves that reverses a specified edge this is a form of reversible logic in that each sequence of edge orientation changes can be undone the hardness of this problem has been used to prove that many games and puzzles have high game complexity in the simplest version of nondeterministic constraint logic each edge of an undirected graph has weight either one or two the weights may also be represented graphically by drawing edges of weight one as red and edges of weight two as blue the graph is required to be a cubic graph each vertex is incident to three edges and additionally each vertex should be incident to an even number of red edges the edges are required to be oriented in such a way that at least two units of weight are oriented towards each vertex there must be either at least one incoming blue edge or at least two incoming red edges an orientation can change by steps in which a single edge is reversed respecting

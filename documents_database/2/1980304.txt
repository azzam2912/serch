due to the geometry of the anode x rays emitted towards the cathode are in general more intense than those emitted perpendicular to the cathode anode axis the effect stems from the absorption of x ray photons before they leave the anode in which they are produced the probability of absorption depends on the distance the photons travel within the anode material which in turn depends on the direction of emission the distance from the anode source of x rays to the image receptor greatly influences the apparent magnitude of the anode heel effect the shorter the distance the less space the beam has to diverge the effect is less noticeable at larger source image distances sid diagnostic x ray beams can be collimated to large or small beams a large beam will emit more intensities of the beam along the cathode anode axis than a small beam a large image receptor will also capture more of this beam than a small receptor both of these factors will greatly influence the visibility of the anode heel effect a smaller field size results in a less pronounced heel effect when the angle of the anode is great the usable x ray

the turret is unusual in being made of two hinged parts elevation of the gun relies on the upper part of the turret moving relative to the lower part oscillating turrets have only rarely been used their only widespread use was on two french designs the amx 13 light tank and the panhard ebr armoured car the austrian sk 105 k rassier uses a turret developed from the amx 13 the turret consists of upper and lower parts joined by a trunnion the gap between these two parts is often covered by a visible rubber or canvas bellows the gun itself is fixed to the upper part of the turret elevation of the gun is achieved by tilting the entire upper part of the turret in conventional designs the gun is mounted inside the one piece turret by a trunnion and its elevation is changed by tilting on that trunnion while the turret remains in fixed position relative to the hull traverse in both designs is achieved by rotating the turret in oscillating turrets where the oscillating part of the turret is enclosed gives the advantage that the gunner and loader always is in line with the gun allowing easier

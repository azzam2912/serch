any cut determines a cut set the set of edges that have one endpoint in each subset of the partition these edges are said to cross the cut in a connected graph each cut set determines a unique cut and in some cases cuts are identified with their cut sets rather than with their vertex partitions in a flow network an s t cut is a cut that requires the source and the sink to be in different subsets and its cut set only consists of edges going from the source s side to the sink s side the capacity of an s t cut is defined as the sum of the capacity of each edge in the cut set a cut formula 1 is a partition of formula 2 of a graph formula 3 into two subsets s and t the cut set of a cut formula 1 is the set formula 5 of edges that have one endpoint in s and the other endpoint in t if s and t are specified vertices of the graph g then an s t cut is a cut in which s belongs to the set s and t belongs to the

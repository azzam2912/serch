cultural travelers leave their home environment at home bringing only themselves and a desire to become part of the culture they visit cultural travel goes beyond cultural exploration or discovery it involves a transformation in way of life this definition was first used by gary langer as a way of describing travel that requires a transition to a new level of understanding of and appreciation for a foreign culture the term is often distorted and misused by travel agents tour operators and international tourism organizations culture primarily has to do with people and less with places or things so visiting museums touring ancient structures attending festivals and eating local food does not provide the same experience as becoming a member of the culture itself expeditions are another form of cultural travel apart from slave trade travel that has given us an insight to various unknown and less talked about cultures the discovery of cultures hence completely depends upon these travel narratives which speak about what travelers witness rather than accounts given by people in power the antithesis of cultural travel is tourism where people bring their home environment with them wherever they go and apply it to whatever they see

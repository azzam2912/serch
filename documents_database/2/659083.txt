grna are the rnas that guide the insertion or deletion of uridine residues into mitochondrial mrnas in kinetoplastid protists in a process known as rna editing the terms guide rna and grna are also used in prokaryotic dna editing involving crispr and cas9 trypanosomatid protists and other kinetoplastids have a novel post transcriptional mitochondrial rna modification process known as rna editing the mitochondrial genome in these cells consists of 20 50 maxicircles that encode genes and cryptogenes and some grnas and 10 20 000 minicircles that encode grnas all of these molecules are catenated into a giant network of dna that is situated at the base of the flagellum in the inner compartment of the single mitochondrion a majority of the maxicircle transcripts can not be translated into proteins due to multiple frameshifts in the sequences these frameshifts are corrected after transcription by the insertion and deletion of uridine residues at precise sites which create an open reading frame that is translated into a mitochondrial protein homologous to mitochondrial proteins from other cells the insertions and deletions are mediated by short guide rna grnas which encode the editing information in the form of complementary sequences allowing gu as well as

each spire whorl is prominently angled at its centre by a tuberculate keel in the series before us the proportion of length to breadth varies considerably the shell has eight whorls including a protoconch of a whorl and a half the ground colour of the shell is pale cream with an evanescent purple tinge in the aperture sculpture the suture is slightly puckered by small radiating folds which run out before reaching half way to the keel along the keel are prominent wide spaced tubercles numbering on the penultimate about seventeen each truncated in front and sloping at the back to the base of its predecessor behind the aperture these sometimes degenerate into crowded imbricate scales below the keel the radial sculpture is resumed at indistinct forwardly curved riblets fine raised spiral threads extend from the tip of the canal to the protoconch in the hollow supra carinal shelf they are small and close together below the keel amounting on the body whorl to about forty they are wider spaced often alternating in size and tend to be knotted by the radials the protoconch is smooth and very glossy dome shaped a whorl and a half ending with a sinus

the epoxide hydrolases this set includes the microsomal epoxide hydrolase also termed epoxide hydrolase 1 ephx1 meh and eh1 the epoxide hydrolase 2 also termed soluble epoxide hydrolase ephx2 seh and eh2 and the far less well defined enzymatically epoxide hydrolase 4 also termed abhd7 and eh4 all four enzyme contain an alpha beta hydrolase fold suggesting that they have hydrolysis activity eh1 eh2 and eh3 have been shown to have such activity in that they add water to epoxides of unsaturated fatty acids to form vicinal cis see cis trans isomerism products the activity of eh4 has not been reported the former three eh s differ in subcellular location tissue expression patterns substrate preferences and thereby functions these functions include limiting the biologically actions of certain fatty acid epoxides increasing the toxicity of other fatty acid epoxides and contributing to the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics eh3 was first named abhd9 owing to its possession of a particular protein domain the alpha beta hydrolase fold or hydrolase fold domain this domain is found in more than 30 other human hydrolytic enzymes including the four epoxide hydrolases the gene for eh3 ephx3 was discovered on chromosome locus 19p13 13

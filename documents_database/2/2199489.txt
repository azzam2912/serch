it is robust through use of identification by cryptographic hash function transparent through use of readable text for legal prose and efficient through markup language to extract essential information a ricardian contract places the defining elements of a legal agreement in a format that can be expressed and executed in software the key is to make the format both machine readable such that they can easily be extracted for computational purposes and readable as an ordinary text document such that lawyers and contracting parties may read the essentials of the contract conveniently from a legal perspective the use of markup language embedded within a mostly legal prose document leads to reduced transaction costs faster dispute resolution better enforceability and enhanced transparency from a computing perspective the ricardian contract is a software design pattern to digitize documents and have them participate within financial transactions such as payments without losing any of the richness of the contracting tradition publication of the content and reference to that content by the unique cryptographic message digest eliminates frauds based on multiple presentations the method arises out of the work of ian grigg completed in the mid 1990s in contributions to ricardo a system of assets

in some cases load balancing rather than raw speed may be the main goal a web server for instance could use gearman to send tasks for which it is not optimized to another computer which may be running on a different architecture using another operating system or loaded with a computer language better suited to a particular operation it was originally written in perl by brad fitzpatrick brian aker and eric day rewrote the framework in c gearman assigns each involved computer a role as client job server or worker a worker machine can be assigned multiple instances of the worker role which allows more powerful computers to complete more portions of a given task tasks originate on a client are transmitted from the client to the job server and performed on one or more workers the completed task s output is then returned again by way of the job server to the client where the task originated gearman is conceptually related to mapreduce gearman handles mapreduce by allowing worker nodes to map out work to other workers with the original worker acting as the reducer gearman performs coalescence on the work sent by a client if two or more

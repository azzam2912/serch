it came to perihelion on july 26 2000 at a distance of 0 765 au from the sun the comet nucleus was estimated to be about 0 9 km in diameter before the comet broke up the dust and water nucleus erosion rate was about 1 cm per day the comet brightened near july 5 2000 and underwent a minor fragmentation event the comet brightened again around july 20 2000 and then disintegrated the published optical and most radio data support that the main nuclear decay started july 23 2000 the dust cloud expanded at about while the fragments expanded at around other comets are known to have disappeared but comet linear is the first one to have been caught in the act the orbit of a long period comet is properly obtained when the osculating orbit is computed at an epoch after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the center of mass of the solar system using jpl horizons the barycentric orbital elements for epoch 2010 jan 01 generate a semi major axis of 700 au an aphelion distance of 1400 au and a period of approximately 18 700 years

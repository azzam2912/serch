the label serves as the integral part of the final product which is then delivered as pre decorated item combining the decoration process with the moulding process cuts the total cost but can increase the manufacturing time the technology was first developed by owens illinois in cooperation with procter gamble to supply pre labelled bottles that could be filled on the product filling line this was first applied to head shoulders shampoo bottles in mould labelling iml was initially designed for blow molding though developments using injection molding or thermoforming with reel fed systems have increased the efficiency of the labelling process the original concept involves coating the reverse side of the label with a heat seal layer followed by a substrate material in which heat resistant ink is applied to a heat resistant coating of lacquer is then applied this process eliminates the need to flame treat the bottles prior to labelling in order to achieve adequate adhesion initially paper was used as the label substrate to which the heat reactive adhesive was applied in more recent times polyolefin substrates have been employed such as polyart from arjobex synthetic papers this creates the advantage that scrap polyethylene and polypropylene

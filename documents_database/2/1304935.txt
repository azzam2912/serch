because rocks of hercynian age are in most places covered by younger strata the zone is not everywhere visible at the surface places where it crops out are the northern bohemian massif the spessart the odenwald the northern parts of the black forest and vosges and the southern part of the taunus west of the vosges terranes on both sides of the english channel are also seen as part of the zone for example the lizard complex in cornwall or the l on zone of the armorican massif brittany in central europe the saxothuringian zone is situated between the rhenohercynian zone to the northwest and the moldanubian zone to the southeast the hercynian metamorphism of the former zone is generally lower grade that of the latter zone higher grade than that of the saxothuringian zone west of the vosges the zone is displaced to the north by a major strike slip fault the bray fault the saxothuringian zone is in some places transected by permo triassic grabens and intramontane basins filled with rotliegend sediments and older deposits the eger graben in the northwest of the czech republic and the saar nahe basin in western germany are examples of such structures

luma is typically paired with chrominance luma represents the achromatic image while the chroma components represent the color information converting r g b sources such as the output of a three ccd camera into luma and chroma allows for chroma subsampling because human vision has finer spatial sensitivity to luminance black and white differences than chromatic differences video systems can store and transmit chromatic information at lower resolution optimizing perceived detail at a particular bandwidth luma is the weighted sum of gamma compressed r g b components of a color video the prime symbols denote gamma compression the word was proposed to prevent confusion between luma as implemented in video engineering and relative luminance as used in color science i e as defined by cie relative luminance is formed as a weighted sum of linear rgb components not gamma compressed ones even so luma is sometimes erroneously called luminance smpte eg 28 recommends the symbol y to denote luma and the symbol y to denote relative luminance while luma is more often encountered relative luminance is sometimes used in video engineering when referring to the brightness of a monitor the formula used to calculate relative luminance uses coefficients based on

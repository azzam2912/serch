this can be done to compare different representations for equivalence to count the number of distinct data structures to improve the efficiency of various algorithms by eliminating repeated calculations or to make it possible to impose a meaningful sorting order files in file systems may in most cases be accessed through multiple filenames for instance in unix like systems the string codice 1 can be replaced by codice 2 in the c standard library the function codice 3 performs this task other operations performed by this function to canonicalize filenames are the handling of codice 4 components referring to parent directories simplification of sequences of multiple slashes removal of trailing slashes and the resolution of symbolic links canonicalization of filenames is important for computer security for example a web server may have a restriction that only files under the cgi directory codice 5 may be executed this rule is enforced by checking that the path starts with codice 6 and only then executing it while the file codice 7 initially appears to be in the cgi directory it exploits the codice 8 path specifier to traverse back up the directory hierarchy in an attempt to execute a file outside of

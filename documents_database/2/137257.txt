it was first fully outlined by ernst mayr in 1942 using existing theoretical work by those such as sewall wright as a result of the loss of genetic variation the new population may be distinctively different both genotypically and phenotypically from the parent population from which it is derived in extreme cases the founder effect is thought to lead to the speciation and subsequent evolution of new species in the figure shown the original population has nearly equal numbers of blue and red individuals the three smaller founder populations show that one or the other color may predominate founder effect due to random sampling of the original population a population bottleneck may also cause a founder effect though it is not strictly a new population the founder effect occurs when a small group of migrants that is not genetically representative of the population from which they came establish in a new area in addition to founder effects the new population is often a very small population so shows increased sensitivity to genetic drift an increase in inbreeding and relatively low genetic variation in genetics a founder mutation is a mutation that appears in the dna of one or more individuals

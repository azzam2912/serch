examples of such object types are status parameters control actions and notification alerts orbit vectors schedules planning requests and software images in addition to definition of the static information model the service defines the interactions through extension of the patterns defined in the message abstraction layer required between service provider and consumer to allow the specification of an mo service defines the structure of the objects however each deployment or instantiation of a service will also require service configuration data that defines the actual instances of those object types that exist for that service instance for example the m c service may define what parameters actions and alerts are but it is the associated service configuration data that specifies the set of parameters actions and alerts that exist for a particular spacecraft the following table lists the application level mission operations services that have currently been identified by the working group it is to be stressed however that the service framework is designed to be extensible and additional services may be identified in the future to address additional requirements for end to end interaction in mission operations note services are listed together with a summary of the associated service objects

this emulator enabled running applications and system code that were originally written for the 680x0 based macintosh models with a few exceptions notably connectix s ram doubler the emulator ran all software with no noticeable impact other than lower performance relative to the same program when compiled for powerpc the first version was written by gary davidian who had originally created it for use on the motorola 88000 cpu used in apple s abortive first attempt at a risc target platform a later version using dynamic recompilation was developed by eric traut who later worked on successful emulation projects at connectix such as virtual game station and virtual pc prior to traut s arrival there connectix had released speed doubler which included an even faster powerpc 68k emulator all versions of this emulator emulated the user subset of the 68ec040 instruction set with a 68020 68030 exception stack frame apple developer documents indicate that the emulator provided an operating environment most closely resembling that of the macintosh centris 610 a system based on the motorola 68lc040 microprocessor early versions emulated it by decoding each instruction and immediately carrying out a series of equivalent powerpc instructions for the pci powermacs the

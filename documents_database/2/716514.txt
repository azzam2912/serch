the tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool making it easy to wind around pipe threads thread seal tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed the tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten and instead making it easier to tighten typically the tape is wrapped around a pipe s thread three times before it is screwed into place it is commonly used commercially in applications including pressurized water systems central heating systems and air compression equipment temperature range 450 f to 500 f 268 c to 260 c ptfe is completely stable up to 500 f or 260 c decomposition is slow up to 750 f or 400 c decomposition will occur on contact with open flames there are two us standards for determining the quality of any ptfe tape mil t 27730a an obsolete military specification still commonly used in industry in the us requires a minimum thickness of 3 5 mils and a minimum ptfe purity of 99 the second standard a

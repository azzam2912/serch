mesopredators often vary in ecosystems depending on the food web it is also important to note that there is no specific size or weight restrictions to qualify as a mesopredator as it depends on how large the apex predator is and what the mesopredator s prey is when new species are introduced into an ecosystem the role of mesopredator often changes the same happens if a species is removed when populations of apex predators decrease populations of mesopredators often increase this is the mesopredator release effect mesopredator outbreaks often lead to declining prey populations sometimes destabilizing communities and driving local extinctions when apex predators are removed from the ecosystem this gives the mesopredators less competition and conflict they are able to catch more prey and have lower mortality rates often mesopredators can take over the role of apex predators this happens when new species are introduced into an ecosystem or when species leave or are killed off when this happens and the new apex predator or former mesopredator becomes the new species on top of the food chain it is important to remember that they are not ecologically identical to the former apex predator and is likely a smaller species

it is typically measured in hertz and depending on context may specifically refer to passband bandwidth or baseband bandwidth passband bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower cutoff frequencies of for example a band pass filter a communication channel or a signal spectrum baseband bandwidth applies to a low pass filter or baseband signal the bandwidth is equal to its upper cutoff frequency bandwidth in hertz is a central concept in many fields including electronics information theory digital communications radio communications signal processing and spectroscopy and is one of the determinants of the capacity of a given communication channel a key characteristic of bandwidth is that any band of a given width can carry the same amount of information regardless of where that band is located in the frequency spectrum for example a 3 khz band can carry a telephone conversation whether that band is at baseband as in a pots telephone line or modulated to some higher frequency bandwidth is a key concept in many telecommunications applications in radio communications for example bandwidth is the frequency range occupied by a modulated carrier signal an fm radio receiver s tuner spans a limited range of frequencies a government

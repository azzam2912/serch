this is practical because of water s large heat of fusion one metric ton of water one cubic metre can store 334 megajoules mj 317 000 btu of energy equivalent to 93 kwh 26 4 ton hours ice was originally obtained from mountains or cut from frozen lakes and transported to cities for use as a coolant the original definition of a ton of cooling capacity heat flow was the heat needed to melt one ton of ice in a 24 hour period this heat flow is what one would expect in a house in boston in the summer this definition has since been replaced by less archaic units one ton hvac capacity is equal to 12 000 btu per hour a small storage facility can hold enough ice to cool a large building from one day to one week whether that ice is produced by anhydrous ammonia chillers or hauled in by horse drawn carts ground freezing can also be utilized this may be done in ice form where the ground is saturated systems will also work with pure rock wherever ice forms the ice formation s heat of fusion is not used as the ice remains solid throughout

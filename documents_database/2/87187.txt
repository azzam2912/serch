within physics this behavior is characterized by dark matter not interacting with electromagnetic radiation hence making it dark and rendering it undetectable via conventional instruments in physics data from galaxy rotation curves indicate that approximately 80 of the mass of a galaxy cannot be seen forcing researchers to innovate ways that indirectly detect it through dark matter s effects on gravitational fluctuations there exists no consensus in the theoretical physics community as to whether dark matter is divisible into various types but there exists evidence for differentiating dark matter into hot hdm and cold cdm types some even suggesting a middle ground of warm dark matter wdm the terminology is not meant to invoke any association with temperature but instead refer to the size of the purported dark matter particles wimps in turn the size of the particles determines the velocities at which they travel at in an inverse relationship hdm travels faster than cdm because the hdm particles are theorized to be of lower mass in terms of its application the distribution of hot dark matter could also help explain how clusters and superclusters of galaxies formed after the big bang theorists claim that there exist two classes of

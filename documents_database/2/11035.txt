ideals generalize certain subsets of the integers such as the even numbers or the multiples of 3 addition and subtraction of even numbers preserves evenness and multiplying an even number by any other integer results in another even number these closure and absorption properties are the defining properties of an ideal an ideal can be used to construct a quotient ring similarly to the way that in group theory a normal subgroup can be used to construct a quotient group among the integers the ideals correspond one for one with the non negative integers in this ring every ideal is a principal ideal consisting of the multiples of a single non negative number however in other rings the ideals may be distinct from the ring elements and certain properties of integers when generalized to rings attach more naturally to the ideals than to the elements of the ring for instance the prime ideals of a ring are analogous to prime numbers and the chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to ideals there is a version of unique prime factorization for the ideals of a dedekind domain a type of ring important in number theory the related but distinct concept of

written in the first person the novel follows henry chinaski bukowski s thinly veiled alter ego during his early years written in bukowski s characteristically straightforward prose the novel tells of his coming of age in los angeles during the great depression the title may be a play on j d salinger s 1951 book the catcher in the rye which is one of the most notable coming of age novels about american males both bukowski and salinger were first published professionally in the 1940s in the literary magazine story edited by whit burnett however bukowski s admiration of john fante also suggests that a phrase in fante s ask the dust liverwurst on rye may have inspired the title ham on rye a third possibility is that the title is a dig at the new york literary critics who generally disdained bukowski s work dismissing him as the equivalent of a ham actor with an overwrought amateurish style thus bukowski may be appropriating the insult and boldly declaring himself a ham writer fueled by rye whiskey still another possible interpretation is that hank perceived himself as being sandwiched or trapped between his highly dysfunctional parents during his formative years

contact forces are ubiquitous and are responsible for most visible interactions between macroscopic collections of matter moving a couch across a floor pushing a car up a hill kicking a ball or pushing a desk across a room are some of the everyday examples where contact forces are at work in the first case the force is continuously applied by the person on the car while in the second case the force is delivered in a short impulse contact forces are often decomposed into orthogonal components one perpendicular to the surface s in contact called the normal force and one parallel to the surface s in contact called the friction force in the standard model of modern physics the four fundamental forces of nature are known to be non contact forces the strong and weak interaction primarily deal with forces within atoms while gravitational effects are only obvious on an ultra macroscopic scale molecular and quantum physics show that the electromagnetic force is the fundamental interaction responsible for contact forces the interaction between macroscopic objects can be roughly described as resulting from the electromagnetic interactions between protons and electrons of the atomic constituents of these objects everyday objects do not

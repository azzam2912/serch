for example the set null is a singleton containing the element null the term is also used for a 1 tuple a sequence with one member within the framework of zermelo fraenkel set theory the axiom of regularity guarantees that no set is an element of itself this implies that a singleton is necessarily distinct from the element it contains thus 1 and 1 are not the same thing and the empty set is distinct from the set containing only the empty set a set such as is a singleton as it contains a single element which itself is a set however not a singleton a set is a singleton if and only if its cardinality is in von neumann s set theoretic construction of the natural numbers the number 1 is defined as the singleton 0 in axiomatic set theory the existence of singletons is a consequence of the axiom of pairing for any set a the axiom applied to a and a asserts the existence of a a which is the same as the singleton a since it contains a and no other set as an element if a is any set and s is any singleton then

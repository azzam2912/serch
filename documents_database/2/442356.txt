there can be errors of various types and the overall error is the sum of the individual errors types of errors include the size of the systematic error is sometimes referred to as the accuracy for example the instrument may always indicate a value 5 higher than the actual value or perhaps the relationship between the indicated and actual values may be more complicated than that a systematic error may arise because the instrument has been incorrectly calibrated or perhaps because a defect has arisen in the instrument since it was calibrated instruments should be calibrated against a standard instrument that is known to be accurate and ideally the calibration should be repeated at intervals the most rigorous standards are those maintained by a standards organization such as nist in the united states or the iso in europe if the users know the amount of the systematic error they may decide to adjust for it manually rather than having the instrument expensively adjusted to eliminate the error e g in the above example they might manually reduce all the values read by about 4 8 the range in amount of possible random errors is sometimes referred to as the precision

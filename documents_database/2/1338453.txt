the chilled water can either be used immediately or be stored for the short or long term when outdoor temperatures are lower relative to indoor temperatures this system utilizes the cool outdoor air as a free cooling source in this manner the system replaces the chiller in traditional air conditioning systems while achieving the same cooling result such systems can be made for single buildings or district cooling networks when the ambient air temperature drops to a set temperature a modulating valve allows all or part of the chilled water to by pass an existing chiller and run through the free cooling system which uses less power and uses the lower ambient air temperature to cool the water in the system this can be achieved by installing an air blast cooler with any existing chiller or on its own during low ambient temperatures an installation can by pass an existing chiller giving energy savings of up to 75 without compromising cooling requirements in heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac in winter months large commercial buildings interior spaces may need cooling even while perimeter spaces may need heating free cooling is the production of chilled water without the use of a

methylecgonidine has a relatively short half life of 18 21 minutes after which it is metabolised to ecgonidine meaning that the relative concentrations of the two compounds can be used to estimate how recently crack cocaine has been smoked methylecgonidine has been shown to be specifically more harmful to the body than other byproducts of cocaine for example to the heart lungs liver the toxicity is due to a partial agonist effect at m1 and m3 muscarinic receptors leading to dna fragmentation and neuronal death by apoptosis aeme is also used in scientific research for the manufacture of phenyltropane analogues such as troparil dichloropane iometopane and cft methylecgonidine could also theoretically be used to produce cocaine and so may be a controlled substance in some countries methylecgonidine can be synthesized non pyrolytically from cocaine via hydrolysis dehydration followed by esterification with methanol the scheme by kline is based on the reaction of 2 4 6 cycloheptatriene 7 carboxylic acid with methylamine this is a modified version of by grundmann and ottmann in the accompanying patent these same authors react their methylecgonidine with two equivalents of phli to form a tertiary alcohol by hard addition to the ester and not soft

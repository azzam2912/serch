in a transmitting antenna it is driven or excited by the rf current from the transmitter and is the source of the radio waves in a receiving antenna it collects the incoming radio waves for reception and converts them to tiny oscillating electric currents which are applied to the receiver multielement antennas like the yagi typically consist of a driven element connected to the receiver or transmitter through a feed line and a number of other elements which are not driven called parasitic elements the driven element is often a dipole the parasitic elements act as resonators and couple electromagnetically with the driven element and serve to modify the radiation pattern of the antenna directing the radio waves in one direction increasing the gain of the antenna an antenna may have more than one driven element although the most common multielement antenna the yagi usually has only one for example transmitting antennas for am radio stations often consist of several mast radiators each of which functions as a half wave monopole driven element to create a particular radiation pattern a two element array with the elements spaced a quarter wavelength apart has a distinct cardioid radiation pattern when the second

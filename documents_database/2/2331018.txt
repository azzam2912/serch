development of cwl is focused particularly on serving the data intensive sciences such as bioinformatics medical imaging astronomy physics and chemistry a key goal of the cwl is to allow the creation of a workflow that is portable and thus may be run reproducibly in different computational environments the cwl originated from discussions in 2014 between peter amstutz john chilton nebojsa tijanic and michael r crusoe at that time their respective affiliations were galaxy arvados seven bridges and michigan state university at the open bioinformatics foundation bosc 2014 codefest cwl is supported by multiple analysis runners and platforms such as apache airflow via cwl airflow arvados rabix cromwell workflow engine toil reana reusable analyses and cwlexec for ibm spectrum lsf and was identified in 2017 as one of the future trends for bioinformatics pipeline development several additional analysis environments are currently implementing support for cwl including apache taverna and galaxy cwl is developed by an informal multi vendor working group consisting of both organizations and individuals and is freely available via its github repository under a permissive apache license 2 0

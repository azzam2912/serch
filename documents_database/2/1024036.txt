farmers combine fed aquaculture e g fish shrimp with inorganic extractive e g seaweed and organic extractive e g shellfish aquaculture to create balanced systems for environment remediation biomitigation economic stability improved output lower cost product diversification and risk reduction and social acceptability better management practices selecting appropriate species and sizing the various populations to provide necessary ecosystem functions allows the biological and chemical processes involved to achieve a stable balance mutually benefiting the organisms and improving ecosystem health ideally the co cultured species each yield valuable commercial crops imta can synergistically increase total output even if some of the crops yield less than they would short term in a monoculture integrated refers to intensive and synergistic cultivation using water borne nutrient and energy transfer multi trophic means that the various species occupy different trophic levels i e different but adjacent links in the food chain imta is a specialized form of the age old practice of aquatic polyculture which was the co culture of various species often without regard to trophic level in this broader case the organisms may share biological and chemical processes that may be minimally complementary potentially leading to reduced production of both species due to

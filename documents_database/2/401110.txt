under the baltimore classification scheme the caudovirales are group i viruses as they have double stranded dna dsdna genomes which can be anywhere from 18 000 base pairs to 500 000 base pairs in length the virus particles have a distinct shape each virion has an icosahedral head that contains the viral genome and is attached to a flexible tail by a connector protein the order encompasses a wide range of viruses many containing genes of similar nucleotide sequence and function however some tailed bacteriophage genomes can vary quite significantly in nucleotide sequence even among the same genus due to their characteristic structure and possession of potentially homologous genes it is believed these bacteriophages possess a common origin there are at least 350 recognised species in this order upon encountering a host bacterium the tail section of the virion binds to receptors on the cell surface and delivers the dna into the cell by use of an injectisome like mechanism an injectisome is a nanomachine that evolved for the delivery of proteins by type iii secretion the tail section of the virus punches a hole through the bacterial cell wall and plasma membrane and the genome passes down the tail

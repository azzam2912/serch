ramsey and david lewis by using this method a set of theoretical terms appearing in a theory can be defined implicitly by the assertions of the theory itself a scientific theory which attempts to describe electrons is inherently abstract as no one has ever observed an electron directly thus the origin and content of the concept of electron is questionable what does the word exactly signify ramsey and lewis proposed that the meaning of the term electron is implicitly generated by the scientific theory that describes it via all its assertions about electrons electrons are those things about which all the statements of the theory are true however some of those statements in a theory refer to other unobserved entities and properties such as charge or spin for instance electrons attract protons and electrons have negative charge employ the terms protons and negative charge with the latter also implicitly using the concept of charge these properties are formalized statements such as conditionals are formed using them and those statements taken together are the definition of the term consider a sentence such as there s an electron in the sink this means something along the lines of there exist some properties

equivalently it is an ellipse on the surface of a spheroid and centered on the origin or the curve formed by intersecting the spheroid by a plane through its center for points that are separated by less than about a quarter of the circumference of the earth about formula 1 the length of the great ellipse connecting the points is close within one part in 500 000 to the geodesic distance the great ellipse therefore is sometimes proposed as a suitable route for marine navigation although for no extra computational effort the more accurate normal section may be computed assume that the spheroid an ellipsoid of revolution has an equatorial radius formula 2 and polar semi axis formula 3 define the flattening formula 4 the eccentricity formula 5 and the second eccentricity formula 6 consider two points formula 7 at geographic latitude formula 8 and longitude formula 9 and formula 10 at latitude formula 11 and longitude formula 12 the connecting great ellipse from formula 7 to formula 10 has length formula 15 and has azimuths formula 16 and formula 17 at the two endpoints there are various ways to map an ellipsoid into a sphere of radius formula 2

light curtains can be used as an alternative to mechanical barriers and other forms of traditional machine guarding by reducing the need for physical guards and barriers light curtains can increase the maintainability of the equipment they are guarding the operability and efficiency of machinery can also be improved by the use of light curtains by for example allowing easier access for semi automatic procedures light curtains fall into a category of equipment known as presence detection devices other common presence detection devices are pressure sensitive safety mats and laser scanners often used on remotely operated vehicles rov when in industrial settings most important applications of safety relays are in automation industries dealing with robotic cell setup light curtains are supplied as a pair with a transmitter and receiver the transmitter projects an array of parallel infrared light beams to the receiver which consists of a number of photoelectric cells when an object breaks one or more of the beams a stop signal is sent to the guarded equipment the light beams emitted from the transmitter are sequenced one after the other and pulsed at a specific frequency the receiver is designed to only accept the specific pulse and frequency

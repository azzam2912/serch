it is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause more generally a breakpoint is a means of acquiring knowledge about a program during its execution during the interruption the programmer inspects the test environment general purpose registers memory logs files etc to find out whether the program is functioning as expected in practice a breakpoint consists of one or more conditions that determine when a program s execution should be interrupted breakpoints were invented for eniac one of the earliest digital computers by programmer betty holberton in the initial design of eniac program flow was set by plugging cables from one unit to another to make the program stop at a certain point a cable was removed called a breakpoint early mainframe computers such as the ibm 360 had console switches dials that allowed breakpoints at specific instruction storage addresses and provided single cycle operation permitting the contents of registers and memory to be observed directly on console lights the advent of multitasking limited the use of this option since the entire machine was halted programmers have used machine code patches to implement single destructive breakpoints to cause a core dump since the early days of computers the core

morse is among the exactly solvable quantum mechanical potentials in dimensionless units and modulo additive constants it is defined as where formula 1 is a relative distance formula 2 is an angle rescaling parameter and formula 3 is so far a matching length parameter another parametrization of same potential is which is the trigonometric version of a one dimensional hyperbolic potential introduced in molecular physics by nathan rosen and philip m morse and given by a parallelism that explains the potential s name the most prominent application concerns the formula 4 parametrization with formula 5 non negative integer and is due to schr dinger who intended to formulate the hydrogen atom problem on einstein s closed universe formula 6 the direct product of a time line with a three dimensional closed space of positive constant curvature the hypersphere formula 7 and introduced it on this geometry in his celebrated equation as the counterpart to the coulomb potential a mathematical problem briefly highlighted below the hypersphere is a surface in a four dimensional euclidean space formula 10 and is defined as where formula 11 formula 12 formula 13 and formula 14 are the cartesian coordinates of a vector in formula 10

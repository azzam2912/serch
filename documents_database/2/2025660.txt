john howell a professor of physics at the university of rochester and graduate student joseph choi developed the device which features four standard lenses that allows an object to appear invisible as the viewer moves several degrees away from the optimal viewing positions the cloaked region is a cylindrical annular region between the first and last lenses for a shorter 3 lens symmetric cloak the middle lens can be diverging to give a 3d triangular ring cloaked region between the first and last lenses the scientists at university of rochester provided steps to make this cloaking device these 4 steps are required to be followed 1 purchase 2 sets of 2 lenses with different focal lengths f1 and f2 4 lenses total 2 with f1 focal length and 2 with f2 focal length 2 separate the first 2 lenses by the sum of their focal lengths so f1 lens is the first lens f2 is the 2nd lens and they are separated by t1 f1 f2 3 do the same in step 2 for the other two lenses 4 separate the two sets by t2 2 f2 f1 f2 f1 f2 apart so that the two f2 lenses are t2

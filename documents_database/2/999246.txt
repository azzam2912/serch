it is a member of the enoyl coa hydratase isomerase superfamily but it is the only member of that family that is able to bind to rna not only does it bind to rna auh has also been observed to be involved in the metabolic enzymatic activity making it a dual role protein mutations of this gene have been found to cause a disease called 3 methylglutaconic acuduria type 1 the enzyme auh has a molecular mass of 32 kda and the auh gene consists of 18 exons is 1 7 kb long and is mainly found in kidney skeletal muscle heart liver and spleen cells auh has a similar fold that is found in other members of the enoyl coa hydratase isomerase family however it is a hexamer as a dimer of trimers also unlike other members of its family auh s surface is positively charged in contrast to the negative charge seen on that of other classes between the two trimers of the enzyme wide clefts were seen with a highly positive charge and lysine residues in alpha helix h1 these lysine residues were shown to be the main reason why auh is able to bind to rna

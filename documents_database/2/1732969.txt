the parameter is a logarithmic scale from 0 to 9 that measures the anticipated longitudinal uncertainty in the minor planet s mean anomaly after 10 years the uncertainty parameter is also known as condition code in jpl s small body database browser the u value should not be used as a predictor for the uncertainty in the future motion of near earth objects orbital uncertainty is related to several parameters used in the orbit determination process including the number of observations measurements the time spanned by those observations observation arc the quality of the observations e g radar vs optical and the geometry of the observations of these parameters the time spanned by the observations generally has the greatest effect on the orbital uncertainty objects such as with a condition code uncertainty parameter u of e where the eccentricity is assumed are considered lost has an uncertainty parameter of 9 and could be an earth threatening asteroid or may always remain beyond the asteroid belt the u parameter is calculated in two steps first the in orbit longitude runoff formula 1 in seconds of arc per decade is calculated i e the discrepancy between the observed and calculated position extrapolated

friedel oscillations are a quantum mechanical analog to electric charge screening of charged species in a pool of ions whereas electrical charge screening utilizes a point entity treatment to describe the make up of the ion pool friedel oscillations describing fermions in a fermi fluid or fermi gas require a quasi particle or a scattering treatment such oscillations depict a characteristic exponential decay in the fermionic density near the perturbation followed by an ongoing sinusoidal decay resembling sinc function the electrons that move through a metal or semiconductor behave like free electrons of a fermi gas with plane wave like wave function that is electrons in a metal behave differently than particles in a normal gas because electrons are fermions and they obey fermi dirac statistics this behaviour means that every k state in the gas can only be occupied by two electrons with opposite spin the occupied states fill a sphere in the band structure k space up to a fixed energy level the so called fermi energy the radius of the sphere in k space k is called the fermi wave vector if there is a foreign atom embedded in the metal or semiconductor a so called impurity

in thermoregulation body heat is generated mostly in the deep organs especially the liver brain and heart and in contraction of skeletal muscles humans have been able to adapt to a great diversity of climates including hot humid and hot arid high temperatures pose serious stress for the human body placing it in great danger of injury or even death for humans adaptation to varying climatic conditions includes both physiological mechanisms resulting from evolution and behavioural mechanisms resulting from conscious cultural adaptations there are four avenues of heat loss convection conduction radiation and evaporation if skin temperature is greater than that of the surroundings the body can lose heat by radiation and conduction but if the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the skin the body actually gains heat by radiation and conduction in such conditions the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation so when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise during sports activities evaporation becomes the main avenue of heat loss humidity affects thermoregulation by limiting sweat evaporation and thus heat loss

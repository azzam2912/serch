the maximum number of colors that can be displayed at any one time is 256 there are two forms of 8 bit color graphics the most common uses a separate palette of 256 colors where each of the 256 entries in the palette map is given red green and blue values in most color maps each color is usually chosen from a palette of 16 777 216 colors 24 bits 8 red 8 green 8 blue but in the original vga card s 320x200 mode 256 on screen colors could be chosen from a palette of 262 144 colors 18 bits 6 red 6 green 6 blue some older cards prior to the vga like the professional graphics controller can only choose the 256 color palette from 4 096 colors 12 bits 4 red 4 green 4 blue the other form is where the 8 bits directly describe red green and blue values typically with three bits for red three bits for green and two bits for blue this second form is often called 8 bit truecolor as it does not use a palette at all and is thus more similar to the 15 bit 16 bit and 24 bit

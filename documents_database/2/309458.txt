the technology is primarily used in large multi cylinder engines many automobile manufacturers have adopted this technology as of 2005 although the concept has existed for some time prior to this cylinder deactivation is used to reduce the fuel consumption and emissions of an internal combustion engine during light load operation in typical light load driving the driver uses only around 30 percent of an engine s maximum power in these conditions the throttle valve is nearly closed and the engine needs to work to draw air this causes an inefficiency known as pumping loss some large capacity engines need to be throttled so much at light load that the cylinder pressure at top dead centre is approximately half that of a small 4 cylinder engine low cylinder pressure results in lower fuel efficiency the use of cylinder deactivation at light load means there are fewer cylinders drawing air from the intake manifold which works to increase its fluid air pressure operation without variable displacement is wasteful because fuel is continuously pumped into each cylinder and combusted even though maximum performance is not required by shutting down half of an engine s cylinders the amount of fuel being consumed is

the hypothesis specifically states that a spot exchange rate is expected to change equally in the opposite direction of the interest rate differential thus the currency of the country with the higher nominal interest rate is expected to depreciate against the currency of the country with the lower nominal interest rate as higher nominal interest rates reflect an expectation of inflation the international fisher effect is an extension of the fisher effect hypothesized by american economist irving fisher the fisher effect states that a change in a country s expected inflation rate will result in a proportionate change in the country s interest rate where this may be arranged as follows when the inflation rate is low the term formula 6 will be negligible this suggests that the expected inflation rate is approximately equal to the difference between the nominal and real interest rates in any given country let us assume that the real interest rate is equal across two countries the us and germany for example due to capital mobility such that formula 8 then substituting the approximate relationship above into the relative purchasing power parity formula results in the formal equation for the international fisher effect where formula

originally developed to produce oxide dispersion strengthened ods nickel and iron base superalloys for applications in the aerospace industry ma has now been shown to be capable of synthesizing a variety of equilibrium and non equilibrium alloy phases starting from blended elemental or pre alloyed powders the non equilibrium phases synthesized include supersaturated solid solutions metastable crystalline and quasicrystalline phases nanostructures and amorphous alloys one consideration that should be avoided is powder contamination mechanical alloying is akin to metal powder processing where metals may be mixed to produce superalloys mechanical alloying occurs in three steps first the alloy materials are combined in a ball mill and ground to a fine powder a hot isostatic pressing hip process is then applied to simultaneously compress and sinter the powder a final heat treatment stage helps remove existing internal stresses produced during any cold compaction which may have been used this produces an alloy suitable for high heat turbine blades and aerospace components design parameters include type of mill milling container milling speed milling time type size and size distribution of the grinding medium ball to powder weight ratio extent of filling the vial milling atmosphere process control agent temperature of milling and

floristic quality assessment was originally developed in order to assess the likelihood that impacts to an area would be irreversible or irretrievable to make standard comparisons among various open land areas to set conservation priorities and to monitor site management or restoration efforts the concept was developed by gerould wilhelm in the 1970s in a report on the natural lands of kane county illinois and codified for the chicago region in 1979 each plant species in a region is assigned a coefficient of conservatism also known as a c value ranging between 0 and 10 a plant species with a higher score e g 10 has a lower tolerance to environmental degradation such as grazing or development and therefore is naturally restricted to undisturbed remnant habitats non native plants are either assigned a c value of 0 or are excluded from assessments in the chicago region 84 of the native plant species have a c value of 4 or greater plants with a c value of 4 or greater rarely naturally move from a remnant area to surrounding degraded land c values are assigned within specific ecological and geographic regions by botanical experts familiar with the species autecology within the

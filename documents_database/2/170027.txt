a type of junctional complex they are localized spot like adhesions randomly arranged on the lateral sides of plasma membranes desmosomes are one of the stronger cell to cell adhesion types and are found in tissue that experience intense mechanical stress such as cardiac muscle tissue bladder tissue gastrointestinal mucosa and epithelia the desmosome was first discovered by giulio bizzozero an italian pathologist he named these dense nodules the nodes of bizzozero in 1920 the term desmosome was originated by josef schaffer the first combining form desmo new latin from greek desmos bond carries meaning of binding or bonding things together combined with some which comes from soma body it thus makes a desmosome a binding body desmosomes are composed of desmosome intermediate filament complexes difc which is a network of cadherin proteins linker proteins and keratin intermediate filaments the difcs can be broken into three regions the extracellular core region or desmoglea the outer dense plaque or odp and the inner dense plaque or idp the extracellular core region approximately 34 nm in length contains desmoglein and desmocollin which are in the cadherin family of cell adhesion proteins both have five extracellular domains and have calcium binding motifs extracellular

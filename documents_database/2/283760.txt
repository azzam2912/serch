it is known to be orbited by two giant planets this star is 24 more massive and 64 larger than our sun the total luminosity is 2 96 times that of our sun and its temperature 5960 k the age of the star is estimated at approximately 3 7 billion years with metallicity 1 35 times that of the sun based on its abundance of iron in april 2001 two giant planets were announced orbiting the star the first planet hd 74156 b orbits the star at a distance closer than mercury is to our sun in an extremely eccentric orbit the second planet hd 74156 c is a long period massive planet at least 8 times the mass of jupiter which orbits the star in an elliptical orbit with a semimajor axis of 3 90 astronomical units given the two planet configuration of the system under the assumption that the orbits are coplanar and have masses equal to their minimum masses an additional saturn mass planet would be stable in a region between 0 9 and 1 4 au between the orbits of the two known planets under the packed planetary systems hypothesis which predicts that planetary systems form

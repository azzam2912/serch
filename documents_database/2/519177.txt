let a denote a second rank tensor in r which can be represented by a 3 by 3 matrix we assume that a is symmetric this implies that a has three real eigenvalues which we denote by formula 1 formula 1 and formula 1 we assume that they are ordered such that the axiality of a is defined by the rhombicity is the difference between the smallest and the second smallest eigenvalue other definitions of axiality and rhombicity differ from the ones given above by constant factors which depend on the context for example when using them as parameters in the irreducible spherical tensor expansion it is most convenient to divide the above definition of axiality by formula 7 and that of rhombicity by formula 8 the description of physical interactions in terms of axiality and rhombicity is frequently encountered in spin dynamics and in particular in spin relaxation theory where many traceless bilinear interaction hamiltonians having the eigenframe form hats denote spin projection operators may be conveniently rotated using rank 2 irreducible spherical tensor operators where formula 12 are wigner functions formula 13 are euler angles and the expressions for the rank 2 irreducible spherical tensor operators are defining

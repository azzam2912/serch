unlike most of the 500 or so streptomyces species it is a plant pathogen causing corky lesions to form on tuber and root crops as well as decreasing the growth of seedlings along with other closely related species it causes the potato disease common scab which is an economically important disease in many potato growing areas it was first described in 1892 being classified as a fungus before being renamed in 1914 and again in 1948 several other species of streptomyces cause similar diseases to s scabies but other more closely related species do not the genome of s scabies has been sequenced and is the largest streptomyces genome known so far the genome contains a pathogenicity island containing the genes required for s scabies to infect plants and which can be transferred between different species s scabies can produce several related toxins which are the most responsible for its pathogenicity but several other systems have also been identified which contribute it can infect young seedlings of all plants as well as mature root and tuber crops but is most often associated with causing common scab of potato the first known reference to common scab of potatoes dates back to

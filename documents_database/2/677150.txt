its location in the brain also allows it to play a vital role in the control of autonomic functions by the central nervous system it is one of the circumventricular organs enabling the dual role of being a sensor for circulating chemical messengers in the blood as well as integrating neural inputs in the brainstem the area postrema is a small protuberance found at the inferoposterior limit of the fourth ventricle specialized ependymal cells are found within the area postrema these cells differ slightly from the majority of ependymal cells ependymocytes forming a unicellular epithelial lining of the ventricles and central canal the area postrema is separated from the vagal triangle by the funiculus separans a thin semitransparent ridge the vagal triangle overlies the dorsal vagal nucleus and is situated on the caudal end of the rhomboid fossa or floor of the fourth ventricle the area postrema is situated just before the obex the inferior apex of the caudal ventricular floor both the funiculus separans and area postrema have a similar thick ependyma containing tanycyte covering ependyma and tanycytes can participate in the transport of neurochemicals into and out of the cerebrospinal fluid from its cells or adjacent neurons glia

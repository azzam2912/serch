a total of thirteen species have been recorded a few examples are listed below this subgroup was recognized in 2012 many species of the carolinensis subgroup are remarkably obscure and with the exception of a few species such as a carolinensis very little is known about its members or its origin however it is believed that the clade originated on cuba glor 2005 with repeated overwater dispersion leading to multiple speciation events it is believed that at least four separate speciation events would have been necessary to explain the diversity found within the carolinensis subgroup however the origin of several species such as a longiceps a brunneus and a maynardi has not been fully understood it is believed that the last common ancestor of the carolinensis subgroup evolved approximately six million years ago molecular dating currently supports this theory the sister subgroup to the carolinensus subgroup is the isolepis group with three species glor 2005 in many respects the anoles of the anolis carolinensis clade are typical trunk crown anoles they have a slender build have large subdigital toe pads to cling to vertical surfaces are commonly found several metres above the ground and with the exception of a brunneus

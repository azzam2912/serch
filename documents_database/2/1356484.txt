2f5 recognizes an epitope in the membrane proximal external region mper of hiv 1 gp41 2f5 then binds to this epitope and its constant region interacts with the viral lipid membrane which neutralizes the virus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv 1 is the most common strain of hiv it contains three structural genes and six regulatory genes one of the structural genes is env which codes for the surface proteins gp120 and gp41 gp41 whose gene is the target for 2f5 is a transmembrane protein that associates with gp120 to bind the virus to cd4 and a chemokine co receptor on the target cell and infect it 2f5 binds to the variable regions of e nv and neutralizes the virus before it infects target cells 2f5 recognizes a core specific epitope eldkwas the amino acid sequence from positions 662 to 668 of env gp41 mutations at each of these amino acid positions of the epitope showed a decrease in or loss of 2f5 binding affinity further studies have expanded the ideal epitope beyond eldkwas and revealed that the extended linear epitope neqelleldkwaslwn increased 2f5 affinity greatly the 3d structure of hiv 1 is believed to change throughout phases of

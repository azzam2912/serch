it was developed by vladimir belinski and vladimir zakharov in 1978 the belinski zakharov transform is a generalization of the inverse scattering transform the solutions produced by this transform are called gravitational solitons gravisolitons despite the term soliton being used to describe gravitational solitons their behavior is very different from other classical solitons in particular gravitational solitons do not preserve their amplitude and shape in time and up to june 2012 their general interpretation remains unknown what is known however is that most black holes and particularly the schwarzschild metric and the kerr metric are special cases of gravitational solitons the belinski zakharov transform works for spacetime intervals of the form where we use einstein s summation convention for formula 2 it is assumed that both the function formula 3 and the matrix formula 4 depend on the coordinates formula 5 and formula 6 only despite being a specific form of the spacetime interval that depends only on two variables it includes a great number of interesting solutions a special cases such as the schwarzschild metric the kerr metric einstein rosen metric and many others in this case einstein s vacuum equation formula 7 decomposes into two sets of equations

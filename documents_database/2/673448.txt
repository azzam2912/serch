g01 means linear g02 means circular and the next cutter location itself the cartesian point 20 1 3 4 409 in this example g01 x20y1 3z4 409 the fundamental basis for creating the cutter paths suitable for cnc milling are functions that can find valid cutter locations and stringing them together in a series there are two broad and conflicting approaches to the problem of generating valid cutter locations given a cad model and a tool definition calculation by offsets and calculation against triangles each is discussed in a later section of this article the most common example of the general cutter location problem is cutter radius compensation crc in which an endmill whether square end ball end or bull end must be offset to compensate for its radius since the 1950s crc calculations finding tangency points on the fly have been done automatically within cnc controls following the instructions of g codes such as g40 g41 and g42 the chief inputs have been the radius offset values stored in the offset registers typically called via address d and the left right climb conventional distinction called via g41 or g42 respectively with the advent of cam software which added a

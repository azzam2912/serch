it is named after tsutomu mizoroki and richard f heck heck was awarded the 2010 nobel prize in chemistry which he shared with ei ichi negishi and akira suzuki for the discovery and development of this reaction this reaction was the first example of a carbon carbon bond forming reaction that followed a pd 0 pd ii catalytic cycle the same catalytic cycle that is seen in other pd 0 catalyzed cross coupling reactions the heck reaction is a way to substitute alkenes the original reaction by tsutomu mizoroki 1971 describes the coupling between iodobenzene and styrene to form stilbene in methanol at 120 c autoclave with potassium acetate base and palladium chloride catalysis this work was an extension of earlier work by fujiwara 1967 on the pd ii mediated coupling of arenes ar h and alkenes and earlier work by heck 1969 on the coupling of arylmercuric halides arhgcl with alkenes using a stoichiometric amount of a palladium ii species in 1972 heck acknowledged the mizoroki publication and detailed independently discovered work the reaction conditions differ in catalyst used palladium acetate and catalyst loading 0 01 eq base used a hindered amine and lack of solvent in these reactions

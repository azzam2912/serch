research and development has advanced so that smart low speed diesel engines are being installed in new ships the concept of the intelligent engine revolves around the idea that the engine is thinking for itself the brain of the system is an electronic control system that analyzes the condition of the engine and the operation of the engine s system the fuel injection exhaust valve cylinder lube oil and turbo charging system along with the control and timing needed to make the diesel run smoothly the intelligent diesel goes beyond that by monitoring and evaluating the condition of the engine based on engine conditions the smart system can actively protect the engine from damage due to overload lack of maintenance and maladjustment the intelligent engines finite control gives the bridge the ability to manually adjust more variables than the current camshaft system along with manual controls operators can specifically design programs that optimize fuel economy emission turbo output allowing for high performance under different loads the convenience of the camshaft is that not only does it keep the timing of the opening and closing valves and injecting fuel through its cams it is also responsible for the mechanical force that

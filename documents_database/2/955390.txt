the triple correlation extends the concept of autocorrelation which correlates a function with a single shifted copy of itself and thereby enhances its latent periodicities the theory of the triple correlation was first investigated by statisticians examining the cumulant structure of non gaussian random processes it was also independently studied by physicists as a tool for spectroscopy of laser beams hideya gamo in 1963 described an apparatus for measuring the triple correlation of a laser beam and also showed how phase information can be recovered from the real part of the bispectrum up to sign reversal and linear offset however gamo s method implicitly requires the fourier transform to never be zero at any frequency this requirement was relaxed and the class of functions which are known to be uniquely identified by their triple and higher order correlations was considerably expanded by the study of yellott and iverson 1992 yellott iverson also pointed out the connection between triple correlations and the visual texture discrimination theory proposed by bela julesz triple correlation methods are frequently used in signal processing for treating signals that are corrupted by additive white gaussian noise in particular triple correlation techniques are suitable when multiple observations of

it consists of a power capacitor connected in series with a bidirectional thyristor valve and usually a current limiting reactor inductor the thyristor switched capacitor is an important component of a static var compensator svc where it is often used in conjunction with a thyristor controlled reactor tcr static var compensators are a member of the flexible ac transmission system facts family a tsc is usually a three phase assembly connected either in a delta or a star arrangement unlike the tcr a tsc generates no harmonics and so requires no filtering for this reason some svcs have been built with only tscs this can lead to a relatively cost effective solution where the svc only requires capacitive reactive power although a disadvantage is that the reactive power output can only be varied in steps continuously variable reactive power output is only possible where the svc contains a tcr or another variable element such as a statcom unlike the tcr the tsc is only ever operated fully on or fully off an attempt to operate a tsc in phase control would result in the generation of very large amplitude resonant currents leading to overheating of the capacitor bank and thyristor

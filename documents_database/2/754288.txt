aspects of the film are inspired by the film snakes on a plane which was scheduled for theatrical release three days later on august 18 2006 although taking the same basic idea from snakes on a plane lots of deadly snakes loose on a claustrophobic high speed means of transport the background story of how the snakes end up on the train is completely different in the film a woman has been put under a mayan curse which causes snake eggs to hatch inside her belly and eat their way out in order to recover the lost pieces of herself the snakes she must travel to los angeles where a powerful mayan shaman can lift the curse she takes the snakes along with her in small jars while on the train bandits attack her allowing the snakes to escape endangering the rest of the passengers eventually and inexplicably she herself transforms into a gigantic snake and swallows the moving train whole six passengers manage to escape unharmed and one of them performs a magic ritual which causes her to vanish however one girl is shown to have been unknowingly bitten suggesting that the curse will remain according to co producer

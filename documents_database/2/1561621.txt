the implementation differs but the ban in most jurisdictions mandates that shops and stores that sell tobacco products keep the products out of sight of customers under the counter or in special cabinets tobacco products can only be shown on request from customers the idea behind the regulation is that people would be less inclined to smoke if they can not see the products the long term effects of these policies cannot be proven as insufficient evidence currently exists some studies have been undertaken and others are ongoing opponents of the ban claim that the regulations have caused shops to close as a result of costs associated with the ban and that the bans have caused the proportion of illegal or contraband cigarettes sold to increase following the 2007 ban in canada in the span of 2 3 years a reduction of 5 of illegal cigarettes was observed 20 7 per cent of cigarettes sold in 2010 were illegal down from 25 1 in 2008 and 15 per cent of convenience stores have closed in iceland 30 per cent of smaller shops have closed it is not yet clear whether the shop closures were linked to the tobacco display ban

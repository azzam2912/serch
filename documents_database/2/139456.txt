agents where the main therapeutic effect is mediated by negative modulation of histamine receptors are termed antihistamines other agents may have antihistaminergic action but are not true antihistamines in common use the term antihistamine refers only to h antihistamines virtually all h antihistamines function as inverse agonists at the histamine h receptor as opposed to neutral antagonists as was previously believed in type i hypersensitivity allergic reactions an allergen a type of antigen interacts with and cross links surface ige antibodies on mast cells and basophils once the allergen cross links immunoglobulin e tyrosine kinases rapidly signal into the cell leading to cell degranulation and the release of histamine and other chemical mediators from the mast cell or basophil once released the histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors histamine acting on h receptors produces pruritus vasodilation hypotension flushing headache bradycardia bronchoconstriction increase in vascular permeability and potentiation of pain while h antihistamines help against these effects they work only if taken before contact with the allergen in severe allergies such as anaphylaxis or angioedema these effects may be of life threatening severity additional administration of epinephrine often in the form of an autoinjector is required

different techniques are used to automate patch clamp recordings from cells in cell culture and in vivo this work has been ongoing since the late 1990s by research labs and companies trying to reduce its complexity and cost of patch clamping manually patch clamping for a long time was considered an art form and is still very time consuming and tedious especially in vivo the automation techniques try to reduce user error and variability in obtaining quality electrophysiology recordings from single cells the traditional manual method to patch clamp using glass pipettes was developed by erwin neher and bert sakmann and required a highly skilled technician the technician would position the glass pipette near a cell and apply the appropriate suction to create an electrical seal between the pipette and the cell membrane this seal ensures a quality recording by preventing any current from leaking out between the tip of the pipette and the cell membrane this seal is made when the membrane of the cell chemically binds with the tip of the pipette so that the inside of the pipette is only connected to the cytoplasm of the cell this membrane glass connection or seal is called a gigaseal

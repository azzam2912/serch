matrix multiplication is an example let formula 1 and formula 2 be three vector spaces over the same base field formula 3 a bilinear map is a function such that formula 5 the map formula 6 is a linear map from formula 8 to formula 2 and formula 10 the map formula 11 is a linear map from formula 13 to formula 2 in other words when we hold the first entry of the bilinear map fixed while letting the second entry vary the result is a linear operator and similarly for when we hold the second entry fixed if and we have for all v w in v then we say that b is symmetric the case where x is the base field f and we have a bilinear form is particularly useful see for example scalar product inner product and quadratic form the definition works without any changes if instead of vector spaces over a field f we use modules over a commutative ring r it generalizes to n ary functions where the proper term is multilinear for non commutative rings r and s a left r module m and a right s module n a bilinear map

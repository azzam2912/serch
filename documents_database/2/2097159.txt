the genus contains only one species pappochelys rosinae from the middle triassic of germany which was named by paleontologists and hans dieter sues in 2015 the discovery of pappochelys provides strong support for the placement of turtles within diapsida a hypothesis that has long been suggested by molecular data but never previously by the fossil record it is morphologically intermediate between the definite stem turtle odontochelys from the late triassic of china and eunotosaurus a reptile from the middle permian of south africa pappochelys had a wide body small skull and a long tail that makes up about half of the total body length which is up to the skull is pointed with large eye sockets several turtle like features are present including expanded ribs and gastralia that seem to be precursors of a shell as is the case in eunotosaurus each rib is flattened into a broad blade like structure with bumps and ridges covering its outer surface and a ridge running down its inner surface forming a t shape in cross section the gastralia rib like bones covering the abdomen are tightly packed and occasionally fused together forming a structure similar to the plastron of turtles unlike turtles

one of the main goal in compressed sensing is the recovery process generally speaking recovery process in compressed sensing is a method by which the original signal is estimated using the knowledge of the compressed signal and the measurement matrix mathematically the recovery process in compressed sensing is finding the sparsest possible solution of an under determined system of linear equations based on the nature of the measurement matrix one can employ different reconstruction methods if the measurement matrix is also sparse one efficient way is to use message passing algorithms for signal recovery although there are message passing approaches that deals with dense matrices the nature of those algorithms are to some extent different from the algorithms working on sparse matrices the main problem in recovery process in cs is to find the sparsest possible solution to the following under determined system of linear equations formula 1 where formula 2 is the measurement matrix formula 3 is the original signal to be recovered and formula 4 is the compresses known signal when the matrix formula 2 is sparse one can represent this matrix by a bipartite graph formula 6 for better understanding formula 7 is the set of variable

the atmosphere of earth protects life on earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the earth s surface absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation warming the surface through heat retention greenhouse effect and reducing temperature extremes between day and night the diurnal temperature variation by volume dry air contains 78 09 nitrogen 20 95 oxygen 0 93 argon 0 04 carbon dioxide and small amounts of other gases air also contains a variable amount of water vapor on average around 1 at sea level and 0 4 over the entire atmosphere air composition temperature and atmospheric pressure vary with altitude and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in earth s troposphere and in artificial atmospheres the atmosphere has a mass of about 5 15 kg three quarters of which is within about of the surface the atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space the k rm n line at or 1 57 of earth s radius is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of

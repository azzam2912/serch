hmsn are characterised by atypical neural development and degradation of neural tissue the two common forms of hmsn are either hypertrophic demyelinated nerves or complete atrophy of neural tissue hypertrophic condition causes neural stiffness and a demyelination of nerves in the peripheral nervous system and atrophy causes the breakdown of axons and neural cell bodies in these disorders a patient experiences progressive muscle atrophy and sensory neuropathy of the extremities the term hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy was used mostly historically to denote the more common forms charcot marie tooth disease cmt with the identification of a wide number of genetically and phenotypically distinct forms of cmt the term hmsn is now used less frequently neuropathy disorders usually have onset in childhood or young adulthood motor symptoms seem to be more predominant that sensory symptoms symptoms of these disorders include fatigue pain lack of balance lack of feeling lack of reflexes and lack of sight and hearing which result from muscle atrophy patients can also suffer from high arched feet hammer toes foot drop foot deformities and scoliosis these symptoms are a result of severe muscular weakness and atrophy in patients suffering from demyelinating neuropathy symptoms are due to slow

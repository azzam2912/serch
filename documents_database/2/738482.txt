each event occurs at a particular instant in time and marks a change of state in the system between consecutive events no change in the system is assumed to occur thus the simulation time can directly jump to the occurrence time of the next event which is called next event time progression in addition to next event time progression there is also an alternative approach called fixed increment time progression where time is broken up into small time slices and the system state is updated according to the set of events activities happening in the time slice because not every time slice has to be simulated a next event time simulation can typically run much faster than a corresponding fixed increment time simulation both forms of des contrast with continuous simulation in which the system state is changed continuously over time on the basis of a set of differential equations defining the rates of change of state variables a common exercise in learning how to build discrete event simulations is to model a queue such as customers arriving at a bank to be served by a teller in this example the system entities are customer queue and tellers the system

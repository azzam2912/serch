these devices may be for one time use or may be reset manually or automatically a thermal fuse is a cutoff which uses a one time fusible link unlike a thermal switch which may automatically reset itself when the temperature drops the thermal fuse is more like an electrical fuse a single use device that cannot be reset and must be replaced when it fails or is triggered a thermal fuse is used when the overheating is a result of a rare occurrence such as failure requiring repair which would also replace the fuse or replacement at the end of service life one mechanism is a small meltable pellet that holds down a spring when the pellet melts the spring is released separating the contacts and breaking the circuit the tamura le series nec sefuse sf series microtemp g4a series and hosho elmwood d series for example may use alloy pellets that contain copper beryllium and silver to melt at a precise temperature thermal fuses are usually found in heat producing electrical appliances such as coffeemakers and hair dryers they function as safety devices to disconnect the current to the heating element in case of a malfunction such as a

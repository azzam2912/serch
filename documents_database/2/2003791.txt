it states that if is a closed subgroup of a lie group then is an embedded lie group with the smooth structure and hence the group topology agreeing with the embedding one of several results known as cartan s theorem it was first published in 1930 by lie cartan who was inspired by john von neumann s 1929 proof of a special case for groups of linear transformations let formula 1 be a lie group with lie algebra formula 2 now let formula 3 be an arbitrary closed subgroup of formula 1 our goal is to show that formula 3 is a smooth embedded submanifold of formula 1 our first step is to identify something that could be the lie algebra of formula 3 that is the tangent space of formula 3 at the identity the challenge is that formula 3 is not assumed to have any smoothness and therefore it is not clear how one may define its tangent space to proceed we define the lie algebra formula 10 of formula 3 by the formula it is not difficult to show that formula 10 is a lie subalgebra of formula 2 in particular formula 10 is a subspace of

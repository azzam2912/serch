methods of transportation fall into three categories due to its weight transportation of water is very energy intensive unless it has the assistance of gravity a canal or long distance pipeline will need pumping stations at regular intervals in this regard the lower friction levels of the canal make it a more economical solution than the pipeline water transportation is also very common along rivers and oceans the grand canal of china finished in the 7th century ad and measuring the california aqueduct near sacramento is long the great manmade river is a vast underground network of pipes 1600 kilometres 994 miles in the sahara desert transporting water from an immense aquifer to the largest cities in the region the keita integrated development project used specially created plows called the donaldo and scarabeo to build water catchments in these catchments trees were planted which grow on the water flowing through the ditches the kimberley water source project is currently underway in australia to determine the best method of transporting water from the fitzroy river to the city of perth options being considered include a 3 700 kilometre canal a pipeline of at least 1 800 kilometres tankers of 300 000

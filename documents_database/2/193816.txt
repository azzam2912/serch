the 7600 ran at 36 4 mhz 27 5 ns clock cycle and had a 65 kword primary memory with a 60 bit word size using magnetic core and variable size up to 512 kword secondary memory depending on site it was generally about ten times as fast as the cdc 6600 and could deliver about 10 mflops on hand compiled code with a peak of 36 mflops in addition in benchmark tests in early 1970 it was shown to be slightly faster than its ibm rival the ibm system 360 model 195 when the system was released in 1969 it sold for around 5 million in base configurations and considerably more as options and features were added among the 7600 s notable state of the art contributions beyond extensive pipelining was the physical c shape which both reduced floor space and dramatically increased performance by reducing the distance that signals needed to travel as the 6600 neared production quality cray lost interest in it and turned to designing its replacement making a machine somewhat faster would not be too difficult in the late 1960s the introduction of integrated circuits allowed denser packing of components and in turn a higher

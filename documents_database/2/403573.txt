the mathematical approach is used with the goal of deriving hypotheses that are more exact and thus yield stricter empirical validations quantifiable behavior is in practice often constituted by task performance as quantification of behavior is fundamental in this endeavor the theory of measurement is a central topic in mathematical psychology mathematical psychology is therefore closely related to psychometrics however where psychometrics is concerned with individual differences or population structure in mostly static variables mathematical psychology focuses on process models of perceptual cognitive and motor processes as inferred from the average individual furthermore where psychometrics investigates the stochastic dependence structure between variables as observed in the population mathematical psychology almost exclusively focuses on the modeling of data obtained from experimental paradigms and is therefore even more closely related to experimental psychology cognitive psychology psychonomics like computational neuroscience and econometrics mathematical psychology theory often uses statistical optimality as a guiding principle assuming that the human brain has evolved to solve problems in an optimized way central themes from cognitive psychology limited vs unlimited processing capacity serial vs parallel processing etc and their implications are central in rigorous analysis in mathematical psychology mathematical psychologists are active in many fields of psychology especially

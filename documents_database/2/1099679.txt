petroleum is transported via rail cars trucks tanker vessels and through pipelines which method is used to move this oil depends on the amount that is being moved and its destination the biggest problems with moving this oil are pollution and the chance of being spilled petroleum oil is very hard to clean up and is very toxic to living animals marine vessels and barges can transport this petroleum all around the world because these vessels can carry a lot of fuel the amount it costs per barrel to move this oil is very cheap these tankers are also the only practical way to move crude oil across the oceans usually the larger tankers are used to transport this fuel on a global scale taking fuel from one continent to the other barges are more like tankers but smaller and do not have any method of propulsion to move them they are often pushed or towed by tugs this makes barges very ineffective for transporting this oil for long distances barges are also not applicable for traveling across rough seas so they are used in calmer waters however these barges are usually used for transporting the fuel shorter distances pipelines

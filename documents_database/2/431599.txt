in effect a physical machine can be partitioned into multiple logical partitions each hosting a separate instance of an operating system ibm developed the concept of hypervisors virtual machines in cp 40 and cp 67 and in 1972 provided it for the s 370 as virtual machine facility 370 ibm introduced the start interpretive execution sie instruction designed specifically for the execution of virtual machines as part of 370 xa architecture on the 3081 as well as vm xa versions of vm to exploit it pr sm is a type 1 hypervisor based on the cp component of vm xa that runs directly on the machine level and allocates system resources across lpars to share physical resources it is a standard feature on ibm system z only an ibm power system uses phyp the power hypervisor to enable its lpar functionalities for system p and system i since approximately 2000 in power4 systems the terms pr sm and lpar are often used interchangeably in ibm z including in ibm documentation formally lpar designates the logical partitioning function and mode of operation whereas pr sm is the commercial designation of the feature amdahl corporation s multiple domain facility mdf was introduced

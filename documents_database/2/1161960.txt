the functors in question are the exclamation mark is often pronounced shriek slang for exclamation mark and the maps called f shriek or f lower shriek and f upper shriek see also shriek map the exceptional inverse image is in general defined on the level of derived categories only similar considerations apply to tale sheaves on schemes the functors are adjoint to each other as depicted at the right where as usual formula 1 means that f is left adjoint to g equivalently g right adjoint to f i e for any two objects a b in the two categories being adjoint by f and g for example f is the left adjoint of f by the standard reasoning with adjointness relations there are natural unit and counit morphisms formula 2 and formula 3 for formula 4 on y and formula 5 on x respectively however these are almost never isomorphisms see the localization example below verdier duality gives another link between them morally speaking it exchanges and i e in the synopsis above it exchanges functors along the diagonals for example the direct image is dual to the direct image with compact support this phenomenon is studied and used

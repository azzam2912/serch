it is a colorless flammable gas with a faint sweet and musky odour when pure it is the simplest alkene a hydrocarbon with carbon carbon double bonds ethylene is widely used in the chemical industry and its worldwide production over 150 million tonnes in 2016 exceeds that of any other organic compound much of this production goes toward polyethylene a widely used plastic containing polymer chains of ethylene units in various chain lengths ethylene is also an important natural plant hormone and is used in agriculture to force the ripening of fruits ethylene s hydrate is ethanol this hydrocarbon has four hydrogen atoms bound to a pair of carbon atoms that are connected by a double bond all six atoms that comprise ethylene are coplanar the h c h angle is 117 4 close to the 120 for ideal sp hybridized carbon the molecule is also relatively rigid rotation about the c c bond is a high energy process that requires breaking the bond the bond in the ethylene molecule is responsible for its useful reactivity the double bond is a region of high electron density thus it is susceptible to attack by electrophiles many reactions of ethylene are catalyzed

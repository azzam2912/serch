there are three main types of operators mutation crossover and selection which must work in conjunction with one another in order for the algorithm to be successful genetic operators are used to create and maintain genetic diversity mutation operator combine existing solutions also known as chromosomes into new solutions crossover and select between solutions selection in his book discussing the use of genetic programming for the optimization of complex problems computer scientist john koza has also identified an inversion or permutation operator however the effectiveness of this operator has never been conclusively demonstrated and this operator is rarely discussed mutation or mutation like operators are said to be unary operators as they only operate on one chromosome at a time in contrast crossover operators are said to be binary operators as they operate on two chromosomes at a time combining two existing chromosomes into one new chromosome genetic variation is a necessity for the process of evolution genetic operators used in genetic algorithms are analogous to those in the natural world survival of the fittest or selection reproduction crossover also called recombination and mutation selection operators give preference to better solutions chromosomes allowing them to pass on their genes to

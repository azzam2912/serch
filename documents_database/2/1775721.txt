s in 1950 in 1956 he received a phd from the university of rochester in nuclear physics under david feldman with a thesis entitled high order corrections to the nucleon nucleon potential in change symmetric pseudoscalar theory after his phd he worked at the princeton plasma physics laboratory on project matterhorn where he was one of the leading theoretical physicists and remained until 1982 in 1982 he was senior technical advisor in the theory group of general atomics and simultaneously adjunct professor at the university of california san diego he was the author of a series of works with john johnson and katherine weimer on equilibria and instabilities in tokamak and stellarator plasmas in magnetohydrodynamics with johnson and ray grimm he developed the computer program pest princeton equilibrium and stability in tokamak s code with bruno coppi and others he investigated dissipative instabilities in plasmas with ira b bernstein and martin kruskal he did research on bgk modes nonlinear wave solutions in plasma physics in the 1970s he worked on hamiltonian dynamics in chaos theory in 1979 he published greene s criterion for the collapse of tori in kam theory in 1992 he won the james clerk maxwell prize in

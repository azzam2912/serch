like the previous year s zeeland goldregen takes the form of a series of spontaneous jams quickly recorded and mastered unlike zeeland goldregen is entirely acoustic containing only piano violin harmonium drums and vocals unlike most other albums released by klaus dinger it is quiet and meditative rather than aggressive or abrasive its low key and low fi values arguable align it with ambient music the album title is a play on words the cover painting depicts a laburnum plant which in german is called goldregen klaus dinger s grand piano was made by a company called goldregen recording began on 2 may 1998 at klaus dinger s studio in d sseldorf starting with the album s opener zeeland wunderbar the only track to have been written before sessions began it features klaus dinger s mother renate on vocals and is a light hearted humorous track about life in zeeland on 27 may klaus and victoria wehrmeister convened in dinger s dutch studio to create three harmonium based tracks which close the album whilst rembrandt lensink and thomas dinger finalised zeeland wunderbar in d sseldorf four days later the whole band met up in d sseldorf to record tracks 2

for the first time since 1968 the german entry was chosen internally rather than through a public selection cindy bert were a very well known and popular act in germany had already had several hit singles and had narrowly missed out on victory in the german eurovision selection in 1972 however the song choice was unenthusiastically received as it was considered a somewhat dated schlager effort with limited appeal to non germanic audiences few in germany predicted anything other than an also ran result particularly as the competition in 1974 was shaping up to be unusually strong with some very well known names being announced as representatives by other participants such as italy the netherlands and the united kingdom on the night of the final cindy bert performed 14th in the running order following ireland and preceding switzerland despite a strong vocal performance from the couple the widely predicted poor result materialised as at the close of voting die sommermelodie had picked up only 3 points placing germany joint last along with norway portugal and switzerland of the 17 entries

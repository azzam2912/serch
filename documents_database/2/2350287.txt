the electric field is applied by a pair of electrodes after the parts being joined are clamped together the clamping force is maintained until the joint solidifies advantages of this process are fast cycle times on the order of a few seconds automation repeatability and good weld appearance only plastics which have dipoles can be heated using radio waves and therefore not all plastics are able to be welded using this process also this process is not well suited for thick or overly complex joints the most common use of this process is lap joints or seals on thin plastic sheets or parts four types of polarization can occur in materials subjected to high frequency alternating electric fields dipole polarization is the phenomenon that is responsible for the heating mechanism in radio frequency plastic welding dielectric heating when an electric field is applied to a molecule with an asymmetric distribution of charge or dipole the electric forces cause the molecule to align itself with the electrical field when an alternating electrical field is applied the molecule will continuously reverse its alignment leading to molecular rotation this process is not instantaneous therefore if the frequency is high enough the dipole will

based on parallax measurements the distance to this star is about although the margin of error is large at 43 the apparent visual magnitude is 10 5 so viewing it would require a telescope with an aperture of but preferably larger this is a t tauri star which is a stage that a newly formed low mass star passes through before settling down onto the main sequence where it will generate all of its energy through hydrogen fusion at its core the age of this star is about 2 3 million years it is showing random fluctuations in luminosity including variations in ultraviolet and x ray emissions the spectrum of the star is displaying emission lines of hydrogen overlaid on the star s normal spectra this may be caused by the impact of infalling gas on the star s outer envelope combined with the signature of a strong outflowing wind near the star mass is accreting onto the star at the rate of about times the mass of the sun per year ru lupi has an estimated mass of 0 6 0 7 times the mass of the sun and 1 6 times the sun s radius it is radiating

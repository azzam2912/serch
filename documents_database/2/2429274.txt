this is primarily to improve the durability of a component it was first invented in 1955 by h b sargent r m poorman and h lamprey and is applied to a component using a specifically designed detonation gun d gun the component being sprayed must be prepared correctly by removing all surface oils greases debris and roughing up the surface in order to achieve a strongly bonded detonation spray coating this process involves the highest velocities 3500 m s shockwave that propels the coating materials and temperatures 4000 c of coating materials compared to all other forms of thermal spraying techniques which means detonation spraying is able to apply low porous below 1 and low oxygen content between 0 1 0 5 protective coatings that protect against corrosion abrasion and adhesion under low load this process allows the application of very hard and dense surface coatings which are useful as wear resistant coatings for this reason detonation spraying is commonly used for protective coatings in aircraft engines plug and ring gauges cutting edges skiving knives tubular drills rotor and stator blades guide rails or any other metallic material that is subject to high wear and tear commonly the materials that

it has been suggested that agag was a dynastic name of the kings of amalek just as pharaoh was used as a dynastic name for the ancient egyptians the etymology is uncertain according to john l mckenzie 1995 while cox 1884 suggested high in the torah the expression higher than agag and his kingdom will be exalted was uttered by balaam in numbers 24 7 in his third prophetic utterance to describe a king of israel who would be higher than the king of amalek this is understood to mean that israel s king would take a higher position than even amalek himself and would exercise a wider authority the writer uses an allusion to the literal significance of the word agag meaning high to convey that the king of israel would be higher than high a characteristic trait of biblical poetry is to use puns in the hebrew bible agag is also referred to as the king of amalek who was defeated by king saul in fulfillment of a decree by yahweh however saul failed to execute agag and allowed the people to keep some of the spoil and this resulted in samuel s pronouncement of god s rejection

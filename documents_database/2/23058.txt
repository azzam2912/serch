thus an lfsr is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the xor of some bits of the overall shift register value the initial value of the lfsr is called the seed and because the operation of the register is deterministic the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current or previous state likewise because the register has a finite number of possible states it must eventually enter a repeating cycle however an lfsr with a well chosen feedback function can produce a sequence of bits that appears random and has a very long cycle applications of lfsrs include generating pseudo random numbers pseudo noise sequences fast digital counters and whitening sequences both hardware and software implementations of lfsrs are common the mathematics of a cyclic redundancy check used to provide a quick check against transmission errors are closely related to those of an lfsr the bit positions that affect the next state are called the taps in the diagram the taps are 16 14 13 11 the rightmost bit of the lfsr is called the output bit the taps are xor d sequentially with the output bit and then fed

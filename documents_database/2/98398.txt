information theory developed by claude e shannon during world war ii defines the notion of channel capacity and provides a mathematical model by which one can compute it the key result states that the capacity of the channel as defined above is given by the maximum of the mutual information between the input and output of the channel where the maximization is with respect to the input distribution the notion of channel capacity has been central to the development of modern wireline and wireless communication systems with the advent of novel error correction coding mechanisms that have resulted in achieving performance very close to the limits promised by channel capacity the basic mathematical model for a communication system is the following where let formula 2 and formula 6 be modeled as random variables furthermore let formula 18 be the conditional probability distribution function of formula 6 given formula 2 which is an inherent fixed property of the communication channel then the choice of the marginal distribution formula 21 completely determines the joint distribution formula 22 due to the identity which in turn induces a mutual information formula 24 the channel capacity is defined as where the supremum is taken over

it has the formula hschconh and has use in perming hair being the salt of a weak acid and weak base ammonium thioglycolate exists in solution as an equilibrium mixture of the salt itself as well as thioglycolic acid and ammonia thioglycolate in turn is able to cleave disulfide bonds capping one side with a hydrogen and forming a new disulfide with the other side a solution containing ammonium thioglycolate contains a lot of free ammonia which swells hair rendering it permeable the thioglycolic acid in the perm solution reduces the disulfide cystine bonds in the cortex of the hair in a sense the thioglycolate removes crosslinks after washing the hair is treated with a mild solution of hydrogen peroxide which oxidizes the cysteines back to cystine these new chemical bonds impart the structural rigidity necessary for a successful perm the rigidification process is akin to the vulcanization of rubber where commonly polysulfide linkages are used to crosslink the polymer chains however not as many disulfide bonds are reformed as there were before the permanent as a result the hair is weaker than before the permanent was applied and repeated applications over the same spot may eventually cause strand breakage

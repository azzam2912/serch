along with dihedral sweepback and weight distribution keel effect is one of the four main design considerations in aircraft lateral stability examples of sideforce generating surfaces are the vertical stabilizer rudder and parts of the fuselage when an aircraft is in a sideslip these surfaces generate sidewards lift forces if the surface is above or below the center of gravity the sidewards lift forces generate a rolling moment this rolling moment caused by sideslip is dihedral effect keel effect is the contribution of these side forces to rolling moment as sideslip increases i e keel effect is the contribution of the side forces to dihedral effect sideforce producing surfaces above the center of gravity will increase dihedral effect while sideforce producing surfaces below the center of gravity will decrease dihedral effect increased dihedral effect helped or hindered by keel effect results in a greater tendency for the aircraft to return to level flight when the aircraft is put into a bank or reduces the tendency to diverge to a greater bank angle when the aircraft starts wings level keel effect is also called pendulum effect because a lower center of gravity increases the effect of sideways forces above the center

it encodes a transcription factor that coordinates expression of lysosomal hydrolases membrane proteins and genes involved in autophagy upon nutrient depletion and under aberrant lysosomal storage conditions such as in lysosomal storage diseases tfeb translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus resulting in the activation of its target genes tfeb overexpression in cultured cells induces lysosomal biogenesis exocytosis and autophagy viral mediated tfeb overexpression in cellular and mouse models of lysosomal storage disorders and in common neurodegenerative diseases such as huntington parkinson and alzheimer diseases resulted in intracellular clearance of accumulating molecules and rescue of disease phenotypes tfeb is activated by pgc1 alpha and promotes reduction of htt aggregation and neurotoxicity in a mouse model of huntington disease tfeb overexpression has been found in patients with renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer and was shown to promote tumorogenesis via induction of varius oncogenic signals nuclear localization and activity of tfeb is inhibited by serine phosphorylation by mtorc1 and extracellular signal regulated kinase 2 erk2 mtorc1 phosphorylation of tfeb occurs at the lysosomal surface both of which are localized there by interaction with the rag gtpases phosphorylated tfeb is then retained in the cytosol by interaction with 14 3 3 proteins

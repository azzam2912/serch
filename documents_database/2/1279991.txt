the wavelength of the atomic spectral line in the emission spectrum gives the identity of the element while the intensity of the emitted light is proportional to the number of atoms of the element a sample of a material analyte is brought into the flame as a gas sprayed solution or directly inserted into the flame by use of a small loop of wire usually platinum the heat from the flame evaporates the solvent and breaks intramolecular bonds to create free atoms the thermal energy also excites the atoms into excited electronic states that subsequently emit light when they return to the ground electronic state each element emits light at a characteristic wavelength which is dispersed by a grating or prism and detected in the spectrometer a frequent application of the emission measurement with the flame is the regulation of alkali metals for pharmaceutical analytics inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes uses an inductively coupled plasma to produce excited atoms and ions that emit electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths characteristic of a particular element advantages of icp aes are excellent limit of detection and linear dynamic range multi element capability low chemical interference and a stable and reproducible signal

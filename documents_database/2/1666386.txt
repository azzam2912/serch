endpoints communicate based on named data instead of ip addresses ccn is characterized by the basic exchange of content request messages called interests and content return messages called content objects it is considered an information centric networking icn architecture the goals of ccn are to provide a more secure flexible and scalable network thereby addressing the internet s modern day requirements for secure content distribution on a massive scale to a diverse set of end devices ccn embodies a security model that explicitly secures individual pieces of content rather than securing the connection or pipe it provides flexibility by using data names instead of host names ip addresses additionally named and secured content resides in distributed caches automatically populated on demand or selectively pre populated when requested by name ccn delivers named content to the user from the nearest cache traversing fewer network hops eliminating redundant requests and consuming less resources overall ccn began as a research project at the palo alto research center parc in 2007 the first software release ccnx 0 1 was made available in 2009 ccn is the ancestor of related approaches including named data networking ccn technology and its open source code base has been

it is the first enzyme in the branched chain amino acid bcaa degradation pathway and facilitates the reversible transamination of bcaas and glutamate bcat1 resides in the cytoplasm while its isoform bcat2 is found in the mitochondria this gene encodes the cytosolic form of the enzyme branched chain amino acid transaminase this enzyme catalyzes the reversible transamination of branched chain alpha keto acids bckas to the branched chain amino acids bcaas valine leucine and isoleucine which are essential for cell growth in humans its primary role is the deamination of bcaas as humans lack the enzymes for de novo synthesis of bckas the respective cofactors are alpha ketoglutarate and glutamate the respective reactions are l leucine 2 oxoglutarate 4 methyl 2 oxopentanoate l glutamate l isoleucine 2 oxoglutarate s 3 methyl 2 oxopentanoate l glutamate l valine 2 oxoglutarate 3 methyl 2 oxobutanoate l glutamate cells can further degrade bckas by the branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex from which the carbon backbones of each bcaa may enter distinct degradation pathways the oncogenic transcription factor myc is frequently reported to drive bcat1 expression two different clinical disorders have been attributed to a defect of branched chain amino acid transamination hypervalinemia

the geographic position of south asia makes its biodiversity important for the study of the early dispersal of anatomically modern humans across asia studies based on mtdna variation have reported genetic unity across various south asian sub populations conclusions of studies based on y chromosome variation and autosomal dna variation have been varied although many researchers argue that most of the ancestral nodes of the phylogenetic tree of all the mtdna types originated in south asia recent genome studies appear to show that most south asians are descendants of two major ancestral components one restricted to south asia ancestral south indian and the other component ancestral north indian more closely related to those in central asia west asia and europe it has been found that the ancestral node of the phylogenetic tree of all the mtdna types mitochondrial dna haplogroups typically found in central asia the west asia and europe are also to be found in south asia at relatively high frequencies the inferred divergence of this common ancestral node is estimated to have occurred slightly less than 50 000 years ago in india the major maternal lineages are various m subclades followed by r and u sublineages these mitochondrial

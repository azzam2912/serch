most commonly in silver gelatin photography it consists of silver halide crystals dispersed in gelatin the emulsion is usually coated onto a substrate of glass films of cellulose nitrate cellulose acetate or polyester paper or fabric photographic emulsion is not a true emulsion but a suspension of solid particles silver halide in a fluid gelatin in solution however the word emulsion is customarily used in a photographic context gelatin or gum arabic layers sensitized with dichromate used in the dichromated colloid processes carbon and gum bichromate are sometimes called emulsions some processes do not have emulsions such as platinum cyanotype salted paper or kallitype photographic emulsion is a fine suspension of insoluble light sensitive crystals in a colloid sol usually consisting of gelatin the light sensitive component is one or a mixture of silver halides silver bromide chloride and iodide the gelatin is used as a permeable binder allowing processing agents e g developer fixer toners etc in aqueous solution to enter the colloid without dislodging the crystals other polymer macromolecules are often blended but gelatin has not been entirely replaced the light exposed crystals are reduced by the developer to black metallic silver particles that form the image colour

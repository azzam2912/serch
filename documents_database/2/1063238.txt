the album was released on october 16 2007 the album has been proven to be her most successful record as it was certified gold by the canadian recording industry association with sales of over 50 000 copies matthew chisling of allmusic found the album an improvement over this is me praising the production for containing both retro and modern beats and black as a performer and songwriter concluding that on revival we see so many sides of a truly multi dimensional black who thanks to more than a decade of struggle and failure releases a powerful showing of delicious rhythm blues to her fans and leaves them coming back for more black has improved in every aspect and establishes herself as a truly credible r b canadian diva who deserves heaps of praise and success canada you ve found your mary j ryan b patrick of exclaim also gave praise to the production but said that listeners might be put off by it playing safe and yearn for black s trademark genre mixing sound concluding that in the grand scheme of things however it s remarkable that a canadian r b artist even gets to record a sophomore disc much

the mail goal of development of amber is gaining experience in building rocket engines and rockets themselves amber can be used in sounding the atmosphere performing various experiments in microgravity and as a rocket and space technologies testing platform the rocket is 5 meters tall and has the diameter of 230 mm it consists of two solid boosters and hybrid main engine the main engine is a polish construction which uses highly concentrated ho as oxidiser amber has reusable head the recovery of payload is done by pirotechnical separation from head and deploying drogue and main parachutes payload touches the ground with speed of about 8 m s ilr 33 amber is designed to reach the k rm n line with 10 kilograms of payload amber is a flagship project of warsaw institute of aviation ukasiewicz research network the rocket is in development since 2014 the oxidising agent of main engine is highly concentrated ho as researchers from institute have patented unique method on obtaining this compound by distillation the project was repeatedly awarded the jury of international invention and innovation show intarg 2018 gave the platinium medal in category industry and ministry of investment and economic development diplomma on

the api supports tasks including reading temperature or voltage sensors built into a processor configuring hardware registers accessing system inventory information like model numbers and serial numbers and performing more complex activities such as upgrading system firmware or diagnosing system failures hpi is designed for use with fault tolerant and modular high availability computer systems which typically include automatic fault detection features and hardware redundancy so that they can provide continuous service availability additional features common in hardware platforms used for high availability applications include online serviceability and upgradeability via hot swappable modules the hpi specification is developed and published by the service availability forum sa forum and made freely available to the public a primary motivator for the development of the hpi specification was the emergence of modular computer hardware platforms and commercial off the shelf cots systems in the late 1990s and early 2000s this included compactpci platforms and later the advancedtca and microtca xtca platforms standardized by the pci industrial computer manufacturers group picmg these platforms include hardware management infrastructures based on the intelligent platform management interface ipmi concurrently major enterprise vendors such as hp and ibm also developed modular and bladed systems the need for the

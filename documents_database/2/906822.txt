the concept of uniform convexity was first introduced by james a clarkson in 1936 a uniformly convex space is a normed vector space so that for every formula 1 there is some formula 2 so that for any two vectors with formula 3 and formula 4 the condition implies that intuitively the center of a line segment inside the unit ball must lie deep inside the unit ball unless the segment is short the if part is trivial conversely assume now that formula 7 is uniformly convex and that formula 19 are as in the statement for some fixed formula 8 let formula 21 be the value of formula 17 corresponding to formula 23 in the definition of uniform convexity we will show that formula 24 with formula 25 if formula 26 then formula 27 and the claim is proved a similar argument applies for the case formula 28 so we can assume that formula 29 in this case since formula 30 both vectors are nonzero so we can let formula 31 and formula 32 we have formula 33 and similarly formula 34 so formula 35 and formula 36 belong to the unit sphere and have distance formula 37 hence

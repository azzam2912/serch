sli is a parallel processing algorithm for computer graphics meant to increase the available processing power the initialism sli was first used by 3dfx for scan line interleave which was introduced to the consumer market in 1998 and used in the voodoo2 line of video cards after buying out 3dfx nvidia acquired the technology but did not use it nvidia later reintroduced the sli name in 2004 and intended for it to be used in modern computer systems based on the pci express pcie bus however the technology behind the name sli has changed dramatically sli allows two three or four graphics processing units gpus to share the workload when rendering real time 3d computer graphics ideally identical gpus are installed on the motherboard that contains enough pci express slots set up in a master slave configuration all graphics cards are given an equal workload to render but the final output of each card is sent to the master card via a connector called the sli bridge for example in a two graphics card setup the master works on the top half of the scene the slave the bottom half once the slave is done it sends its render to

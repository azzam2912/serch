the ability to preferentially amplify and identify minority alleles and low level somatic dna mutations in the presence of excess wildtype alleles is useful for the detection of mutations detection of mutations is important in the case of early cancer detection from tissue biopsies and body fluids such as blood plasma or serum assessment of residual disease after surgery or chemotherapy disease staging and molecular profiling for prognosis or tailoring therapy to individual patients and monitoring of therapy outcome and cancer remission or relapse common pcr will amplify both the major wildtype and minor mutant alleles with the same efficiency occluding the ability to easily detect the presence of low level mutations the capacity to detect a mutation in a mixture of variant wildtype dna is valuable because this mixture of variant dnas can occur when provided with a heterogeneous sample as is often the case with cancer biopsies currently traditional pcr is used in tandem with a number of different downstream assays for genotyping or the detection of somatic mutations these can include the use of amplified dna for rflp analysis maldi tof matrix assisted laser desorption time of flight genotyping or direct sequencing for detection of mutations by

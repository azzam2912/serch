there may also be limited emission of heat given reactants a and b with an excited intermediate for example if a is luminol and b is hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a suitable catalyst we have where the decay of this excited state to a lower energy level causes light emission in theory one photon of light should be given off for each molecule of reactant this is equivalent to avogadro s number of photons per mole of reactant in actual practice non enzymatic reactions seldom exceed 1 q quantum efficiency in a chemical reaction reactants collide to form a transition state the enthalpic maximum in a reaction coordinate diagram which proceeds to the product normally reactants form products of lesser chemical energy the difference in energy between reactants and products represented as formula 1 is turned into heat physically realized as excitations in the vibrational state of the normal modes of the product since vibrational energy is generally much greater than the thermal agitation it rapidly disperses in the solvent through molecular rotation this is how exothermic reactions make their solutions hotter in a chemiluminescent reaction the direct product of the reaction is an excited electronic state this

they describe many different physical systems ranging from gravitation to fluid dynamics and have been used in mathematics to solve problems such as the poincar conjecture and the calabi conjecture they are difficult to study there are almost no general techniques that work for all such equations and usually each individual equation has to be studied as a separate problem a fundamental question for any pde is the existence and uniqueness of a solution for given boundary conditions for nonlinear equations these questions are in general very hard for example the hardest part of yau s solution of the calabi conjecture was the proof of existence for a monge ampere equation the basic questions about singularities their formation propagation and removal and regularity of solutions are the same as for linear pde but as usual much harder to study in the linear case one can just use spaces of distributions but nonlinear pdes are not usually defined on arbitrary distributions so one replaces spaces of distributions by refinements such as sobolev spaces an example of singularity formation is given by the ricci flow richard s hamilton showed that while short time solutions exist singularities will usually form after a finite

to determine its position a satellite navigation receiver will determine the ranges to at least four satellites as well as their positions at time of transmitting knowing the satellites orbital parameters these positions can be calculated for any point in time the pseudoranges of each satellite are obtained by multiplying the speed of light by the time the signal has taken from the satellite to the receiver as there are accuracy errors in the time measured the term pseudo ranges is used rather than ranges for such distances typically a quartz oscillator is used in the receiver to do the timing the accuracy of quartz clocks in general is worse i e more than one part in a million if the clock hasn t been corrected for a week the distance will put you not on the earth but outside the moon s orbit even if the clock is corrected a second later the clock is not usable anymore for positional calculation because after a second the error will be hundreds of meters for a typical quartz clock but in a gps receiver the clock s time is used to measure the ranges to different satellites at almost the same

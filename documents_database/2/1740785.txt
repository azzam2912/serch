he is a 2013 recipient of the john scott award for his work on electron transfer studying the organization of electrons in cells and the mechanisms by which they convert light or oxygen into energy for the cell leslie dutton was born in england he received a b sc honors in chemistry at the university of wales in 1963 and a ph d in biochemistry at the university of wales in 1967 in 1968 leslie dutton joined the university of pennsylvania where he now leads the dutton lab at the perelman school of medicine he is also principal investigator at the photosynthetic antenna research center dr dutton attempts to understand elementary processes of oxidation reduction and related biological events natural enzymes called oxidoreductases are involved in biological functions including gene regulation signalling long range electron transfer energy conversion in photosynthesis and respiration atom transport drug detoxification and enzyme catalysis using physical chemical and computational methods the dutton lab studies oxidoreductases and redox proteins to discover mechanisms of electron transfer over large distances through proteins and understand quantum mechanical electron tunneling theory understanding electron tunnelling gives scientists a foundation for investigation of biological redox reactions and their relationship to chemical events

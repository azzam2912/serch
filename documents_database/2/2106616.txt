this protein is an amp lysine hydrolase and phosphoamidase and may contribute to tumor suppression as a member of the histidine triad nucleotide binding hint protein family which is a subfamily of the histidine triad hit family hint2 contains a conserved histidine and hit sequence motif his x his x his x x and the latter two histidines contribute to a catalytic triad the 163 amino acid protein encoded by this gene forms a 17 kda homodimer compared to other members of the hint family hint2 has a 61 sequence homology to hint1 and 28 sequence homology to hint3 when compared with hint1 the 35 amino acid extension at the hint2 n terminal corresponds to a predicted mitochondria import signal hint2 is a member of the hit superfamily and hint subfamily which are characterized as nucleotide hydrolases and transferases that act on the alpha phosphate of ribonucleotides the hint family is the oldest within the hit superfamily and thus its members are highly conserved among eukaryotes and archaebacteria the hint proteins function as amp lysine hydrolases and phosphoramidases in mammals hint2 is expressed in the liver adrenal cortex and pancreas and localizes to the mitochondria within their cells specifically the

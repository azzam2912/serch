the setting is as follows consider a system with formula 1 identical oscillators without the coupling they evolve according to the same differential equation say formula 2 where formula 3 denotes the state of oscillator formula 4 a synchronous state of the system of oscillators is where all the oscillators are in the same state the coupling is defined by a coupling strength formula 5 a matrix formula 6 which describes how the oscillators are coupled together and a function formula 7 of the state of a single oscillator including the coupling leads to the following equation it is assumed that the row sums formula 9 vanish so that the manifold of synchronous states is neutrally stable the master stability function is now defined as the function which maps the complex number formula 10 to the greatest lyapunov exponent of the equation the synchronous state of the system of coupled oscillators is stable if the master stability function is negative at formula 12 where formula 13 ranges over the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix formula 14

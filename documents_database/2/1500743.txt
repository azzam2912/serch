it is one of the pseudo oxocarbon anions as it can be described as a derivative of the croconate oxocarbon anion through the replacement of two oxygen atoms by dicyanomethylene groups c c n its systematic name is 3 5 bis dicyanomethylene 1 2 4 trionate the term croconate violet as a dye name specifically refers to the dipotassium salt the anion was synthesized and characterized by alexander fatiadi in 1978 he obtained the potassium salt by treating dipotassium croconate with malononitrile in water solution at 80 90 c the dipotassium salt crystallizes from water as a dihydrate in deep blue metallic needles the water solutions have an intense violet color and strongly stain the skin the croconate violet anion is the conjugate base of the acid croconic acid violet also obtained by fatiadi in 1978 by treating the potassium salt with hydrochloric acid it is an orange crystalline solid that melts at 260 270 c and dissolves in water to give violet skin staining solutions it strongly acidic p k 0 32 0 02 p k 1 02 0 02 from this acid other alkali metal salts can be prepared the acid cannot be prepared directly from croconic acid

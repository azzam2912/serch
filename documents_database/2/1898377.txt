the acquired data are then postprocessed to obtain perfusion maps with different parameters such as bv blood volume bf blood flow mtt mean transit time and ttp time to peak in cerebral infarction the penumbra has decreased perfusion another mri sequence diffusion weighted mri estimates the amount of tissue that is already necrotic and the combination of those sequences can therefore be used to estimate the amount of brain tissue that is salvageable by thrombolysis and or thrombectomy there are 3 main techniques for perfusion mri it can also be argued that diffusion mri models such as intravoxel incoherent motion also attempt to capture perfusion in dynamic susceptibility contrast mr imaging dsc mri or simply dsc gadolinium contrast agent gd is injected usually intravenously and a time series of fast t2 weighted images is acquired as gadolinium passes through the tissues it induces a reduction of t2 in the nearby water protons the corresponding decrease in signal intensity observed depends on the local gd concentration which may be considered a proxy for perfusion the acquired time series data are then postprocessed to obtain perfusion maps with different parameters such as bv blood volume bf blood flow mtt mean transit time

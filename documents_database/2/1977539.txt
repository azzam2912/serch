they are universal and are found in eubacteria archaea and eukarya including humans transposons have a large influence on gene expression and can be used to determine gene function in fact when a transposon inserts itself in a gene the gene s function will be disrupted because of that property transposons have been manipulated for use in insertional mutagenesis the development of microbial genome sequencing was a major advance for the use of transposon mutagenesis the function affected by a transposon insertion could be linked to the disrupted gene by sequencing the genome to locate the transposon insertion site massively parallel sequencing allows simultaneous sequencing of transposon insertion sites in large mixtures of different mutants therefore genome wide analysis is feasible if transposons are positioned throughout the genome in a mutant collection transposon sequencing requires the creation of a transposon insertion library which will contain a group of mutants that collectively have transposon insertions in all non essential genes the library is grown under the condition that is of interest mutants with transposons inserted in genes required for growth under the test condition will diminish in frequency from the population to identify genes being lost sequences encompassing the transposon ends

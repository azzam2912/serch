this concept had roots in the high medieval period after 1867 croatia and slavonia were within the hungarian half of austria hungary and were eventually united in 1868 as the kingdom of croatia slavonia where the name triune kingdom of croatia slavonia and dalmatia became official however dalmatia being located in the austrian half still remained de facto separate until the end of the austro hungarian empire several croatian political parties and groups sought recognition of the triune kingdom and the incorporation of dalmatia into croatia slavonia the croatian intelligentsia especially lawyers and historians played a key role in interpreting historical sources so as to legitimize the demand for the triune kingdom the unification among the three kingdoms started gaining popularity in the 14th century and was originally used in the title of the ban of croatia slavonia and dalmatia in the medieval croatian kingdom the first usage of the term triune kingdom was in 1527 by the habsburgs to make the title of the croatia dalmatia and slavonia seem grander this can be seen in titles given to krsto frankopan as well as other examples from 1527 the croatian sabor was in 1681 officially named the congregatio croatiae dalmatiae

this is to try raise public awareness they also hold international seminars make videos and hold a design construction competition every year ncree is aiming to improve seismic resistant designs for all constructions and to provide feedback to the engineering community through research and development the center was built for researchers to collaborate and check their theories by doing various experiments their goals are establish and provide research facilities develop and improve the seismic engineering database create and carry out regulations relating to seismic design codes co ordinate and integrate academic institutes and related industries introduce develop and educate on seismic resisting technology ncree s seismic simulation laboratory has international standard facilities such as eighteen sets of static hydraulic actuators and six sets of dynamic hydraulic actuators the tri axial seismic simulator or shaking table can produce earthquake ground motions in six degrees of freedom with motion in 3 axes the shaking table is 5m x 5m and has a mass of 27 tons it can take models of large scale buildings weighing up to 50 tons and the square shape of the table provides large bending and torsional stiffness small scale or full scale models are placed on the

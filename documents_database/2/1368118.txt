they were formulated by leonhard euler about 50 years after isaac newton formulated his laws euler s first law states that the linear momentum of a body also denoted is equal to the product of the mass of the body and the velocity of its center of mass internal forces between the particles that make up a body do not contribute to changing the total momentum of the body as there is an equal and opposite force resulting in no net effect the law is also stated as where is the acceleration of the centre of mass and is the total applied force on the body this is just the time derivative of the previous equation is a constant euler s second law states that the rate of change of angular momentum sometimes denoted about a point that is fixed in an inertial reference frame often the mass center of the body is equal to the sum of the external moments of force torques acting on that body also denoted or about that point note that the above formula holds only if both and are computed with respect to a fixed inertial frame or a frame parallel to the inertial

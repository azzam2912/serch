although these numbers have applications in modern pure mathematics the areas of study that most frequently refer to the superparticular ratios by this name are music theory and the history of mathematics as leonhard euler observed the superparticular numbers including also the multiply superparticular ratios numbers formed by adding an integer other than one to a unit fraction are exactly the rational numbers whose continued fraction terminates after two terms the numbers whose continued fraction terminates in one term are the integers while the remaining numbers with three or more terms in their continued fractions are superpartient the wallis product represents the irrational number in several ways as a product of superparticular ratios and their inverses it is also possible to convert the leibniz formula for into an euler product of superparticular ratios in which each term has a prime number as its numerator and the nearest multiple of four as its denominator in graph theory superparticular numbers or rather their reciprocals 1 2 2 3 3 4 etc arise via the erd s stone theorem as the possible values of the upper density of an infinite graph in the study of harmony many musical intervals can be expressed as

although the royal thai government does not recognize north korean escapees as refugees but rather as illegal economic migrants the thai government allows north koreans illegally entering the country to resettle in south korea this is possible because south korea s domestic law recognizes that north koreans are also citizens of south korea the thai government also cites the conveniently blurred geographical distinctions between the two koreas in facilitating the transfer and resettlement process despite its long distance from north korea to thailand this escaping route has become significantly more popular for north korean defectors between 2004 and 2011 the number of north korean who escaped through thailand in 2004 was 46 the figure increased to 752 in 2005 1 785 in 2007 1 849 in 2009 and 2 482 in 2010 in 2011 95 percent of north koreans arriving in south korea were reportedly sent from thailand however the thai government has stopped providing the official figures for the recent years it is estimated that there are approximately 10 15 defectors from north korea entering thailand every week most north korean refugees use a route that runs from china laos to thailand the old routes which run from mongolia

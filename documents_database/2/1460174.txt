in particular terms appear as components of a formula a first order term is recursively constructed from constant symbols variables and function symbols an expression formed by applying a predicate symbol to an appropriate number of terms is called an atomic formula which evaluates to true or false in bivalent logics given an interpretation for example is a term built from the constant 1 the variable and the binary function symbols and it is part of the atomic formula which evaluates to true for each real numbered value of besides in logic terms play important roles in universal algebra and rewriting systems in the context of polynomials sometimes term is used for a monomial with a coefficient to collect like terms in a polynomial is the operation of making it a linear combination of distinct monomials terms in this sense are things that are added or subtracted a series is often represented as the sum of a sequence of terms individual factors in an expression representing a product are multiplicative terms for example in we have that and are all terms in mathematics terms are expressions that are bounded by plus signs given a set v of variable symbols a

a carrier spacecraft would deploy the lander five days before it flew by venus the atmosphere of venus at the surface has an average temperature of 450 c and is highly acidic and corrosive which severely limits the time a lander can function the visage lander would function autonomously while descending 1 hour and would operate on the surface for additional 3 5 hours and it would transmit its acquired data to the nearby carrier module for relay to earth during its parachute descent the visage lander would analyse atmospheric noble gases and light stable isotopes inventory as well as reactive and trace gases and measure the atmospheric structure profile it would also image the surface starting from an altitude of and acquire panoramic images of the landing site the visage lander would drill on the shallow subsurface and samples would be brought on board to measure the mineralogy and elemental composition the proposed mission goals are the proposed lander payload comprises five instruments the atmospheric structure investigation including doppler wind measurements a neutral mass spectrometer an imaging system an x ray fluorescence experiment and a visible near infrared spectrometer the total surface science data return is expected to be

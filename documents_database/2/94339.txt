this occurs because the thermal energy given to the carrier overcomes the work function of the material the charge carriers can be electrons or ions and in older literature are sometimes referred to as thermions after emission a charge that is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the total charge emitted is initially left behind in the emitting region but if the emitter is connected to a battery the charge left behind is neutralized by charge supplied by the battery as the emitted charge carriers move away from the emitter and finally the emitter will be in the same state as it was before emission the classical example of thermionic emission is that of electrons from a hot cathode into a vacuum also known as thermal electron emission or the edison effect in a vacuum tube the hot cathode can be a metal filament a coated metal filament or a separate structure of metal or carbides or borides of transition metals vacuum emission from metals tends to become significant only for temperatures over the term thermionic emission is now also used to refer to any thermally excited charge emission process even when the charge is emitted from one

reviewers credited the game for its story complex interaction with other in game characters and graphics but criticized it for the difficult control scheme and high system requirements the main character must complete quests and slay wild animals and monsters to earn skill points which are used to increase basic attributes improve skills and learn trades they are spent by finding the appropriate teacher several skills have only one level sneaking acrobatics while the fighting skills one handed weapons two handed weapons bows and crossbows have two proficiency levels if the hero chooses to be a mage or joins the swamp camp he will be able to learn circles of magic of which there are 6 the main attributes are increased in 1 or 5 point increments starting at 10 and capping off at 100 the cap can be surpassed with the use of potions the game places a special focus on the interactivity of the environment for example hunting wild animals can earn the player raw meat this heals damage and can be sold however by using a stove or frying pan the player may also choose to turn this into grilled meat which heals much more effectively similarly

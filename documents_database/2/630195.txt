this definition is not strict in terms of underlying model a short josephson junction is characterized by the josephson phase formula 2 which is only a function of time but not of coordinates i e the josephson junction is assumed to be point like in space in contrast in a long josephson junction the josephson phase can be a function of one or two spatial coordinates i e formula 3 or formula 4 the simplest and the most frequently used model which describes the dynamics of the josephson phase formula 5 in ljj is the so called perturbed sine gordon equation for the case of 1d ljj it looks like formula 6 where subscripts formula 7 and formula 8 denote partial derivatives with respect to formula 7 and formula 8 formula 1 is the josephson penetration depth formula 12 is the josephson plasma frequency formula 13 is the so called characteristic frequency and formula 14 is the bias current density formula 15 normalized to the critical current density formula 16 in the above equation the r h s is considered as perturbation usually for theoretical studies one uses normalized sine gordon equation formula 17 where spatial coordinate is normalized to

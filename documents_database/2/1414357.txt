braiding materials include natural and synthetic yarns metal wires leather tapes and others in a horn gear braider bobbins of thread pass one another to the left and right on pseudo sinusoidal tracks the bobbins are mounted on spool carriers that are driven by a series of horn gears a horn gear is a notched disk driven by a spur gear below on the same shaft bobbins are transferred between notches of adjacent gears these gears lie below the track plate that the bobbin carriers ride on the gears must be driven at multiple points on machines that use two or more bobbin sets and cross shafts on a vertically oriented machine the braided thread is taken up above the machine the height and diameter of a guide ring affects the characteristics of the braided product on horizontal machines the braiding track plate and associated bobbins are rotated 90 degrees and the braided product is produced parallel to the ground this enables large stiff braided cables to be output horizontally which eliminates the need for factory buildings with tall ceilings braiding machines although they have an apparent complex movement of bobbins are mechanically simple and robust modern versions are reliable

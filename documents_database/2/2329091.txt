eight known asteroids 2018 bd a106fgf 2018 la a107j4p 2018 ua and are confirmed to have passed within this distance and poorly observed asteroids zb0a262 zgbe54f a1080dc zw87f01 and zw900be may have also passed within this distance while most asteroids on this list are confirmed well observed unconfirmed objects with a 50 or greater chance of passing within 1 ld of the earth are included as well the number of asteroids listed here are significantly less than those of asteroids that approach earth for several reasons asteroids that approach earth not only move faster but are brighter and are easier to detect with modern surveys because these factors severely limit the amount of moon approaching asteroids to a level many times lower than the asteroids detected passing as close to earth an example list of near earth asteroids that passed more than 1 lunar distance 384 400 km or 0 00256 au from earth in 2018 list of asteroids that are listed on the sentry risk table because they have short observation arcs with poorly constrained orbits and have a chance of impacting earth in 2018 given a short observation arc many different orbits fit the observed data these objects

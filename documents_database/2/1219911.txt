more specifically it can refer to sub poissonian photon statistics that is a photon number distribution for which the variance is less than the mean a coherent state as output by a laser far above threshold has poissonian statistics yielding random photon spacing while a thermal light field has super poissonian statistics and yields bunched photon spacing in the thermal bunched case the number of fluctuations is larger than a coherent state for an antibunched source they are smaller the variance of the photon number distribution is using commutation relations this can be written as this can be written as the second order intensity correlation function for zero delay time is defined as this quantity is basically the probability of detecting two simultaneous photons normalized by the probability of detecting two photons at once for a random photon source here and after we assume stationary counting statistics then we have then we see that sub poisson photon statistics one definition of photon antibunching is given by formula 6 we can equivalently express antibunching by formula 7 where the mandel q parameter is defined as if the field had a classical stochastic process underlying it say a positive definite probability distribution

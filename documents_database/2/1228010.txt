guglielmo marconi developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers between 1895 and 1901 his company the marconi wireless telegraph co started in 1897 dominated the early radio industry during the first two decades of the 20th century the marconi co built the first radiotelegraphy communication stations which were used to communicate with ships at sea and exchange commercial telegram traffic with other countries using morse code many of these have since been preserved as historic places the first radio transmitters could not transmit audio sound like modern am and fm transmitters and instead transmitted information by radiotelegraphy the transmitter was turned on and off rapidly using a switch called a telegraph key creating different length pulses of radio waves dots and dashes which spelled out text messages in morse code marconi used several types of station coastal stations communicated with wireless stations on ships providing navigation and weather information and relayed communications from ships to other coastal stations and through telegraph systems ships were allowed to communicate on three frequencies 500 660 and 1000 khz transoceanic wireless telegraph stations were large high powered stations with huge antenna structures with output power of 100 kw to one megawatt industrial countries

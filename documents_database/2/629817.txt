the patterns occur on low slopes in arid and semi arid regions such as in australia sahelian west africa and north america due to the natural water harvesting capacity many species in tiger bush usually occur only under a higher rainfall regime the alternating pattern arises from the interplay of hydrological ecological and erosional phenomena in the regions where tiger bush is present plant growth is water limited the shortage of rainfall prevents vegetation from covering the entire landscape instead trees and shrubs are able to establish by either tapping soil moisture reserves laterally or by sending roots to deeper wetter soil depths by a combination of plant litter root macropores and increased surface roughness infiltration into the soil around the base of these plants is enhanced surface runoff arriving at these plants will thus likely to become run on and infiltrate into the soil by contrast the areas between these larger plants contain a greater portion of bare ground and herbaceous plants both bare soil with its smoother surface and soil crusts and herbaceous plants with fewer macropores inhibit infiltration this causes much of the rainfall that falls in the inter canopy areas to flow downslope and infiltrate beneath

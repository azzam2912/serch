the microcontroller architecture was designed by a handful of people educated at the norwegian university of science and technology including lead designer yvind str m and cpu architect erik renno in atmel s norwegian design center most instructions are executed in a single cycle the multiply accumulate unit can perform a 32 bit 16 bit 48 bit arithmetic operation in two cycles result latency issued once per cycle it does not resemble the 8 bit avr microcontroller family even though they were both designed at atmel norway in trondheim some of the debug tools are similar support for avr32 has been dropped from linux as of kernel 4 12 atmel has switched mostly to m variants of the arm architecture the avr32 has at least two micro architectures the avr32a and avr32b these differ in the instruction set architecture register configurations and the use of caches for instructions and data the avr32a cpu cores are for inexpensive applications they do not provide dedicated hardware registers for shadowing the register file status and return address in interrupts this saves chip area at the expense of slower interrupt handling the avr32b cpu cores are designed for fast interrupts they have dedicated registers

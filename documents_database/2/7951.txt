it is a crescent shaped trough in the earth s crust averaging about long and wide the maximum known depth is at the southern end of a small slot shaped valley in its floor known as the challenger deep however some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at by comparison if mount everest were placed into the trench at this point its peak would still be over under water at the bottom of the trench the water column above exerts a pressure of more than 1 000 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level at this pressure the density of water is increased by 4 96 so that 95 27 of any unit of volume of water under the pressure of the challenger deep would contain the same mass as 100 of those units at the surface the temperature at the bottom is the trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the center of the earth this is because the earth is an oblate spheroid not a perfect sphere its radius is about smaller at the poles than at the equator as a result parts of the arctic ocean seabed are at least closer to the

appearing in it in euclidean space the integral often converges for re d sufficiently large and can be analytically continued from this region to a meromorphic function defined for all complex d in general there will be a pole at the physical value usually 4 of d which needs to be canceled by renormalization to obtain physical quantities although the method is most well understood when poles are subtracted and d is once again replaced by 4 it has also led to some successes when d is taken to approach another integer value where the theory appears to be strongly coupled as in the case of the wilson fisher fixed point a further leap is to take the interpolation through fractional dimensions seriously this has led some authors to suggest that dimensional regularization can be used to study the physics of crystals that macroscopically appear to be fractals if one wishes to evaluate a loop integral which is logarithmically divergent in four dimensions like one first rewrites the integral in some way so that the number of variables integrated over does not depend on d and then we formally vary the parameter d to include non integral values like d

readings taken of the density of seawater contributed to research into the dynamics of ocean currents the first international maritime conference held at brussels in 1853 aka brussels conference for devising a uniform system of meteorological observations at sea recommended the systematic use of the hydrometer captain john rodgers lieutenant porter and dr william samuel waithman ruschenberger all of the united states navy did this as did dr raymond in the american steamer golden age and captain henry toynbee f r a s f r a g s of the english east indiaman gloriana all of these men returned valuable observations with the hydrometer though captain rodgers afforded the most extended series those navigators who used the hydrometer enlarged the bounds of knowledge and fields of research and led to the discovery of new relations of the sea the object which the brussels organization had in view when the specific gravity column was introduced into the sea journal was that hydrographers might find in it data for computing the dynamical force which the sea derives for its currents from the difference in the specific gravity of its waters in different climes the brussels conference agreed that a given difference as

it is commonly used by manufacturers of blowers and compressors this is the actual gas delivery with reference to inlet conditions whereas cubic foot per minute cfm is an unqualified term and should only be used in general and never accepted as a specific definition without explanation since the volumetric capacity refers to the volume of air or other gas at the inlet to the unit it is often referred to as inlet cubic feet per minute icfm actual cubic feet per minute is the volume of gas and air flowing anywhere in a system independent of its density if the system were moving air at exactly the standard condition then acfm would equal standard cubic feet per minute scfm however this usually is not the case as the most important change between these two definitions is the pressure to move air either a positive pressure or a vacuum must be created when positive pressure is applied to a standard cubic foot of air or other gas it gets smaller when a vacuum is applied to a standard cubic foot of gas it expands the volume of gas after it is pressurized or rarefied is referred to as its actual

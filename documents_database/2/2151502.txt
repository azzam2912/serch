the group is formed by about four well preserved scoria cones between high and wide at the basis subcircular to elliptic with lava fields and one isolated lava field constructed on ordovician marine sediments and dacitic lavas from the adjacent cerro bayo de archibarca 7 2 million years old volcano these cones are aligned submeridionally with a fault system in the ground the lavas and associated dykes have porphyritic appearance and variable morphology the lavas show no evidence of ponding in crustal magma chambers suggesting that the large volatile content of the magma was sufficient to quickly transport it through the crust magma temperatures have been estimated at higher than the cones are constructed by reddish lapilli and lava bombs up to wide with subordinate amounts of ash like material concentrated in the talus deposits that have been formed by erosion at the basis of the cones arenite of sedimentary origin and dacite are found as xenoliths the cones were presumably built by strombolian activity with occasional hawaiian episodes usually less than thick folded lava flows of gray colour are found in the field containing xenoliths and scoriaceous material from the cones in two of the cones were erupted at

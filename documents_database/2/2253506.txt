current studies have determined the location of this gene to be in the nuclear region of the cell fam227a is most highly expressed in the tissues of the fallopian tube testis and pituitary gland fam227a is present in species of mammals birds and reptiles and gene alignment sequences have shown that fam227a is a rapidly evolving gene fam227a is found on chromosome 22 at the location 22q13 1 it is flanked by the gene loc105373031 on the left and cby1 on the right the gene is 78 510 base pairs long with 21 exons there are currently no aliases for fam227a there are two isoforms of fam227a the first isoform nm 001013647 1 has a shorter transcript but a longer isoform it is 2 948 base pairs long and includes the first 17 exons the second isoform nm 001291030 1 is 10 362 base pairs long it starts translation at a different start codon than variant 1 by utilizing an alternate splice site the 5 region is relatively short but the 3 region is very long the primary sequence for fam227a is isoform 1 with accession number np 001013669 1 it is 570 amino acids long there are 9 isoforms

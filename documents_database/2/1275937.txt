although the country has a large potential for hydroelectric and bagasse fueled power generation most of its 226 mw of installed capacity correspond to inefficient thermoelectric diesel engine driven generators reliability or electricity supply is very low linked both to technical and institutional deficiencies in the sector with total losses close to 40 and commercial losses of about 30 this low reliability has led most firms to install their own diesel generators which in turn leads to higher than average electricity costs installed power generation capacity in guyana in 2007 was 226 mw or 0 4 kw per capita which is lower than in other countries in the region and is hardly sufficient to cover the current demand for electricity in the country most electricity generation uses diesel engines to drive generators there are plans for introduction of power generation facilities based on renewable resources but these would still account for only a small share 10 percent of the generation capacity in the country self generation is widely spread in guyana where 100 82 and 37 of large medium and small firms respectively own generators which supply them with 64 54 and 31 respectively of the total electricity consumed a

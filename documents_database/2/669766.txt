it is an eigenvector of the hamiltonian this corresponds to a state with a single definite energy instead of a quantum superposition of different energies it is also called energy eigenvector energy eigenstate energy eigenfunction or energy eigenket it is very similar to the concept of atomic orbital and molecular orbital in chemistry with some slight differences explained below a stationary state is called stationary because the system remains in the same state as time elapses in every observable way for a single particle hamiltonian this means that the particle has a constant probability distribution for its position its velocity its spin etc this is true assuming the particle s environment is also static i e the hamiltonian is unchanging in time the wavefunction itself is not stationary it continually changes its overall complex phase factor so as to form a standing wave the oscillation frequency of the standing wave times planck s constant is the energy of the state according to the planck einstein relation stationary states are quantum states that are solutions to the time independent schr dinger equation where this is an eigenvalue equation formula 3 is a linear operator on a vector space formula 2 is

genetic equilibrium describes a theoretical state that is the basis for determining whether and in what ways populations may deviate from it hardy weinberg equilibrium is one theoretical framework for studying genetic equilibrium it is commonly studied using models that take as their assumptions those of hardy weinberg meaning it can describe other types of equilibrium as well especially in modeling contexts in particular many models use a variation of the hardy weinberg principle as their basis instead of all of the hardy weinberg characters being present these instead assume a balance between the diversifying effects of genetic drift and the homogenizing effects of migration between populations a population not at equilibrium suggests that one of the assumptions of the model in question has been violated the hardy weinberg principle provides the mathematical framework for genetic equilibrium genetic equilibrium itself whether hardy weinberg or otherwise provides the groundwork for a number of applications in including population genetics conservation and evolutionary biology with the rapid increase in whole genome sequences available as well as the proliferation of anonymous markers models have been used to extend the initial theory to all manner of biological contexts using data from genetic markers such as

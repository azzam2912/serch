dually a complete quadrilateral is a system of four lines no three of which pass through the same point and the six points of intersection of these lines the complete quadrangle was called a tetrastigm by and the complete quadrilateral was called a tetragram those terms are occasionally still used the six lines of a complete quadrangle meet in pairs to form three additional points called the diagonal points of the quadrangle similarly among the six points of a complete quadrilateral there are three pairs of points that are not already connected by lines the line segments connecting these pairs are called diagonals due to the discovery of the fano plane a finite geometry in which the diagonal points of a complete quadrangle are collinear some authors have augmented the axioms of projective geometry with fano s axiom that the diagonal points are not collinear while others have been less restrictive as systems of points and lines in which all points belong to the same number of lines and all lines contain the same number of points the complete quadrangle and the complete quadrilateral both form projective configurations in the notation of projective configurations the complete quadrangle is written as

one of the generally agreed noack and breuer and references within requirements for a life sustaining planet is a mobile fractured lithosphere cyclically recycled into a vigorously convecting mantle in a process commonly known as plate tectonics plate tectonics provide a means of geochemical regulation of atmospheric particulates as well as removal of carbon from the atmosphere this prevents a runaway greenhouse effect that can result in inhospitable surface temperatures and vaporization of liquid surface water planetary scientists have not reached a consensus on whether earth like exoplanets have plate tectonics but it is widely thought that the likelihood of plate tectonics on an earth like exoplanet is a function of planetary radius initial temperature upon coalescence insolation and presence or absence of liquid phase surface water in order to characterize the geodynamic regime of an earth like exoplanet the basic assumption is made that such a planet is earth like or rocky this implies a three layer stratigraphy of from center to surface a partially molten iron core a silicate mantle that convects over geologic timescales and a relatively cold brittle silicate lithosphere within these parameters the geodynamic regime at a given time point in the planet s history

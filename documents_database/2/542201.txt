the sqnr reflects the relationship between the maximum nominal signal strength and the quantization error also known as quantization noise introduced in the analog to digital conversion the sqnr formula is derived from the general snr signal to noise ratio formula for the binary pulse code modulated communication channel where as sqnr applies to quantized signals the formulae for sqnr refer to discrete time digital signals instead of formula 5 the digitized signal formula 6 will be used for formula 7 quantization steps each sample formula 8 requires formula 9 bits the probability distribution function pdf representing the distribution of values in formula 8 and can be denoted as formula 11 the maximum magnitude value of any formula 8 is denoted by formula 13 as sqnr like snr is a ratio of signal power to some noise power it can be calculated as the signal power is the quantization noise power can be expressed as giving when the sqnr is desired in terms of decibels db a useful approximation to sqnr is where formula 19 is the number of bits in a quantized sample and formula 20 is the signal power calculated above note that for each bit added to

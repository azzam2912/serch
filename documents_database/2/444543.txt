they are named thymosins because they were originally isolated from the thymus but most are now known to be present in many other tissues thymosins have diverse biological activities and two in particular thymosins and have potentially important uses in medicine some of which have already progressed from the laboratory to the clinic in relation to diseases thymosins have been categorized as biological response modifiers the discovery of thymosins in the mid 1960s emerged from investigations of the role of the thymus in development of the vertebrate immune system begun by allan l goldstein in the laboratory of abraham white at the albert einstein college of medicine in new york the work continued at university of texas medical branch in galveston and at the george washington university school of medicine and health sciences in washington d c the supposition that the role of the thymus might involve a hormone like mechanism led to the isolation from thymus tissue of a biologically active preparation known as thymosin fraction 5 this was able to restore some aspects of immune function in animals lacking thymus gland fraction 5 was found to contain over 40 small peptides molecular weights ranging from 1000 to 15

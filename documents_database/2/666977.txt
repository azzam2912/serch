these blocks convert data between serial data and parallel interfaces in each direction the term serdes generically refers to interfaces used in various technologies and applications the primary use of a serdes is to provide data transmission over a single line or a differential pair in order to minimize the number of i o pins and interconnects the basic serdes function is made up of two functional blocks the parallel in serial out piso block aka parallel to serial converter and the serial in parallel out sipo block aka serial to parallel converter there are 4 different serdes architectures 1 parallel clock serdes 2 embedded clock serdes 3 8b 10b serdes 4 bit interleaved serdes the piso parallel input serial output block typically has a parallel clock input a set of data input lines and input data latches it may use an internal or external phase locked loop pll to multiply the incoming parallel clock up to the serial frequency the simplest form of the piso has a single shift register that receives the parallel data once per parallel clock and shifts it out at the higher serial clock rate implementations may also make use of a double buffered register

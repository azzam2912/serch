the term pp stands for plane fronted waves with parallel propagation and was introduced in 1962 by j rgen ehlers and wolfgang kundt the pp waves solutions model radiation moving at the speed of light this radiation may consist of or any combination of these so long as the radiation is all moving in the same direction a special type of pp wave spacetime the plane wave spacetimes provide the most general analogue in general relativity of the plane waves familiar to students of electromagnetism in particular in general relativity we must take into account the gravitational effects of the energy density of the electromagnetic field itself when we do this purely electromagnetic plane waves provide the direct generalization of ordinary plane wave solutions in maxwell s theory furthermore in general relativity disturbances in the gravitational field itself can propagate at the speed of light as wrinkles in the curvature of spacetime such gravitational radiation is the gravitational field analogue of electromagnetic radiation in general relativity the gravitational analogue of electromagnetic plane waves are precisely the vacuum solutions among the plane wave spacetimes they are called gravitational plane waves there are physically important examples of pp wave spacetimes which are

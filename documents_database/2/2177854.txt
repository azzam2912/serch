the approach was further significantly developed by madigan raftery 1994 and george mcculloch 1997 the final adjustments to the model were done by ishwaran rao 2005 suppose we have p possible predictors in some model vector has a length equal to p and consists of zeros and ones this vector indicates whether a particular variable is included in the regression or not if no specific prior information on initial inclusion probabilities of particular variables is available a bernoulli prior distribution is a common default choice conditional on a predictor being in the regression we identify a prior distribution for the model coefficient which corresponds to that variable a common choice on that step is to use a normal prior with mean equal to zero and a large variance calculated based on formula 1 where formula 2 is a design matrix of explanatory variables of the model a draw of from its prior distribution is a list of the variables included in the regression conditional on this set of selected variables we take a draw from the prior distribution of the regression coefficients if 1 then 0 and if 0 then 0 denotes the subset of for which 1 in the

biologically fructosamines are recognized by fructosamine 3 kinase which may trigger the degradation of advanced glycation end products though the true clinical significance of this pathway is unclear fructosamine can also refer to the specific compound 1 amino 1 deoxy d fructose isoglucosamine first synthesized by nobel laureate hermann emil fischer in 1886 most commonly fructosamine refers to a laboratory test for diabetes management that is rarely used in clinical practice simple blood glucose monitoring or hemoglobin a1c testing are preferred many direct to consumer lab testing companies sell fructosamine tests in diabetes maintaining a normal blood glucose is essential to preventing many medical complications including heart attacks diabetic nephropathy diabetic neuropathy and also diabetic retinopathy eventually leading to blindness most commonly blood sugars are measured by either blood glucose monitoring which measures the current blood glucose level or by glycated hemoglobin hba1c which measures average glucose levels over approximately 3 months in a similar way to hemoglobin a1c testing which measures the glycation of hemoglobin fructosamine testing determines the fraction of total serum proteins that have undergone glycation the glycated serum proteins since albumin is the most abundant protein in blood fructosamine levels typically reflect albumin glycation some fructosamine

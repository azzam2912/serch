the serotype is determined by the antibody recognition of the 2 domain of the hla a chain for a 02 the chain is encoded by the hla a 02 gene and the chain is encoded by the b2m locus in 2010 the world health organization naming committee for factors of the hla system revised the nomenclature for hlas before this revision hla a 02 was also referred to as hla a2 hla a02 and hla a 2 hla a 02 is one particular class i major histocompatibility complex mhc allele group at the hla a locus the a 02 allele group can code for many proteins as of december 2013 there are 456 different hla a 02 proteins serotyping can identify as far as hla a 02 which is typically enough to prevent transplant rejection the original motivation for hla identification genes can further be separated by genetic sequencing and analysis hlas can be identified with as many as nine numbers and a letter ex hla a 02 101 01 02n hla a 02 is globally common but particular variants of the allele can be separated by geographic prominence the serotyping for the most abundant a 02 alleles is good

urelements are sometimes called atoms or individuals there are several different but essentially equivalent ways to treat urelements in a first order theory one way is to work in a first order theory with two sorts sets and urelements with a b only defined when b is a set in this case if u is an urelement it makes no sense to say although is perfectly legitimate another way is to work in a one sorted theory with a unary relation used to distinguish sets and urelements as non empty sets contain members while urelements do not the unary relation is only needed to distinguish the empty set from urelements note that in this case the axiom of extensionality must be formulated to apply only to objects that are not urelements this situation is analogous to the treatments of theories of sets and classes indeed urelements are in some sense dual to proper classes urelements cannot have members whereas proper classes cannot be members put differently urelements are minimal objects while proper classes are maximal objects by the membership relation which of course is not an order relation so this analogy is not to be taken literally the zermelo set

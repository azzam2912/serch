fires were set against a rock face to heat the stone which was then doused with liquid causing the stone to fracture by thermal shock some experiments have suggested that the water or any other liquid did not have a noticeable effect on the rock but rather helped the miners progress by quickly cooling down the area after the fire this technique was best performed in opencast mines where the smoke and fumes could dissipate safely the technique was very dangerous in underground workings without adequate ventilation the method became largely redundant with the growth in use of explosives although fire setting was frequently used before modern times it has been used sporadically since then in some regions of the world notably africa and eurasia fire setting continued to be in use until the 19th and 20th centuries it was used where rock was too hard to drill holes with steel borers for blasting or whenever it was economic because of cheapness of wood the oldest traces of this method in europe were found in southern france d partement of h rault and date back to copper age numerous finds exist from bronze age such as in the alps in

similar to his predecessor successor or co ruler seth peribsen sekhemib is contemporarily well attested in archaeological records but he does not appear in any posthumous document the exact length of his reign is unknown and his burial site has yet to be found sekhemib s name is known from seal impressions and from inscriptions on vessels made of alabaster and breccia they were found in the entrance of peribsen s tomb at abydos in the underground galleries beneath the step pyramid of 3rd dynasty king djoser at sakkara and on one excavation site at elephantine sekhemib s serekh name is unusual because it is the first in egyptian history that was extended by an epithet beside the first name sekhem ib several seal impressions and stone vessel inscriptions show the epithet perenma at inside the serekh sekhemib used both name forms the single horus name and the double name at the same time egyptologists such as herman te velde and wolfgang helck think that the double name of sekhemib came in use when the egyptian state was split into two independent realms it seems that sekhemib tried to stress the peaceful political situation prevailing in egypt at the time

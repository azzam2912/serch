applications for the device which is pending fda review and approval are expected to include medical diagnosis and support in determining interventional treatments such as surgery or biopsy providing both full color images and a wide field real time surgical view into the inner depths of arteries enables physicians to circumnavigate hard to reach internal tissues to assess for potential disease the sfe technology was developed at the university of washington for the purpose of providing high quality laser based imaging within an ultrathin and flexible endoscope it is believed that the concept of moving an optical fiber to produce 2d images with confocal sectioning and laser illumination was first proposed for endoscopic applications by giniunas et al in 1993 a major advancement of the sfe is rapid scanning and generation of high quality images using an amplitude modulated resonating fiber using a single mode fiber that vibrates in resonance the sfe scans over tissue highlighted by a focused laser spot a detector records the time multiplexed backscatter signal to access hard to reach arterial areas the sfe fiber and tube are extremely small the piezoelectric tube is 400 micron in diameter and this houses the single mode optical fiber

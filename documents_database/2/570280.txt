they were constructed with bipolar devices in a bit slice topology and were designed to be used as modular components each representing a different aspect of a computer control unit ccu by using the bit slicing technique am2900 family was able to implement a ccu with data addresses and instructions to be any multiple of 4 bits by multiplying the number of ics one major problem with this modular technique was that it required a larger number of ics to implement what could be done on a single cpu ic the am2901 chip was the arithmetic logic unit alu and the core of the series it could count using 4 bits and implement binary operations as well as various bit shifting operations the 2901 and some other chips in the family were second sourced by an unusually large number of other manufacturers starting with motorola and then raytheon both in 1975 and also cypress semiconductor national semiconductor nec thomson and signetics in the soviet union and later russia the am2900 family was manufactured as the 1804 series with e g the am2901 designated as kr1804vs1 which was still in production as of 2016 there are probably many more but here

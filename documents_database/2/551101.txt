nitromethane is a highly combustible substance that is generally only used in very specifically designed engines found in top fuel drag racing and miniature internal combustion engines in radio control control line and free flight model aircraft the term nitro has come into use in the last few decades to describe these engines and has its origins in marketing hype in the model car market for the fifty or so years prior to this term since the engines were first developed they were simply referred to as glow engines but the term nitro has more impact in ad copy these engines are actually fueled by methanol but the fuel is often doped with nitromethane as a performance additive the ignition system consists of a glow plug hence the older term glow engine which has a coil of platinum containing wire alloy usually platinum iridium the glow plug is heated with electric current for starting after which power is disconnected and the combination of residual heat and catalytic action of the platinum alloy with methanol ignites the fuel mixture nitro engines for models can turn in excess of 50 000 rpm typical operating rpm for sport model aircraft engines is 10

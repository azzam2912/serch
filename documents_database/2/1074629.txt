a common variety is the 18 24 mm format on regular 135 film it is the normal exposure format on 35mm movie cameras for still cameras using the 35mm film the usual format is 24 36 mm so still cameras taking 18 24 mm exposures are called half frame cameras there was a vogue of half frame cameras in the 1960s mainly from japan originating with the olympus pen models it allowed for a very compact camera using commonly available film unlike other subminiatures that used exotic films 16mm 9 3mm etc this vogue ended when cameras like the rollei 35 or the olympus xa showed that it was possible to make cameras as small as the half frame ones but taking 24 36 mm exposures with a half frame camera one can fit twice as many pictures onto a standard roll of film for example 72 exposures on a 36 exposure roll 48 on a 24 exposure one and so on the exposures have a vertical portrait orientation as opposed to the horizontal landscape orientation of a 35mm slr or rangefinder with the exception of cameras whose film mechanisms run vertically examples include the konica recorder and belomo agat

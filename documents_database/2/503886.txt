capb is available as a viscous pale yellow solution and it is used as a surfactant in personal care products the name reflects that the major part of the molecule the lauric acid group is derived from coconut oil cocamidopropyl betaine to a significant degree has replaced cocamide dea despite the name cocamidopropyl betaine is not synthesized from betaine instead it is produced in a two step manner beginning with the reaction of dimethylaminopropylamine dmapa with fatty acids from coconut or palm kernel oil lauric acid or its methyl ester is the main constituent the primary amine in dmapa is more reactive than the tertiary amine leading to its selective addition to form an amide in the second step chloroacetic acid reacts with the remaining tertiary amine to form a quaternary ammonium center a quaternization reaction capb is a fatty acid amide containing a long hydrocarbon chain at one end and a polar group at the other this allows capb to act as a surfactant and as a detergent it is a zwitterion consisting of both a quaternary ammonium cation and a carboxylate cocamidopropyl betaine is used as a foam booster in shampoos it is a medium strength surfactant also

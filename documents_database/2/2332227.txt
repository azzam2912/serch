the mission will study exotic astronomical objects and permit mapping the magnetic fields of black holes neutron stars pulsars supernova remnants magnetars quasars and active galactic nuclei the high energy x ray radiation from these objects surrounding environment can be polarized vibrating in a particular direction studying the polarization of x rays reveals the physics of these objects and can provide insights into the high temperature environments where they are created the ixpe mission was announced on january 3 2017 it is being developed by nasa s small explorer program smex and is slated for launch in april 2021 the estimated cost of the mission and its two year operation is 188 million the launch cost is 50 3 million the goal of the ixpe mission is to expand understanding of high energy astrophysical processes and sources in support of nasa s first science objective in astrophysics discover how the universe works by obtaining x ray polarimetry and polarimetric imaging of cosmic sources ixpe addresses two specific science objectives to determine the radiation processes and detailed properties of specific cosmic x ray sources or categories of sources and to explore general relativistic and quantum effects in extreme environments during ixpe

it was developed by phelim boyle in 1986 it is an extension of the binomial options pricing model and is conceptually similar it can also be shown that the approach is equivalent to the explicit finite difference method for option pricing for fixed income and interest rate derivatives see lattice model finance interest rate derivatives under the trinomial method the underlying stock price is modeled as a recombining tree where at each node the price has three possible paths an up down and stable or middle path these values are found by multiplying the value at the current node by the appropriate factor formula 1 formula 2 or formula 3 where and the corresponding probabilities are in the above formulae formula 10 is the length of time per step in the tree and is simply time to maturity divided by the number of time steps formula 11 is the risk free interest rate over this maturity formula 12 is the corresponding volatility of the underlying formula 13 is its corresponding dividend yield as with the binomial model these factors and probabilities are specified so as to ensure that the price of the underlying evolves as a martingale while the moments

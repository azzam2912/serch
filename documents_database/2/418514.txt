the record is as of february 2011 it involves three or four wheeled electric vehicles somewhat similar in overall appearance to a go kart with an aerodynamic body but powered by an electric motor and batteries electrathon class vehicles are principally defined and constrained by length and width 12 feet long and 4 feet wide or 3 6 m 1 2 m maximum and by battery weight and chemistry sealed lead acid discharged for one hour this amounts to just under one kilowatt 1 3 hp driver s weight is ballasted to for fairness and the vehicles themselves may weigh from safety regulations require features such as braking systems roll bars and electrical disconnects electrathon racing started in england spread to australia and arrived in the united states in 1990 the basic format is to determine which car can travel the furthest in one hour within the limitations of battery weight and other factors mentioned above design teams must compromise speed in order to gain distance success requires efficiency of both the machine and driving technique the relatively low cost of the electrathon racing has made the sport a popular activity for high school age students worldwide who learn skills

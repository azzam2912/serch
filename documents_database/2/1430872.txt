two research groups have produced several models of the cell cycle simulating several organisms they have recently produced a generic eukaryotic cell cycle model which can represent a particular eukaryote depending on the values of the parameters demonstrating that the idiosyncrasies of the individual cell cycles are due to different protein concentrations and affinities while the underlying mechanisms are conserved csikasz nagy et al 2006 by means of a system of ordinary differential equations these models show the change in time dynamical system of the protein inside a single typical cell this type of model is called a deterministic process whereas a model describing a statistical distribution of protein concentrations in a population of cells is called a stochastic process to obtain these equations an iterative series of steps must be done first the several models and observations are combined to form a consensus diagram and the appropriate kinetic laws are chosen to write the differential equations such as rate kinetics for stoichiometric reactions michaelis menten kinetics for enzyme substrate reactions and goldbeter koshland kinetics for ultrasensitive transcription factors afterwards the parameters of the equations rate constants enzyme efficiency coefficients and michaelis constants must be fitted to match observations when

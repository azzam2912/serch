in signal and control circuits that can operate with low currents and voltages the intrinsic safety approach simplifies circuits and reduces installation cost over other protection methods areas with dangerous concentrations of flammable gases or dust are found in applications such as petrochemical refineries and mines as a discipline it is an application of inherent safety in instrumentation high power circuits such as electric motors or lighting cannot use intrinsic safety methods for protection in normal use electrical equipment often creates tiny electric arcs internal sparks in switches motor brushes connectors and in other places compact electrical equipment generates heat as well which under some circumstances can become an ignition source there are multiple ways to make equipment safe for use in explosive hazardous areas intrinsic safety denoted by i in the atex and iecex explosion classifications is one of several available methods for electrical equipment others include explosion proof nec 500 or flameproof enclosures d in iec atex and nec 505 increased safety e encapsulation m enclosed break device nc sealed device nc hermetically sealed device nc restricted breathing enclosure nr oil immersion o protection of optical radiation op venting p powder or sand filling q special protection s

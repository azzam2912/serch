sensorml provides standard models and an xml encoding for describing sensors and measurement processes sensorml can be used to describe a wide range of sensors including both dynamic and stationary platforms and both in situ and remote sensors functions supported include examples of supported sensors are sensorml provides standard models and an xml encoding for describing any process including the process of measurement by sensors and instructions for deriving higher level information from observations it provides a provider centric view of information in a sensor web which is complemented by observations and measurements which provides a user centric view processes described in sensorml are discoverable and executable all processes define their inputs outputs parameters and method as well as provide relevant metadata sensorml models detectors and sensors as processes that convert real phenomena to data sensorml does not encode measurements taken by sensors measurements can be represented in transducerml as observations in observations and measurements or in other forms such as ieee 1451 electronic specification sheet in its simplest application sensorml can be used to provide a standard digital means of providing specification sheets for sensor components and systems discovery of sensor sensor systems and processes sensorml is a means

it is a script only based modeller that uses its own description language parts can be previewed but it cannot be interactively selected or modified by mouse in the 3d view an openscad script specifies geometric primitives such as spheres boxes cylinders etc and defines how they are modified and combined for instance by intersection difference envelope combination and minkowski sums to render a 3d model as such the program does constructive solid geometry csg openscad is available for windows linux and os x for fast previewing of models using z buffering openscad employs opencsg and opengl the 3d model position can be interactively manipulated in the view with a mouse similarly to other 3d modellers it is also possible to define a default camera position in the script part colors can be defined in the 3d view including transparency preview is relatively fast and allows interactive modifications while modifying the script the model renderer takes into account lighting but the lighting source is not modifiable openscad allows a designer to create accurate 3d models and parametric designs that can be easily adjusted by changing the parameters openscad documents are human readable scripts in plain ascii text as such openscad

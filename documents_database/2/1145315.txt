this action inactivates lpss that are sensed by md 2 toll like receptor 4 tlr 4 on animal cells and probably also by the cytosolic caspase based sensors the enzyme s 2 disulfide linked subunits are encoded by a single mrna the smaller subunit is a member of the saposin like saplip protein family and the larger subunit which contains the active site serine is a gdsl lipase aoah is produced by neutrophils macrophages including kupffer cells and microglia dendritic cells nk cells and renal proximal tubule cells absence of the enzyme in genetically engineered mice has been associated with distinctive phenotypes aoah deficient animals are unable to inactivate even small amounts of lps in most tissues it remains bioactive and may pass from cell to cell in vivo for many weeks the lps exposed mice develop strikingly high titers of polyclonal antibodies prolonged hepatomegaly and innate immune tolerance that gives them slow and inadequate responses to bacterial challenge in contrast absence of the enzyme renders mice more likely to develop severe lung injury and die if they are challenged with intratracheal lps or gram negative bacteria aoah has been highly conserved through evolution the amino acid sequence of the

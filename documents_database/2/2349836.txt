it plays very important roles in plant development especially in the control of cell elongation and for the tolerance of environmental stresses bri1 enhances cell elongation promotes pollen development controls vasculature development and promotes chilling and freezing tolerance bri1 is one of the most well studied hormone receptors and it acts a model for the study of membrane bound receptors in plants bri1 is an integral membrane protein on the extracellular side of the membrane lies a series of 25 leucine rich repeats lrrs the lrr domain forms a horseshoe shape an atypical lrr within this domain acts as the brassinosteroid binding site next to the lrr domain there is a single pass transmembrane section the intracelluar domain of bri1 functions as a kinase and it is this domain triggers the phosphorylation cascade that results in changes of gene expression in the absence of brassinosteroid bri1 is held in an inactive state by another protein bri1 kinase inhibitor 1 bki1 when brassinosteroid binds to bri1 it reduces the stability of the bri1 bki1 complex and promotes the binding of bri1 to another membrane protein bri1 associated receptor kinase 1 bak1 in the bri1 bak1 complex both bri1 and bak1 make

the carbene radical can be formed by one electron reduction of fischer type carbenes using an external reducing agent or directly upon carbene formation at an open shell transition metal complex in particular low spin cobalt ii complexes using diazo compounds and related carbene precursors cobalt iii carbene radicals have found catalytic applications in cyclopropanation reactions as well as in a variety of other catalytic radical type ring closing reactions theoretical calculations and epr studies confirmed their radical type behaviour and explained the bonding interactions underlying the stability of the carbene radical stable carbene radicals of other metals are known but the catalytically relevant cobalt iii carbene radicals have thus far only been synthesized as long lived reactive intermediates the chemical bond present in carbene radicals is surprising in that it possesses aspects of both fischer and schrock type carbenes as a result the cobalt carbene radical complexes have discrete radical character at their carbon atom thus giving rise to interesting catalytic radical type reaction pathways the mechanism of formation of a carbene radical at cobalt ii typically involves carbene generation at the metal with simultaneous intramolecular electron transfer from the metal into the metal carbene anti bonding molecular orbital

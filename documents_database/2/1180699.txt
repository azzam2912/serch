regulations do not exist for this size class of ambient air pollution particles which are far smaller than the regulated pm and pm particle classes and are believed to have several more aggressive health implications than those classes of larger particulates in the eu ufp s in ambient air are empirically defined by a technical specification the important detail is the definition of size stated the lower and upper sizes considered within this document are 7 nm and a few micrometres respectively although the most common referral to ufp is less than 0 1 m this is incorrect for ambient air in the eu there are two main divisions that categorize types of ufps ufps can either be carbon based or metallic and then can be further subdivided by their magnetic properties electron microscopy and special physical lab conditions allow scientists to observe ufp morphology airborne ufps can be measured using a condensation particle counter in which particles are mixed with alcohol vapor and then cooled allowing the vapor to condense around them after which they are counted using a light scanner ufps are both manufactured and naturally occurring ufps are the main constituent of airborne particulate matter owing to

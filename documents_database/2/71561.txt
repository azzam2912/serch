for centuries froissart s chronicles have been recognised as the chief expression of the chivalric revival of the 14th century kingdoms of england france and scotland his history is also an important source for the first half of the hundred years war what little is known of froissart s life comes mainly from his historical writings and from archival sources which mention him in the service of aristocrats or receiving gifts from them although his poems have also been used in the past to reconstruct aspects of his biography this approach is in fact flawed as the i persona which appears in many of the poems should not be construed as a reliable reference to the historical author this is why de looze has characterised these works as pseudo autobiographical froissart came from valenciennes in the county of hainaut situated in the western tip of the holy roman empire bordering france earlier scholars have suggested that his father was a painter of armorial bearings but there is actually little evidence for this other suggestions include that he began working as a merchant but soon gave that up to become a cleric for this conclusion there is also no real evidence

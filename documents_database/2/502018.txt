in the late 1990s underwriters laboratories changed their definition of a single station co detector with a sound device in it to a carbon monoxide co alarm this applies to all co safety alarms that meet ul 2034 standard however for passive indicators and system devices that meet ul 2075 ul refers to these as carbon monoxide detectors co is a colorless tasteless and odorless compound produced by incomplete combustion of carbon containing materials it is often referred to as the silent killer because it is virtually undetectable by humans without using detection technology and in a study by underwriters laboratories sixty percent of americans could not identify any potential signs of a co leak in the home elevated levels of co can be dangerous to humans depending on the amount present and length of exposure smaller concentrations can be harmful over longer periods of time while increasing concentrations require diminishing exposure times to be harmful co detectors are designed to measure co levels over time and sound an alarm before dangerous levels of co accumulate in an environment giving people adequate warning to safely ventilate the area or evacuate some system connected detectors also alert a monitoring service that

their distinguishing feature is cnidocytes specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey their bodies consist of mesoglea a non living jelly like substance sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick they have two basic body forms swimming medusae and sessile polyps both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa like or polyp like zooids or both hence they are trimorphic cnidarians activities are coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptors several free swimming species of cubozoa and scyphozoa possess balance sensing statocysts and some have simple eyes not all cnidarians reproduce sexually with many species having complex life cycles of asexual polyp stages and sexual medusae some however omit either the polyp or the medusa stage cnidarians were formerly grouped with ctenophores in the phylum coelenterata but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla cnidarians are classified into four main groups the almost wholly sessile anthozoa sea anemones corals sea pens

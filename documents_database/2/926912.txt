it is a complex concept incorporating not just the distance between opponents but also the time it will take to cross the distance angle and rhythm of attack it is specifically the exact position from which one opponent can strike the other after factoring in the above elements for example a faster opponent s maai is farther away than a slower opponent it is ideal for one opponent to maintain maai while preventing the other from doing so meaning that they can strike before the opponent can rather than both striking simultaneously or being struck without being able to strike back in kendo maai has a more specific interpretation in physical terms pertains to the distance maintained between two opponents when maai is interpreted as the actual distance between opponents there are three types itto ma is the distance equaling one step to make one strike it measures about two metres between opponents from which either need advance only one step in order to strike the other normally most techniques are initiated at this distance chika ma is the distance narrower than itto ma short close distance and to ma is greater long far distance at to ma there is

the term bond out derives from connecting or bonding the emulation circuitry to these external pins these devices are designed to be used within an in circuit emulator and are not typically used in any other kind of system bond out pins were marked as no connects in the first devices produced by intel and were usually not connected to anything on the ordinary production silicon later bond out versions of the microprocessor were produced in a bigger package to provide more signals and functionality bond out processors provides capabilities far beyond those of a simple rom monitor a rom monitor is a firmware program that runs instead of the application code and provides a connection to a host computer to carry out debugging functions in general the rom monitor uses part of the processor resources and shares the memory with the user code bond out processors can handle complex breakpoints even in rom real time traces of processor activity and no use of target resources but this extra functionality comes at a high cost as bond outs have to be produced for in circuit emulators only therefore sometimes solutions similar to bond outs are implemented with an asic or

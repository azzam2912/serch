this protein is located in the cell nucleus and must dimerize with another bhlh protein in order to bind dna n myc is highly expressed in the fetal brain and is critical for normal brain development the mycn gene has an antisense rna n cym or mycnos transcribed from the opposite strand which can be translated to form a protein product n myc and mycnos are co regulated both in normal development and in tumor cells so it is possible that the two transcripts are functionally related it has been shown that the antisense rna encodes for a protein named ncym that has originated de novo and is specific to human and chimpanzee this ncym protein inhibits gsk3b and thus prevents mycn degradation transgenic mice that harbor human mycn ncym pair often show neuroblastomas with distant metastasis which are atypical for normal mice thus ncym represents a rare example of a de novo gene that has acquired molecular function and plays a major role in oncogenesis amplification and overexpression of n myc can lead to tumorigenesis excess n myc is associated with a variety of tumors most notably neuroblastomas where patients with amplification of the n myc gene tend to

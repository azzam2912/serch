its main purpose is to control ata pi devices connected to an ide64 cartridge and present them like normal commodore drives additionally it supports networked drives pclink and has a built in machine code monitor and file manager the c64 kernal uses a vector table at page 3 to allow redirection of common kernal file handling and basic functions this feature is used by idedos to hook into the c64 kernal the operating system itself is divided into four pages of 16 kib which are mapped in when required the mapping is temporarily switched off while interrupts are running for increased compatibility however this causes a 40 s latency additional ram for buffers and internal data are also mapped in from either the ide64 cartridge 28 kib or the additional ram of the supercpu is used the standard kernal memory locations at page zero and page two are handled in a kernal compatible way temporarily used memory is restored after the routines are finished beyond the kernal table idedos has two new calls for bulk data handling read write which allows much faster data transfer rates than the character based i o the native file system is non cbm style

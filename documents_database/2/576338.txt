it is considered to be a law of classical logic it is the principle that the conjuncts of a logical conjunction may switch places with each other while preserving the truth value of the resulting proposition commutativity of conjunction can be expressed in sequent notation as and where formula 3 is a metalogical symbol meaning that formula 4 is a syntactic consequence of formula 5 in the one case and formula 5 is a syntactic consequence of formula 4 in the other in some logical system or in rule form and where the rule is that wherever an instance of formula 5 appears on a line of a proof it can be replaced with formula 4 and wherever an instance of formula 4 appears on a line of a proof it can be replaced with formula 5 or as the statement of a truth functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic and where formula 16 and formula 17 are propositions expressed in some formal system for any propositions h h h and permutation n of the numbers 1 through n it is the case that is equivalent to for example if h is h is and h is then it

the locomotive is part of a project funded by the rail safety and standards board rssb to test the viability of combining hydrostatic transmission with a form of regenerative braking that can reduce engine emissions hydrostatic transmissions have been used previously for rail vehicles but only for slow speed track maintenance vehicles and similar not for mainline locomotives diesel hydraulic locomotives instead use a hydrodynamic i e torque converter transmission in 2017 the rssb announced that it planned to fund the development of an experimental rail vehicle in conjunction with artemis intelligent power a developmental company specialising in hydraulic machines the intention of the project was to develop a rail vehicle that could store braking energy which could then be released during acceleration it would be powered by diesel engines as the prime mover driving hydraulic pumps and then hydraulic motors mounted on the axles these motors could also act as pumps storing braking energy in hydraulic accumulators this type of system is being offered as a potential solution for use in areas that are not economical to electrify the rssb and artemis entered into a collaboration with chiltern railways to obtain a suitable vehicle with one of chiltern s

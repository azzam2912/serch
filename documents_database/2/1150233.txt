they contain many feather mites the alloptidae and trouessartiidae were in earlier times included here as subfamilies proctophyllodidae females are extremely similar among species and sometimes even hard to assign to a genus while males vary much more two subfamilies are generally recognized the proctophyllodinae and the pterodectinae the main difference is that the female pregenital apodeme and epimerites iv are separated while in the latter they are connected and form a distinct structure feather mites subclass acarina family proctophyllodinae are ectoparasites that live in between the barbs of feathers and are found on nearly every bird species currently described it was previously believed that these mites had a parasitic relationship with their hosts but it is now thought that most species are more commensal with their hosts morphological studies have provided strong evidence for this with feather mite mouthparts being identified as unstructured for biting on solid material instead it is suggested that they feed on oils and fats secreted from the uropygial gland as well as pollen fungus and dead epidermis tissue that is trapped within it feather mites are streamlined strongly dorsoventrally flattened with short legs and well developed ambulacra that act as a hold fast organ

he remained at oxford for his phd which involved the design of a mass spectrometer under the supervision of john wilfrid linnett in 1961 he returned to manchester to work at the scientific instruments division of associated electrical industries in 1973 he took up a lectureship position at umist and was promoted to professor in 1985 he remained at manchester until his death the michael barber centre for collaborative mass spectrometry based at manchester university is named in honour of him fast atom bombardment fab is a method of ionization used in mass spectrometry that uses a beam of high energy atoms strikes a surface to create ions an energetic beam of atoms or ions will destroy an organic molecule under conditions typically used to create secondary ions barber realised that mixing the compound of interest with a vacuum compatible low volatility liquid such as glycerol effectively protected the organic molecule and allowed it to be ionized and detected the protecting liquid matrix allowed compounds as large as 10 000 da molecular mass to be detected the concept of a protecting matrix was later used in matrix assisted laser desorption ionization the fab technique was employed by barber howard morris

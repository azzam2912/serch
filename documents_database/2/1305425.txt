the procedure is typically conducted in a surgical setting cheesewiring or the cheesewire effect can also describe the process of suture material cutting or tearing through viscera at the time of suture anastomosis and tension cheesewiring can be a complication or part of a negative outcome of a procedure examples include tumor growth penetrating the openings in a bowel stent that was placed to open an obstructed bowel sutures used to hold a transplanted cornea in place and treatment of tendon rupture when sutures pull through the tendon evidence that the cheesewire effect has occurred is most clearly seen after surgery has been completed postoperatively as wound margins begin to swell a suture can drag through the thin portion of tissue present near the surface this suture drag is most often the result of tension being reduced in tying or placing the suture it is apparent that cheesewiring has occurred if the suture has moved a little closer to the insertion site a tell tale y shaped scar is evidence that cheesewiring has taken place cheesewiring that causes drag can lead to damage to tissue and make a surgeon tug on the material leading to suture pullout this causes an

the experiment began operation in november 2009 the primary goal is to understand the influence of galactic cosmic rays gcrs on aerosols and clouds and their implications for climate although its design is optimised to address the cosmic ray question as posed by henrik svensmark and colleagues in 1997 cloud allows as well to measure aerosol nucleation and growth under controlled laboratory conditions atmospheric aerosols and their effect on clouds are recognised by the ipcc as the main source of uncertainty in present radiative forcing and climate models since an increase in cloud cover reduces global warming the core of the experiment is a stainless steel chamber of 26m volume filled with synthetic air made from liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen the chamber atmosphere and pressure is being measured and regulated by various instrumentations the aerosol chamber can be exposed to an adjustable particle beam simulating gcrs at various altitude or latitude uv illumination allows photolytic reaction the chamber contains an electric field cage to control the drift of small ions and charged aerosols the ionisation produced by cosmic rays can be removed with a strong electric field besides humidity and temperature inside the chamber can be regulated allowing for

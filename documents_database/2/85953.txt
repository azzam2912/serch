though covering all light s technical applications over the whole spectrum most photonic applications are in the range of visible and near infrared light the term photonics developed as an outgrowth of the first practical semiconductor light emitters invented in the early 1960s and optical fibers developed in the 1970s the word photonics is derived from the greek word phos meaning light which has genitive case photos and in compound words the root photo is used it appeared in the late 1960s to describe a research field whose goal was to use light to perform functions that traditionally fell within the typical domain of electronics such as telecommunications information processing etc photonics as a field began with the invention of the laser in 1960 other developments followed the laser diode in the 1970s optical fibers for transmitting information and the erbium doped fiber amplifier these inventions formed the basis for the telecommunications revolution of the late 20th century and provided the infrastructure for the internet though coined earlier the term photonics came into common use in the 1980s as fiber optic data transmission was adopted by telecommunications network operators at that time the term was used widely at bell laboratories

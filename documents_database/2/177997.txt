cells which are classified as apocrine bud their secretions off through the plasma membrane producing extracellular membrane bound vesicles the apical portion of the secretory cell of the gland pinches off and enters the lumen it loses part of its cytoplasm in their secretions apocrine glands are found primarily in the breast of lactating mammals i e the mammary glands are apocrine glands secretion occurs when the release of secretory materials is accompanied with loss of part of cytoplasm apocrine secretion is less damaging to the gland than holocrine secretion which destroys a cell but more damaging than merocrine secretion exocytosis an example of true apocrine glands is the mammary glands responsible for secreting breast milk apocrine metaplasia is a reversible transformation of cells to an apocrine phenotype it is common in the breast in the context of fibrocystic change it is seen in women mostly over the age of 50 years metaplasia happens when there is an irritation to the breast breast cyst apocrine like cells form in a lining of developing microcysts due to the pressure buildup within the lumen the pressure build up is caused by secretions this type of metaplasia represents an exception to the common

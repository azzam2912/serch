together with the mesangial matrix they form the vascular pole of the renal corpuscle the mesangial cell population accounts for approximately 30 40 of the total cells in the glomerulus mesangial cells can be categorized as either extraglomerular mesangial cells or intraglomerular mesangial cells based on their relative location to the glomerulus the extraglomerular mesangial cells are found between the afferent and efferent arterioles towards the vascular pole of the glomerulus the extraglomerular mesangial cells are adjacent to the intraglomerular mesangial cells that are located inside the glomerulus and in between the capillaries the primary function of mesangial cells is to remove trapped residues and aggregated protein from the basement membrane thus keeping the filter free of debris the contractile properties of mesangial cells have been shown to be insignificant in changing the filtration pressure of the glomerulus mesangial cells have irregular shapes with flattened cylinder like cell bodies and processes at both ends containing actin myosin and actinin giving mesangial cells contractile properties the anchoring filaments from mesangial cells to the glomerular basement membrane can alter capillary flow by changing glomerular ultrafiltration surface area extraglomerular mesangial cells are in close connection to afferent and efferent arteriolar cells by gap

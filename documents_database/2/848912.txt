the issue is of greater significance when a significant power is technically under the overarching body s power but has been external from that control for so long that it is generally accepted as to have little consequence kosovo is one particular case as from many country s viewpoints it doesn t exist as a country however it has a well established legal system without any other party effectively stating control over the region and no likelihood of that changing in the anticipated future for the 80 countries that don t recognise its independence but wish to participate with the country trade security etc then functioning with kosovo s legal system is necessary this means functionally ignoring a legal system of significance from their point of view the same can be said of several other long disputed de facto states where necessity drives rejecting the participation of a legally significant legal system legal nullity is also a court decision made without jurisdiction or authority such a decision does not have to be vacated or appealed it is void from inception

differentiation or integration is a real or complex parameter the fractional integrator is useful in fractional order control where the history of the system under control is important to the control system output the differintegral function includes the integer order differentiation and integration functions and allows a continuous range of functions around them the differintegral parameters are a t and q the parameters a and t describe the range over which to compute the result the differintegral parameter q may be any real number or complex number if q is greater than zero the differintegral computes a derivative if q is less than zero the differintegral computes an integral the integer order integration can be computed as a riemann liouville differintegral where the weight of each element in the sum is the constant unit value 1 which is equivalent to the riemann sum to compute an integer order derivative the weights in the summation would be zero with the exception of the most recent data points where in the case of the first unit derivative the weight of the data point at t 1 is 1 and the weight of the data point at t is 1 the sum of

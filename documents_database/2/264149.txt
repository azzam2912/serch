it is an activity that can occur in software development and is comparable to prototyping as known from other fields such as mechanical engineering or manufacturing a prototype typically simulates only a few aspects of and may be completely different from the final product prototyping has several benefits the software designer and implementer can get valuable feedback from the users early in the project the client and the contractor can compare if the software made matches the software specification according to which the software program is built it also allows the software engineer some insight into the accuracy of initial project estimates and whether the deadlines and milestones proposed can be successfully met the degree of completeness and the techniques used in prototyping have been in development and debate since its proposal in the early 1970s the purpose of a prototype is to allow users of the software to evaluate developers proposals for the design of the eventual product by actually trying them out rather than having to interpret and evaluate the design based on descriptions software prototyping provides an understanding of the software s functions and potential threats or issues prototyping can also be used by end users to

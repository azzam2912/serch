procr has also recently been designated cd201 cluster of differentiation 201 the protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for protein c that enhances its activation protein c is an anti coagulant serine protease activated by the blood coagulation pathway epcr protein is an n glycosylated type i membrane protein that enhances the activation of protein c it belongs to the mhc class i cd1 family of proteins that is characterized by having a deep groove that in other proteins in the family but not in epcr is usually used for antigen binding like the cd1 series epcr has a lipid in the corresponding groove the bound lipid in epcr is usually phosphatidylcholine but it may be phosphatidylethanolamine and it contributes to protein c binding though probably not through direct contact mutations in this gene have been associated with venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarction as well as with late fetal loss during pregnancy the protein is also involved in plasmodium falciparum malaria as subtypes of the plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 pfemp1 family use epcr of the host as a receptor

for example in an auction for a single item the utilities of all agents are single parametric since they can be represented by their monetary evaluation of the item in contrast in a combinatorial auction for two or more related items the utilities are usually not single parametric since they are usually represented by their evaluations to all possible bundles of items there is a set formula 1 of possible outcomes there are formula 2 agents which have different valuations for each outcome in general each agent can assign a different and unrelated value to every outcome in formula 1 in the special case of single parameter utility each agent formula 4 has a publicly known outcome subset formula 5 which are the winning outcomes for agent formula 4 e g in a single item auction formula 7 contains the outcome in which agent formula 4 wins the item for every agent there is a number formula 9 which represents the winning value of formula 4 the agent s valuation of the outcomes in formula 1 can take one of two values the vector of the winning values of all agents is denoted by formula 15 for every agent formula

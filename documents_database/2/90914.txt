the normalization is typically a division by an expression of the standard deviation which renders the moment scale invariant this has the advantage that such normalized moments differ only in other properties than variability facilitating e g comparison of shape of different probability distributions let x be a random variable with a probability distribution p and mean value formula 1 i e the first raw moment or moment about zero the operator e denoting the expected value of x then the standardized moment of degree k is formula 2 that is the ratio of the k th moment about the mean to the k th power of the standard deviation the power of k is because moments scale as formula 5 meaning that formula 6 they are homogeneous functions of degree k thus the standardized moment is scale invariant this can also be understood as being because moments have dimension in the above ratio defining standardized moments the dimensions cancel so they are dimensionless numbers the first four standardized moments can be written as for skewness and kurtosis alternative definitions exist which are based on the third and fourth cumulant respectively another scale invariant dimensionless measure for characteristics of a

one can show that it is a constant vector for a given orbit under ideal conditions this essentially proves kepler s second law it s called specific angular momentum because it s not the actual angular momentum formula 2 but the angular momentum per mass thus the word specific in this term is short for mass specific or divided by mass thus the si unit is m s formula 4 denotes the reduced mass formula 5 the specific relative angular momentum is defined as the cross product of the relative position vector formula 6 and the relative velocity vector formula 7 the formula 9 vector is always perpendicular to the instantaneous osculating orbital plane which coincides with the instantaneous perturbed orbit it would not necessarily be perpendicular to an average plane which accounted for many years of perturbations as usual in physics the magnitude of the vector quantity formula 1 is denoted by formula 11 the following is only valid under the simplifications also applied to newton s law of universal gravitation one looks at two point masses formula 13 and formula 14 at the distance formula 15 from one another and with the gravitational force formula 16 acting between

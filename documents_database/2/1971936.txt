a biomolecular gradient can exist intracellularly within a cell or extracellularly between groups of cells the purposes of such gradients in biological systems vary but include chemotaxis and functions in development these types of gradients play a role in many different types of signaling as well as recently being implicated in cancer metastasis cells themselves can create biomolecular gradients by releasing signaling molecules that diffuse outwardly these gradients are critical for cellular identity and cell relocation similarly the gradients produced by cells may influence cellular fate by their temporal and spatial characteristics in certain organisms the choice of cell fate can be determined by a gradient a binary choice or through a relay of molecules released by a cell if cell fate is binary the identity of the cell is influenced by the presence or absence of a signaling molecule consequently these signals can also induce cell fate acting in a relay the relay functions by the source cell releasing a signaling molecule into the environment adjacent cells possessing similar cell identities respond to these signals and can release different signaling molecules to cells in their surrounding area promoting additional new cell fates this process continues to all cells in

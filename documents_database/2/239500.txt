critical iss functionality such as guidance navigation control and propulsion are provided only by russian zvezda and progress and the european atv a propulsion module would have been needed for iss altitude maintenance and reboost debris avoidance maneuvers attitude control and propellant supply in the event the zvezda service module was not available launch failure etc to the international space station if the zvezda had not been available the interim control module would have been used at first it only had a lifetime of three years then the propulsion module would have been necessary the iss requires an average 7 000 kg of propellant each year for altitude maintenance debris avoidance and attitude control a propulsion module would have provided reserve propellant for one year of iss orbit life in case of supply interruption a propulsion module would have been attached to the unity node of the iss multiple supply vehicles are required to satisfy the iss s 7 000 kg annual average propellant need the then current plan for six progress m1 spacecraft per year met that need the propulsion module would hold 9808 kg fuel progress m holds 1100 kg progress m1 holds 1950 kg esa atv holds

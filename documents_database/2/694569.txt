they are the product of chemical reactions physical effects and contamination that occurs during the melting and pouring process these inclusions are categorized by origin as either endogenous or exogenous endogenous inclusions also known as indigenous occur within the metal and are the result of chemical reactions these products precipitate during cooling and are typically very small exogenous inclusions are caused by the entrapment of nonmetals their size varies greatly and their source can include slag dross flux residues and pieces of the mold non metallic inclusions arise because of many physical chemical effects that occur in molten and consolidated metal during production non metallic inclusions that arise because of different reactions during metal production are called natural or indigenous they include oxides sulfides nitrides and phosphides apart from natural inclusions there are also parts of slag refractories material of a casting mould the material the metal contacts during production in the metal such non metallic inclusions are called foreign accidental or exogenous most inclusions in the reduction smelting of metal formed because of admixture dissolubility decreasing during cooling and consolidation the present day level of steel production technology allows the elimination of most natural and foreign inclusions from the

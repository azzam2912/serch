in other words it is the curve traced out by a point fixed to a circle where the point may be on inside or outside the circle as it rolls along a straight line if the point is on the circle the trochoid is called common also known as a cycloid if the point is inside the circle the trochoid is called curtate and if the point is outside the circle the trochoid is called prolate the word trochoid was coined by gilles de roberval as a circle of radius a rolls without slipping along a line l the center c moves parallel to l and every other point p in the rotating plane rigidly attached to the circle traces the curve called the trochoid let cp b parametric equations of the trochoid for which l is the x axis are where is the variable angle through which the circle rolls if p lies inside the circle b a the trochoid is described as being curtate contracted common or prolate extended respectively a curtate trochoid is traced by a pedal when a normally geared bicycle is pedaled along a straight line a prolate trochoid is traced by the tip of

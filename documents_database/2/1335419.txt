this definition is used in a number of mass spectrometry texts this use is also implied by the term high resolution mass spectrometry a high value for resolution corresponding to good separation of peaks is similar to the convention used with chromatography separations although it is important to note that the definitions are not the same high resolution indicating better peak separation is also used in ion mobility spectrometry some mass spectrometrists use the definition that is similar to definitions used in some other fields of physics and chemistry in this case resolving power is defined as the minimum peak separation m which allows to distinguish two ion species is then called resolution and resolving power when defined in this way are consistent with iupac recommendations for microscopy optical spectroscopy and ion microscopy sims but not gas chromatography this definition also appears in some mass spectrometry texts there are several ways to define the minimum peak separation m in mass spectrometry therefore it is important to report the method used to determine mass resolution when reporting its value the two most widely used are the peak width definition and the valley definition in the peak width definition the value of

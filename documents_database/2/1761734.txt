they were introduced by jack e graver their connection to the theory of gr bner bases was discussed by bernd sturmfels the algorithmic theory of graver bases and its application to integer programming is described by shmuel onn the graver basis of an m n integer matrix formula 1 is the finite set formula 2 of minimal elements in the set under a well partial order on formula 4 defined by formula 5 when formula 6 and formula 7 for all i for example the graver basis of formula 8 consists of the vectors 2 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 1 1 and their negations integer programming is the problem of optimizing a linear or nonlinear objective function over the set of integer points satisfying a system of linear inequalities formally it can be written in standard form as follows it is one of the most fundamental discrete optimization problems and has a very broad modeling power and numerous applications in a variety of areas but is typically very hard computationally as noted below however given the graver basis formula 2 of formula 1 the problem with linear and various nonlinear objective functions can be solved

several methods exist for the separation of cobalt from copper and nickel they depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore the ores are treated by a sulfatizing roast in a fluidized bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides into soluble sulfates and iron into insoluble hematite the calcine is subsequently leached with sulfuric acid from the spent copper recovery electrolyte oxide concentrates are introduced at this leaching step to maintain the acid balance in the circuit iron and aluminum are removed from the leach solution by the addition of lime and copper is electrowon on copper cathodes a part of the spent electrolyte enters the cobalt recovery circuit and is purified by the removal of iron copper nickel and zinc prior to the precipitation of cobalt as its hydroxide this is accomplished by the addition of more lime to raise the ph until the remaining copper precipitates this copper is sent back to the copper circuit as more lime is then added a copper cobaltite precipitates and is fed back to the leaching process sodium hydrosulfide nahs is added along with some metallic cobalt as a catalyst to precipitate nickel sulfide nis

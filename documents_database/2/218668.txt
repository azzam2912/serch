the name is also a reference to the allegory of the cave in plato s republic in which a philosopher contemplates perception reality and illusion the first cave was invented by carolina cruz neira daniel j sandin and thomas a defanti at the university of illinois chicago electronic visualization laboratory in 1992 a cave is typically a video theater situated within a larger room the walls of a cave are typically made up of rear projection screens however flat panel displays are becoming more common the floor can be a downward projection screen a bottom projected screen or a flat panel display the projection systems are very high resolution due to the near distance viewing which requires very small pixel sizes to retain the illusion of reality the user wears 3d glasses inside the cave to see 3d graphics generated by the cave people using the cave can see objects apparently floating in the air and can walk around them getting a proper view of what they would look like in reality this was initially made possible by electromagnetic sensors but has converted to infrared cameras the frame of early caves had to be built from non magnetic materials such

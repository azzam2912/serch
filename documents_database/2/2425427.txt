as a postdoctoral researcher she worked on the structure determination of vitamin b12 in the group of dorothy hodgkin together with her husband david shoemaker she contributed to the research on transition metal phases and intermetallic compounds they were the first to recognize that interstices in tetrahedrally close packed metal crystals are exclusively tetrahedral and only have four types of coordination polyhedra in 1941 shoemaker completed her undergraduate degree at the university of leiden which was closed shortly after due to the nazi occupation she then started her graduate studies at the university of utrecht where she studied under anton eduard van arkel at the end of the world war ii she completed her doctoral examination afterwards shoemaker assumed an assistantship at the university of utrecht and she learned the techniques of x ray crystallography under the renowned crystallographer caroline macgillavry in 1950 shoemaker received her phd from the university of utrecht and was hired by anton eduard van arkel as an x ray crystallographer at the university of leiden during this time her research focused on crystal structures of monovalent ions starting later in 1950 she worked on the crystal structure of vitamin b12 in dorothy hodgkin s laboratory

aligned sequences of nucleotide or amino acid residues are typically represented as rows within a matrix gaps are inserted between the residues so that identical or similar characters are aligned in successive columns sequence alignments are also used for non biological sequences such as calculating the distance cost between strings in a natural language or in financial data if two sequences in an alignment share a common ancestor mismatches can be interpreted as point mutations and gaps as indels that is insertion or deletion mutations introduced in one or both lineages in the time since they diverged from one another in sequence alignments of proteins the degree of similarity between amino acids occupying a particular position in the sequence can be interpreted as a rough measure of how conserved a particular region or sequence motif is among lineages the absence of substitutions or the presence of only very conservative substitutions that is the substitution of amino acids whose side chains have similar biochemical properties in a particular region of the sequence suggest that this region has structural or functional importance although dna and rna nucleotide bases are more similar to each other than are amino acids the conservation of base

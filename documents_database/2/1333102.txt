it aims to provide a very secure stable and fast desktop environment that lives purely in ram tin hat boots from cd or optionally from usb flash drive but it does not mount any file system directly from the boot device instead tin hat employs a large squashfs image from the boot device which expands into tmpfs upon booting this makes for long boot times but fast speeds during use the central design consideration in tin hat is to construct an operating system that can hide data from an attacker even if he has physical access to the computer physical access to a computer with unencrypted filesystems does not secure the data and an attacker could easily retrieve the data encrypting the filesystem provides protection from such an attack but many implementations of encryption do not hide the fact that data is encrypted on the filesystem for example the luks encryption system includes metadata which detail the block cipher and block cipher mode used in encryption this information does not help the attacker decrypt the filesystem but it does reveal that it contains encrypted data and not random data however tin hat stores its filesystem in the ram leaving no

commonly affected tissues include the brain and muscles there are three distinct ccds the most common is creatine transporter defect ctd an x linked disorder caused by pathogenic variants in slc6a8 the main symptoms of ctd are intellectual disability and developmental delay and these are caused by a lack of creatine in the brain due to the defective transporter there are also two enzymatic defects of creatine biosynthesis agat deficiency caused by variants in gatm and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency gamt deficiency caused by variants in gamt the single enzyme defects are both inherited in an autosomal recessive manner creatine is synthesized in the kidney and liver by a two step enzymatic process in the first step glycine and arginine are combined by to form guanidinoacetate this step also results in the production of ornithine creatine is produced by the enzyme guanidinoacetate methyltransferase after production in the liver and kidneys creatine is transported to organs and tissues with high energy demands most commonly the brain and skeletal muscles in addition to endogenous production creatine can be obtained from dietary sources or supplementation ornithine aminotransferase deficiency can cause secondary creatine deficiency however it does not result in cerebral creatine deficiency the clinical

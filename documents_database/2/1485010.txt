some animals particularly carnivores also use teeth for hunting or for defensive purposes the roots of teeth are covered by gums teeth are not made of bone but rather of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness the cellular tissues that ultimately become teeth originate from the embryonic germ layer the ectoderm the general structure of teeth is similar across the vertebrates although there is considerable variation in their form and position the teeth of mammals have deep roots and this pattern is also found in some fish and in crocodilians in most teleost fish however the teeth are attached to the outer surface of the bone while in lizards they are attached to the inner surface of the jaw by one side in cartilaginous fish such as sharks the teeth are attached by tough ligaments to the hoops of cartilage that form the jaw some animals develop only one set of teeth monophyodont while others develop many sets polyphyodont sharks for example grow a new set of teeth every two weeks to replace worn teeth rodent incisors grow and wear away continually through gnawing which helps maintain relatively constant length the industry of the beaver is due in part

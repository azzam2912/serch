developed in the early 1990s by keygene aflp uses restriction enzymes to digest genomic dna followed by ligation of adaptors to the sticky ends of the restriction fragments a subset of the restriction fragments is then selected to be amplified this selection is achieved by using primers complementary to the adaptor sequence the restriction site sequence and a few nucleotides inside the restriction site fragments as described in detail below the amplified fragments are separated and visualized on denaturing on agarose gel electrophoresis either through autoradiography or fluorescence methodologies or via automated capillary sequencing instruments although aflp is commonly referred to as amplified fragment length polymorphism the resulting data are not scored as length polymorphisms but instead as presence absence polymorphisms aflp pcr is a highly sensitive method for detecting polymorphisms in dna the technique was originally described by vos and zabeau in 1993 in detail the procedure of this technique is divided into three steps the aflp technology has the capability to detect various polymorphisms in different genomic regions simultaneously it is also highly sensitive and reproducible as a result aflp has become widely used for the identification of genetic variation in strains or closely related species of plants

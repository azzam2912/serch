meta ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally studied by philosophers the others being normative ethics and applied ethics while normative ethics addresses such questions as what should i do evaluating specific practices and principles of action meta ethics addresses questions such as what is goodness and how can we tell what is good from what is bad seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations some theorists argue that a metaphysical account of morality is necessary for the proper evaluation of actual moral theories and for making practical moral decisions others reason from opposite premises and suggest that studying moral judgments about proper actions can guide us to a true account of the nature of morality according to richard garner and bernard rosen there are three kinds of meta ethical problems or three general questions a question of the first type might be what do the words good bad right and wrong mean see value theory the second category includes questions of whether moral judgments are universal or relative of one kind or many kinds etc questions of the third kind ask for example how we can know if something is right or wrong

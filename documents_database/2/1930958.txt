the liquid being evaporated is fed from the bottom into long tubes and heated with steam condensing on the outside of the tube from the shell side this is to produce steam and vapour within the tube bringing the liquid inside to a boil the vapour produced then presses the liquid against the walls of the tubes and causes the ascending force of this liquid as more vapour is formed the centre of the tube will have a higher velocity which forces the remaining liquid against the tube wall forming a thin film which moves upwards this phenomenon of the rising film gives the evaporator its name applications there is a wide range of applications for rising tube evaporators including effluent treatment production of polymers food production thermal desalination pharmaceuticals and solvent recovery aschner f s schaal m hasson d 1971 large long tube evaporators for seawater distillation in terms of applications within these industries rising tube evaporators are mainly used as reboilers for distillation columns or as pre concentrators or flash evaporators or pre heaters designed to remove volatile components prior to stripping thermal desalination a specific application of rising tube evaporators is the thermal desalination of sea water

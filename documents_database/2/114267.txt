it develops in places where re entrance occurs such as at a cove s headlands by the process of longshore drift by longshore currents the drift occurs due to waves meeting the beach at an oblique angle moving sediment down the beach in a zigzag pattern this is complemented by longshore currents which further transport sediment through the water alongside the beach these currents are caused by the same waves that cause the drift where the direction of the shore inland re enters or changes direction for example at a headland the longshore current spreads out or dissipates no longer able to carry the full load much of the sediment is dropped this is called deposition this submerged bar of sediment allows longshore drift or littoral drift to continue to transport sediment in the direction the waves are breaking forming an above water spit without the complementary process of littoral drift the bar would not build above the surface of the waves becoming a spit and would instead be leveled off underwater spits occur when longshore drift reaches a section of headland where the turn is greater than 30 degrees the spit will continue out into the sea until water

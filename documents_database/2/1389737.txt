in this form the theorem asserts that if as y 0 the non negative sequence a is such that there is an asymptotic equivalence then there is also an asymptotic equivalence as n the integral formulation of the theorem relates in an analogous manner the asymptotics of the cumulative distribution function of a function with the asymptotics of its laplace transform the theorem was proved in 1914 by g h hardy and j e littlewood in 1930 jovan karamata gave a new and much simpler proof this formulation is from titchmarsh suppose a 0 for all n and as x 1 we have then as n goes to we have the theorem is sometimes quoted in equivalent forms where instead of requiring a 0 we require a o 1 or we require a k for some constant k the theorem is sometimes quoted in another equivalent formulation through the change of variable x 1 e if as y 0 then the following more general formulation is from feller consider a real valued function f 0 r of bounded variation the laplace stieltjes transform of f is defined by the stieltjes integral the theorem relates the asymptotics of with those of

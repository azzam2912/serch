this is due to qore s unique prompt collection implementation for garbage collection qore scripts typically have the following extensions executable qore scripts on unix like operating systems will typically start with a hashbang to specify the filename of the interpreter as follows codice 4 qore syntax is similar to and inspired from the following programming languages basic types include codice 23 codice 24 codice 25 codice 26 codice 27 codice 28 codice 29 codice 30 associative arrays and codice 31 as well as code codice 32 for code used as a data type complex types are also supported such as codice 33 codice 34 codice 35 as well as type safe hashes despite being an interpreted language qore was designed to support multithreading as a fundamental design principle all elements of qore are thread safe and the language in general has been designed with smp scalability in mind because all elements of the language were designed to support multithreading qore programs and scripts do not have to limit themselves to a subset of qore s functionality which is also why there is no global interpreter lock in qore threading functionality in qore is provided by the operating system s

proposed explanations for this type of gigantism include colder temperature food scarcity and reduced predation pressure in the deep sea the inaccessibility of abyssal habitats has hindered the study of this topic in marine crustaceans the trend of increasing size with depth has been observed in mysids euphausiids decapods isopods and amphipods non arthropods in which deep sea gigantism has been observed are cephalopods cnidarians and eels from the order anguilliformes examples of deep sea gigantism include the big red jellyfish the giant isopod giant ostracod the giant sea spider the giant amphipod the japanese spider crab the giant oarfish the deepwater stingray the seven arm octopus and a number of squid species the colossal squid up to 14 m in length the giant squid up to 12 m onykia robusta taningia danae galiteuthis phyllura kondakovia longimana and the bigfin squid deep sea gigantism is not generally observed in the meiofauna organisms that pass through a 1 mm mesh which actually exhibit the reverse trend of decreasing size with depth in crustaceans it has been proposed that the explanation for the increase in size with depth is similar to that for the increase in size with latitude bergmann s rule

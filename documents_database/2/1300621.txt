he has written extensively on the subject of free logic a term which he coined lambert s law is the major principle in any free definite description theory that says for all x x the y a if and only if a x y for all y if a then y x free logic itself is an adjustment of a given standard predicate logic such as to relieve it of existential assumptions and so make it a free logic taking bertrand russell s predicate logic in his principia mathematica as standard one replaces universal instantiation formula 1 with universal specification formula 2 thus universal statements like all men are mortal or everything is a unicorn do not presuppose that there are men or that there is anything these would be symbolized with the appropriate predicates as formula 3 and formula 4 which in principia mathematica entail formula 5 and formula 6 but not in free logic the truth of these last statements when used in a free logic depend on the domain of quantification which may be the null set

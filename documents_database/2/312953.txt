it is similar to a snowboard or monoski in that both feet are attached to the same board on a skwal the feet are one in front of the other in line with the direction the skwal is pointing in this differs from snowboards in which the feet are side on to the direction of the board and monoskis in which the feet point in the direction of the board but are side by side the skwal was invented by two french ski school instructors and manuel jammes with the first prototype appearing in 1992 they envisaged it as a way to offer different sensations to what skiing and snowboarding could offer at a time when carving skis were only just starting to take off a french company called lacroix took an interest recruited and started producing skwals a few years later left lacroix and started his own skwal making company there are now several other makers of skwals though the sport has never gained the widespread popularity its creators predicted possibly due to the perceived difficulty of the sport the sport is nonetheless gathering a few more adepts every year

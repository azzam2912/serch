polyploidy wholesale genome duplication is common in plants and constitutes an important method of speciation when a polyploid species arises its genome contains homeologs duplicated chromosomes with equivalent genetic information however silencing of redundant genes occurs rapidly in new polyploids through genetic and epigenetic means this primarily occurs because redundancy allows one of the two genes present for each locus to be silenced without affecting the phenotype of the organism and thus mutations that eliminate gene expression are much less likely to be deleterious or lethal this allows mutations that would be lethal in diploid populations to accumulate in polyploids reciprocal silencing refers to the specific pattern of silencing where equivalent loci in are both silenced and expressed in a reciprocal manner this phenomenon is observed on two distinct scales allopolyploids are species whose increased complement of genetic material is the result of hybridization of two closely related species thus homeologous chromosomes in allopolyploids are equivalent but not identical these differences mean that the precise pattern of silencing and expression can have important phenotypic effects reciprocal silencing on the population level refers to the case where two populations are each descended from the same allopolyploid in one population one of

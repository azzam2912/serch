since equilibrium is maintained at all steps the process is reversible equilibrium folding equilibrium unfolding is used to determine the conformational stability of the molecule in its simplest form equilibrium unfolding assumes that the molecule may belong to only two thermodynamic states the folded state typically denoted n for native state and the unfolded state typically denoted u this all or none model of protein folding was first proposed by tim anson in 1945 but is believed to hold only for small single structural domains of proteins jackson 1998 larger domains and multi domain proteins often exhibit intermediate states as usual in statistical mechanics these states correspond to ensembles of molecular conformations not just one conformation the molecule may transition between the native and unfolded states according to a simple kinetic model with rate constants formula 1 and formula 2 for the folding u n and unfolding n u reactions respectively the dimensionless equilibrium constant formula 3 can be used to determine the conformational stability formula 4 by the equation where formula 6 is the gas constant and formula 7 is the absolute temperature in kelvin thus formula 4 is positive if the unfolded state is less stable i e

the hypothesis was never widely accepted and the causative agents responsible for these diseases are now widely accepted to be prions the virino was described partially to protect the central dogma of molecular biology which was threatened by the existence of a series of degenerative neurological tse diseases including kuru cjd scrapie in sheep and bse in cattle the central dogma states that nucleic acids act as the information carriers and dna and rna make proteins proteins alone cannot make dna however studies searching for the transmission agent of scrapie and other tses have failed to culture bacteria and tests attacking nucleic acids strands have little effect on the infectivity of tse solutions these failures largely rule out a virus as the infective agent experiments using electron beams designed to disrupt large molecules have been performed to investigate the size of the agent show that it is very small much smaller than the smallest known virus the virino also has the benefit of explaining the traits of tses which resemble nucleic acids for example their occurrence in strains which positively indicates the tse agent is information carrying and not merely a toxin in 1971 dickinson ag and meikle vm provided

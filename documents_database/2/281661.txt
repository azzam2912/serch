hek 293 cells have been widely used in cell biology research for many years because of their reliable growth and propensity for transfection they are also used by the biotechnology industry to produce therapeutic proteins and viruses for gene therapy hek 293 cells were generated in 1973 by transfection of cultures of normal human embryonic kidney cells with sheared adenovirus 5 dna in alex van der eb s laboratory in leiden the netherlands the cells were obtained from a single apparently healthy legally aborted fetus under dutch law the identity of the parent and the reason for the abortion are unknown the cells were cultured by van der eb the transfection by adenovirus was performed by frank graham a post doc in van der eb s lab they were published in 1977 after graham left leiden for mcmaster university they are called hek since they originated in human embryonic kidney cultures while the number 293 came from graham s habit of numbering his experiments the original hek 293 cell clone was from his 293rd experiment graham performed the transfection a total of eight times obtaining just one clone of cells that were cultured for several months after presumably adapting to

the purpose of deer management is to regulate the population s size reduce negative effects of population on the ecosystem and maintain the integrity of other populations as a deer population grows it will begin to reach the carrying capacity of an ecosystem causing issues for other plants and wildlife plant life can begin to disappear locally because of browsing these local disappearances directly effect the population of that plant species and indirectly effect other wildlife populations that also depend on the plant species for food this ultimately lowers the biodiversity and changes the composition of the habitat region or area until the population of deer is lowered and the location is given time to recover deer populations may not always reach the carrying capacity this can lead to an increase in human and deer interactions these interactions can result in car accidents crop damage property damage and much more these species interaction occur both in rural and urban areas where population of deer come into contact each area comes with its own set of challenges as to which management practice is the most appropriate and effective these challenges have led to the development of alternative methods of deer management

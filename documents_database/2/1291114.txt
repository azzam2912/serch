he is also founder president and scientific director of abtech scientific inc he is noted for his research and commercial development of biologically inspired and chemically responsive polymers as related to bioanalytics bioinformatics and bionics guiseppi elie initially focused on chemical engineering and materials science with his sc d research on the synthesis and characterization of polyacetylene however medicine was the interest of his youth and eventually drew him to the expanding field of bioengineering specifically research and commercial development of biologically inspired and chemically responsive polymers that combine hydrogels possessing biologically inspired moieties with one dimensional organic conductors conductive polymers and carbon nanotubes the resulting stimuli responsive polymers are being developed as smart materials for controlled drug release biosensors and for use in bionics he is noted for his work on the development of controversial implantable biochips dna microarrays and for his guiseppi prediction continued progress in the density of molecular recognition features on biochips will approach single molecule detection by analogy to moore s law he currently pursues the development of electronic noses implantable bioanalytical biochips and implantable bio smart materials for human health applications his work has resulted in the commercialization of a wide variety of biochip

as there was no funding available to turn the many blocks of this street into a local greenway the local community worked with the city of vancouver planning department to implement a demonstration project called blooming boulevards this demonstration project allowed residents to garden the frontages of their yards between the street and the sidewalk this section of street contains the wires and ducts of the city and this was the first time that gardening on these city owned frontages was allowed the program was so successful that blooming boulevards are now city policy and boulevards are now gardened throughout the city the windsor bikeway is a 4 3 km north south bike route that follows glen drive and windsor street from great northern way to 43rd avenue and was chosen for its proximity to knight street this route provides a connection for the off broadway and 10th avenue bikeways to the midtown ridgeway and inverness bikeways the windsor bikeway passes through mount pleasant and kensington cedar cottage neighbourhoods and goes by memorial park south measures along the proposed bikeway to reduce vehicle speeds and to help cyclists cross busy arterials include traffic circles corner bulges centre medians speed humps

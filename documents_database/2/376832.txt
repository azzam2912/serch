a dna binding repressor blocks the attachment of rna polymerase to the promoter thus preventing transcription of the genes into messenger rna an rna binding repressor binds to the mrna and prevents translation of the mrna into protein this blocking of expression is called repression if an inducer a molecule that initiates the gene expression is present then it can interact with the repressor protein and detach it from the operator rna polymerase then can transcribe the message expressing the gene a corepressor is a molecule that can bind to repressor and make it bind to the operator tightly which decreases transcription a repressor that binds with a corepressor is termed an aporepressor or inactive repressor one type of aporepressor is the trp repressor an important metabolic protein in bacteria the above mechanism of repression is a type of a feedback mechanism because it only allows transcription to occur if a certain condition is present the presence of specific inducer s within the eukaryotic genome are regions of dna known as silencers these dna sequences bind to repressors to partially or fully repress the expression of a gene silencers can be located several bases upstream or downstream from the actual

it was first named by paleontologists linda a tsuji johannes muller and robert r reisz in 2010 the type species is microleter mckinzieorum a very well preserved skull and lower jaw is the only known specimen it was found from the early permian early kungurian stage fissure fill deposits near richards spur in comanche county often referred to as the fort sill locality the fort sill locality has yielded many other well preserved tetrapod fossils including those of other parareptiles such as bolosaurus colobomycter and delorhynchus the surfaces of the bones of the skull are covered in pits with large pits surrounded by much smaller ones there is also a radial pattern of grooves on some bone surfaces like many other basal parareptiles microleter has a temporal fenestra the temporal fenestra is not entirely surrounded by bone and opens ventrally at the bottom of the skull microleter also has a wide palatine bone and a lacrimal that reaches the naris or nasal opening microleter is one of the most basal parareptiles and the most basal parareptile from laurasia it is phylogenetically positioned between the more basal millerettids from the late permian of south africa and a more derived group of

this last characteristic makes possible the study of samples with the natural abundance of the m ssbauer isotope the information furnished by the integral measurements can be increased by using various angles of incidence or by depositing thin layers of inert material on the sample in the energy range used in cems the incident radiation can interact with the absorber through two kinds of processes a conventional interactions photoelectric and compton effects and b nuclear resonant absorption m ssbauer effect due to conventional interactions the beam is attenuated and electrons are emitted from the sample the nuclear de excitation following the resonant absorption takes place by emission of either a gamma ray or an internal conversion ic electron in the latter case the atom is left in an excited state with a hole in an inner shell the energy excess is given away with emission of auger electrons and or x rays thus the electrons emitted from the sample as a consequence of the m ssbauer absorptions are a primary ic or auger electrons originated in the de excitations of the nuclei excited by the incident beam and b secondary electrons originated by conventional interactions of photons or resonant absorption

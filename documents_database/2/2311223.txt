built when there was a plentiful supply of timber it is a substantial timber framed house with brick panels and during the last 500 years it has evolved and grown to what is now a quintessential english chocolate box cottage elevated above the surrounding fields bounded by rich woodlands and close to the river the site of the cottage is a perfect location for a nobleman of 1490 and the cottage is the heart of the village it had the village forge and blacksmiths in its garden next door is the red lion inn and opposite is the old post office in 1490 the left hand side of the house was built using timber framing brick panels and strong diagonal braces a similar type of construction was used in one of the houses at the weald and downland museum sussex because bricks were a relatively new way of building they were not yet trusted to take the whole weight of the house this is why timber was used for the main strength of the house the original timbers are thought to come from an earlier house on the site the same type of carpenters marks are on the rear timber

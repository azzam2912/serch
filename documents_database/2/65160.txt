it was discovered by andr louis cholesky for real matrices when it is applicable the cholesky decomposition is roughly twice as efficient as the lu decomposition for solving systems of linear equations the cholesky decomposition of a hermitian positive definite matrix a is a decomposition of the form where l is a lower triangular matrix with real and positive diagonal entries and l denotes the conjugate transpose of l every hermitian positive definite matrix and thus also every real valued symmetric positive definite matrix has a unique cholesky decomposition if the matrix a is hermitian and positive semi definite then it still has a decomposition of the form a ll if the diagonal entries of l are allowed to be zero when a has only real entries l has only real entries as well and the factorization may be written a ll the cholesky decomposition is unique when a is positive definite there is only one lower triangular matrix l with strictly positive diagonal entries such that a ll however the decomposition need not be unique when a is positive semidefinite the converse holds trivially if a can be written as ll for some invertible l lower triangular or otherwise

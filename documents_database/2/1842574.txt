in a matroid of rank formula 1 every circuit has size at most formula 2 so it is equivalent to define paving matroids as the matroids in which the size of every circuit belongs to the set formula 3 it has been conjectured that almost all matroids are paving matroids every simple matroid of rank three is a paving matroid for instance this is true of the fano matroid the v mos matroid provides another example of rank four uniform matroids of rank formula 1 have the property that every circuit is of length exactly formula 2 and hence are all paving matroids the converse does not hold for example the cycle matroid of the complete graph formula 6 is paving but not uniform a steiner system formula 7 is a pair formula 8 where formula 9 is a finite set of size formula 10 and formula 11 is a family of formula 12 element subsets of formula 9 with the property that every formula 14 element subset of formula 9 is also a subset of exactly one set in formula 11 the elements of formula 11 form a formula 14 partition of formula 9 and hence are the hyperplanes

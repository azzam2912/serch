in a typical sfg setup two laser beams mix at an interface and generate an output beam with a frequency equal to the sum of the two input frequencies traveling in a direction given by the sum of the incident beams wavevectors the technique was developed in 1987 by yuen ron shen and his students as an extension of second harmonic generation spectroscopy and rapidly applied to deduce the composition orientation distributions and structural information of molecules at gas solid gas liquid and liquid solid interfaces soon after its invention philippe guyot sionnest extended the technique to obtain the first measurements of electronic and vibrational dynamics at surfaces sfg has advantages in its ability to be monolayer surface sensitive ability to be performed in situ for example aqueous surfaces and in gases and its capability to provide ultrafast time resolution sfg gives information complementary to infrared and raman spectroscopy ir visible sum frequency generation spectroscopy uses two laser beams that spatially and temporally overlap at a surface of a material or the interface between two media an output beam is generated at a frequency of the sum of the two input beams the two input beams have to be able

normally orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory although it may also refer to a non repeating trajectory to a close approximation planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse as described by kepler s laws of planetary motion for most situations orbital motion is adequately approximated by newtonian mechanics which explains gravity as a force obeying an inverse square law however albert einstein s general theory of relativity which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of spacetime with orbits following geodesics provides a more accurate calculation and understanding of the exact mechanics of orbital motion historically the apparent motions of the planets were described by european and arabic philosophers using the idea of celestial spheres this model posited the existence of perfect moving spheres or rings to which the stars and planets were attached it assumed the heavens were fixed apart from the motion of the spheres and was developed without any understanding of gravity after the planets motions were more accurately measured theoretical mechanisms such as deferent and epicycles were added although the model was capable of reasonably accurately predicting the planets positions in the sky

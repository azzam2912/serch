the weight is defined by the kernel such that closer points are given higher weights the estimated function is smooth and the level of smoothness is set by a single parameter this technique is most appropriate when the dimension of the predictor is low p kernels used for smoothing include parabolic epanechnikov tricube and gaussian kernels let formula 7 be a continuous function of x for each formula 8 the nadaraya watson kernel weighted average smooth y x estimation is defined by where in the following sections we describe some particular cases of kernel smoothers the gaussian kernel is one of the most widely used kernels and is expressed with the equation below here b is the length scale for the input space the idea of the nearest neighbor smoother is the following for each point x take m nearest neighbors and estimate the value of y x by averaging the values of these neighbors formally formula 11 where formula 12 is the m th closest to x neighbor and example in this example x is one dimensional for each x the formula 14 is an average value of 16 closest to x points denoted by red the result is

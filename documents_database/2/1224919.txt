these compounds represent the smallest molecular wires although such species have no applications they are researched for the bottom up approach to nanoelectronics an emac molecule contains a linear string of transition metals typically cr co ni or cu that are bonded to each other and are surrounded helically by four long organic ligands the metal chains are capped at the ends by anions usually halides the four organic ligands are made of repeating pyridylamido units which contain nitrogen donor atoms each metal atom is six coordinate bonded to two other metals along the axis of the molecule except terminal metals which are bonded to one metal and one capping anion and to four nitrogen atoms perpendicular to the axis the organic ligands template the formation of the chains by bringing the metal ions together and aligning them into a linear string the number of nitrogen atoms in the ligand determines the number of metal atoms that will be incorporated into the chain thus the synthesis yields molecular wires of predetermined length this feature in combination with the fact that the molecules have well defined ends differentiates emacs from other kinds of molecular wires emacs exist only as distinct molecular

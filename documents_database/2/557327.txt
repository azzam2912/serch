applications can link with and use vx32 in order to create safe os independent execution environments in which to run untrusted plug ins or other extensions written in any language that compiles to x86 code from the host processor s viewpoint plug ins running under the vx32 virtual machine monitor run in the context of the application process itself but the vx32 library uses dynamic recompilation to prevent the guest plug in code from accessing memory or jumping to instructions outside its designated sandbox the vx32 library redirects any system calls the plug in makes to the application itself rather than to the host operating system thereby giving the application exclusive control over the api and security environment in which the plug in code executes vx32 thus provides an application extension facility comparable in function to the java virtual machine jvm or the common language runtime clr but with less overhead and with the ability to run code written in any language safe or unsafe vx32 s primary disadvantage is that it is more difficult to make it run on non x86 host processors there are some disadvantages that have been proposed by critics of vx32

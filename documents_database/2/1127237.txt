typically to prove the existence of solutions one first constructs approximate solutions for example by a galerkin method or by mollification of the equation then uses the compactness lemma to show that there is a convergent subsequence of approximate solutions whose limit is a solution the result is named after the french mathematicians jean pierre aubin and jacques louis lions in the original proof by aubin the spaces x and x in the statement of the lemma were assumed to be reflexive but this assumption was removed by simon so the result is also referred to as the aubin lions simon lemma let x x and x be three banach spaces with x x x suppose that x is compactly embedded in x and that x is continuously embedded in x for 1 p q let i if p 1 then the embedding of w into c 0 t x is compact

growth differentiation factor 9 gdf9 is expressed in oocytes and is thought to be required for ovarian folliculogenesis gdf9 is a member of the transforming growth factor beta tgf superfamily growth differentiation factor 9 gdf9 is an oocyte derived growth factor in the transforming growth factor tgf superfamily it is highly expressed in the oocyte and has a pivotal influence on the surrounding somatic cells particularly granulosa cumulus and theca cells paracrine interactions between the developing oocyte and its surrounding follicular cells is essential for the correct progression of both the follicle and the oocyte gdf9 is essential for the overall process of folliculogenesis oogenesis and ovulation and thus plays a major role in female fertility gdf9 acts through two receptors on the cells surrounding the oocyte it binds to bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 bmprii and downstream to this utilizes the tgf receptor type 1 alk5 ligand receptor activation allows the downstream phosphorylation and activation of smad proteins smad proteins are transcription factors found in vertebrates insects and nematodes and are the intercellular substrates of all tgf molecules huang q cheung a zhang y huang h auersperg n and leung p 2009 effects of growth differentiation factor 9 on

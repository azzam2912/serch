whereas normal semiconductor diodes have a roughly fixed voltage drop of around 0 5 1 volts active rectifiers behave as resistances and can have arbitrarily low voltage drop historically vibrator driven switches or motor driven commutators have also been used for mechanical rectifiers and synchronous rectification active rectification has many applications it is frequently used for arrays of photovoltaic panels to avoid reverse current flow that can cause overheating with partial shading while giving minimum power loss the constant voltage drop of a standard p n junction diode is typically between 0 7 v and 1 7 v causing significant power loss in the diode electric power depends on current and voltage the power loss rises proportional to both current and voltage in low voltage converters around 10 volts and less the voltage drop of a diode typically around 0 7 to 1 volt for a silicon diode at its rated current has an adverse effect on efficiency one classic solution replaces standard silicon diodes with schottky diodes which exhibit very low voltage drops as low as 0 3 volts however even schottky rectifiers can be significantly more lossy than the synchronous type notably at high currents and low voltages

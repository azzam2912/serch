it comprises the principal functions of sensation from the maxillary nasal cavity sinuses the palate and subsequently that of the mid face and is intermediate both in position and size between the ophthalmic nerve and the mandibular nerve it begins at the middle of the trigeminal ganglion as a flattened plexiform band then it passes through the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus it leaves the skull through the foramen rotundum where it becomes more cylindrical in form and firmer in texture after leaving foramen rotundum it gives two branches to the pterygopalatine ganglion it then crosses the pterygopalatine fossa inclines lateralward on the back of the maxilla and enters the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure it then runs forward on the floor of the orbit at first in the infraorbital groove and then in the infraorbital canal remaining outside the periosteum of the orbit it then emerges on the face through the infraorbital foramen and terminates by dividing into palpebral lateral nasal and labial branches the nerve is accompanied by the infraorbital branch of the third part of the maxillary artery and the accompanying vein its branches may be divided into four groups depending upon where they branch

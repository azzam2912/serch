this technique uses the specificity of antibodies to their antigen to target fluorescent dyes to specific biomolecule targets within a cell and therefore allows visualization of the distribution of the target molecule through the sample the specific region an antibody recognizes on an antigen is called an epitope there have been efforts in epitope mapping since many antibodies can bind the same epitope and levels of binding between antibodies that recognize the same epitope can vary additionally the binding of the fluorophore to the antibody itself cannot interfere with the immunological specificity of the antibody or the binding capacity of its antigen immunofluorescence is a widely used example of immunostaining using antibodies to stain proteins and is a specific example of immunohistochemistry the use of the antibody antigen relationship in tissues this technique primarily makes use of fluorophores to visualise the location of the antibodies immunofluorescence can be used on tissue sections cultured cell lines or individual cells and may be used to analyze the distribution of proteins glycans and small biological and non biological molecules this technique can even be used to visualize structures such as intermediate sized filaments if the topology of a cell membrane has yet to

there are two facet joints in each spinal motion segment and each facet joint is innervated by the recurrent meningeal nerves the biomechanical function of each pair of facet joints is to guide and limit movement of the spinal motion segment in the lumbar spine for example the facet joints function to protect the motion segment from anterior shear forces excessive rotation and flexion facet joints appear to have little influence on the range of side bending lateral flexion these functions can be disrupted by degeneration dislocation fracture injury instability from trauma osteoarthritis and surgery in the thoracic spine the facet joints function to restrain the amount of flexion and anterior translation of the corresponding vertebral segment and function to facilitate rotation cavitation of the synovial fluid within the facet joints is responsible for the popping sound crepitus associated with manual spinal manipulation commonly referred to as cracking the back the facet joints both superior and inferior are aligned in a way to allow flexion and extension and to limit rotation this is especially true in the lumbar spine in large part due to the mechanical nature of their function all joints undergo degenerative changes with the wear and tear

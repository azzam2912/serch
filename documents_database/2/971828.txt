it consists of a helium atom bonded to a hydrogen atom with one electron removed it can also be viewed as protonated helium it is the lightest heteronuclear ion and is believed to be one of the first compounds formed in the universe after the big bang the ion was first produced in a laboratory in 1925 it is stable in isolation but extremely reactive and cannot be prepared in bulk because it would react with any other molecule with which it came into contact noted as the strongest known acid its occurrence in the interstellar medium has been conjectured since the 1970s and it was finally detected in april 2019 the helium hydrogen ion is isoelectronic with molecular hydrogen unlike the dihydrogen ion the helium hydride ion has a permanent dipole moment which makes its spectroscopic characterization easier the calculated dipole moment of heh is 2 26 or 2 84 d the electron density in the ion is higher around the helium nucleus than the hydrogen 80 of the electron charge is closer to the helium nucleus than to the hydrogen nucleus spectroscopic detection is hampered because one of its most prominent spectral lines at 149 14 m coincides

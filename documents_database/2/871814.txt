the idea is that the probability of success might vary between different sets of trials in different situations this ratio is not much used currently having been largely replaced by the use of the chi squared test in testing for the homogeneity of samples this measure compares the between set variance of the sample proportions evaluated for each set with what the variance should be if there were no difference between in the true proportions of success across the different sets thus the measure is used to evaluate how data compares to a fixed probability of success bernoulli distribution the term lexis ratio is sometimes referred to as l or q where where formula 2 is the weighted sample variance derived from the observed proportions of success in sets in lexis trials and formula 3 is the variance computed from the expected bernoulli distribution on the basis of the overall average proportion of success trials where l falls significantly above or below 1 are known as supernormal and subnormal respectively this ratio q is a measure that can be used to distinguish between three types of variation in sampling for attributes bernoullian lexian and poissonian the lexis ratio is sometimes

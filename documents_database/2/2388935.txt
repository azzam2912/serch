he identified the first clear candidate for a black hole cygnus x 1 with his colleague louise webster he studied mathematics and physics at the universities of oxford and rochester in 1962 he took an eight week summer residential course supporting researchers at the royal greenwich observatory in herstmonceux and at the end was offered a post by the astronomer royal richard woolley he left to study a phd at rochester and returned to the rgo in 1970 as a research fellow during his three year contract there he wondered what he could contribute to find out about the provenance of powerful cosmic x ray sources that had recently been detected particularly cygnus x 1 after he had made unsuccessful searches for light variations and unusual spectra among the hundreds of stars within the area of positional uncertainty of the x ray source a radio star was found that was coincident with a star hde226868 he decided with louise webster to investigate whether the star was a binary star possibly with one of the pair being the x ray source as well as a radio source but not being visible they measured the doppler shift to find that hde226868 was

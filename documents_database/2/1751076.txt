since then analysis of tooth specimens dated to 7 2 million years ago has led to suggestions that graecopithecus may have been the oldest direct ancestor of humans excluding the chimpanzee lineage or alternatively the last common ancestor of both humans and chimpanzees the creature was nicknamed el graeco by scientists the original graecopithecus specimen mandible was found in 1944 reportedly unearthed as the occupying german forces were building a wartime bunker the mandible with a third molar that is very worn the root of a second molar and a fragment of a premolar is from a site called pyrgos vassilissis northwest of athens and is dated from the late miocene excavation of the site is not possible as of 1986 due to the owner having built a swimming pool on the location an examination of the detailed morphology of molar teeth from two fossils of g freybergi published in 2017 suggests that it was a homininan sharing ancestry with homo but not with the chimpanzees pan this would call into question the prevailing belief that pre human hominids originated in africa though others are sceptical of the claims the species was found to be some two hundred thousand years

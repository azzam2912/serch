this form also occurs naturally as the rare mineral mitscherlichite the compound is also called potassium tetrachlorocuprate ii dipotassium tetrachlorocuprate potassium copper ii tetrachloride potassium cupric chloride and other similar names the dihydrate occurs rarely in nature near volcanic vents e g in mount vesuvius as the mineral mitscherlichite which is named in honor of eilhardt mitscherlich 1794 1863 the german crystallographer and chemist who first synthesized the compound it was identified as pigment in some ancient artifacts the dihydrate can be obtained by slow evaporation of a solution of potassium chloride and copper ii chloride in 2 1 molar ratio the crystal structure of the dihydrate was partially determined in 1927 by hendricks and dickinson and refined in 1934 by chrobak the structure is tetragonal p4 mnm 136 z 2 isostructural with ammonium tetrachoridocuprate ii 2 and rubidium tetrachoridocuprate ii 2 each copper atom is immediately surrounded by two oxygen atoms and four chlorine atoms forming a hydrated tetrachloridocuprate ii anion two of the chlorine atoms are about 0 75 angstroms further away than the other two each potassium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms four copper atoms and eight chlorine atoms the anhydrous compound was reported in

the greater the access the cryptanalyst has to the system the more useful information he can get to utilize for breaking the cypher in cryptography a sending party uses a cipher to encrypt transform a secret plaintext into a ciphertext which is sent over an insecure communication channel to the receiving party the receiving party uses an inverse cipher to decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the plaintext a secret knowledge is required to apply the inverse cipher to the ciphertext this secret knowledge is usually a short number or string called a key in a cryptographic attack a third party cryptanalyst analyzes the ciphertext to try to break the cipher to read the plaintext and obtain the key so that future enciphered messages can be read it is usually assumed that the encryption and decryption algorithms themselves are public knowledge and available to the cryptographer as this is the case for modern ciphers which are published openly this assumption is called kerckhoffs s principle some common attack models are different attack models are used for other cryptographic primitives or more generally for all kind of security systems examples for such attack models are

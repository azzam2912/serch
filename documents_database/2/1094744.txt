it is exposed along a nearly continuous east west passage for and changes in stratigraphic thickness from 1 to 2 5 kilometers the formation is a rare alkaline suite that formed as a result of submarine rifting during the paleoproterozoic period the bravo lake formation is surprisingly undeformed by the himalayan scale forming event during the trans hudsonian orogeny the stratigraphy of the bravo lake formation starts with a basic section of iron oxide rich sandstones psammites and semi pelites which cover a series of deformed pillow lavas which expand in viscosity towards the west and volcanic clastic deposits and ultramafic sills the lower volcanic section is covered by garnet and diopside bearing calc silicate layers and finely layered metasediments composed of coarse grained actinolite hornblende and biotite followed by pelites and semi pelites that are intruded by separate sills in the ridge lake area the volcanic belt includes an interlayered series of amphibolite gabbro iron formation sulfidic schist and metasediments geochemical results of pillow lavas and chill boundaries along five transects across the volcanic belt suggest the existence of three chemically different magma types within the bravo lake formation lavas of the volcanic belt display geochemical characteristics similar to

lag3 which was discovered in 1990 and was designated cd223 cluster of differentiation 223 after the seventh human leucocyte differentiation antigen workshop in 2000 is a cell surface molecule with diverse biologic effects on t cell function it is an immune checkpoint receptor and as such is the target of various drug development programs by pharmaceutical companies seeking to develop new treatments for cancer and autoimmune disorders in soluble form it is also being developed as a cancer drug in its own right the lag3 gene contains 8 exons the sequence data exon intron organization and chromosomal localization all indicate a close relationship of lag3 to cd4 the gene for lag 3 lies adjacent to the gene for cd4 on human chromosome 12 12p13 and is approximately 20 identical to the cd4 gene the lag3 protein which belongs to immunoglobulin ig superfamily comprises a 503 amino acid type i transmembrane protein with four extracellular ig like domains designated d1 to d4 when human lag 3 was cloned in 1990 it was found to have approx 70 homology with murine lag3 the homology of pig lag3 is 78 lag 3 is expressed on activated t cells natural killer cells b cells

specifically if x and y are pointed spaces i e topological spaces with distinguished basepoints x and y the wedge sum of x and y is the quotient space of the disjoint union of x and y by the identification x y where is the equivalence closure of the relation x y more generally suppose x is a family of pointed spaces with basepoints p the wedge sum of the family is given by where is the equivalence closure of the relation p p i j i in other words the wedge sum is the joining of several spaces at a single point this definition is sensitive to the choice of the basepoints p unless the spaces x are homogeneous the wedge sum is again a pointed space and the binary operation is associative and commutative up to homeomorphism sometimes the wedge sum is called the wedge product but this is not the same concept as the exterior product which is also often called the wedge product the wedge sum of two circles is homeomorphic to a figure eight space the wedge sum of n circles is often called a bouquet of circles while a wedge product of arbitrary spheres

when an oil spill affects penguins they have in the past been sometimes dressed in knitted sweaters supposedly to stop them from poisoning themselves by ingesting the oil during preening and to keep them warm since the spilled oil destroys their natural oils the sweaters are removed and discarded as soon as the penguins can be washed the project originated with the phillip island nature park oil spill of january 2000 and was successfully completed but the knitting pattern and call for volunteers to donate remained available online instead of the 100 or so sweaters needed thousands were sent the extra sweaters were stockpiled by the tasmanian conservation trust as of 2014 the australia based penguin foundation is still accepting handmade sweaters but no longer uses these for penguin rehabilitation instead these sweaters are used to dress toy penguins which are then sold to raise money for the foundation after a 2011 oil spill in new zealand a local yarn shop put out the call for penguin jumpers and supplied a pattern jumpers were received from all over the world however those cleaning and rehabilitating the penguins affected said they neither used nor requested the jumpers heat lamps were used

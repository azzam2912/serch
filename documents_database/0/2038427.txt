due to which the fluid with lower density is always above the fluid with higher density stratified flows are very common such as the earth s ocean and its atmosphere a stratified fluid may be defined as the fluid with density variations in the vertical direction for example air and water both are fluids and if we consider them together then they can be seen as a stratified fluid system density variations in the atmosphere profoundly affect the motion of water and air wave phenomena in air flow over the mountains and occurrence of smog are the examples of stratification effect in the atmosphere when a fluid system having a condition in which fluid density decreases with height is disturbed then the gravity and friction restore the undisturbed conditions if however the fluid tends to be stable if density decreases with height it is known that the sub critical flow of a stratified fluid past a barrier produce motions upstream of the barrier sub critical flow may be defined as a flow for which the froude number based on channel height is less than 1 so that one or more stationary lee waves would be present some of the upstream

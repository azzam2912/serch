by means of carrier aggregation an lte advanced or umts hsdpa base station could use this spectrum to provide additional bandwidth for communications from the base station to the mobile device i e in the downlink direction the global positioning system carriers are in the l band centered at 1176 45 mhz l5 1227 60 mhz l2 1381 05 mhz l3 and 1575 42 mhz l1 frequencies l band waves are used for gps units because they are able to penetrate clouds fog rain storms and vegetation only dense environments such as heavy forest canopies or concrete buildings can cause gps units to receive data inaccurately the galileo navigation system the glonass system and the beidou system uses the l band similar to gps although the frequency ranges are named differently modern receivers such as those found in smartphones are able to take advantage of multiple systems usually only around the oldest l1 band at the same time mobile phones operate at 800 900 and 1700 2100 mhz iridium communications satellite phones use frequencies between 1616 and 1626 5 mhz to communicate with the satellites inmarsat and lightsquared terminals use frequencies between 1525 and 1646 5 mhz thuraya satellite phones

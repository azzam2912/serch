both analog and stepped movement quartz clocks use the lavet type stepping motor see quartz clock through miniaturization it can be used in wristwatches and requires very little power making a battery last for many years the french engineer marius lavet is known as the inventor for this kind of drives and described it in 1936 in his patent application fr823395 like other single phase motors the lavet motor is only able to turn in one direction which depends on the geometry of its stator the rotor is a permanent magnet the motor can be built with a strong magnet and large stator to deliver high torque but it is mostly built small to drive the load through a low gear ratio the stator core looks a lot like one in a shaded pole motor and defines the rotational direction according to the position of holes grooves or shade windings through the stator however unlike a shaded pole motor the grooves are at backward positions and the positions where the rotor settles after each cycle are well determined which is not the case for induction motors in general where slip and load affect the angle that the rotor turns each

it was devised in 1804 by john leslie 1766 1832 a scottish mathematician and physicist in the version of the experiment described by john tyndall in the late 1800s one of the cube s vertical sides is coated with a layer of gold another with a layer of silver a third with a layer of copper while the fourth side is coated with a varnish of isinglass the cube is made from a solid block of metal with a central cavity in use the cavity was filled with hot water the entire cube has essentially the same temperature as the water the thermal detector on the far right in the figure showed much greater emission from the side with varnish than from any of the other three sides a modern version of leslie s cube is part of the structure of a small earth orbiting satellite known as funcube 1 and registered as a dutch spacecraft launched in november 2013 it demonstrates the absorption and emission of solar radiation in space as the satellite orbits in full sunlight eclipse and rotates around its three axes

it was written by singer david coverdale and guitarist adrian vandenberg the power ballad follows an alternately slow fast paced rhythm and the lyrics tell about longing for the woman after a break up now you re gone was released as the third and final single from slip of the tongue remixed by chris lord alge while it was a top 40 chart success in the uk it barely made it onto billboard hot 100 in the us a music video was shot in 1990 in the afternoon before and during a live show in philadelphia to promote the single the video was directed by wayne isham and features the band playing the song on stage with footage of the fans interspersed with shots from the concert in the booklet of the 20th anniversary edition of slip of the tongue david coverdale commented i remember shooting the video with wayne isham in front of a sold out crowd at the spectrum in philadelphia unfortunately it received minimal airplay as mtv was changing its format still i think it s one of the best videos we ve done all tracks written by david coverdale and adrian vandenberg

thus the n limit tonality diamond limit here is in the sense of odd limit not prime limit is an arrangement in diamond shape of the set of rational numbers r formula 1 such that the odd part of both the numerator and the denominator of r when reduced to lowest terms is less than or equal to the fixed odd number n equivalently the diamond may be considered as a set of pitch classes where a pitch class is an equivalence class of pitches under octave equivalence the tonality diamond is often regarded as comprising the set of consonances of the n limit although originally invented by max friedrich meyer the tonality diamond is now most associated with harry partch many theorists of just intonation consider the tonality diamond partch s greatest contribution to microtonal theory partch arranged the elements of the tonality diamond in the shape of a rhombus and subdivided into n 1 4 smaller rhombuses along the upper left side of the rhombus are placed the odd numbers from 1 to n each reduced to the octave divided by the minimum power of 2 such that formula 1 these intervals are then arranged in ascending order

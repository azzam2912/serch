there exists no clear definition of a wimp but broadly a wimp is a new elementary particle which interacts via gravity and any other force or forces potentially not part of the standard model itself which is as weak as or weaker than the weak nuclear force but also non vanishing in its strength many wimp candidates are expected to have been produced thermally in the early universe similarly to the particles of the standard model according to big bang cosmology and usually will constitute cold dark matter obtaining the correct abundance of dark matter today via thermal production requires a self annihilation cross section of formula 1 which is roughly what is expected for a new particle in the 100 gev mass range that interacts via the electroweak force because supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of particle physics readily predict a new particle with these properties this apparent coincidence is known as the wimp miracle and a stable supersymmetric partner has long been a prime wimp candidate however recent null results from direct detection experiments along with the failure to produce evidence of supersymmetry in the large hadron collider lhc experiment has cast doubt on the simplest wimp

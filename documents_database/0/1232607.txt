225 bce it most notably details how to find the surface area of a sphere and the volume of the contained ball and the analogous values for a cylinder and was the first to do so the principal formulae derived in on the sphere and cylinder are those mentioned above the surface area of the sphere the volume of the contained ball and surface area and volume of the cylinder in his work archimedes showed that the surface area of a cylinder is equal to and that the volume of the same is on the sphere he showed that the surface area is four times the area of its great circle in modern terms this means that the surface area is equal to the result for the volume of the contained ball stated that it is two thirds the volume of a circumscribed cylinder meaning that the volume is archimedes was particularly proud of this latter result and so he asked for a sketch of a sphere inscribed in a cylinder to be inscribed on his grave since h 2 r he had shown that both the volume and the surface area of the sphere were two thirds that of

they are known from fossil remains found throughout the late cretaceous period of north america though only one species ichthyornis dispar is represented by complete enough fossils to have been named ichthyornitheans became extinct at the cretaceous paleogene boundary along with enantiornitheans all other non avian dinosaurs and many other animal and plant groups the earliest known ichthyornitheans appear in the fossil record about 95 million years ago during the cenomanian age of the late cretaceous based on fragmentary fossil remains the two known species present in the ashville formation have not been given names but overall were very similar to ichthyornis dispar i dispar itself had a very long temporal range and specimens referred to it or very similar species existed relatively unchanged other than some fluctuations in average adult size for nearly 10 million years when species referable to i dispar disappeared and were replaced by other though still somewhat similar species of ichthyornitheans the fact that ichthyornitheans appear to have existed virtually unchanged in their general size and anatomy for nearly the entire duration of the late cretaceous period suggests that their evolutionary pace was in relative stasis compared to other contemporary species of closely related avialans

the members of the set are called symbols and are typically thought of as representing letters characters or digits for example a common alphabet is 0 1 the binary alphabet and a binary string is a string drawn from the alphabet 0 1 an infinite sequence of letters may be constructed from elements of an alphabet as well if l is a formal language i e a possibly infinite set of finite length strings the alphabet of l is the set of all symbols that may occur in any string in l for example if l is the set of all variable identifiers in the programming language c l s alphabet is the set a b c x y z a b c x y z 0 1 2 7 8 9 given an alphabet formula 1 the set of all strings of length formula 2 over the alphabet formula 1 is indicated by formula 4 the set formula 5 of all finite strings regardless of their length is indicated by the kleene star operator as formula 6 and is also called the kleene closure of formula 1 the notation formula 8 indicates the set of all infinite sequences over

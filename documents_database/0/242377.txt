most viruses have the capability to use host enzymes or their own replication machinery to independently replicate their own viral rna satellite viruses in contrast are completely dependent on a helper virus for replication the symbiotic relationship between a satellite and a helper virus to catalyze the replication of a satellite viral genome is also dependent on the host to provide components like replicases to carry out replication a satellite virus of mamavirus that inhibits the replication of its host has been termed a virophage however the usage of this term remains controversial due to the lack of fundamental differences between virophages and classical satellite viruses the genomes of satellite viruses range upward from 359 nucleotides in length for satellite tobacco ringspot virus rna stobrv satellite viral particles should not be confused with satellite dna the tobacco necrosis virus was the virus that lead to the discovery of the first satellite virus in 1962 scientists discovered that the first satellite had the components to make its own protein shell a few years later in 1969 scientists discovered another symbiotic relationship with the tobacco ringspot neopvirus tobrv and another satellite virus the emergence of satellite rna is said to have come

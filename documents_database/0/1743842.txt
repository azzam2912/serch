one of his most notable discoveries was finding how histones control gene activity bonner was professor and professor emeritus of biology at the california institute of technology bonner was born in ansley nebraska in 1910 he graduated from the university of utah in 1931 with b a degree in chemistry and mathematics he received the ph d in biology at california institute of technology in 1934 bonner spent the year after his phd in europe on a national research council fellowship at utrecht leiden and eth in zurich he was a postdoctoral fellow at california institute of technology after his return from europe then joined the faculty in 1936 early in his career he invented a method for collecting rubber tree exudate natural rubber that greatly improved the efficiency of the process he also invented a mechanical method for harvesting oranges he studied the timing of processes in plants in the dawn of molecular biology in the 1960s his interest turned to gene expression in particular the regulation of production of rna from genes experiments in his laboratory in collaboration with his postdoctoral fellow ru chih c huang showed that histone a protein associated with the genes shuts off gene

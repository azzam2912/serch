a capacitor bank delivers a pulse of high current across two electrodes which are positioned a short distance apart while submerged in a fluid water or oil the electric arc discharge rapidly vaporizes the surrounding fluid creating a shock wave the workpiece which is kept in contact with the fluid is deformed into an evacuated die the potential forming capabilities of submerged arc discharge processes were recognized as early as the mid 1940s yutkin l a during the 1950s and early 1960s the basic process was developed into production systems this work principally was by and for the aerospace industries by 1970 forming machines based on submerged arc discharge were available from machine tool builders a few of the larger aerospace fabricators built machines of their own design to meet specific part fabrication requirements electrohydraulic forming ehf is based on the ultra high speed deformation of metal using shockwaves in water using the discharge of current from a capacitor bank an electric arc is generated in water between two electrodes this electric arc vaporizes the surrounding water converting electrical energy into an intense shockwave of mechanical energy the shockwave simultaneously transforms the metal workpiece into a visco plastic state and

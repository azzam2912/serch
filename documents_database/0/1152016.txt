the prototype cc 7000 7001 7002 were built in 1949 and the production series locomotives cc 7101 cc 7158 followed during 1952 1955 two of the class are notable for setting world rail speed records cc 7121 reaching on 21 february 1954 and cc 7107 reaching on 28 29 march 1955 the cc 7100 class were the first sncf high speed locomotives in which all the axles were motorized as delivered their top speed was during the 1950s sncf s experimental investigations into high speed rail saw some cc 7100 class locomotives specially modified for operation at speeds far higher than their regular service speed these experiments provided valuable test data for the sncf to develop increasingly more rapid regular services including the mistral of 1967 and ultimately the tgv cc 7121 broke the rail speed record when it achieved on the plm mainline between dijon and beaune on 21 february 1954 preparations for further high speed tests proceeded and in march 1955 cc 7107 and bo bo locomotive bb 9004 both attained on separate high speed runs between bordeaux and dax landes cc 7107 hauled a three car train with streamlining modifications to reduce aerodynamic drag although the rail

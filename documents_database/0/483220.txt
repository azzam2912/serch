all selectins are single chain transmembrane glycoproteins that share similar properties to c type lectins due to a related amino terminus and calcium dependent binding selectins bind to sugar moieties and so are considered to be a type of lectin cell adhesion proteins that bind sugar polymers all three known members of the selectin family l e and p selectin share a similar cassette structure an n terminal calcium dependent lectin domain an epidermal growth factor egf like domain a variable number of consensus repeat units 2 6 and 9 for l e and p selectin respectively a transmembrane domain tm and an intracellular cytoplasmic tail cyto the transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts are not conserved across the selectins being responsible for their targeting to different compartments though they share common elements their tissue distribution and binding kinetics are quite different reflecting their divergent roles in various pathophysiological processes there are three subsets of selectins l selectin is the smallest of the vascular selectins expressed on all granulocytes and monocytes and on most lymphocytes can be found in most leukocytes p selectin the largest selectin is stored in granules of platelets and in weibel palade bodies of endothelial cells and is

andreev is a type of particle scattering which occurs at interfaces between a superconductor s and a normal state material n it is a charge transfer process by which normal current in n is converted to supercurrent in s each andreev reflection transfers a charge 2e across the interface avoiding the forbidden single particle transmission within the superconducting energy gap the process involves an electron hole incident on the interface from the normal state material at energies less than the superconducting energy gap the incident electron hole forms a cooper pair in the superconductor with the retroreflection of a hole electron of opposite spin and velocity but equal momentum to the incident electron hole as seen in the figure the barrier transparency is assumed to be high with no oxide or tunnel layer which reduces instances of normal electron electron or hole hole scattering at the interface since the pair consists of an up and down spin electron a second electron hole of opposite spin to the incident electron hole from the normal state forms the pair in the superconductor and hence the retroreflected hole electron through time reversal symmetry the process with an incident electron will also work with

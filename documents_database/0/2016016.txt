originally applied to the refining of iron into steel with most installations in the 1960s the process is 2014 used primarily to refine non ferrous metals typically copper in that field it is often named tbrc or top blown rotary converter the name kaldo is derived from prof bo kalling and from the domnarvets jernverk stora kopparbergs bergslag subsidiary both key in the development of the process research into the use of a stirring to promote mixing and therefor rate of conversion was investigated from the 1940s and investigations into the use of oxygen began c 1948 the feedstock at the domnarvet works had a phosphorus content of 1 8 2 0 and so the process was developed with one aim being dephosphorisation the first production unit was installed in 1954 at domnarvet jernverk the converter was a top blow oxygen converter similar to linz donawitz type using a cylindrical vessel the vessel was tilted whilst conversion took place with typical rotation speeds of around 30 revolutions per minute the oxygen was injected via a lance with slag forming materials added separately kaldo converters were relatively common in the 1960s in the united kingdom during the transition from predominately open

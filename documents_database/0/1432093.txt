this rise is superimposed upon the late night rise in cortisol which occurs before awakening while its purpose is uncertain it may be linked to the hippocampus preparation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis hpa in order to face anticipated stress shortly after awakening a sharp 38 75 average 50 increase occurs in the blood level of cortisol in about 77 of healthy people of all ages the average level of salivary cortisol upon waking is roughly 15 nmol l 30 minutes later it may be 23 nmol l though there are wide variations the cortisol awakening response reaches a maximum approximately 30 minutes after awakening though it may still be heightened by 34 an hour after waking the pattern of this response to waking is relatively stable for any individual twin studies show its pattern is largely genetically determined since there is a heritability of 0 40 for the mean cortisol increase after awakening and 0 48 for the area under the cortisol rise curve normally the highest cortisol secretion happens in the second half of the night with peak cortisol production occurring in the early morning following this cortisol levels decline throughout the day with lowest levels during

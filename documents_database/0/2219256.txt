it is part of the ktx6 subfamily and exerts its effects by inhibiting voltage gated potassium channels specifically kv1 2 and kv1 3 spinoxin is isolated from the venom of the malaysian black scorpion h spinifer from which the toxin gets its name researchers first characterized it in 2003 spinoxin is a peptide neurotoxin consisting of 34 amino acid residues it has a molecular weight of 3 7 kda all members of the ktx subfamily share a common cysteine stabilized motif cs in spinoxin the n terminal contains the helix whereas the c terminal contains the region sheet which is involved in the binding to the potassium channel resulting in blocking of the channel four disulfide bridges connect these terminals stabilizing the small protein the pattern of spinoxin disulfide bonding has been determined to be cys1 cys5 cys2 cys6 cys3 cys7 and cys4 cys8 a 3d model of spinoxin can be viewed on this website spinoxin belongs to the class of small proteins with knottin folds resulting from the four disulfide bonds the superfamily spinoxin is part of is known as scorpion toxin like and its family as short chain scorpion toxins spinoxin has 82 sequence homology with maurotoxin mtx

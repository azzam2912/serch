the criteria used and whether metalloids are included vary depending on the author and context in metallurgy for example a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number while a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour more specific definitions have been published but none of these have been widely accepted the definitions surveyed in this article encompass up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical elements only mercury lead and bismuth meet all of them despite this lack of agreement the term plural or singular is widely used in science a density of more than 5 g cm is sometimes quoted as a commonly used criterion and is used in the body of this article the earliest known metals common metals such as iron copper and tin and precious metals such as silver gold and platinum are heavy metals from 1809 onward light metals such as magnesium aluminium and titanium were discovered as well as less well known heavy metals including gallium thallium and hafnium some heavy metals are either essential nutrients typically iron cobalt and zinc or relatively harmless such as ruthenium silver

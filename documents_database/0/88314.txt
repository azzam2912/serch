it is capable of acting independently of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems although it may be influenced by them the ens is also called the second brain it is derived from neural crest cells the enteric nervous system is capable of operating independently of the brain and spinal cord but does rely on innervation from the autonomic nervous system via the vagus nerve and prevertebral ganglia in healthy subjects however studies have shown that the system is operable with a severed vagus nerve the neurons of the enteric nervous system control the motor functions of the system in addition to the secretion of gastrointestinal enzymes these neurons communicate through many neurotransmitters similar to the cns including acetylcholine dopamine and serotonin the large presence of serotonin and dopamine in the gut are key areas of research for neurogastroenterologists the enteric nervous system in humans consists of some 500 million neurons including the various types of dogiel cells 0 5 of the number of neurons in the brain five times as many as the one hundred million neurons in the human spinal cord and about 2 3 as many as in the whole nervous system of a cat the enteric nervous

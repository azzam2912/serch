with about 95 species this group displays its largest species richness in the indo pacific they are found in coral reefs rocky coasts and seagrass beds and can play a significant role in bioerosion parrotfish are named for their dentition which is distinct from other fish including other labrids their numerous teeth are arranged in a tightly packed mosaic on the external surface of their jaw bones forming a parrot like beak with which they rasp algae from coral and other rocky substrates which contributes to the process of bioerosion maximum sizes vary within the family with the majority of species reaching in length however a few species reach lengths in excess of and the green humphead parrotfish can reach up to the smallest species is the bluelip parrotfish cryptotomus roseus which has a maximum size of some parrotfish species including the queen parrotfish scarus vetula secrete a mucus cocoon particularly at night prior to going to sleep some species extrude mucus from their mouths forming a protective cocoon that envelops the fish presumably hiding its scent from potential predators this mucus envelope may also act as an early warning system allowing the parrotfish to flee when it detects predators

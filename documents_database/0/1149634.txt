the system was composed of a ground transceiver designed by captain bert lane and an air transceiver designed by major hobday both of the royal signals the ground set which was to be used by agents on the ground weighed about 15 lbs including batteries and was typically worn attached to its operator with two canvas straps it was a highly directional unit which required the operator to face the path of the aircraft it had the useful trait that transmitted signals could not be picked up by ground monitoring stations more than one mile distant however its signal was only good to 10 000 ft which brought the aircraft within range of flak it permitted direct two way voice communication with an aircraft up to a range of 30 miles while the s phone provided directional information to the pilot it gave no range information although a pilot could tell when he was directly over the ground operator because at that point no communication was possible the primary purpose of the s phone was not navigational as such rather it was to provide a reasonably secure channel for coded conversation between staff officers based in london and agents in

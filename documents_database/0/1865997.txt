its main function is to cut dna and therefore it can alter a cell s genome more technically cas9 is an rna guided dna endonuclease enzyme associated with the crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats adaptive immunity system in streptococcus pyogenes s pyogenes utilizes cas9 to memorize and later interrogate and cleave foreign dna such as invading bacteriophage dna or plasmid dna cas9 performs this interrogation by unwinding foreign dna and checking for sites complementary to the 20 basepair spacer region of the guide rna if the dna substrate is complementary to the guide rna cas9 cleaves the invading dna in this sense the crispr cas9 mechanism has a number of parallels with the rna interference rnai mechanism in eukaryotes apart from its original function in bacterial immunity the cas9 protein has been heavily utilized as a genome engineering tool to induce site directed double strand breaks in dna these breaks can lead to gene inactivation or the introduction of heterologous genes through non homologous end joining and homologous recombination respectively in many laboratory model organisms alongside zinc finger nucleases and talen proteins cas9 is becoming a prominent tool in the field of genome editing cas9 has gained traction

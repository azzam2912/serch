it was designed by ibm and was produced using a 45 nm silicon on insulator process the espresso chip resides together with a gpu from amd on a mcm manufactured by renesas it was revealed at e3 2011 in june 2011 and released in november 2012 ibm and nintendo have revealed that the espresso processor is a powerpc based microprocessor with three cores on a single chip to reduce power consumption and increase speed the cpu and the graphics processor are placed on a single substrate as a multi chip module mcm to reduce complexity increase the communication speed between the chips further reduce power consumption and reduce cost and space required the two chips were assembled to the complete mcm by renesas in japan espresso itself was manufactured by ibm in its 300 mm plant in east fishkill new york using 45 nm soi technology and embedded dram edram for caches while unverified by nintendo hackers teardowns and unofficial informants have since revealed more information about the espresso such as its name size and speed the microarchitecture seems to be quite similar to its predecessors the broadway and gekko i e powerpc 750 based but enhanced with larger and

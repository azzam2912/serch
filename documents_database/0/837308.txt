the family is often referred to as the 8xc196 family or 80196 the most popular mcu in the family these mcus are commonly used in hard disk drives modems printers pattern recognition and motor control in 2007 intel announced the discontinuance of the entire mcs 96 family of microcontrollers intel noted that there are no direct replacements for these components and a redesign will most likely be necessary the mcs 96 family originated as a commercial derivative of the intel 8061 the first processor in the ford eec iv engine controller family differences between the 8061 and the 8096 include the memory interface bus the 8061 s m bus being a burst mode bus requiring a tracking program counter in the memory devices there were also considerable differences in the i o peripherals of the two parts the 8061 had 8 hsi pulse measurement inputs 10 hso pulse generation outputs entirely separated from the hsi pins and a non sampling 10 bit adc with more channels than the 8096 had many differences between the eec iv and the 8096 resulted from an effort to share pins to reduce i o pin count in favor of using the pins for a

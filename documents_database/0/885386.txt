precisely in the case of nucleophilic attack at a carbonyl it is defined as the nu c o bond angle where nu is the atom of the nucleophile forming the bond with the carbon atom the angle was named after crystallographers hans beat b rgi and jack d dunitz its first senior investigators the second angle defining the geometry describes the offset of the nucleophile s approach toward one of the two substituents attached to the carbonyl carbon or other electrophilic center and was named the flippin lodge angle by clayton heathcock after his contributing collaborators lee a flippin and eric p lodge these angles are generally best construed to mean the angle observed or measured for a given system and not the historically observed value range for the original b rgi dunitz aminoketones or an idealized value computed for a particular system such as hydride addition to formaldehyde image at left i e the bd and fl angles of the hydride formadehyde system have one pair of values while the angles observed for other systems are expected to vary the bd angle adopted during an approach by a nucleophile to a trigonal unsaturated electrophile depends primarily on the molecular

these visual illusions are of particular interest to researchers because they may provide valuable insights in regard to the workings of human visual systems an object of low contrast visual texture surrounded by a field of uniform visual texture appears to have higher contrast than when presented on a field of high contrast texture this illusion was observed by charles chubb and colleagues and published in 1989 an empirical explanation of the chubb illusion was published by lotto and purves in 2001 chubb and his colleagues researched this illusion by showing various combinations of foreground objects and background fields to human test subjects and asking them to rate the sharpness of the visual contrast in each foreground object they found that subjects viewing a patch of random visual texture embedded in a surrounding background field were likely to report different perceptions of visual contrast for the central target patch depending on the relative contrast of the background field furthermore the apparent brightness dullness of a texture patch varied as the background varied e g bright points of texture patch appeared duller in a high contrast background whereas dark points appeared lighter in an even background this apparent variance in perception

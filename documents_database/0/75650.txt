it can be used for signal processing statistical analysis image enhancement fluid dynamics simulations numerical optimization and modeling simulation of explicit and implicit dynamical systems and if the corresponding toolbox is installed symbolic manipulations scilab is one of the two major open source alternatives to matlab the other one being gnu octave scilab puts less emphasis on syntactic compatibility with matlab than octave does but it is similar enough that some authors suggest that it is easy to transfer skills between the two systems scilab is a high level numerically oriented programming language the language provides an interpreted programming environment with matrices as the main data type by using matrix based computation dynamic typing and automatic memory management many numerical problems may be expressed in a reduced number of code lines as compared to similar solutions using traditional languages such as fortran c or c this allows users to rapidly construct models for a range of mathematical problems while the language provides simple matrix operations such as multiplication the scilab package also provides a library of high level operations such as correlation and complex multidimensional arithmetic the software can be used for signal processing statistical analysis image enhancement fluid dynamics

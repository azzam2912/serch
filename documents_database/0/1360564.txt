the form of the law can depend on the form in which one states the probability distribution of the random variable x if it is a discrete distribution and one knows its probability mass function but not then the expected value of g x is where the sum is over all possible values x of x if it is a continuous distribution and one knows its probability density function but not then the expected value of g x is if one knows the cumulative probability distribution function f but not f then the expected value of g x is given by a riemann stieltjes integral again assuming x is real valued this proposition is known as the law of the unconscious statistician because students have been accused of using the identity without realizing that it must be treated as the result of a rigorously proved theorem not merely a definition a similar property holds for joint distributions for discrete random variables x and y a function of two variables g and joint probability mass function f x y in the continuous case with f x y being the joint probability density function this law is not a trivial result of

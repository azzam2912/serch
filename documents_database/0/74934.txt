it first appeared in february 2002 on xeon server processors and in november 2002 on pentium 4 desktop cpus later intel included this technology in itanium atom and core i series cpus among others for each processor core that is physically present the operating system addresses two virtual logical cores and shares the workload between them when possible the main function of hyper threading is to increase the number of independent instructions in the pipeline it takes advantage of superscalar architecture in which multiple instructions operate on separate data in parallel with htt one physical core appears as two processors to the operating system allowing concurrent scheduling of two processes per core in addition two or more processes can use the same resources if resources for one process are not available then another process can continue if its resources are available in addition to requiring simultaneous multithreading smt support in the operating system hyper threading can be properly utilized only with an operating system specifically optimized for it furthermore intel recommends htt to be disabled when using operating systems unaware of this hardware feature hyper threading technology is a form of simultaneous multithreading technology introduced by intel while the concept

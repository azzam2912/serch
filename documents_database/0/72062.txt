it is committed by reasoning in the form which may also be phrased as arguments of this form are invalid informally this means that arguments of this form do not give good reason to establish their conclusions even if their premises are true the name denying the antecedent derives from the premise not p which denies the if clause of the conditional premise one way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with an example that has true premises but an obviously false conclusion for example that argument is intentionally bad but arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing as in the following example offered by alan turing in the article computing machinery and intelligence however men could still be machines that do not follow a definite set of rules thus this argument as turing intends is invalid it is possible that an argument that denies the antecedent could be valid if the argument instantiates some other valid form for example if the claims p and q express the same proposition then the argument would be trivially valid as it would beg the question in everyday discourse however such cases are rare typically only occurring

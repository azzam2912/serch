he originally intended for the song to be recorded by king floyd but floyd never recorded it instead tex recorded it himself in the late 1960s but did not release it at that time he decided to re record the song in late 1971 and released it as the b side of a mother s prayer the first single off his 1972 album that was also titled i gotcha the song i gotcha has the singer demanding physical affection from a woman because he claims she promised she would get together with him when she broke up with her boyfriend radio djs ended up playing the b side more than the a side this would result in tex having his first major hit in five years as i gotcha eventually peaked at number 1 on the r b chart and number 2 on the pop chart for two weeks behind the first time ever i saw your face by roberta flack and would sell around three million copies billboard ranked it as the no 6 song of 1972 tex would later re record i gotcha again this time in more of a ballad style for inclusion on his 1978 album

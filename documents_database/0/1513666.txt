newer immunosignature work is run on wafers made of silicon dioxide with each wafer cut into standard slide size and spotted with 330 034 peptides however further description will focus on the glass slide experiments these random sequence peptides 20 amino acids long are chemically attached to the slides of the 20 amino acid length 3 amino acids at the c terminus side of the peptide are common to each peptide spot this 3 amino acid segment is used as the linker by which the 17 amino acid chain 17 mer is attached to the slide the 17 mer is the random peptide with a random sequence selected by the use of a random number generator this randomness makes the immunosignature technology different from existing technology to identify disease states via biomarkers because the 10 000 unique random peptides per slide are not specifically selected for containing particular sequences the random sequences are not selected for containing known epitopes or antibody binding sites of pathogens when a sample of diluted blood serum containing antibodies is applied to the surface of the peptide microarray the 17 mers are long enough that there are multiple potential epitopes on each individual peptide antibodies

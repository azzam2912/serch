with textiles fabric is passed between calender rollers at high temperatures and pressures calendering is used on fabrics such as moire to produce its watered effect and also on cambric and some types of sateens in preparation for calendering the fabric is folded lengthwise with the front side or face inside and stitched together along the edges the fabric can be folded together at full width however this is not done as often as it is more difficult the fabric is then run through rollers that polish the surface and make the fabric smoother and more lustrous high temperatures and pressure are used as well fabrics that go through the calendering process feel thin glossy and papery the wash durability of a calendared finish on thermoplastic fibers like polyester is higher than on cellulose fibers such as cotton on blended fabrics such as polyester cotton the durability depends largely on the proportion of synthetic fiber component present as well as the amount and type of finishing additives used and the machinery and process conditions employed several different finishes can be achieved through the calendering process by varying different parts the main different types of finishes are beetling watered embossing and

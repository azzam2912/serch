it is the principal streptococcus found in the alimentary canal of a horse and makes up the majority of the bacterial flora in horse feces s equinus is seldom found in humans s equinus which is always abundant in the feces of horses was first isolated from the air in 1906 by andrewes and horder due to the presence of dried horse manure common in most cities at the time in 1910 winslow and palmer verified the findings of andrewes and horder and reported further findings in both cattle and human feces after the bacterium was discovered in 1906 the term streptococcus equinus became a convenient wastebasket into which nonhemolytic streptococci that do not ferment lactose and mannitol were categorized the classification of all streptococci that fail to ferment lactose into one large category has made the classification of s equinus very difficult however as shown to the left it is known that s equinus a nonenterococcal group d streptococcus is most closely related to the species s bovis in 2003 s bovis and s equinus were found to have a 99 16s rrna sequence similarity while particularly similar in phylogeny they differ in biochemical reactions and physiological characteristics the

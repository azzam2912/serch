the movement arose in response to an attempt to censor robin hood because it displayed communist ideals and eventually spread to universities across the nation the green feather movement came during the height of the red scare and mccarthyism in the united states following world war ii and the establishment of communist regimes abroad and the great depression after which many were disillusioned by capitalism americans were especially paranoid about possibly having communists in the country especially in the government so alleged communists were often tried and fired people like senator joseph mccarthy were able to capitalize on this widespread fear of communism to gain political power mccarthy claimed to have the names of more than 200 communists in the state department and he held a series of televised smear campaigns in order to rid the government of communists however his attempts to find communists were largely unsuccessful he ended up accusing the us army of containing communists leading to his downfall and irrelevance after his inquiry of the army starting in 1953 censorship was an important part of the red scare and containment of communism in the united states the film and music industries were especially censored as well

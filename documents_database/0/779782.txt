cryoablation is performed using hollow needles cryoprobes through which cooled thermally conductive fluids are circulated cryoprobes are positioned adjacent to the target in such a way that the freezing process will destroy the diseased tissue once the probes are in place the attached cryogenic freezing unit removes heat from cools the tip of the probe and by extension from the surrounding tissues ablation occurs in tissue that has been frozen by at least three mechanisms the most common application of cryoablation is to ablate solid tumors found in the lung liver breast kidney and prostate the use in prostate and renal cryoablation are the most common although sometimes applied in cryosurgery through laparoscopic or open surgical approaches most often cryoablation is performed percutaneously through the skin and into the target tissue containing the tumor by a medical specialist such as an interventional radiologist the term is from cryo ablation prostate cryoablation is moderately effective but as with any prostate removal process also can result in impotence prostate cryoablation is used in three patient categories cryoablation has been explored as an alternative to radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of moderate to severe pain in people with metastatic bone disease the area

the kakinada kotipalli branch line was first laid in 1928 but was removed in 1940 with the onset of world war ii the british rulers then ruling in india were facing shortage of steel and took away the tracks for use somewhere else the line was relaid at a cost of rs 67 crores 670 million it was formally opened in november 2004 however that was only a partly finished project the total project envisaged construction of two lines the first from kakinada to kotipalli and the second from kotipally to narsapur via amalapuram the 2001 02 estimates for the kotipalli narsapur line was rs 710 crores 7 1 billion the estimates are high because three bridges need to be constructed across three distributaries of the godavari first a bridge across the gautami between kotipalli and mukteswaram second a bridge across vainateya between bodasakurru and pasarlapudi and third across the vasista between narsapur and sakinetipally in the context of limited resources for funding projects in india it is a tall order and funds are coming only in trickles as for example rs 2 crores 20million spent in acquiring 110 acres of land obviously such a project had high profile backers

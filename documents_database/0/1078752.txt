the period of time taken by the drive to perform this process is referred to as its spin up time the average of which is reported by hard disks as a s m a r t attribute the required operational speed depends on the design of the disk drive typical speeds of hard disks have been 2400 3600 4200 5400 7200 10000 and 15000 revolutions per minute rpm achieving such speeds can require a significant portion of the available power budget of a computer system and so application of power to the disks must be carefully controlled operational speed of optical disc drives may vary depending on type of disc and mode of operation see constant linear velocity spin up of hard disks generally occurs at the very beginning of the computer boot process however most modern computers have the ability to stop a drive while the machine is already running as a means of energy conservation or noise reduction if a machine is running and requires access to a stopped drive then a delay is incurred while the drive is spun up it also depends on the type of mechanism used within a drive in the process of being

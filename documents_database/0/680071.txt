the acronym stands for programming language for nd computers compilers were developed by norsk data for several architectures including the motorola 68000 88000 x86 and the norsk data nord 10 minicomputer architecture and nd 500 superminicomputer the language was designed to be platform independent it was mainly used internally at norsk data for writing high level systems software such as the upper parts of the operating systems and compilers planc programs are structured into modules and routines a very simple example of a planc program is as follows a difference from popular programming languages is that the assignment operator goes from left to right first you compute the value then you store it compile time initialization of variables on the other hand went from right to left the assignment operator returns the stored value so you could store it multiple times 5 a b would store 5 into both the a and b variables it shares this direction with plankalk l algol 60 and mary another little known programming language developed in norway but also the popular c programming language a related distinct syntactic feature is that a function can be defined to take as input the computed value of

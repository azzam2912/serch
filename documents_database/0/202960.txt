viscous materials like water resist shear flow and strain linearly with time when a stress is applied elastic materials strain when stretched and immediately return to their original state once the stress is removed viscoelastic materials have elements of both of these properties and as such exhibit time dependent strain whereas elasticity is usually the result of bond stretching along crystallographic planes in an ordered solid viscosity is the result of the diffusion of atoms or molecules inside an amorphous material in the nineteenth century physicists such as maxwell boltzmann and kelvin researched and experimented with creep and recovery of glasses metals and rubbers viscoelasticity was further examined in the late twentieth century when synthetic polymers were engineered and used in a variety of applications viscoelasticity calculations depend heavily on the viscosity variable the inverse of is also known as fluidity the value of either can be derived as a function of temperature or as a given value i e for a dashpot depending on the change of strain rate versus stress inside a material the viscosity can be categorized as having a linear non linear or plastic response when a material exhibits a linear response it is categorized as

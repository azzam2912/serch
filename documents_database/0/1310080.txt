the theory was explained in alexander william bickerton s book the romance of the heavens published in 1901 it is not part of contemporary astrophysics in the romance of the heavens bickerton states that a slight grazing collision between stars would be much more common than a head on impact between stars so he believed this phenomenon needed to be explained to account for the appearance of bright new stars that would appear in the night sky and disappear within a year or even days the theory explains that when the two stellar bodies graze each other the grazed parts will shear off from the main body of each star their velocity will cancel each other s out transforming this energy into heat while the main mass of each star will continue moving as they did before the collision the third body created from the two sheared parts of the stars will form between the two original stars the temporary star expands after the impact displaying an intense increase in light after all molecular reactions have taken place the light is replaced by a hollow shell of gas or possibly a planetary nebula and eventually dissipates into space bickerton explains

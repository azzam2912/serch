the unqualified term cyclopentanepentol usually refers to this compound there are four distinct stereoisomers with this same structure the compound is a five fold alcohol of cyclopentane and technically a cyclic sugar alcohol a cyclitol however it is very rarely found in nature and therefore it has received much less attention than the ubiquitous six carbon version inositol there are four distinct stereoisomers of cyclopentane 1 2 3 4 5 pentol distinguished by the position of the hydroxyls relative to the mean plane of the ring all have a plane of symmetry and therefore are not chiral one naming convention for the isomers labels each carbon number 1 5 with for the side of the ring plane with most hydroxyls three or more and for the other side another convention lists the hydroxyls on the majority side and then those on the minority side with the two groups separated by a slash and a 0 is written when the second list would be empty the four possible isomers are the last three isomers interconvert by heating them at about 104 c with 95 acetic acid in the presence of a strong acid the conversion between 1 2 3 4 5

the different bacterial species that are capable of acetogenesis are collectively termed acetogens some acetogens can synthesize acetate autotrophically from carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas in 1932 organisms were discovered that could convert hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide into acetic acid the first acetogenic bacterium species clostridium aceticum was discovered in 1936 by klaas tammo wieringa a second species moorella thermoacetica attracted wide interest when it was first isolated because of its ability to convert glucose into three moles of acetic acid the precursor to acetic acid is the thioester acetyl coa the key aspects of the acetogenic pathway are several reactions that include the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and the attachment of the carbon monoxide to a methyl group the first process is catalyzed by enzymes called carbon monoxide dehydrogenase the coupling of the methyl group provided by methylcobalamin and the co is catalyzed by acetyl coa synthetase the unique metabolism of acetogens has significance in biotechnological uses in carbohydrate fermentations the decarboxylation reactions involved result in the loss of carbon into carbon dioxide this loss is an issue with an increased requirement of minimization of co emissions as well as successful competition for fossil fuels

it is a generalization of the cram r rao bound compared to the cram r rao bound it is both tighter and applicable to a wider range of problems however it is usually more difficult to compute the bound was independently discovered by john hammersley in 1950 and by douglas chapman and herbert robbins in 1951 let be an unknown deterministic parameter and let be a random variable interpreted as a measurement of suppose the probability density function of x is given by p x it is assumed that p x is well defined and that for all values of x and suppose x is an unbiased estimate of an arbitrary scalar function of i e the chapman robbins bound then states that note that the denominator in the lower bound above is exactly the formula 3 divergence of formula 4 with respect to formula 5 the expression inside the supremum in the chapman robbins bound converges to the cram r rao bound when assuming the regularity conditions of the cram r rao bound hold this implies that when both bounds exist the chapman robbins version is always at least as tight as the cram r rao bound in many

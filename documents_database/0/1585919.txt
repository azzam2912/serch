all thermal fluctuations become larger and more frequent as the temperature increases and likewise they decrease as temperature approaches absolute zero thermal fluctuations are a basic manifestation of the temperature of systems a system at nonzero temperature does not stay in its equilibrium microscopic state but instead randomly samples all possible states with probabilities given by the boltzmann distribution thermal fluctuations generally affect all the degrees of freedom of a system there can be random vibrations phonons random rotations rotons random electronic excitations and so forth thermodynamic variables such as pressure temperature or entropy likewise undergo thermal fluctuations for example for a system that has an equilibrium pressure the system pressure fluctuates to some extent about the equilibrium value only the control variables of statistical ensembles such as the number of particules n the volume v and the internal energy e in the microcanonical ensemble do not fluctuate thermal fluctuations are a source of noise in many systems the random forces that give rise to thermal fluctuations are a source of both diffusion and dissipation including damping and viscosity the competing effects of random drift and resistance to drift are related by the fluctuation dissipation theorem thermal fluctuations play a

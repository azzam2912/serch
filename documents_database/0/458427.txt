it was described by eusebius and more fully developed by john calvin the doctrine states that jesus christ performed three functions or offices in his earthly ministry those of prophet deuteronomy 18 14 22 priest psalm 110 1 4 and king psalm 2 in the old testament the appointment of someone to any of these three positions could be sanctioned by anointing him by pouring oil over his head thus the term messiah meaning anointed one is associated with the concept of the threefold office while the office of king is that most frequently with the messiah the role of jesus as priest which involves intercession before god is also prominent in the new testament being most fully explained in chapters 7 to 10 of the book of hebrews eusebius worked out this threefold classification writing and we have been told also that certain of the prophets themselves became by the act of anointing christs in type so that all these have reference to the true christ the divinely inspired and heavenly word who is the only high priest of all and the only king of every creature and the father s only supreme prophet of prophets during the reformation

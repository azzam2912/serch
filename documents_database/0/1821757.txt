this process gained some interests due to the potential of using amine boranes for hydrogen storage many metal complexes catalyze the dehydrogenation of amine borane ab catalysis in the absence of metals has also been observed the dehydrogenation of ab would in principle afford hbnh and hbnh the monomers n 1 are highly unstable with respect to oligomerization group 6 metal carbonyls upon photolytic activation catalyze dehydrogenation of ab secondary amine boranes dehydrogenate to form cyclic dimers or monomeric aminoboranes in the case of more bulky groups on the amine similarly primary amine boranes dehydrogenate through a two step intramolecular process to give aminoborane polymers which further dehydrogenate to form borazines the cpfe co is also an effective precatalyst requiring photolytic activation the two step process is proposed to occur first by dehydrogenation of the amine borane coordinated to the metal followed by cyclodimerization in an off metal step the first catalysts for the dehydrogenation of abs were derived from reduction of rh i complexes to form the active colloidal heterogeneous catalyst as in the case with the metal carbonyl catalysts bulky secondary amine boranes form monomeric aminoboranes for rhl and rh h l derived catalysts the active species is

it is the unique strongly regular graph srg 100 22 0 6 i e no neighboring pair of vertices share a common neighbor and each non neighboring pair of vertices share six common neighbors it was first constructed by and rediscovered in 1968 by donald g higman and charles c sims as a way to define the higman sims group and that group is a subgroup of index two in the group of automorphisms of the higman sims graph take the m22 graph a strongly regular graph srg 77 16 0 4 and augment it with 22 new vertices corresponding to the points of s 3 6 22 each block being connected to its points and one additional vertex c connected to the 22 points there are 100 independent sets of size 15 in the hoffman singleton graph create a new graph with 100 corresponding vertices and connect vertices whose corresponding independent sets have exactly 0 or 8 elements in common the resulting higman sims graph can be partitioned into two copies of the hoffman singleton graph in 352 ways take a cube with vertices labeled 000 001 010 111 take all 70 possible 4 sets of vertices and retain

it states that in a random sequence the methodical selection of subsequences does not change the probability of specific elements the first mathematical demonstration is attributed to richard von mises who used the term collective rather than sequence the principle states that no method for forming a subsequence of a random sequence the gambling system improves the odds for a specific event for instance a sequence of fair coin tosses produces equal and independent 50 50 chances for heads and tails a simple system of betting on heads every 3rd 7th or 21st toss etc does not change the odds of winning in the long run as a mathematical consequence of computability theory more complicated betting strategies such as a martingale also cannot alter the odds in the long run von mises mathematical demonstration defines an infinite sequence of zeros and ones as a random sequence if it is not biased by having the frequency stability property with this property the frequency of zeroes in the sequence stabilizes at 1 2 and every possible subsequence selected by any systematic method is likewise not biased the subsequence selection criterion is important because although the sequence 0101010101 is not biased selecting the

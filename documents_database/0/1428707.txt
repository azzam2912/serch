it may also describe other motions such as precession or nutation of the object s rotational axis prograde or direct motion is motion in the same direction as the primary rotates rotation is determined by an inertial frame of reference such as distant fixed stars however retrograde and prograde can also refer to an object other than the primary if so described in our solar system the orbits about the sun of all planets and most other objects except many comets are prograde i e in the same direction as the sun rotates the rotations of most planets except venus and uranus are also prograde most natural satellites have prograde orbits about their planets prograde satellites of uranus orbit in the direction uranus rotates which is retrograde to the sun retrograde satellites are generally small and distant from their planets except neptune s satellite triton which is large and close all retrograde satellites are thought to have formed separately before being captured by their planets when a galaxy or a planetary system forms its material takes the shape of a disk most of the material orbits and rotates in one direction this uniformity of motion is due to the collapse

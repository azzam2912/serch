it was launched aboard spacex crs 4 in september 2014 and operated until august 2016 iss rapidscat was a scatterometer designed to support weather forecasting by bouncing microwaves off the ocean s surface to measure wind speed it featured a rotating radar dish that operated at 13 4 ghz k band it could collect data between 51 6 degrees north and south latitude with a swath the iss rapidscat program was initiated in response to the failure of the quikscat satellite s antenna rotation mechanism in november 2009 while the spacecraft continued to function it could only gather data in one direction significantly limiting its data collection ability iss rapidscat was built by the jet propulsion laboratory from elements of quikscat s seawinds instrument engineering model originally used to validate that instrument s flight hardware prior to its launch in 1999 it was constructed in 18 months re using the quikscat hardware had the double benefit of reducing cost and using already flight proven hardware that functioned well in orbit iss rapidscat was very similar to quikscat in functionality however the instrument suffered due to peculiarities of the international space station such as the station s varying altitude due to

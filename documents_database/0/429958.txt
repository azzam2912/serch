it is one of the most widely used techniques for activation and dissociation of mass selected precursor ion in ms ms it involves the direct introduction of low energy electrons to trapped gas phase ions electron capture dissociation was developed by roman zubarev and neil kelleher while in fred mclafferty s lab at cornell university irradiation of melittin 4 ions and ubiquitin 10 ions trapped in ft ms cell by laser pulses not only resulted in peculiar c z fragmentation but also charge reduction it was suggested that if ft cell is modified to trap cations and electrons simultaneously secondary electrons emitted by uv photons increases the charge reduction effect and c z fragmentation replacing uv laser with ei source led to the development of this new technique electron capture dissociation typically involves a multiply protonated molecule m interacting with a free electron to form an odd electron ion liberation of the electric potential energy results in fragmentation of the product ion rate of electron capture dissociation not only depends on the frequency of ion electron fragmentation reactions but also on the number of ions in an ion electron interaction volume electron current density and cross section of ecd is

members of this family are found in gram positive and gram negative bacteria archaea and possibly eukaryotes these proteins all probably arose by an internal gene duplication event lensbouer doyle 2010 have reviewed these systems classifying the porters with three superfamilies according to ion preference 1 mg preferring 2 ca preferring and 3 fe preferring a representative list of proteins belonging to the citmhs family can be found in the transporter classification database two of the characterized members of the citmhs family both citrate uptake permeases from bacillus subtilis are citm tc 2 a 11 1 1 and cith tc 2 a 11 1 2 citm is believed to transport a citrate mgcomplex in symport with one h per mg citrate while cith apparently transports a citrate ca complex in symport with protons the cation specificity of citm is mg mn ba ni co ca and zn in this preferential order citm is highly specific for citrate and d isocitrate and does not transport other di and tri carboxylates including succinate l isocitrate cis aconitate and tricarballylate for cith the cation specificity in order of preference is ca ba and sr the two proteins are 60 identical contain about 400

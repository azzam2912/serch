the class includes some heterocyclic compounds the archetypical member of the class is 1 4 benzoquinone or cyclohexadienedione often called simply quinone thus the name of the class other important examples are 1 2 benzoquinone ortho quinone 1 4 naphthoquinone and 9 10 anthraquinone quinones are oxidized derivatives of aromatic compounds and are often readily made from reactive aromatic compounds with electron donating substituents such as phenols and catechols which increase the nucleophilicity of the ring and contributes to the large redox potential needed to break aromaticity quinones are conjugated but not aromatic quinones are electrophilic michael acceptors stabilised by conjugation depending on the quinone and the site of reduction reduction can either rearomatise the compound or break the conjugation conjugate addition nearly always breaks the conjugation the term quinone is also used more generally for a large class of compounds formally derived from aromatic quinones through replacement of some hydrogen atoms by other atoms or radicals a large scale industrial application of quinones is for the production of hydrogen peroxide 2 alkylanthraquinones are hydrogenated to the corresponding hydroquinones quinizarins which then transfer to oxygen in this way several billion kilograms of are produced annually derivatives of quinones are common

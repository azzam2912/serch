several geological processes may cause the formation of mud volcanoes mud volcanoes are not true igneous volcanoes as they do not produce lava and are not necessarily driven by magmatic activity the earth continuously exudes a mud like substance which may sometimes be referred to as a mud volcano mud volcanoes may range in size from merely 1 or 2 meters high and 1 or 2 meters wide to 700 meters high and 10 kilometers wide smaller mud exudations are sometimes referred to as mud pots the mud produced by mud volcanoes is mostly formed as hot water which has been heated deep below the earth s surface begins to mix and blend with subterranean mineral deposits thus creating the mud slurry exudate this material is then forced upwards through a geological fault or fissure due to local subterranean pressure imbalances mud volcanoes are associated with subduction zones and about 1100 have been identified on or near land the temperature of any given active mud volcano generally remains fairly steady and is much lower than the typical temperatures found in igneous volcanoes mud volcano temperatures can range from near to occasionally some being used as popular mud baths about 86

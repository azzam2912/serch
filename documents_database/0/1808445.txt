members of this family are predominantly found in tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13b taci and are required for binding to the ligands april and baff taci crd2 stands for transmembrane activator and caml interactor cysteine rich domain 2 taci functions as a negative regulator of baff function given that loss of taci expression results in the overproduction of b lymphocytes a type of white blood cell that guards against infection cytokines can be grouped into a family on the basis of sequence functional and structural similarities tumor necrosis factor tnf also known as tnf alpha or cachectin is a cytotoxin which is derived from a form of white blood cell called monocytes it is thought to cause tumour regression septic shock and cachexia the protein is synthesised as a prohormone with an unusually long and atypical signal sequence which is absent from the mature secreted cytokine a short hydrophobic stretch of amino acids serves to anchor the prohormone in lipid bilayers both the mature protein and a partially processed form of the hormone are secreted after cleavage of the propeptide there are a number of different families of tnf but all these cytokines seem to form homotrimeric or

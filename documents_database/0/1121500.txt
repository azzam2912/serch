it participates in the n myristoylation of proteins and in vertebrates there are two isoenzymes nmt1 and nmt2 besides tetradecanoyl coa this enzyme is also capable of using modified versions of this subtrate in human retina a even wider range of fatty acids including 14 1 n 9 14 2n 6 and 12 0 are accepted by the enzyme and grafted onto guanylate cyclase activators this is mainly a result of a special set of fatty acid coa substrates available in the retina this enzyme belongs to the family of transferases specifically those n acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups cd04301 the systematic name of this enzyme class is tetradecanoyl coa glycylpeptide n tetradecanoyltransferase other names in common use include peptide n myristoyltransferase nmt myristoyl coa protein n myristoyltransferase myristoyl coenzyme a protein n myristoyl transferase myristoylating enzymes and protein n myristoyltransferase as of late 2007 9 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes with pdb accession codes and the enzyme folds into two domains each with a double ef hand arrangement

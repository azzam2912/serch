this is described in the german patent 215225 felix meyer founded the company deutsche rotawerke gmbh in aachen recognizing the fundamental importance of this invention they improved this invention with new shapes of the float and of the glass tube kueppers invented the special shape for the inside of the glass tube that realized a symmetrical flow scale the brand name rotameter was registered by the british company gec elliot automation rotameter co in many other countries the brand name rotameter is registered by rota yokogawa gmbh co kg in germany which is now owned by yokogawa electric corp a rotameter consists of a tapered tube typically made of glass with a float a shaped weight made either of anodized aluminum or a ceramic inside that is pushed up by the drag force of the flow and pulled down by gravity the drag force for a given fluid and float cross section is a function of flow speed squared only see drag equation a higher volumetric flow rate through a given area increases flow speed and drag force so the float will be pushed upwards however as the inside of the rotameter is cone shaped widens the area around the

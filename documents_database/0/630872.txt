it is a short artery which runs backward between the lumbosacral trunk and the first sacral nerve and divides into a superficial and a deep branch after passing out of the pelvis above the upper border of the piriformis muscle within the pelvis it gives off branches to the iliacus piriformis and obturator internus muscles just previous to exiting the pelvic cavity it also gives off a nutrient artery which enters the ilium the superficial branch enters the deep surface of the gluteus maximus and divides into numerous branches some of which supply the muscle and anastomose with the inferior gluteal artery while others perforate its tendinous origin and supply the integument covering the posterior surface of the sacrum anastomosing with the posterior branches of the lateral sacral arteries the deep branch lies under the gluteus medius and almost immediately subdivides into the superior and inferior divisions the superior division continues the original course of the vessel passingalong the upper border of the gluteus minimus to the anterior superior spine of the ilium asis anastomosing with the deep iliac circumflex artery and the ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery the inferior division crosses the gluteus minimus obliquely to

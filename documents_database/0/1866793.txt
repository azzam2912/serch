it is the smallest planet discovered around a main sequence star with a radius slightly greater than that of the moon the measurements do not constrain its mass but masses above a few times that of the moon give unphysically high densities kepler 37b is a sub earth an exoplanet with a radius and mass smaller than earth its surface temperature is because of this it is not expected to have an atmosphere its radius is approximately 0 34 about a diameter of about a little larger than the moon due to its small size it is very likely kepler 37b is a rocky planet with a solid surface furthermore it is too hot to support liquid water on its surface the planet orbits a g type star similar to the sun named kepler 37 orbited by a total of four planets the star has a mass of 0 80 and a radius of 0 79 it has a temperature of 5417 k and is 5 66 billion years old in comparison the sun is 4 6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 k the star s apparent magnitude or how bright it appears from earth s

around 300 000 years after the big bang during the epoch of recombination diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones equalising the temperatures of these regions this effect is responsible along with baryon acoustic oscillations the doppler effect and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe it is a damping by diffusion not of diffusion the strength of diffusion damping is calculated by a mathematical expression for the damping factor which figures into the boltzmann equation an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the cmb the strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered diffusion length the primary effects on the diffusion length are from the properties of the plasma in question different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping the evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process the scale on which diffusion damping works is called the silk scale and its value corresponds to the size of galaxies of the present day the mass contained within the

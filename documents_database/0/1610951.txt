a servant is a class whose instance or even just class provides methods that take care of a desired service while objects for which or with whom the servant does something are taken as parameters servant is used for providing some behavior to a group of classes instead of defining that behavior in each class or when we cannot factor out this behavior in the common parent class it is defined once in the servant for example we have a few classes representing geometric objects rectangle ellipse and triangle we can draw these objects on some canvas when we need to provide a move method for these objects we could implement this method in each class or we can define an interface they implement and then offer the move functionality in a servant an interface is defined to ensure that serviced classes have methods that servant needs to provide desired behavior if we continue in our example we define an interface movable specifying that every class implementing this interface needs to implement method getposition and setposition the first method gets the position of an object on a canvas and second one sets the position of an object and draws it

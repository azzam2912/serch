this is an active area of biological research that includes the study of the transformation of energy in living organisms and the study of thousands of different cellular processes such as cellular respiration and the many other metabolic and enzymatic processes that lead to production and utilization of energy in forms such as adenosine triphosphate atp molecules that is the goal of bioenergetics is to describe how living organisms acquire and transform energy in order to perform biological work the study of metabolic pathways is thus essential to bioenergetics bioenergetics is the part of biochemistry concerned with the energy involved in making and breaking of chemical bonds in the molecules found in biological organisms it can also be defined as the study of energy relationships and energy transformations and transductions in living organisms the ability to harness energy from a variety of metabolic pathways is a property of all living organisms that contains earth science growth development anabolism and catabolism are some of the central processes in the study of biological organisms because the role of energy is fundamental to such biological processes life is dependent on energy transformations living organisms survive because of exchange of energy between living tissues

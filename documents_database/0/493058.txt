this colorless flammable liquid with a characteristic smell is mainly used as a solvent either directly or as its esters its isomers the other butanols include n butanol 2 butanol and tert butanol all of which are important industrially isobutanol is produced by the carbonylation of propylene two methods are practiced industrially hydroformylation is more common and generates a mixture of isobutyraldehydes the reaction is catalyzed by cobalt or rhodium complexes the resulting aldehyde are subsequentlyhydrogenated to the alcohols which are then separated in reppe carbonylation the same products are obtained but the hydrogenation is effected by the water gas shift reaction e coli as well as several other organisms has been genetically modified to produce c4 alcohols from glucose including isobutanol 1 butanol 2 methyl 1 butanol 3 methyl 1 butanol and 2 phenylethanol the host s highly active amino acid biosynthetic pathway is shifted to alcohol production the uses of isobutanol and n butanol are similar they are often used interchangeably the main applications are as varnishes and precursors to esters which are useful solvents e g isobutyl acetate isobutyl esters of phthalic adipic and related dicarboxylic acids are common plasticizers isobutanol is also a component of some

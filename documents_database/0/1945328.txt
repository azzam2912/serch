as the name implies chemcam is actually two different instruments combined as one a laser induced breakdown spectroscopy libs and a remote micro imager rmi telescope the purpose of the libs instrument is to provide elemental compositions of rock and soil while the rmi will give chemcam scientists high resolution images of the sampling areas of the rocks and soil that libs targets the libs instrument can target a rock or soil sample from up to away vaporizing a small amount of it with about 50 to 75 5 nanosecond pulses from a 1067 nm infrared laser and then observing the spectrum of the light emitted by the vaporized rock chemcam has the ability to record up to 6 144 different wavelengths of ultraviolet visible and infrared light detection of the ball of luminous plasma will be done in the visible near uv and near infrared ranges between 240 nm and 800 nm the first initial laser testing of the chemcam by curiosity on mars was performed on a rock n165 coronation rock near bradbury landing on august 19 2012 the chemcam team expects to take approximately one dozen compositional measurements of rocks per day using the same collection optics

there are a variety of effects that can be called magnetoresistance some occur in bulk non magnetic metals and semiconductors such as geometrical magnetoresistance shubnikov de haas oscillations or the common positive magnetoresistance in metals other effects occur in magnetic metals such as negative magnetoresistance in ferromagnets or anisotropic magnetoresistance amr finally in multicomponent or multilayer systems e g magnetic tunnel junctions giant magnetoresistance gmr tunnel magnetoresistance tmr colossal magnetoresistance cmr and extraordinary magnetoresistance emr can be observed the first magnetoresistive effect was discovered by william thomson better known as lord kelvin in 1856 but he was unable to lower the electrical resistance of anything by more than 5 today systems e g semimetals or concentric ring emr structures are known where a magnetic field can change resistance by orders of magnitude as the resistance may depend on magnetic field through various mechanisms it is useful to separately consider situations where it depends on magnetic field directly e g geometric magnetoresistance and multiband magnetoresistance and those where it does so indirectly through magnetisation e g amr tmr william thomson lord kelvin first discovered ordinary magnetoresistance in 1856 he experimented with pieces of iron and discovered that the resistance increases when

if one can change the identities of the players without changing the payoff to the strategies then a game is symmetric symmetry can come in different varieties ordinally symmetric games are games that are symmetric with respect to the ordinal structure of the payoffs a game is quantitatively symmetric if and only if it is symmetric with respect to the exact payoffs a partnership game is a symmetric game where both players receive identical payoffs for any strategy set that is the payoff for playing strategy a against strategy b receives the same payoff as playing strategy b against strategy a only 12 out of the 144 ordinally distinct 2x2 games are symmetric however many of the commonly studied 2x2 games are at least ordinally symmetric the standard representations of chicken the prisoner s dilemma and the stag hunt are all symmetric games formally in order for a 2x2 game to be symmetric its payoff matrix must conform to the schema pictured to the right the requirements for a game to be ordinally symmetric are weaker there it need only be the case that the ordinal ranking of the payoffs conform to the schema on the right nash 1951 shows

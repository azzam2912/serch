the name refers to their nature i e extraordinary or chosen men almost all the details we know of the extraordinarii are described to us in the histories of the ancient greek historian polybius the standard consular army of the republic was made up of two legions and a comparable number of italian allied troops termed the alae in theory the alae would be the same size as the legions except for the cavalry which was tripled so a standard ala would contain about 900 cavalry and 4 200 foot in practice there was often more allied infantry than roman infantry for instance the four legions numbering 15 000 roman infantry were supported by 20 000 allied infantry at the battle of the trebia similar discrepancies can be found in other roman battles of the era from the whole force of the alae the consul would request the praefecti sociorum commanders of the allied forces to select for the extraordinarii about a third of the cavalry the equites extraordinarii and a fifth of the infantry the pedites extraordinarii of those men best fitted for service the extraordinarii for a standard consular army as described by polybius would thus number 600

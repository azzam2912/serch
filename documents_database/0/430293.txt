iodometric titration is used to find cl2 conc redox titration using sodium thiosulphate naso usually as a reducing agent is known as iodometric titration since it is used specifically to titrate iodine the iodometric titration is a general method to determine the concentration of an oxidising agent in solution in an iodometric titration a starch solution is used as an indicator since it can absorb the i that is released this absorption will cause the solution to change its colour from dark blue to light yellow a colour when titrated with standardised thiosulfate solution this indicates the end point of the titration iodometry is commonly used to analyze the concentration of oxidizing agents in water samples such as oxygen saturation in ecological studies or active chlorine in swimming pool water analysis to a known volume of sample an excess but known amount of iodide is added which the oxidizing agent then oxidizes to iodine iodine dissolves in the iodide containing solution to give triiodide ions which have a dark brown color the triiodide ion solution is then titrated against standard thiosulfate solution to give iodide again using starch indicator together with reduction potential of thiosulfate the overall reaction is thus

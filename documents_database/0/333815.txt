invented by per gillbrand at the swedish car maker saab that introduced it on turbo charged saab h engines in 1982 and was fitted to all subsequent 900 turbos through 1993 and 1994 convertibles as well as 9000 turbos through 1989 sold to maserati to equip the carbureted maserati biturbo same layout as the apc from saab with different settings known as mabc maserati automatic boost controller the apc allowed a higher compression ratio initially 8 5 1 as opposed to 7 2 1 and on 16 valve variants introduced in 1985 9 0 1 this improved fuel economy and allowed the use of low octane petrol without causing engine damage caused by knock the apc controls boost pressure and the overall performance specifically the rate of rise and maximum boost level and it detects and manages harmful knock events to control the turbocharger the apc monitors the engine s rpm and inlet manifold pressure via a pressure transducer and uses these inputs to control a solenoid valve that trims the rate of rise of pressure as well as the maximum pressure by directing boost pressure to the turbocharger s pneumatic wastegate actuator to detect knock a piezoelectric knock sensor

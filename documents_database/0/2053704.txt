it was proposed by boualem boashash and peter o shea in 1994 many signals in nature and in engineering applications can be modeled as formula 1 where formula 2 is a polynomial phase and formula 3 for example it is important to detect signals of an arbitrary high order polynomial phase however the conventional wigner ville distribution have the limitation being based on the second order statistics hence the polynomial wigner ville distribution was proposed as a generalized form of the conventional wigner ville distribution which is able to deal with signals with nonlinear phase the polynomial wigner ville distribution formula 4 is defined as where formula 6 denotes the fourier transform with respect to formula 7 and formula 8 is the polynomial kernel given by where formula 10 is the input signal and formula 11 is an even number the above expression for the kernel may be rewritten in symmetric form as the discrete time version of the polynomial wigner ville distribution is given by the discrete fourier transform of where formula 14 and formula 15 is the sampling frequency the conventional wigner ville distribution is a special case of the polynomial wigner ville distribution with formula 16 one

it was released on 18 september 2017 through dirty hit as the album s fourth single in a track by track breakdown for consequence of sound drummer joel amey said i feel like heavenward was one of the first ideas we really got to grips with we have a few demo versions floating around one of which was made in our manager s office basement and from which the opening build up noise is lifted that passage always set such a mood and tone and for me that i couldn t have imagined it as anything other than the opener the guitars are so dense and there are so many nuances that we had to think carefully about how the sonics of the other instruments should sit we wanted to avoid classic radio rock drums and keep them almost small in size to really push the walls of guitar noise it s a favourite of mine especially lyrically but also for joff s guitar anti solo that comes in the middle 8th i won t reveal how he gets the sound but so far some people we ve shown it to have said it s a saxophone or a set

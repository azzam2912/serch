is an international company headquartered in greater vancouver bc canada officially spun off from the national research council of canada nrc in 1995 crosslight s founder dr z m simon li is a pioneer in the field of optoelectronic device simulation tcad and based on this work crosslight claims to be the first commercial vendor of tcad tools for quantum well laser diodes crosslight also licenses other technology from the stanford university tcad group for semiconductor process simulations after its initial spin off from the nrc crosslight launched its flagship product lastip a 2d simulator for quantum well laser diodes based on its founder s research lastip predates other well known tools in the field such as minilase by adding the ability to model quantum well active regions lastip was also a significant step up from earlier comparable efforts such as hitachi s hiladies as early laser diode tcad tools were primarily developed by individual researchers for their own use crosslight claims that lastip s commercialization makes them first to market in this field further improvements in the technology followed including the development of pics3d for 3d modeling of optoelectronic devices a feat which earned crosslight the laser focus world

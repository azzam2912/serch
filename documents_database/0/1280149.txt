this implies the existence of antiderivatives for continuous functions conversely the second part of the theorem sometimes called the second fundamental theorem of calculus states that the integral of a function f over some interval can be computed by using any one say f of its infinitely many antiderivatives this part of the theorem has key practical applications because explicitly finding the antiderivative of a function by symbolic integration avoids numerical integration to compute integrals this provides generally a better numerical accuracy the fundamental theorem of calculus relates differentiation and integration showing that these two operations are essentially inverses of one another before the discovery of this theorem it was not recognized that these two operations were related ancient greek mathematicians knew how to compute area via infinitesimals an operation that we would now call integration the origins of differentiation likewise predate the fundamental theorem of calculus by hundreds of years for example in the fourteenth century the notions of continuity of functions and motion were studied by the oxford calculators and other scholars the historical relevance of the fundamental theorem of calculus is not the ability to calculate these operations but the realization that the two seemingly distinct operations

marine bioerosion can be caused by mollusks polychaete worms phoronids sponges crustaceans echinoids and fish it can occur on coastlines on coral reefs and on ships its mechanisms include biotic boring drilling rasping and scraping on dry land bioerosion is typically performed by pioneer plants or plant like organisms such as lichen and mostly chemical e g by acidic secretions on limestone or mechanical e g by roots growing into cracks in nature bioerosion of coral reefs generates the fine and white coral sand characteristic of tropical islands the coral is converted to sand by internal bioeroders such as algae fungi bacteria microborers and sponges clionaidae bivalves including lithophaga sipunculans polychaetes acrothoracican barnacles and phoronids generating extremely fine sediment with diameters of 10 to 100 micrometres external bioeroders include sea urchins such as diadema and chitons these forces in concert produce a great deal of erosion sea urchin erosion of calcium carbonate has been reported in some reefs at annual rates exceeding 20 kg m fish also erode coral while eating algae parrotfish cause a great deal of bioerosion using well developed jaw muscles tooth armature and a pharyngeal mill to grind ingested material into sand sized particles bioerosion of

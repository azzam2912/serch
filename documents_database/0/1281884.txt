one of the key features that distinguishes archaea from bacteria and eukarya is their membrane lipids where archaeol plays an important role because of this archaeol is also broadly used as a biomarker for ancient archaea especially methanogens activity archaeol is generally composed by linking two phytanyl chains to the sn 2 and sn 3 positions of a glycerol molecule the highly branched side chains are speculated to account for the very low permeability of archaeol based membrane which may be one of the key adaptations of archaea to extreme environments archaeol is a diether lipid commonly found in archaea standard archaeol is 2 3 di o phytanyl sn glycerol with two phytanyl chains binding to the position of sn 2 and sn 3 of glycerol by ether bonds the 2 3 sn glycerol structure and ether bond linkage are two key differences of archaea lipids from those of bacteria and eukarya that use 1 2 sn glycerol and mostly ester bonds natural archaeol has 3r 7r 11r configurations for the three chiral centers in the isoprenoid chains there are four structural variations contributing to the complexity of the membrane lipids in function and properties the two phytanyl chains can

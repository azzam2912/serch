cce was launched with the two other satellites of the ampte mission on august 16 1984 from a cape canaveral launch pad by a delta 3924 rocket it was placed in an equatorial orbit of with an inclination of 4 8 degrees cce is one of the components of the international space mission ampte which also includes mri designed by west germany and uks provided by the united kingdom charge composition explorer was instrumented to detect those lithium and barium tracer ions from the irm released that were transported into the magnetosphere within the cce orbit the spacecraft was spin stabilized at 10 rpm with its spin axis in the equatorial plane and offset from the earth sun line by about 20 degrees it could adjust attitude with both magnetic torqueing and cold gas thrusters the satellite carries 5 scientific instruments that are used to measure the composition of the particles in the magnetosphere throughout their energy spectrum and the changes that affect them with the objective of determining the main processes governing their excitation their displacement and their disappearance cce must also detect the lithium and barium ions released by the mri satellite and transported in the magnetosphere starting

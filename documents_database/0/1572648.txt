though described in 1902 the genus was up to 2005 known from a single male specimen whose appearance was so unusual that the authors suspected a mislabeled giant pill millipede from india their unusual and distinct morphology includes well developed stridulation organs probably as devices for courtship these are the male harp and the female washboard which contain more stridulation ribs than in other members of the order sphaerotheriida they have a closer affinity with the indian genus arthrosphaera than to other malagasy genera though all belong to the arthrosphaeridae it belongs to the family arthrosphaeridae which besides sphaeromimus includes the malagasy genera zoosphaerium and microsphaerotherium and the indian genus arthrosphaera recent research has shown that sphaeromimus is more closely related to the indian genus arthrosphaera than to the other malagasy genera all populations inhabit the leaf litter of the malagasy rainforests except for one recently described species 2014 which was found in a cave and the type species s musicus which has only been found in the dry spiny forest recent research has shown that sphaeromimus populations are highly endemic since individuals are not able to travel between forest patches movement between populations is becoming more limited as forest

insoluble solids such as quartz and oyster shell are diluted by grinding them with lactose trituration the founder of homeopathy samuel hahnemann 1755 1843 believed that the process of succussion activated the vital energy of the diluted substance and that successive dilutions increased the potency of the preparation although other strands of homeopathy disagree the concept is pseudoscience because at commonly used dilutions no molecules of the original material are likely to remain several potency scales are in use in homeopathy hahnemann created the centesimal or c scale diluting a substance by a factor of 100 at each stage the centesimal scale was favored by hahnemann for most of his life a 2c dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in one hundred and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of one hundred this works out to one part of the original substance in 10 000 parts of the solution a 6c dilution repeats this process six times ending up with the original material diluted by a factor of 100 10 higher dilutions follow the same pattern in homeopathy a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher potency

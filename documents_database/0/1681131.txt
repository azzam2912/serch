acbp is also known as diazepam binding inhibitor dbi or endozepine ep because of its ability to displace diazepam from the benzodiazepine bzd recognition site located on the gaba type a receptor it is therefore possible that this protein also acts as a neuropeptide to modulate the action of the gaba receptor acbp is a highly conserved protein of about 90 amino acids that is found in all four eukaryotic kingdoms animalia plantae fungi and protista and in some eubacterial species although acbp occurs as a completely independent protein intact acb domains have been identified in a number of large multifunctional proteins in a variety of eukaryotic species these include large membrane associated proteins with n terminal acb domains multifunctional enzymes with both acb and peroxisomal enoyl coa delta 3 delta 2 enoyl coa isomerase domains and proteins with both an acb domain and ankyrin repeats the acb domain consists of four alpha helices arranged in a bowl shape with a highly exposed acyl coa binding site the ligand is bound through specific interactions with residues on the protein most notably several conserved positive charges that interact with the phosphate group on the adenosine 3 phosphate moiety and the acyl

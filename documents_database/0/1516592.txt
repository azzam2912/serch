in inorganic phosphors these inhomogeneities in the crystal structure are created usually by addition of a trace amount of dopants impurities called activators in rare cases dislocations or other crystal defects can play the role of the impurity the wavelength emitted by the emission center is dependent on the atom itself its electronic configuration and on the surrounding crystal structure the activators prolong the emission time afterglow in turn other materials such as nickel can be used to quench the afterglow and shorten the decay part of the phosphor emission characteristics the electronic configuration of the activator depends on its oxidation state and is crucial for the light emission oxidation of the activator is one of the common mechanisms of phosphor degradation the distribution of the activator in the crystal is also of high importance diffusion of the ions can cause depletion of the crystal from the activators with resulting loss of efficiency this is another mechanism of phosphor degradation the scintillation process in inorganic materials is due to the electronic band structure found in the crystals an incoming particle can excite an electron from the valence band to either the conduction band or the exciton band located just below

this move however was highly controversial as the m v chenega a fast ferry was supposed to take this role and been promised for years in advance to the prince william sound area and specifically to be homeported in the city of cordova instead the ferry system reneged on this promise and moved the chenega to a ketchikan wrangell route currently the aurora is being hubbed out of cordova although unlike the fast ferry the aurora operates 24 hours a day so it doesn t have a crew that lives in its homeport thus denying that city the economic stimulus of additional residents jobs this is the primary motive for the especially rancorous uproar from cordova regarding the chenega s route placement and operating principally between cordova whittier and valdez with whistle stops the ferry only stops if there are prior reservations in tatitlek and chenega bay the aurora s amenities include a hot food cafeteria movie and forward observation lounges and solarium there are no cabins on the aurora both because of its small size and the lack of demand due to its feeder route running times the aurora and the m v leconte are the only amhs vessels

an improvement to a reference implementation reflects an unchanging specification conversely a failed attempt at an implementation may prove that the specification is not suitable and needs improvement itself testing the implementation vs specification relationship further enhances the production s inter process efficiencies reference implementations of algorithms for instance cryptographic algorithms are often the result or the input of standardization processes in this function they are often dedicated to the public domain with their source code as public domain software examples are the first cern s httpd serpent cipher base64 variants and sha 3 the openwall project maintains a list of several algorithms with their reference source code in the public domain a reference implementation may or may not be production quality for example the fraunhofer reference implementation of the mp3 standard usually does not compare favorably to other common implementations such as lame in listening tests that determine sound quality in contrast cpython the reference implementation of the python programming language is also the implementation most widely used in production

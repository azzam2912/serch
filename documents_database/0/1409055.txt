gemini was the second manned spaceflight program operated by nasa and consisted of a two seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit docking with unmanned spacecraft such as agena target vehicles and allowing the crew to perform tethered extra vehicular activities a range of applications were considered for advanced gemini missions including military flights space station crew and logistics delivery and lunar flights the lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the centaur which could propel the spacecraft to the moon to complete modifications of the gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before apollo was ready to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded apollo crews or even replacing the apollo program some of the advanced gemini proposals used off the shelf gemini spacecraft unmodified from the original program while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew dock with space stations visit the moon and perform other mission objectives other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft in order to enable it to

it is similar to a gear pump except the lobes are designed to almost meet rather than touch and turn each other an early example of a lobe pump is the roots blower patented in 1860 to blow combustion air to melt iron in blast furnaces but now more commonly used as an engine supercharger lobe pumps are used in a variety of industries including pulp and paper chemical food beverage pharmaceutical and biotechnology they are popular in these diverse industries because they offer superb sanitary qualities high efficiency reliability corrosion resistance and good clean in place and steam in place cip sip characteristics rotary pumps can handle solids e g cherries and olives slurries pastes and a variety of liquids if wetted they offer self priming performance a gentle pumping action minimizes product degradation they also offer continuous and intermittent reversible flows and can operate dry for brief periods of time flow is relatively independent of changes in process pressure too so output is relatively constant and continuous lobe pumps are similar to external gear pumps in operation in that fluid flows around the interior of the casing unlike external gear pumps however the lobes do not make contact

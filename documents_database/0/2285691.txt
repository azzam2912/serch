the procedure involves injecting the right or left portal vein with embolic material to occlude portal blood flow by occluding the blood flow to areas of the liver that will be resected away the blood is diverted to healthy parts of the liver and induces hyperplasia this may allow for a more extensive resection or stage bilateral resections that would otherwise be contraindicated resulting in better oncological treatment outcomes indications for pve depend on the ratio of future liver remnant flr to total estimated liver volume telv and liver condition although there is no consensus to the absolute minimum liver volume required for adequate post resection liver function a flr telv ratio of at least 25 is recommended in patients with otherwise normal livers the recommendation for those with chronic liver disease such as cirrhosis is a flr telv ratio of at least 40 in these patients a pve may be indicated to increase the flr and the flr telv ratio preoperative patients receiving extensive chemotherapy with a flr telv less than 30 should also receive pve prior to resection conversely chemotherapy does not preclude subsequent pve other important considerations before a pve include co morbidities such as diabetes procedure

it can be done easily by hand because it separates an otherwise complex division problem into smaller ones sometimes using a shorthand version called synthetic division is faster with less writing and fewer calculations polynomial long division is an algorithm that implements the euclidean division of polynomials which starting from two polynomials a the dividend and b the divisor produces if b is not zero a quotient q and a remainder r such that and either r 0 or the degree of r is lower than the degree of b these conditions uniquely define q and r which means that q and r do not depend on the method used to compute them the result r 0 occurs if and only if the polynomial a has b as a factor thus long division is a means for testing whether one polynomial has another as a factor and if it does for factoring it out for example if a root r of a is known it can be factored out by dividing a by x r find the quotient and the remainder of the division of formula 1 the dividend by formula 2 the divisor the dividend is first rewritten like

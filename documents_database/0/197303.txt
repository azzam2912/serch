voltage regulation describes the ability of a system to provide near constant voltage over a wide range of load conditions the term may refer to a passive property that results in more or less voltage drop under various load conditions or to the active intervention with devices for the specific purpose of adjusting voltage in electrical power systems voltage regulation is a dimensionless quantity defined at the receiving end of a transmission line as where v is voltage at no load and v is voltage at full load the percent voltage regulation of an ideal transmission line as defined by a transmission line with zero resistance and reactance would equal zero due to v equaling v as a result of there being no voltage drop along the line this is why a smaller value of voltage regulation is usually beneficial indicating that the line is closer to ideal the voltage regulation formula could be visualized with the following consider power being delivered to a load such that the voltage at the load is the load s rated voltage v if then the load disappears the voltage at the point of the load will rise to v voltage regulation in transmission

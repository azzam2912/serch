the term was first used by scott and still in 1968 after they realized that the glycogen in the cell was not static but rather a dynamic molecule it is found in a few species of protozoa including the kinetoplastida which include the suborders trypanosomatida and bodonina most notably in the human pathogenic trypanosomes which can cause sleeping sickness chagas s disease and leishmaniasis the organelle is bounded by a single membrane and contains a dense proteinaceous matrix it is believed to have evolved from the peroxisome this has been verified by work done on leishmania genetics the glycosome is currently being researched as a possible target for drug therapies glycosomes are unique to kinetoplastids and their sister diplonemids the term glycosome is also used for glycogen containing structures found in hepatocytes responsible for storing sugar but these are not membrane bound organelles glycosomes are composed of glycogen and proteins the proteins are the enzymes that are associated with the metabolism of glycogen these proteins and glycogen form a complex to make a distinct and separate organelle the proteins for glycosomes are imported from free cytosolic ribosomes the proteins imported into the organelle have a specific sequence a pts1 ending

in it he described a language of symbolic expressions s expressions that could represent complex structures as lists then he defined a set of primitive operations on the s expressions and a language of meta expressions m expressions that could be used to define more complex operations finally he showed how the meta language itself could be represented with s expressions resulting in a system that was potentially self hosting mccarthy had planned to develop an automatic lisp compiler using m expressions as the language syntax and s expressions to describe the compiler s internal processes stephen b russell read the paper and suggested to him that s expressions were a more convenient syntax although mccarthy disapproved of the idea russell and colleague daniel j edwards hand coded an interpreter program that could execute s expressions this program was adopted by mccarthy s research group establishing s expressions as the dominant form of lisp mccarthy reflected on the fate of m expressions in 1979 a more recent circa 2003 variant is i expressions which use indentation to indicate parentheses implicitly and are thus in some ways intermediate between s expressions and m expressions i expressions were introduced in scheme request

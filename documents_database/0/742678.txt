different declarer play strategies lead to success depending on the distribution of opponent s cards to decide which strategy has highest likelihood of success the declarer needs to have at least an elementary knowledge of probabilities the tables below specify the various prior probabilities i e the probabilities in the absence of any further information during bidding and play more information about the hands becomes available allowing players to improve their probability estimates this table represents the different ways that two to eight particular cards may be distributed or may lie or split between two unknown 13 card hands before the bidding and play or a priori the table also shows the number of combinations of particular cards that match any numerical split and the probabilities for each combination these probabilities follow directly from the law of vacant places let formula 1 be the probability of an east player with formula 2 unknown cards holding formula 3 cards in a given suit and a west player with formula 4 unknown cards holding formula 5 cards in the given suit the total number of arrangements of formula 6 cards in the suit in formula 7 spaces is formula 8 i e

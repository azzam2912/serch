oxymonas was established in order to accommodate a newly discovered species oxymonas granulosa through the discovery of oxymonas janicki was also responsible for coining the term karyomastigont for a new structure which was observed in this genus and other termite symbionts oxymonas is found to be sub elliptical in its body shape and has a pointed posterior end oxymonas is distinguishable by the rostellum which can be thought of as a elongated proboscis the rostellum projects anteriorly from the organism and ends in a holdfast apparatus that allows for the attachment to the gut of the termite the rostellum is composed of a system of microtubules oxymonas have two pairs of flagella which originate from pairs of basal bodies which are located at the base of the rostellum these basal body pairs are connected to the preaxostyle which is a paracrystalline structure in addition to the preaxostyle there is an axostyle this organelle moves the oxymonas by undulating and changing shape in a sinusoidal fashion the axostyle is also composed of microtubules oxymonas secondarily lost their mitochondria and the golgi dictyosomes because oxymonas lack both these cellular components energy producing processes must take place in the cytoplasm of the cell

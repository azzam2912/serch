he was also awarded the 2014 nobel prize in physics together with hiroshi amano and shuji nakamura for the invention of efficient blue light emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy saving white light sources born in kagoshima prefecture akasaki graduated from kyoto university in 1952 and obtained a dr eng degree in electronics from nagoya university in 1964 during college years he visited shrines and temples that local residents rarely visit walked around the mountains of shinshu during the summer vacation enjoyed classes and enjoyed a fulfilling student era he started working on gan based blue leds in the late 1960s step by step he improved the quality of gan crystals and device structures at matsushita research institute tokyo inc mrit where he decided to adopt metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy movpe as the preferred growth method for gan in 1981 he started afresh the growth of gan by movpe at nagoya university and in 1985 he and his group succeeded in growing high quality gan on sapphire substrate by pioneering the low temperature lt buffer layer technology this high quality gan enabled them to discover p type gan by doping with magnesium mg and subsequent activation by electron

picaxe devices are essentially microchip pic devices with pre programmed firmware that enables bootloading of code directly from a pc simplifying hobbyist embedded development not unlike the arduino and parallax basic stamp systems picaxe devices have been produced by revolution education rev ed since 1999 there are currently six 6 picaxe variants of differing pin counts 8 14 18 20 28 40 and are available as dil and smd picaxe microcontrollers are pre programmed with an interpreter similar to the basic stamp but using internal eeprom instead thus reducing cost this also allows downloads to be made with a simple serial connection which eliminates the need for a pic programmer picaxe is programmed using an rs 232 serial cable or a usb cable which connects a computer to the download circuit which normally uses a 3 5 mm jack and two resistors picaxe microcontrollers are programmed using basic the picaxe interpreter features bit banged communications the readtemp command reads the temperature from a ds18b20 temperature sensor and converts it into celsius all current picaxes have commands for using hardware features of the underlying pic microcontrollers all current picaxe chips have at least 2048 bytes of on board program memory available

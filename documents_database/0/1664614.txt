conformance checking for short is a family of process mining techniques to compare a process model with an event log of the same process it is used to check if the actual execution of a business process as recorded in the event log conforms to the model and vice versa for instance there may be a process model indicating that purchase orders of more than one million euros require two checks analysis of the event log will show whether this rule is followed or not another example is the checking of the so called four eyes principle stating that particular activities should not be executed by one and the same person by scanning the event log using a model specifying these requirements one can discover potential cases of fraud hence conformance checking may be used to detect locate and explain deviations and to measure the severity of these deviations conformance checking techniques take as input a process model and event log and return a set of differences between the behavior captured in the process model and the behavior captured in the event log these differences may be represented visually e g overlaid on top of the process model or textually

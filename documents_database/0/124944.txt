concretely for a partially ordered set s one represents each element of s as a vertex in the plane and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from x to y whenever y covers x that is whenever x helmut hasse 1898 1979 according to they are so called because of the effective use hasse made of them however hasse was not the first to use these diagrams one example that predates hasse can be found in although hasse diagrams were originally devised as a technique for making drawings of partially ordered sets by hand they have more recently been created automatically using graph drawing techniques the phrase hasse diagram may also refer to the transitive reduction as an abstract directed acyclic graph independently of any drawing of that graph but this usage is eschewed here although hasse diagrams are simple as well as intuitive tools for dealing with finite posets it turns out to be rather difficult to draw good diagrams the reason is that there will in general be many possible ways to draw a hasse diagram for a given poset the simple technique of just starting with the minimal elements of an order and then

five years later the complete treasure was sold to the english collector richard payne knight who bequeathed it to the british museum in 1824 for many years the hoard was assumed to have been discovered in caubiac however in 1988 scholars challenged the original provenance of the find according to handwritten records kept at the academy of toulouse the treasure was actually found at the nearby village of thil the error appears to have originated from the fact that the owner of the field where the treasure was found lived in caubiac while the field itself was located in the town of thil on the site of an ancient castle named mouillat the entire hoard is made of silver it includes a saucer and three dishes some of which are decorated with bacchic scenes a large plate inscribed with the name benignus an ornamented cup and a now badly damaged fluted bowl with a central medallion of venus with cupid and priapus which was used for washing hands the whole set dates from between the late 2nd century and the early 3rd century and probably served to celebrate the cult of bacchus at the base of one of the dishes

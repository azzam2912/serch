instead the two faces are coated to provide mirror surfaces the two opposite transmitting faces are often coated with an antireflection coating to reduce spurious reflections the fifth face of the prism is not used optically but truncates what would otherwise be an awkward angle joining the two mirrored faces a variant of this prism is the roof pentaprism which is commonly used in the viewfinder of single lens reflex cameras the camera lens renders an image that is both vertically and laterally reversed and the reflex mirror re inverts it leaving an image laterally reversed in this case the image needs to be reflected left to right as the prism transmits the image formed on the camera s focusing screen this lateral inversion is done by replacing one of the reflective faces of a normal pentaprism with a roof section with two additional surfaces angled towards each other and meeting at 90 which laterally reverses the image back to normal reflex cameras with waist level finders viewed from above including many medium format cameras display a laterally reversed image directly from the focusing screen which is viewed from above the same optical paths can be realized with three mirrors

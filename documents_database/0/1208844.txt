these ripple marks are often characterised and thus distinguished from current ripples by symmetric cross sections and long relatively straight crests which may commonly bifurcate commonly these crests can be truncated by subsequent flows their wavelength periodicity depends on the sediment grain size water depth and water particle orbits in the waves on tidal flats the pattern of wave formed ripples may be complicated as a product of changing depth and wind and tidal runoff directions symmetrical ripples are commonly found in shallow waters beaches are a good place to find these ripples while wave formed ripples are traditionally described as symmetrical asymmetric wave ripples are common in shallow waters along sandy shores they are produced by bottom oscillations generated by passing breaker waves which have unequal intensity in opposite directions wave formed ripples indicate an environment with weak currents where water motion is dominated by wave oscillations although symmetrical ripples are also called bi directional ripples there is a difference between them bi directional ripples are rarely symmetrical due to the difference in force of the two directions where as the wave formed or oscillation ripples form from the circular water movement pattern of water molecules these ripples form

the special case where the numbers z z are all algebraic is the lindemann weierstrass theorem if on the other hand the numbers are chosen so as to make exp z exp z all algebraic then one would prove that linearly independent logarithms of algebraic numbers are algebraically independent a strengthening of baker s theorem the gelfond schneider theorem follows from this strengthened version of baker s theorem as does the currently unproven four exponentials conjecture schanuel s conjecture if proved would also settle whether numbers such as e and e are algebraic or transcendental and prove that e and are algebraically independent simply by setting z 1 and z i and using euler s identity euler s identity states that e 1 0 if schanuel s conjecture is true then this is in some precise sense involving exponential rings the only relation between e and i over the complex numbers although ostensibly a problem in number theory the conjecture has implications in model theory as well angus macintyre and alex wilkie for example proved that the theory of the real field with exponentiation is decidable provided schanuel s conjecture is true in fact they only needed the real version

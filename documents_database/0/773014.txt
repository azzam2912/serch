the poster advertising the event can be seen in the photo collage included in the album gong live etc also released in 1977 the gong lineup was a reunion of the angel s egg you era band featuring the return of daevid allen gilli smyth steve hillage and miquette giraudy who had left in 1975 and so were not part of the then current gong expresso which would eventually change its name to pierre moerlen s gong their set included most of the music from four albums camembert electrique and the three albums of the radio gnome invisible trilogy therefore this album documents less than half of the performance and some songs are absent or incomplete many are slightly renamed from their original titles

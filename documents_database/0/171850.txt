it along with other aerodigestive reflexes such as reflexive pharyngeal swallowing prevents objects in the oral cavity from entering the throat except as part of normal swallowing and helps prevent choking and is a form of coughing in a reflex arc a series of physiological steps occur very rapidly to produce a reflex generally a sensory receptor receives an environmental stimulus in this case from objects reaching nerves in the back of the throat and sends a message via an afferent nerve to the central nervous system cns the cns receives this message and sends an appropriate response via an efferent nerve also known as a motor neuron to effector cells located in the same initial area that can then carry out the appropriate response in the case of the pharyngeal reflex the gag reflex involves a brisk and brief elevation of the soft palate and bilateral contraction of pharyngeal muscles evoked by touching the posterior pharyngeal wall touching the soft palate can lead to a similar reflex response however in that case the sensory limb of the reflex is the cn v trigeminal nerve in very sensitive individuals much more of the brain stem may be involved a simple

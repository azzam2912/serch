it can also be created by freshwater snails when temporary pools dry up in most species the epiphragm is made of dried mucus and although it is elastic it is fairly easily torn when forcibly removing a snail from its substrate in a few species the epiphragm is thick and quite rigid being reinforced with calcium carbonate this kind of epiphragm is very strong and may be difficult to break the epiphragm is created to seal the aperture of the shell against desiccation it is used when the snail is inactive most land snails are only active when the humidity is high such as after rain and at night and become inactive during dry weather the main function of the epiphragm is to reduce water loss through the aperture during inactivity an operculum is a somewhat similar but permanent anatomical feature that is found in other clades of gastropods the operculum serves some of the same functions as an epiphragm sometimes it protects the snail against predation it protects certain species of snail if they are eaten by birds such as japanese white eye the snail can remain alive as it passes through the digestive tract because it is protected

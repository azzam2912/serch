instead of using a metal cage inside the concrete this technique uses a fabric cage inside the same materials with high tensile strengths with negligible elongation properties are reinforced with woven or nonwoven fabrics the fibres used for making the fabric are of high tenacity like jute glass fibre kevlar polypropylene polyamides nylon etc the weaving of the fabric is done either in a coil fashion or in a layer fashion molten materials ceramic clays plastics or cement concrete are deposited on the base fabric in such a way that the inner fabric is completely wrapped with the concrete or plastic as a result of this sort of structure the resultant concrete becomes flexible from the inner side along with high strength provided by the outer materials various nonwoven structures also get priority to form the base structure special types of weaving machines are used to form spiral fabrics and layer fabrics are generally nonwoven the initial creation of textile reinforced concrete trc began in the 1980s concepts for trc originated from the s chsisches textiforschungs institut e v stfi a german institute focusing on textile technology the first patent for textile reinforced concrete design granted in 1982 was for

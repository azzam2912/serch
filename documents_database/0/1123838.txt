it may give meteorologists the ability to pinpoint and track the location of tornadic rotation within a larger storm but it is not an important feature in the national weather service s warning operations the tornadic vortex signature was first identified by donald w burgess and others in the 1970s using experimental doppler radar at the national severe storms laboratory nssl in norman oklahoma the national weather service nws now uses an updated algorithm developed by nssl the tornado detection algorithm tda based on data from its wsr 88d system of radars nssl also developed the mesocyclone detection algorithm mda the conditions causing a tvs are often visible on the doppler weather radar storm relative velocity srv product as adjacent inbound and outbound velocities a signature known as a velocity couplet or gate to gate shear in most cases the tvs is a strong mesocyclone aloft not an actual tornado although the presence of an actual tornado on the ground can occasionally be inferred based on a strong couplet in concert with a tornado debris signature tds i e a debris ball on reflectivity or certain polarimetric characteristics or through confirmation from storm spotters when the algorithm is tripped a

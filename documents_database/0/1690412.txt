not to be rejected so easily venusita visits saurina irma serrano the sorceress who comes up with a spell that kills off the merchant and zaps the son back home but venusita s problems are far from over the movie is about witchcraft and a passion thriller around it it was written by a very known mexican writer hugo arg elles in conjunction with isela vega great actors appear in the movie including emilio fern ndez and the always enigmatic irma serrano who is already celebrity of its own this film passed unnoticed in mexico in part thanks to the lousy distribution system of that time which used to privilege the foreign movies nowadays there are no longer mexican movies so the distributors no longer have the concern of programming mexican movies the movie could have turned into a cult movie it has a good plot good intentions interesting actors and low budget

macroemulsions scatter light effectively and therefore appear milky because their droplets are greater than a wavelength of light they are part of a larger family of emulsions along with microemulsions as with all emulsions one phase serves as the dispersing agent it is often called the continuous or outer phase the remaining phase s are disperse or inner phase s because the liquid droplets are finely distributed amongst the larger continuous phase droplets this type of emulsion is thermodynamically unstable but can be stabilized for a period of time with applications of kinetic energy surfactants emulsifiers are used to reduce the interfacial tension between the two layers and induce macroemulsion stability for a useful amount of time macroemulsions can be divided into two main categories based on if they are a single emulsion or a double or multiple emulsion group both categories will be described using a typical oil o and water w immiscible fluid pairing single emulsions can be sub divided into two different types for each single emulsion a single surfactant stabilizing layer exists as a buffer in between the two layers in o w oil droplets are dispersed in water on the other hand w o involves

all infrastructure would be built to high speed shinkansen standards including its wider loading gauge 4 000 m minimum curve radius and total grade separation with the ability to convert the lines to in the future although they would be slower than regular shinkansen train they will have a speed of more than 200 km h enabling some reductions in journey times to be achieved and total construction expenditure could be spread over a longer period with travel times gradually reduced as more sections are completed the ultimate goal is eventual conversion to standard gauge shinkansen track once the entire line is completed but with gauge change trains gcts it may be possible in the future to upgrade these sections to full shinkansen specifications even while inter operation with conventional lines remains in place in 1991 the super tokky concept was formally planned to be used as part of the following three shinkansen extensions these schemes were subsequently constructed to full shinkansen specification lines the west kyushu shinkansen route to nagasaki was also initially proposed as a super tokky line from takeo onsen however after construction commenced the proposal changed to incorporate gcts resulting in the takeo onsen to nagasaki

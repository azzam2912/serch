it processes microwave data from a variety of nasa satellites most of their research is supported by the earth science enterprise program the company is based in santa rosa california they are a widely cited source of data on the satellite temperature record their data is one source of evidence for global warming research by carl mears matthias schabel and wentz all of rss highlighted errors in the early satellite temperature records compiled by john christy and roy spencer at uah the uah data had previously showed no significant temperature trend bringing the derived satellite data into closer agreement with surface temperature trends radiosonde data and computer models the uah data is now closer to the rss data but differences remain for example the lower troposphere global average trend since 1979 rss currently have 0 133k decade while uah have 0 140k decade while the mid troposphere difference is even more marked at 0 079k decade and 0 052k decade respectively however in a recent online youtube video dr carl mears a senior scientist with the team behind the satellite data explained how he believes his data set needed correction i would have to say that the surface data seems

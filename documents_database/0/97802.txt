it is the process of coating iron and steel with zinc which alloys with the surface of the base metal when immersing the metal in a bath of molten zinc at a temperature of around when exposed to the atmosphere the pure zinc zn reacts with oxygen o to form zinc oxide zno which further reacts with carbon dioxide co to form zinc carbonate znco a usually dull grey fairly strong material that protects the steel underneath from further corrosion in many circumstances galvanized steel is widely used in applications where corrosion resistance is needed without the cost of stainless steel and is considered superior in terms of cost and life cycle it can be identified by the crystallization patterning on the surface often called a spangle galvanized steel can be welded however one must exercise caution around the resulting toxic zinc fumes galvanized steel is suitable for high temperature applications of up to the use of galvanized steel at temperatures above this will result in peeling of the zinc at the inter metallic layer electrogalvanized sheet steel is often used in automotive manufacturing to enhance the corrosion performance of exterior body panels this is however a completely different process

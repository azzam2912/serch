experimentation in animals began in the early 1900s no lasting successes have been achieved there are three main technical challenges as with any organ transplant managing the immune response to avoid transplant rejection is necessary also the brain is highly dependent on continuous flow of blood to provide oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products with damage setting in quickly at normal temperatures when blood flow is cut off finally managing the nervous systems in both the body and the head is essential in several ways the autonomic nervous system controls essential functions like breathing and the heart beating and is governed largely by the brain stem if the recipient body s head is removed this can no longer function additionally each nerve coming out of the head via the spinal cord needs to be connected to the putatively corresponding nerve in the recipient body s spinal cord in order for the brain to control movement and receive sensory information finally the risk of systematic neuropathic pain is high and had largely been unaddressed in research of these challenges dealing with blood supply and transplant rejection have been addressed in the field of transplant medicine generally making transplantation of several

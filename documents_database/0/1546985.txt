although the concerted photochemical 2 2 cycloaddition is allowed the reaction between enones and alkenes is stepwise and involves discrete diradical intermediates in 1908 it was reported that exposure of carvone to italian sunlight for one year gives camphor subsequent investigations demonstrated the utility of the photochemical 2 2 cycloaddition of enones to alkenes in spite of the stepwise radical mechanism both stereoselective intra and intermolecular variants have emerged cyclic enones are employed otherwise competitive cis trans isomerization ensues the mechanism of 2 2 photocyclization is proposed to begin with photoexcitation of the enone to a singlet excited state the singlet state is typically very short lived and decays by intersystem crossing to the triplet state at this point the enone forms an exciplex with the ground state alkene eventually giving the triplet diradical spin inversion to the singlet diradical allows closure to the cyclobutane as an alternative a pericyclic reaction mechanism is proposed in which after intersystem crossing a radical cation and a radical anion are formed which then recombine to the cyclobutane enone alkene cycloadditions can produce two isomers depending on the orientation of substituents on the alkene and the enone carbonyl group when the enone carbonyl and

it is located at the paul scherrer institute and began taking data september 2008 meg uses a continuous muon beam 3 10 s incident on a plastic target the decay is reconstructed to look for a back to back positron and monochromatic photon 52 8 mev a liquid xenon scintillator with photomultiplier tubes measure the photon energy and a drift chamber in a magnetic field detects the positrons in may 2016 the meg experiment published the world s leading upper limit on the branching ratio of this decay formula 1 at 90 confidence level based on data collected in 2009 2013 this improved the meg limit from the prior mega experiment by a factor of about 28 the meg collaboration presented upgrade plans for meg ii at the particles and nuclei international conference 2014 with an order more sensitivity and increased muon production to begin data taking in 2017 more experiments are planned to explore rare muon transitions such as mu2e and mu3e

as of april 14 2014 one year after zhang s announcement according to the polymath project wiki n has been reduced to 246 further assuming the elliott halberstam conjecture and its generalized form the polymath project wiki states that n has been reduced to 12 and 6 respectively for n 2 it is the twin prime conjecture for n 4 it says there are infinitely many cousin primes p p 4 for n 6 it says there are infinitely many sexy primes p p 6 with no prime between p and p 6 dickson s conjecture generalizes polignac s conjecture to cover all prime constellations let formula 1 for even n be the number of prime gaps of size n below x the first hardy littlewood conjecture says the asymptotic density is of form where c is a function of n and formula 3 means that the quotient of two expressions tends to 1 as x approaches infinity c is the twin prime constant where the product extends over all prime numbers p 3 c is c multiplied by a number which depends on the odd prime factors q of n for example c c and c 2 c twin

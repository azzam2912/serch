it is the largest assembly of sunpower c7 tracker low concentration pv lcpv technology in the united states the facility was constructed for apple inc to service its reno technology park data center the project occupies 137 acres adjacent to nv energy s 226 mw natural gas fueled fort churchill generating station in the mason valley sunpower constructed the project using 1 248 of its second generation single axis c7 tracker systems the system reflects direct sunlight in order to concentrate it by a factor of seven onto high efficiency 22 8 at 7x concentration mono crystalline silicon solar cells apple initiated the project with sunpower and nv energy for the main purpose of supplying its growing data center business in the state with 100 renewable energy the resulting arrangement is unusual in that apple owns the facility leases it to nv energy to operate and maintain under a 20 year contract then repurchases the power through the nv greenenergy rider opportunity sunpower s high efficiency solar cell technology was originally developed to meet the more rigorous demands of lcpv despite having a much greater success in the flat panel pv market in the u s in late 2011 sunpower

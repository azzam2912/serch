this gene encodes an alpha actinin isoform that is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscles and functions to anchor myofibrillar actin thin filaments and titin to z discs alpha actinin 2 is a 103 8 kda protein composed of 894 amino acids each molecule is rod shaped 35 nm in length and it homodimerizes in an anti parallel fashion each monomer has an n terminal actin binding region composed of two calponin homology domains two c terminal ef hand domains and four tandem spectrin like repeats form the rod domain in the central region of the molecule the high resolution crystal structure of human alpha actinin 2 at 3 5 was recently resolved alpha actinins belong to the spectrin gene superfamily which represents a diverse group of actin binding cytoskeletal proteins including spectrin dystrophin utrophin and fimbrin skeletal cardiac and smooth muscle isoforms are localized to the z disc and analogous dense bodies where they help anchor the myofibrillar actin filaments alpha actinin 2 has been shown to interact with kcna5 dlg1 disc1 myoz1 grin2b adam12 actn3 mypn pdlim3 pkn myot ttn nmdar synpo2 ldb3 and fatz the primary function of alpha actinin 2 is to crosslink filamentous actin

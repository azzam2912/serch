their name derives from their initial isolation from human adenoids in 1953 they have a broad range of vertebrate hosts in humans more than 50 distinct adenoviral serotypes have been found to cause a wide range of illnesses from mild respiratory infections in young children known as the common cold to life threatening multi organ disease in people with a weakened immune system group dsdna this family contains the following genera classification of adenoviridae can be complex in humans there are 57 accepted human adenovirus types hadv 1 to 57 in seven species human adenovirus a to g different types serotypes are associated with different conditions when not restricting the subject to human viruses adenoviridae can be divided into five genera mastadenovirus aviadenovirus atadenovirus siadenovirus and ichtadenovirus adenoviruses represent the largest known nonenveloped viruses they are able to be transported through the endosome i e envelope fusion is not necessary the virion also has a unique spike or fiber associated with each penton base of the capsid see picture below that aids in attachment to the host cell via the receptor on the surface of the host cell see replication section below for discussion of diverse receptors in 2010 scientists

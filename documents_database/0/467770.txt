the earliest trilobites in the fossil record are arguably olenellina although the earliest redlichiina and eodiscina follow quickly the suborder died out when the lower passed into the middle cambrian at the end of the stage called toyonian a feature uniting the olenellina is the lack of rupture lines or sutures in the headshield which in other trilobites assist the periodic moulting or ecdysis associated with arthropod growth some derived trilobites have lost facial sutures again some eodiscina all agnostina and a few phacopina but all of these are blind while all olenellina have eyes the suborder contains four superfamilies olenelloidea with 3 families and 5 stemgroup genera judomioidea with 1 family and 3 stemgroup genera nevadioidea and fallotaspidoidea with 3 families and 3 stemgroup genera lieberman 2002 considered that the fallotaspidoidea are a paraphyletic group because it gave rise to the redlichiina he did not propose to restrict the olenellina to the olenelloidea judomioidea and nevadioidea neither did he propose to assign this group of superfamilies to a newly formed order olenellida and consequently expand the redlichiina to include the fallotaspidoidea this would imply that the redlichiina would include taxa with and without dorsal sutures the olenellina appear suddenly

ions with sufficient internal energy may fragment in a mass spectrometer which in some cases may degrade the mass spectrometer performance but in other cases such as tandem mass spectrometry the fragmentation can reveal information about the structure of the ion a wahrhaftig diagram named after austin l wahrhaftig illustrates the relative contributions in unimolecular ion decomposition of direct fragmentation and fragmentation following rearrangement the x axis of the diagram represents the internal energy of the ion the lower part of the diagram shows the logarithm of the rate constant k for unimolecular dissociation whereas the upper portion of the diagram indicates the probability of forming a particular product ion the green trace in the lower part of the diagram indicates the rate of the rearrangement reaction given by and the blue trace indicates the direct cleavage reaction a rate constant of 10 s is sufficiently fast for ion decomposition within the ion source of a typical mass spectrometer ions with rate constants less than 10 s and greater than approximately 10 s lifetimes between 10 and 10 s have a high probability of decomposing in the mass spectrometer between the ion source and the detector these rate constants are

they are used as part of an optical path to filter the incoming light to allow frequencies of interest to pass while reflecting other frequencies of light metal mesh filters have many applications for use in the far infrared fir and submillimeter regions of the electromagnetic spectrum these filters have been used in fir and submillimeter astronomical instruments for over 4 decades in which they serve two main purposes bandpass or low pass filters are cooled and used to lower the noise equivalent power of cryogenic bolometers detectors by blocking excess thermal radiation outside of the frequency band of observation and bandpass filters can be used to define the observation band of the detectors metal mesh filters can also be designed for use at 45 to split an incoming optical signal into several observation paths or for use as a polarizing half wave plate transmission line theory can be applied to metallic meshes to understand how they work and the overall light transmission properties of groups of metallic meshes grouped together modeling the properties of these metallic meshes allows for reliable manufacture of filters with the desired transmission properties in 1967 ulrich showed that the optical transmission properties of a

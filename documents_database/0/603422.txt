the implementation of both approaches on the same network can be problematic however resolving such names via unicast dns servers has fallen into disfavor as computers printers and other devices implementing zero configuration networking zeroconf have become increasingly common the internet engineering task force ietf standards track rfc 6762 february 20 2013 reserves the use of the domain name label local as a pseudo top level domain for hostnames in local area networks that can be resolved via the multicast dns name resolution protocol any dns query for a name ending with the label local must be sent to the mdns ipv4 link local multicast address 224 0 0 251 or its ipv6 equivalent ff02 fb domain name ending in local may be resolved concurrently via other mechanisms for example unicast dns rfc 6762 was authored by apple inc employees stuart cheshire and marc krochmal and apple s bonjour zeroconf networking software implements mdns that service will automatically resolve the private ip addresses of link local macintosh computers running macos and mobile devices running ios if local is appended to their hostnames in addition bonjour devices will use those local hostnames when advertising services to dns service discovery clients most

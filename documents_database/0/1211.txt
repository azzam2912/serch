it exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice the hexagonal form corresponding to graphite is the most stable and soft among bn polymorphs and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products the cubic sphalerite structure variety analogous to diamond is called c bn it is softer than diamond but its thermal and chemical stability is superior the rare wurtzite bn modification is similar to lonsdaleite but slightly softer than the cubic form because of excellent thermal and chemical stability boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high temperature equipment boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology nanotubes of bn can be produced that have a structure similar to that of carbon nanotubes i e graphene or bn sheets rolled on themselves but the properties are very different boron nitride exists in multiple forms that differ in the arrangement of the boron and nitrogen atoms giving rise to varying bulk properties of the material the amorphous form of boron nitride a bn is non crystalline lacking any long distance regularity in the arrangement of its atoms it is analogous to amorphous carbon all other forms of boron

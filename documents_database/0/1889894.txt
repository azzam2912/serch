current loops can be used over moderately long distances tens of kilometres and can be interfaced with optically isolated links long before the rs 232 standard current loops were used to send digital data in serial form for teleprinters more than two teleprinters could be connected on a single circuit allowing a simple form of networking older teleprinters used a 60 ma current loop later machines such as the teletype model 33 operated on a lower 20 ma current level and most early minicomputers featured a 20 ma current loop interface with an rs 232 port generally available as a more expensive option the original ibm pc serial port card had provisions for a 20 ma current loop a digital current loop uses the absence of current for high space or break and the presence of current in the loop for low mark this is done to ensure that on normal conditions there is always current flowing and in the event of a line being cut the flow stops indefinitely immediately raising the alarm of the event usually as the heavy noise of the teleprinter not being synchronized something that would not have been possible if the idle state had

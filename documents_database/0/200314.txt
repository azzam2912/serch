in particular the property of being a gr bner basis is always relative to a specific monomial order besides respecting multiplication monomial orders are often required to be well orders since this ensures the multivariate division procedure will terminate there are however practical applications also for multiplication respecting order relations on the set of monomials that are not well orders in the case of finitely many variables well ordering of a monomial order is equivalent to the conjunction of the following two conditions since these conditions may be easier to verify for a monomial order defined through an explicit rule than to directly prove it is a well ordering they are sometimes preferred in definitions of monomial order the choice of a total order on the monomials allows sorting the terms of a polynomial the leading term of a polynomial is thus the term of the largest monomial for the chosen monomial ordering concretely let be any ring of polynomials then the set of the monic monomials in is a basis of considered as a vector space over the field of the coefficients thus any nonzero polynomial in has a unique expression formula 5 as a linear combination of monomials

state diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states sometimes this is indeed the case while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction many forms of state diagrams exist which differ slightly and have different semantics state diagrams are used to give an abstract description of the behavior of a system this behavior is analyzed and represented as a series of events that can occur in one or more possible states hereby each diagram usually represents objects of a single class and track the different states of its objects through the system state diagrams can be used to graphically represent finite state machines this was introduced by c e shannon and w weaver in their 1949 book the mathematical theory of communication another source is taylor booth in his 1967 book sequential machines and automata theory another possible representation is the state transition table a classic form of state diagram for a finite state machine or finite automaton fa is a directed graph with the following elements q z q f the output function represents the mapping of ordered pairs of input symbols and states onto output symbols denoted mathematically as q z

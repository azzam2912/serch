it is the main air traffic control system for the airspace around airports at large airports it typically controls traffic within a radius of 60 miles 96 km of the airport below an elevation of 25 000 feet the sophisticated systems at large airports consist of two different radar systems the primary and secondary surveillance radar the primary radar typically consists of a large rotating parabolic antenna dish that sweeps a vertical fan shaped beam of microwaves around the airspace surrounding the airport it detects the position and range of aircraft by microwaves reflected back to the antenna from the aircraft s surface in the us the primary radar operates at a frequency of 2 7 2 9 ghz in the s band with a peak radiated power of 25 kw and an average power of 2 1 kw the secondary surveillance radar consists of a second rotating antenna often mounted on the primary antenna which interrogates the transponders of aircraft which transmits a radio signal back containing the aircraft s identification barometric altitude and an emergency status code which is displayed on the radar screen next to the return from the primary radar it operates at a frequency of

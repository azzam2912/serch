the encoded protein is a ca permeable nonselective cation channel that has been found involved in multiple physiologic functions dysfunctions and also disease it functions in the regulation of systemic osmotic pressure by the brain in vascular function in liver intestinal renal and bladder function in skin barrier function and response of the skin to ultraviolet b radiation in growth and structural integrity of the skeleton in function of joints in airway and lung function in retinal and inner ear function and in pain the channel is activated by osmotic mechanical and chemical cues it also responds to thermal changes warmth channel activation can be sensitized by inflammation and injury the trpv4 gene has been co discovered by w liedtke et al and r strotmann et al channelopathy mutations in the trpv4 gene lead to skeletal dysplasias premature osteoarthritis and neurological motor function disorders and are associated with a range of disorders including brachyolmia type 3 congenital distal spinal muscular atrophy scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy and subtype 2c of charcot marie tooth disease a number of trpv4 agonists and antagonists have been identified since its discovery the discovery of unselective modulators e g antagonist ruthenium red was followed by the

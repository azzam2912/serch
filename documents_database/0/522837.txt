in recent decades the set of associated assumptions supporting a thesis sometimes is called a bundle of hypotheses the duhem quine thesis argues that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions instead deriving predictions from the hypothesis typically requires background assumptions that several other hypotheses are correct for example that an experiment works as predicted or that previous scientific theory is sufficiently accurate for instance as evidence against the idea that the earth is in motion some people objected that birds did not get thrown off into the sky whenever they let go of a tree branch later theories of physics and astronomy such as classical and relativistic mechanics could account for such observations without positing a fixed earth and in due course they replaced the static earth auxiliary hypotheses and initial conditions although a bundle of hypotheses i e a hypothesis and its background assumptions as a whole can be tested against the empirical world and be falsified if it fails the test the duhem quine thesis says it is impossible to isolate a single hypothesis in the bundle one solution to the dilemma thus facing scientists is that when we have rational reasons to accept

waterproofing a basement that is below ground level can require the application of sealant materials the installation of drains and sump pumps and more waterproofing is usually required by building codes for structures that are built at or below ground level waterproofing and drainage considerations are especially important in cases where ground water is likely to build up in the soil or where there is a high water table water in the soil causes hydrostatic pressure to be exerted underneath basement floors and walls this hydrostatic pressure can force water in through cracks which can cause major structural damage as well as mold decay and other moisture related problems several measures exist to prevent water from penetrating a basement foundation or to divert water that has penetrated a foundation in poured concrete foundations cracks and pipe penetrations are the most common entry points for seepage these openings can be sealed from the interior epoxies which are strong adhesives or urethanes can be pressure injected into the openings thus penetrating the foundation through to the exterior and cutting off the path of the seepage in masonry foundations interior sealers will not provide permanent protection from water infiltration where hydrostatic pressure is

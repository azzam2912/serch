it is denoted by formula 3 or formula 4 or formula 5 the cremona group is naturally identified with the automorphism group formula 6 of the field of the rational functions in formula 1 indeterminates over formula 2 or in other words a pure transcendental extension of formula 2 with transcendence degree formula 1 the projective general linear group of order formula 11 of projective transformations is contained in the cremona group of order formula 1 the two are equal only when formula 13 or formula 14 in which case both the numerator and the denominator of a transformation must be linear in two dimensions max noether and castelnuovo showed that the complex cremona group is generated by the standard quadratic transformation along with formula 15 though there was some controversy about whether their proofs were correct and gave a complete set of relations for these generators the structure of this group is still not well understood though there has been a lot of work on finding elements or subgroups of it there is little known about the structure of the cremona group in three dimensions and higher though many elements of it have been described showed that it is

in other words h is a hypertree if there exists a tree t such that every hyperedge of h is the set of vertices of a connected subtree of t hypertrees have also been called arboreal hypergraphs or tree hypergraphs every tree t is itself a hypertree t itself can be used as the host graph and every edge of t is a subtree of this host graph therefore hypertrees may be seen as a generalization of the notion of a tree for hypergraphs they include the connected berge acyclic hypergraphs which have also been used as a different generalization of trees for hypergraphs every hypertree has the helly property 2 helly property if a subset s of its hyperedges has the property that every two hyperedges in s have a nonempty intersection then s itself has a nonempty intersection a vertex that belongs to all hyperedges in s by results of duchet flament and slater hypertrees may be equivalently characterized in the following ways it is possible to recognize hypertrees as duals of alpha acyclic hypergraphs in linear time the exact cover problem finding a set of non overlapping hyperedges that covers all the vertices is solvable in polynomial

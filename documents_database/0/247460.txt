it was designed and operated by michael j freedman coral used the bandwidth of a worldwide network of web proxies and name servers to mirror world wide web content often to avoid the slashdot effect or to reduce the load on web servers coral avoided high loads on individual nodes through an indexing abstraction called a distributed sloppy hash table dsht dshts create self organizing clusters of nodes which fetch information from each other to avoid communicating with more distant or heavily loaded servers dsht is described in the paper sloppy hashing and self organizing clusters the sloppy hash table refers to the fact that coral was made up of concentric rings of distributed hash tables dhts each ring representing a wider and wider geographic range or rather ping range the dhts are composed of nodes all within some latency of each other for example a ring of nodes within 20 milliseconds of each other it avoids hot spots the sloppy part by only continuing to query progressively larger sized rings if they are not overburdened in other words if the two top most rings are experiencing too much traffic a node will just ping closer ones when a node

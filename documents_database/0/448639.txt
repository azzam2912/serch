because of their high potency and selectivity for potassium channels dendrotoxins have proven to be extremely useful as pharmacological tools for studying the structure and function of these ion channel proteins dendrotoxins have been shown to block particular subtypes of voltage gated potassium k channels in neuronal tissue in the nervous system voltage gated k channels control the excitability of nerves and muscles by controlling the resting membrane potential and by repolarizing the membrane during action potentials dendrotoxin has been shown to bind the nodes of ranvier of motor neurons and to block the activity of these potassium channels in this way dendrotoxins prolong the duration of action potentials and increase acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction which may result in muscle hyperexcitability and convulsive symptoms dendrotoxins are 7kda proteins consisting of a single peptide chain of approximately 57 60 amino acids several homologues of alpha dendrotoxin have been isolated all possessing a slightly different sequence however the molecular architecture and folding conformation of these proteins are all very similar dendrotoxins possess a very short 3 helix near the n terminus of the peptide while a two turn alpha helix occurs near the c terminus a two stranded antiparallel sheet

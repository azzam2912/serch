the formula is chnos it is also known as potassium channel toxin alpha ktx 1 3 or ibtx the complete amino acid sequence has been defined and it displays 68 sequence homology with charybdotoxin iberiotoxin binds to the outer face of the large conductance calcium activated potassium channels maxik or bk channels with high affinity kd 1 nm it selectively inhibits the current by decreasing both the probability of opening and the open time of the channel the venom produces mainly cardiopulmonary abnormalities like circulatory derangements myocarditis and changes in cardiac sarcolemmal atpase and by these abnormalities it can finally cause death in rural india the scorpion and its venom is a commonly known factor of children s death the venom initially causes transient cholinergic stimulation vomiting profuse sweating bradycardia priapism hypersalivation and hypotension which is followed by sustained adrenergic hyperactivity hypertension tachycardia and myocardial failure the adrenergic phase but not the cholinergic phase is a dose dependent phenomenon treatment is mainly symptomatic local pain is treated by injecting dehydroemetine at the site of the sting hypovolaemia is corrected by oral rehydration solution agitated confused and non cooperative patients are given a 5 dextrose saline drip patients with hypertension on

he studied mathematics and theoretical physics at the university of oxford where he earned his bachelor of arts and went on to earn his doctorate at princeton university while at the institute for advanced study in princeton hoffmann collaborated with einstein and leopold infeld on the classic paper gravitational equations and the problem of motion einstein s original work on general relativity was based on two ideas the first was the equation of motion a particle would follow the shortest path in four dimensional space time the second was how matter affects the geometry of space time what einstein infeld and hoffmann showed was that the equation of motion followed directly from the field equation that defined the geometry see main article in 1937 hoffmann joined the mathematics department of queens college part of the city university of new york where he remained till the late 1970s he retired in the 1960s but continued to teach one course a semester in the fall a course on classical and quantum mechanics and in the spring one on the special and general theories of relativity he died on 5 august 1986 one of the queens college mathematics department s honors for graduating

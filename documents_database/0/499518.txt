in ordinary arithmetic the number 0 does not have a sign so that 0 0 and 0 are identical however in computing some number representations allow for the existence of two zeros often denoted by 0 negative zero and 0 positive zero regarded as equal by the numerical comparison operations but with possible different behaviors in particular operations this occurs in the sign and magnitude and ones complement signed number representations for integers and in most floating point number representations the number 0 is usually encoded as 0 but can be represented by either 0 or 0 the ieee 754 standard for floating point arithmetic presently used by most computers and programming languages that support floating point numbers requires both 0 and 0 real arithmetic with signed zeros can be considered a variant of the extended real number line such that 1 0 and 1 0 division is only undefined for 0 0 and negatively signed zero echoes the mathematical analysis concept of approaching 0 from below as a one sided limit which may be denoted by x 0 x 0 or x 0 the notation 0 may be used informally to denote a small negative number that has been

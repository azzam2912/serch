these smaller transforms of size n and n can then be evaluated by applying pfa recursively or by using some other fft algorithm pfa should not be confused with the mixed radix generalization of the popular cooley tukey algorithm which also subdivides a dft of size n n n into smaller transforms of size n and n the latter algorithm can use any factors not necessarily relatively prime but it has the disadvantage that it also requires extra multiplications by roots of unity called twiddle factors in addition to the smaller transforms on the other hand pfa has the disadvantages that it only works for relatively prime factors e g it is useless for power of two sizes and that it requires a more complicated re indexing of the data based on the chinese remainder theorem crt note however that pfa can be combined with mixed radix cooley tukey with the former factorizing n into relatively prime components and the latter handling repeated factors pfa is also closely related to the nested winograd fft algorithm where the latter performs the decomposed n by n transform via more sophisticated two dimensional convolution techniques some older papers therefore also call winograd s

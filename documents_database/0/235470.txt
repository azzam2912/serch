the classical statement of the k nneth theorem relates the singular homology of two topological spaces x and y and their product space formula 1 in the simplest possible case the relationship is that of a tensor product but for applications it is very often necessary to apply certain tools of homological algebra to express the answer a k nneth theorem or k nneth formula is true in many different homology and cohomology theories and the name has become generic these many results are named for the german mathematician hermann k nneth let x and y be two topological spaces in general one uses singular homology but if x and y happen to be cw complexes then this can be replaced by cellular homology because that is isomorphic to singular homology the simplest case is when the coefficient ring for homology is a field f in this situation the k nneth theorem for singular homology states that for any integer k furthermore the isomorphism is a natural isomorphism the map from the sum to the homology group of the product is called the cross product more precisely there is a cross product operation by which an i cycle on x

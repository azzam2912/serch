the field has also been referred to as exercise genomics or exercisenomics areas of study within kinesiogenomics include the role of gene sequence variation i e alleles in sport performance identification of genes and their different alleles that contribute to the response and adaptation of the body s tissue systems e g muscles heart metabolism etc to various exercise related stimuli the use of genetic testing to predict sport performance or individualize exercise prescription and gene doping the potential for genetic therapy to be used to enhance sport performance the field of kinesiogenomics is relatively new though two books have outlined basic concepts a regularly published review article entitled the human gene map for performance and health related fitness phenotypes describes the genes that have been studied in relation to specific exercise and fitness related traits the most recent seventh update was published in 2009 within the field of kinesiogenomics several research studies have been conducted in recent years this increase in research has led to advancements of knowledge in associating how genes and gene sequencing effects a person s exercise habits and health one study focusing on twins looked to see the effect of genes on exercise ability the

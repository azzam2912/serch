this signal may be in the form of an action potential if the chemoreceptor is a neuron nerve cell or in the form of a neurotransmitter that can activate a nearby nerve fiber if the chemosensor is a specialized sensory receptor cell such as the taste receptor in a taste bud or in an internal peripheral chemoreceptor such as the carotid body ex in chemotherapy in more general terms a chemosensor detects toxic or hazardous chemicals in the internal or external environment of the human body e x chemotherapy and transmits that information to the central nervous system and rarely the peripheral nervous system in order to expel the biologically active toxins from the blood and prevent further consumption of alcohol and or other acutely toxic recreational intoxicants plants have various mechanisms to perceive danger in their environment plants are able to detect pathogens and microbes through surface level receptor kinases prk additionally receptor like proteins rlps containing ligand binding receptor domains capture pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps and damage associated molecular patterns damps which consequently initiates the plant s innate immunity for a defense response plant receptor kinases are also used for growth and hormone induction among other important

it is a small compact device only 5mm by 5mm and measures acceleration in the x y and z axes it was developed by the army research laboratory for the purposes of traumatic brain injury tbi research and was first introduced in 2012 at the 25th international conference on micro electro mechanical systems mems the three axis acceleration switch was designed to obtain acceleration data more effectively than a conventional accelerometer in order to more accurately characterize the forces and shocks responsible for tbi while miniature accelerometers require a constant power draw the three axis acceleration switch only draws current when it senses an acceleration event using up less energy and allowing the use of smaller batteries the three axis acceleration switch has shown to exhibit an expected battery lifetime that is about 100 times better than that of a digital accelerometer in return however the acceleration switch has a lower resolution than that of a digital or analog accelerometer one potential application of the three axis acceleration switch is in studying the head impacts of players in high risk contact sports due to the size of conventional accelerometers measuring the acceleration requires the device to be implemented inside the

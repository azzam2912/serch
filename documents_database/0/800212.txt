it is similar in spirit to a nonce word hence the name it is often a random or pseudo random number issued in an authentication protocol to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks they can also be useful as initialization vectors and in cryptographic hash functions a nonce is an arbitrary number used only once in a cryptographic communication in the spirit of a nonce word they are often random or pseudo random numbers many nonces also include a timestamp to ensure exact timeliness though this requires clock synchronization between organizations the addition of a client nonce cnonce helps to improve the security in some ways as implemented in digest access authentication to ensure that a nonce is used only once it should be time variant including a suitably fine grained timestamp in its value or generated with enough random bits to ensure a probabilistically insignificant chance of repeating a previously generated value some authors define pseudo randomness or unpredictability as a requirement for a nonce authentication protocols may use nonces to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks for instance nonces are used in http digest access authentication to calculate an md5

lfrts are one of the fastest growing categories in thermoplastic technologies leading this expansion is one of the oldest forms glass mat thermoplastic gmt and two of the segment s newest precompounded pelletized lfrts long fiber reinforced thermoplastics also known as lfts and inline compounded ilc or direct lfts d lfts lfrts differ from the composite structures used in the aerospace industry for components such as aircraft parts the fibers in lfrts are relatively short 6 35 mm 0 25 in or greater compared to the fibres contained in composite aircraft components high performance composites usually contain fibers as long as the component itself 6 metres or longer their structural properties and low cost per part have enabled lfrts to replace metal parts in the automotive industry in addition some new organic fibers can even be recyclable with the independence of choosing the reinforcement from a wide range of fibers and the matrix from a wide range of thermoplastics polymer in the lfrts its property can be changed according to customer needs lfrts have become an increasingly valuable and popular part of building envelope components such as windows and doors lfrt components or semi finished products are made by compression

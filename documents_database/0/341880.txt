his thesis project was to build a compiler for the elan programming language which had been launched for teaching programming in german schools the compiler was written in elan itself after his graduation in 1977 he remained at bielefeld and worked on an elan environment for the zilog z80 microprocessor this required a run time environment which he called eumel extendable multiuser microprocessor elan system but also a colloquial north german term for a likeable fool eumel grew into a complete multi tasking multi user operating system supporting orthogonal persistence which started shipping in 1980 and was later ported to zilog z8000 motorola 68000 and intel 8086 processors as these processors lacked memory protection eumel implemented a virtual machine which added the features missing from the hardware more than 2000 eumel systems shipped mostly to schools but also to legal practices as a text processing platform in 1984 he joined the gmd the german national research center for computer science which is now a part of the fraunhofer society where he continued his work on eumel in 1987 when microprocessors supporting virtual memory became widely available in the form of the intel 80386 liedtke started to design a new operating

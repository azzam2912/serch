groups range in size from 2 16 adults but pairs are rare the species is sexually monomorphic with males and females indistinguishable from physical characteristics each group comprises a dominant breeding pair that monopolise access to breeding opportunities recent genetic research has confirmed that these dominant pairs are responsible for more than 95 of young hatched occasional mixed parentage has been observed but is predictable in most cases subordinates primarily gain parentage when a new unrelated immigrant disperses into the group or a new group is founded all group members cooperate to help raise the young hatched from a single clutch clutch size varies between two and five with a modal clutch size of three cooperative behaviours include provisioning young both in the nest and post fledging sentinel behaviour territory border defense teaching behaviour and babysitting behaviour where semi independent fledglings follow adults between foraging sites and away from predators the breeding season extends from late september to early april although this varies between years and is strongly rain dependent groups can raise up to three successful clutches per breeding season average incubation time is 14 days and average time between hatching and fledging is 16 days fledging time varies

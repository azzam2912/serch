the company a division of northern cable had television and radio holdings in northeastern ontario mid canada television or mctv was created in 1980 when cambrian broadcasting which owned the ctv affiliates in sudbury north bay and timmins merged with j conrad lavigne s cbc affiliates in the same cities this twinstick structure was permitted by the canadian radio television and telecommunications commission because both companies were on the brink of bankruptcy due to their aggressive competition for limited advertising dollars in small markets notably the companies holdings included two parallel microwave transmission systems both of which were among the largest such systems in the world at the time and which were technically redundant since one system can in fact carry multiple channels the deal represented the first time that the crtc had ever approved direct ownership of a radio or television broadcast outlet by a cable distribution company which is now commonplace in canada but was explicitly forbidden by crtc policy prior to the mctv approval in its decision however the crtc explicitly stated that the merger was approved as a temporary arrangement only until the cbc could afford to directly acquire mctv s cbc affiliates that temporary deal

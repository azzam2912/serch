it orbits in the cybele group in the far outer asteroid belt as an asteroid of the dark c spectral type it is probably composed of carbonaceous materials in 2002 a small moon was found to be orbiting hermione hermione was discovered by j c watson on 12 may 1872 from ann arbor michigan in the united states and named after hermione daughter of menelaus and helen in greek mythology the asteroid has a bi lobed shape as evidenced by adaptive optics images the first of which were taken in december 2003 with the keck telescope of several proposed shape models that agreed with the images a snowman like shape was found to best fit the observed precession rate of hermione s satellite in this snowman model the asteroid s shape can be approximated by two partially overlapping spheres of radii 80 and 60 km whose centers are separated by a distance of 115 km a simple ellipsoid shape was ruled out observation of the satellite s orbit has made possible an accurate determination of hermione s mass for the best fit snowman model the density is found to be 1 8 0 2 g cm giving a porosity on

michael steele suppose that we have a function formula 24 and a change of variables formula 25 such that there exist functions formula 26 such that and functions formula 29 such that and furthermore such that and in other words it is helpful for there to be a bijection between the old set of variables and the new one or else one has to if a bijection does not exist then the solution to the reduced form equation will not in general be a solution of the original equation we are discussing change of variable for pdes a pde can be expressed as a differential operator applied to a function suppose formula 36 is a differential operator such that then it is also the case that where and we operate as follows to go from formula 37 to formula 41 in the context of pdes weizhang huang and robert d russell define and explain the different possible time dependent transformations in details often theory can establish the existence of a change of variables although the formula itself cannot be explicitly stated for an integrable hamiltonian system of dimension formula 57 with formula 58 and formula 59 there exist formula 57

for example in the pythagorean triple 3 4 and 5 formula 2 if 3 and 4 are colored red then 5 must be colored blue marijn heule oliver kullmann and victor marek investigated the problem and showed that such a coloring is only possible up to the number 7824 the actual statement of the theorem proved is there are colorings for the numbers up to 7825 these possible colorings were logically and algorithmically narrowed down to around a trillion still highly complex cases and those were examined using a boolean satisfiability solver creating the proof took about 4 cpu years of computation over a period of two days on the stampede supercomputer at the texas advanced computing center and generated a 200 terabyte propositional proof which was compressed to 68 gigabytes the paper describing the proof was published on arxiv on 3 may 2016 and has been accepted for the sat 2016 conference where it won the best paper award in the 1980s ronald graham offered a 100 prize for the solution of the problem which has now been awarded to marijn heule

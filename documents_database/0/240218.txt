when referenced in the chemistry research literature description of the use of this technique and equipment may include the phrase rotary evaporator though use is often rather signaled by other language e g the sample was evaporated under reduced pressure rotary evaporators are also used in molecular cooking for the preparation of distillates and extracts a simple rotary evaporator system was invented by lyman c craig it was first commercialized by the swiss company b chi in 1957 in research the most common form is the 1l bench top unit whereas large scale e g 20l 50l versions are used in pilot plants in commercial chemical operations the main components of a rotary evaporator are the vacuum system used with rotary evaporators can be as simple as a water aspirator with a trap immersed in a cold bath for non toxic solvents or as complex as a regulated mechanical vacuum pump with refrigerated trap glassware used in the vapor stream and condenser can be simple or complex depending upon the goals of the evaporation and any propensities the dissolved compounds might give to the mixture e g to foam or bump commercial instruments are available that include the basic features

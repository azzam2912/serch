it is the c3 sulfamate ester of the estrogen estrone unlike other estrogen esters however emate is not an effective prodrug of estrogens a closely related compound is estradiol sulfamate e2mate which is extensively metabolized into emate and has similar properties to it emate shows high bioavailability and undergoes little or no first pass metabolism with oral administration the sulfamate moiety of emate results in carbonic anhydrase binding which in turn results in emate being taken up into and stored in erythrocytes in the blood since this occurs in the hepatic portal vein it prevents emate from entering the liver during the first pass with the oral route the inhibition of sts by emate prevents its bioactivation into estrone and estradiol which in turn accounts for the lack of estrogenicity of emate a short initial peak of estradiol and estrone levels was observed with e2mate at the start of treatment in humans followed by very high and long lasting concentrations of emate and estrone sulfate in erythrocytes observations that are in accordance with sts inhibition emate is an extremely potent and irreversible inhibitor of sts it was found to have an of 65 pm for sts inhibition in mcf 7

it is a white coloured crystalline solid at room temperature highly soluble in water it can be created by neutralising hydrochloric acid with calcium hydroxide calcium chloride is commonly encountered as a hydrated solid with generic formula cacl ho where x 0 1 2 4 and 6 these compounds are mainly used for de icing and dust control because the anhydrous salt is hygroscopic it is used as a desiccant by depressing the freezing point of water calcium chloride is used to prevent ice formation and is used to de ice this application consumes the greatest amount of calcium chloride calcium chloride is relatively harmless to plants and soil as a de icing agent it is much more effective at lower temperatures than sodium chloride when distributed for this use it usually takes the form of small white spheres a few millimeters in diameter called prills solutions of calcium chloride can prevent freezing at temperature as low as 52 c 62 f making it ideal for filling agricultural implement tires as a liquid ballast aiding traction in cold climates it is also used in domestic and industrial chemical air dehumidifiers the second largest application of calcium chloride exploits hygroscopic properties

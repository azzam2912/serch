it can be seen as derivative of tetrahydrofuran oxolane with two methyl groups replacing two hydrogen atoms on each of the carbon atoms in the ring that are adjacent to the oxygen it can be seen also as a cyclic ether of 2 5 dimethylhexane an isomer of octane it is sometimes denoted by the abbreviations tmthf or me4thf the compound is sometimes used as a polar aprotic solvent in research chemistry and as a reagent in chemical synthesis the compound is produced in small quantities by the mycelium of tuber borchii a mushroom similar to the truffle the compound can be prepared by treating 2 5 dimethylhexane 2 5 diol with sulfuric acid tmthf reacts with benzene in the presence of triflic acid to form 1 1 4 4 dimethyltetralin and symmetric tetramethyloctahydroanthracene this and other similar reactions can be used for the selective preparation of derivatives of naphthalene anthracene and tetracene and other fused ring aromatic hydrocarbons tmthf undergoes photolysis by uv in aqueous solution the products are mainly methane ethane and 2 hydroxy 2 5 5 trimethyltetrahydrofuran the dehydration of tmthf yields alkenes like 2 5 dimethyl 2 4 hexadiene and 2 5 dimethyl 1 5 hexadiene

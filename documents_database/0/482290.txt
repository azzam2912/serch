they serve to encode large numbers of genes at a time tags represent a large proportion of genes in a genome including between 14 to 17 of the human mouse and rat genomes tag clusters may have as few as two genes with small clusters predominating but may consist of hundreds of genes an example are tandem clusters of rrna encoding genes these genes are transcribed faster than they would be if only a single copy of the gene was available additionally a single rna gene may not be able to provide enough rna but tandem repeats of the gene allow sufficient rna to be produced for example cells in a human embryo contain between five and ten million ribosomes and cell number doubles within 24 hours in order to provide the necessary ribosomes multiple rna polymerases must consecutively transcribe multiple rrna genes in some species such as arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa most tags are the result of unequal chromosomal crossover during genetic recombination

the relevant coordinate transforms are typically stored within the image file geopdf and geotiff are examples though there are many possible mechanisms for implementing georeferencing the most visible effect of georeferencing is that display software can show ground coordinates such as latitude longitude or utm coordinates and also measure ground distances and areas in other words georeferencing means to associate something with locations in physical space the term is commonly used in the geographic information systems field to describe the process of associating a physical map or raster image of a map with spatial locations georeferencing may be applied to any kind of object or structure that can be related to a geographical location such as points of interest roads places bridges or buildings geographic locations are most commonly represented using a coordinate reference system which in turn can be related to a geodetic reference system such as wgs 84 examples include establishing the correct position of an aerial photograph within a map or finding the geographical coordinates of a place name or street address geocoding there are various gis tools available that can transform image data to some geographic control framework like the commercial arcmap pci geomatica tntmips microimages

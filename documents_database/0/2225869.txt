suppose there are four items formula 1 a person states that he ranks the items according to the following total order i e z is his best item then y then x then w assuming the items are independent goods one can deduce that but one cannot deduce anything about the bundles formula 5 we do not know which of them the person prefers the rs extension of the ranking formula 2 is a partial order on the bundles of items that includes all relations that can be deduced from the item ranking and the independence assumption let formula 7 be a set of objects and formula 8 a total order on formula 7 the rs extension of formula 8 is a partial order on formula 11 it can be defined in several equivalent ways the original rs extension is constructed as follows for every bundle formula 12 every item formula 13 and every item formula 14 take the following relations the rs extension is the transitive closure of these relations the pd extension is based on a pairing of the items in one bundle with the items in the other bundle formally formula 18 if and only if there

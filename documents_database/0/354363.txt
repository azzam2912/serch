in science and engineering it is most frequently a concern regarding meteors reentry vehicles and the design of high speed aircraft at high speeds through the air the object s kinetic energy is converted to heat through compression and friction at lower speed the object will lose heat to the air through which it is passing if the air is cooler the combined temperature effect of heat from the air and from passage through it is called the stagnation temperature the actual temperature is called the recovery temperature these viscous dissipative effects to neighboring sub layers make the boundary layer slow down via a non isentropic process heat then conducts into the surface material from the higher temperature air the result is an increase in the temperature of the material and a loss of energy from the flow the forced convection ensures that other material replenishes the gases that have cooled to continue the process the stagnation and the recovery temperature of a flow increases with the speed of the flow and are greater at high speeds the total thermal loading of the object is a function of both the recovery temperature and the mass flow rate of the flow

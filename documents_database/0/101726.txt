its name trigeminal tri or three and geminus or twin thrice twinned derives from the fact that each of the two nerves one on each side of the pons has three major branches the ophthalmic nerve v the maxillary nerve v and the mandibular nerve v the ophthalmic and maxillary nerves are purely sensory whereas the mandibular nerve supplies motor as well as sensory or cutaneous functions the motor division of the trigeminal nerve derives from the basal plate of the embryonic pons and the sensory division originates in the cranial neural crest sensory information from the face and body is processed by parallel pathways in the central nervous system the three major branches of the trigeminal nerve the ophthalmic nerve v the maxillary nerve v and the mandibular nerve v converge on the trigeminal ganglion also called the semilunar ganglion or gasserian ganglion located within meckel s cave and containing the cell bodies of incoming sensory nerve fibers the trigeminal ganglion is analogous to the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord which contain the cell bodies of incoming sensory fibers from the rest of the body from the trigeminal ganglion a single large sensory root enters the brainstem

they form the building blocks of the dna double helix and contribute to the folded structure of both dna and rna dictated by specific hydrogen bonding patterns watson crick base pairs guanine cytosine and adenine thymine allow the dna helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its nucleotide sequence the complementary nature of this based paired structure provides a redundant copy of the genetic information encoded within each strand of dna the regular structure and data redundancy provided by the dna double helix make dna well suited to the storage of genetic information while base pairing between dna and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which dna polymerase replicates dna and rna polymerase transcribes dna into rna many dna binding proteins can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes intramolecular base pairs can occur within single stranded nucleic acids this is particularly important in rna molecules e g transfer rna where watson crick base pairs guanine cytosine and adenine uracil permit the formation of short double stranded helices and a wide variety of non watson crick interactions e g g u or a a allow rnas to fold into a

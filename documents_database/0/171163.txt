the model which is an application of kinetic theory assumes that the microscopic behaviour of electrons in a solid may be treated classically and looks much like a pinball machine with a sea of constantly jittering electrons bouncing and re bouncing off heavier relatively immobile positive ions the two most significant results of the drude model are an electronic equation of motion and a linear relationship between current density and electric field here is the time p is the average momentum per electron and and are respectively the electron charge number density mass and mean free time between ionic collisions that is the mean time an electron has traveled since the last collision the latter expression is particularly important because it explains in semi quantitative terms why ohm s law one of the most ubiquitous relationships in all of electromagnetism should be true the model was extended in 1905 by hendrik antoon lorentz and hence is also known as the drude lorentz model and is a classical model later it was supplemented with the results of quantum theory in 1933 by arnold sommerfeld and hans bethe leading to the drude sommerfeld model the drude model considers the metal to be

when a crystal is deformed in order for slip to occur dislocations must be generated in the material this implies that during deformation dislocations must be primarily generated in these planes cold working of metal increases the number of dislocations by the frank read mechanism higher dislocation density increases yield strength and causes work hardening of metals it was proposed by and named after british physicist charles frank and thornton read charles frank detailed the history of the discovery from his perspective in proceedings of the royal society in 1980 in 1950 charles frank who was then a research fellow in the physics department at the university of bristol visited the united states to participate in a conference on crystal plasticity in pittsburgh frank arrived in the united states well in advance of the conference to spend time at a naval laboratory and to give a lecture at cornell university when during his travels in pennsylvania frank visited pittsburgh he received a letter from fellow scientist jock eshelby suggesting that he read a recent paper by gunther leibfried frank was supposed to board a train to cornell to give his lecture at cornell but before departing for cornell he went

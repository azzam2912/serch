scuderi april 13 1925 october 16 2002 scuderi group an engineering and licensing company based in west springfield massachusetts and founded by carmelo scuderi s children is testing a working prototype of the engine that was officially unveiled to the public on april 20 2009 scuderi group released video footage of a naturally aspirated one liter prototype of the scuderi engine firing on its own in the laboratory in october 2009 scuderi engines have paired cylinders each of which performs two of the tasks strokes of a conventional engine the compression cylinder performs intake and compression the power cylinder performs combustion and exhaust compressed air is transferred from the compression cylinder to the power cylinder through a crossover passage fuel is then injected and fired to produce the power stroke the power cylinder fires just after the piston has begun its downward motion after top dead center or atdc the scuderi group says atdc eliminates a thermal efficiency shortcoming seen in previous split cycle engine designs firing atdc in a split cycle arrangement is claimed to eliminate the losses resulting from recompressing the gas in a conventional otto cycle engine each cylinder performs all four strokes per cycle this means

it is a g protein coupled receptor gpcr that is coupled to g and mediates excitatory neurotransmission htr6 denotes the human gene encoding for the receptor the 5ht receptor is expressed almost exclusively in the brain it is distributed in various areas including but not limited to the olfactory tubercle cerebral cortex frontal and entorhinal regions nucleus accumbens striatum caudate nucleus hippocampus and the molecular layer of the cerebellum based on its abundance in extrapyramidal limbic and cortical regions it can be suggested that the 5ht receptor plays a role in functions like motor control emotionality cognition and memory blockade of central 5ht receptors has been shown to increase glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmission in various brain areas whereas activation enhances gabaergic signaling in a widespread manner antagonism of 5ht receptors also facilitates dopamine and norepinephrine release in the frontal cortex while stimulation has the opposite effect despite the 5ht receptor having a functionally excitatory action it is largely co localized with gabaergic neurons and therefore produces an overall inhibition of brain activity in parallel with this 5ht antagonists are hypothesized to improve cognition learning and memory agents such as latrepirdine idalopirdine lu ae58054 and intepirdine sb 742 457 rvt 101

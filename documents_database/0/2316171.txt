it is sometimes called the fall of the limes as a result of a series of informative archaeological finds and the re evaluation of literary sources the limesfall no longer appears to have been a simple historical event but a multi layered complex phenomenon whose historical linkages have not yet been fully understood because written sources are largely absent or of dubious reliability research often relies on archaeological findings which can be interpreted differently in the past the monocausal assumption was that the romans had been forced by armed events and external aggressors in the context of the so called alamannic storm to withdraw from the area east of the rhine and north of the danube archaeological finds however suggest that this process was the result of years of development during the so called imperial crisis of the 3rd century with a decline of the border provinces and even civil wars within the empire seem to have played a role all this finally led in 259 260 to the de facto abandonment of the so called agri decumates territory and the withdrawal of the roman military border to the rhine and the danube

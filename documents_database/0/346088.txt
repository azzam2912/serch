gave a simplified proof of the classification has a sentence mentioning that he found more than 10 such lattices but gives no further details one example of a niemeier lattice is the leech lattice niemeier lattices are usually labeled by the dynkin diagram of their root systems these dynkin diagrams have rank either 0 or 24 and all of their components have the same coxeter number the coxeter number at least in these cases is the number of roots divided by the dimension there are exactly 24 dynkin diagrams with these properties and there turns out to be a unique niemeier lattice for each of these dynkin diagrams the complete list of niemeier lattices is given in the following table in the table if l is an odd unimodular lattice of dimension 8 n and m its sublattice of even vectors then m is contained in exactly 3 unimodular lattices one of which is l and the other two of which are even if l has a norm 1 vector then the two even lattices are isomorphic the kneser neighborhood graph in 8 n dimensions has a point for each even lattice and a line joining two points for each

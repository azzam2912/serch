however a few languages have analogous series for fricatives mazahua for example has ejective aspirated and voiced fricatives alongside tenuis parallel to stops alongside tenuis many click languages have tenuis click consonants alongside voiced aspirated and glottalized series in transcription tenuis consonants are not normally marked explicitly and consonants written with voiceless ipa letters such as are typically assumed to be unaspirated and unglottalized unless otherwise indicated however aspiration is often left untranscribed if no contrast needs to be made like in english so there is an explicit diacritic for a lack of aspiration in the extensions to the ipa a superscript equal sign it is sometimes seen in phonetic descriptions of languages there are also languages such as the northern ryukyuan languages whose phonologically unmarked sound is aspirated and the tenuis consonants are marked and transcribed explicitly in unicode the symbol is encoded at an early ipa convention was to write the tenuis stops etc if the plain letters were used for aspirated consonants as they are in english pie vs spy the term tenuis comes from latin translations of ancient greek grammar which differentiated three series of consonants voiced aspirate and tenuis analogous series occur in many other

india has denied the allegations stating the supply shortages have been imposed by madheshi protesters within nepal the allegation however was supported by various indian medias as a landlocked nation nepal imports all of its petroleum supplies from india roughly 300 fuel trucks enter from india on a normal day but this has dwindled to a sporadic passage of 5 10 fuel trucks daily since the start of the crisis though shipments of perishables like fruits and vegetables have generally been allowed to pass moreover india had also been stopping some nepalese trucks at the kolkata harbour the blockade choked imports of not only petroleum but also medicines and earthquake relief material a root problem is that the demands of madheshis backed by india are in direct opposition to the demands of two other groups which puts kathmandu in a quandary two ethnic groups the tharu and the kiranti have been enforcing bandh a general strike or blockade and agitating for full autonomy from kathmandu madheshis have had clashes with tharu protesters in addition to government forces yet all these groups accuse kathmandu of ordering excessive use of force by the police political intrigue is a recurring theme of nepal

whether or not a particular kind of contact will be effective depends on the infectious agent and its route of transmission the effective contact rate denoted in a given population for a given infectious disease is measured in effective contacts per unit time this may be expressed as the total contact rate the total number of contacts effective or not per unit time denoted multiplied by the risk of infection given contact between an infectious and a susceptible individual this risk is called the transmission risk and is denoted p thus the total contact rate will generally be greater than the effective contact rate since not all contacts result in infection that is to say p is almost always less than 1 and it can never be greater than 1 since it is effectively the probability of transmission occurring this relation formalises the fact that the effective contact rate depends not only on the social patterns of contact in a particular society but also on the specific types of contact and the pathology of the infectious organism p for example it has been shown that a concurrent sexually transmitted infection can substantially increase the probability p of infecting a susceptible

the active movement of kinesins supports several cellular functions including mitosis meiosis and transport of cellular cargo such as in axonal transport most kinesins walk towards the positive end of a microtubule which in most cells entails transporting cargo such as protein and membrane components from the centre of the cell towards the periphery this form of transport is known as anterograde transport in contrast dyneins are motor proteins that move toward the minus end of a microtubule in retrograde transport kinesins were discovered as mt based anterograde intracellular transport motors the founding member of this superfamily kinesin 1 was isolated as a heterotetrameric fast axonal organelle transport motor consisting of 2 identical motor subunits khc and 2 light chains klc via microtubule affinity purification from neuronal cell extracts subsequently a different heterotrimeric plus end directed mt based motor named kinesin 2 consisting of 2 distinct khc related motor subunits and an accessory kap subunit was purified from echinoderm egg embryo extracts and is best known for its role in transporting protein complexes ift particles along axonemes during cilium biogenesis molecular genetic and genomic approaches have led to the recognition that the kinesins form a diverse superfamily of motors that

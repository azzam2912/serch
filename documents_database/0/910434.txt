quadratic growth often means more generally quadratic growth in the limit as the argument or sequence position goes to infinity in big theta notation f x x this can be defined both continuously for a real valued function of a real variable or discretely for a sequence of real numbers i e real valued function of an integer or natural number variable examples of quadratic growth include for a real function of a real variable quadratic growth is equivalent to the second derivative being constant i e the third derivative being zero and thus functions with quadratic growth are exactly the quadratic polynomials as these are the kernel of the third derivative operator d similarly for a sequence a real function of an integer or natural number variable quadratic growth is equivalent to the second finite difference being constant the third finite difference being zero and thus a sequence with quadratic growth is also a quadratic polynomial indeed an integer valued sequence with quadratic growth is a polynomial in the zeroth first and second binomial coefficient with integer values the coefficients can be determined by taking the taylor polynomial if continuous or newton polynomial if discrete algorithmic examples include

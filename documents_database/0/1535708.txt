for the purpose of this entry we shall focus on only oligonucleotides dna computing involves allowing synthetic oligonucleotide strands to hybridize in such a way as to perform computation dna computing requires that the self assembly of the oligonucleotide strands happen in such a way that hybridization should occur in a manner compatible with the goals of computation the field of dna computing was established in leonard m adelman s seminal paper his work is significant for a number of reasons this capability for massively parallel computation in dna computing can be exploited in solving many computational problems on an enormously large scale such as cell based computational systems for cancer diagnostics and treatment and ultra high density storage media this selection of codewords sequences of dna oligonucleotides is a major hurdle in itself due to the phenomenon of secondary structure formation in which dna strands tend to fold onto themselves during hybridization and hence rendering themselves useless in further computations this is also known as self hybridization the nussinov jacobson algorithm is used to predict secondary structures and also to identify certain design criteria that reduce the possibility of secondary structure formation in a codeword in essence this algorithm

the egg contains stored maternal genetic material mrna which controls embryo development until the onset of mzt after mzt the diploid embryo takes over genetic control this requires both zygotic genome activation zga and degradation of maternal products this process is important because it is the first time that the new embryonic genome is utilized and the paternal and maternal genomes are used in combination ie different alleles will be expressed the zygotic genome now drives embryo development mzt is often thought to be synonymous with midblastula transition mbt but these processes are in fact distinct however the mbt roughly coincides with zga in many metazoans and thus may share some common regulatory features for example both processes are proposed to be regulated by the nucleocytoplasmic ratio mbt strictly refers to changes in the cell cycle and cell motility that occur just prior to gastrulation in the early cleavage stages of embryogenesis rapid divisions occur synchronously and there are no gap stages in the cell cycle during these stages there is also little to no transcription of mrna from the zygotic genome but zygotic transcription is not required for mbt to occur cellular functions during early cleavage are carried out

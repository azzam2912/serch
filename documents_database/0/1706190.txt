users classify sets of infrared images from the spitzer space telescope and the wide field infrared survey explorer wise scientists believe bubbles in these images are the result of young massive stars whose light causes shocks in interstellar gas the milky way project works with data taken from the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer galactic plane survey mipsgal and galactic legacy infrared mid plane survey extraordinaire glimpse only a small part uses wise data the project looks for bubbles which can mean the formation of stars the project also looks for knots star clusters and other objects such as young stars supernova remnants and newly discovered galaxies the milky way project started as the ninth zooniverse project in december 2010 the phase 1 worked with the colors 4 5 m for blue 8 0 m for green and 24 m for red this resulted in the data release 1 dr1 of the milky way project in 2012 with 5 106 bubbles which can also be found in simbad the annulus tool that was used to mark the bubbles in the milky way project phase 1 was at random round and needed improvement this problem was solved after the introduction of

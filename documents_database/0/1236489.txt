recoil start is also used on some small vehicles such as small go karts minibikes and small atvs the starter mechanism comprises a rope with a grip at the end moulded rope reels and a spring the rope is coiled within a reel which is held under spring tension within an outer reel this reel assembly is in contact with one end of the crankshaft through a ratcheting mechanism specifically a freewheel clutch when the rope s grip is pulled the rope uncoils tensions the spring engages the clutch and turns the crankshaft spinning it to crank or start the engine before the end of the pull stroke after the end of the pull is reached the spring operated reel retracts the rope either to store it or to prepare it for another attempt to start and disengages the clutch hence the term re coil starter if the reel were directly connected to the crank and lacked the freewheel mechanism once the rope reached its end the spinning crankshaft would keep turning the reel which would violently recoil the rope in the opposite direction until it reached its end where it would likely jam and stall the engine there is

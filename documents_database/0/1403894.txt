it was discovered in may 2002 by a team of researchers from lbl it behaved differently from normal type ia supernovae and differently from several other previously observed peculiar type ia supernovae including sn 1991t and sn 1991bg sn 2002cx was discovered on 2002 may 12 21 ut by w m wood vasey g aldering and p nugent of lbl with the oschin 1 2 m telescope at palomar on 2002 may 17 2 a spectrum taken by t matheson s jha p challis and r kirshner of the cfa with the 1 5 m telescope at flwo suggested it was a peculiar sn 1991t like type ia sn 2002cx had photometric follow up taken at lick using kait and the nickel telescope and further spectra were taken at flwo and keck sn 2002cx hit maximum light in the b band at 2452415 2 jd 2002 may 20 7 at 17 68 and in the v band on 2452417 5 jd 2002 may 23 at 17 57 the b band light curve of sn 2002cx before 15 days after maximum evolves in a similar manner to sn 1999ac brightening faster than sn 1991t but slower than sn 1994d or sn

the spacecraft s primary instrumentation was a highly sensitive gravity gradiometer consisting of three pairs of accelerometers which measured gravitational gradients along three orthogonal axes launched on 17 march 2009 goce mapped the deep structure of the earth s mantle and probed hazardous volcanic regions it brought new insight into ocean behaviour this in particular was a major driver for the mission by combining the gravity data with information about sea surface height gathered by other satellite altimeters scientists were able to track the direction and speed of geostrophic ocean currents the low orbit and high accuracy of the system greatly improved the known accuracy and spatial resolution of the geoid the theoretical surface of equal gravitational potential on the earth the satellite s unique arrow shape and fins helped keep goce stable as it flew through the thermosphere at a comparatively low altitude of additionally an ion propulsion system continuously compensated for the variable deceleration due to air drag without the vibration of a conventional chemically powered rocket engine thus limiting the errors in gravity gradient measurements caused by non gravitational forces and restoring the path of the craft as closely as possible to a purely inertial trajectory after

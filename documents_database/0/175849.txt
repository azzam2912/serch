hashcash was proposed in 1997 by adam back and described more formally in back s paper hashcash a denial of service counter measure a similar idea was first proposed by cynthia dwork and moni naor and eli ponyatovski in their 1992 paper pricing via processing or combatting junk mail hashcash is a cryptographic hash based proof of work algorithm that requires a selectable amount of work to compute but the proof can be verified efficiently for email uses a textual encoding of a hashcash stamp is added to the header of an email to prove the sender has expended a modest amount of cpu time calculating the stamp prior to sending the email in other words as the sender has taken a certain amount of time to generate the stamp and send the email it is unlikely that they are a spammer the receiver can at negligible computational cost verify that the stamp is valid however the only known way to find a header with the necessary properties is brute force trying random values until the answer is found though testing an individual string is easy satisfactory answers are rare enough that it will require a substantial number of tries

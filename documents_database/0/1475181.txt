in heliophora the indentations may remain restricted to the posterior edge or they may reach to the anterior edges of the test depending on the individual the indentations may be very shallow or very deep forming very long fingers or digits while rotulids are very distinctive in appearance they are also highly morphic with a tremendous diversity seen in individual specimens that the digits are very fragile and prone to breaking off and regenerating only adds to individual variations in the genus heliophora the test is extremely variable depending on the individual indentations may be shallow or deep and may be restricted to the posterior edge or may be found along the entire margin of the test in the genus rotula the test has up to eleven indentations along the posterior edge forming up to twelve digits the primary way to distinguish rotula from heliophora is that adult specimens of rotula have up to four holes or lunules set into the anterior portion of the test in the extinct genus rotuloidea the test is oval shaped and comes to a blunt point at the anterior end of the test there are nine very shallow indentations along the posterior edge of

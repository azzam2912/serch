excessive conductivity values often indicate a high corrosion potential especially in the case of certain ions such as chloride and acetate ions these can be particularly damaging to the blades in the steam turbine typically there are three major types of conductivity measurements used generally degas conductivity is measured from condensed and cooled samples of primary steam it may also be relevant for analyzing condensate return especially in cases where the condensate is returned from a separate plant that used the steam in another process above three conductivity measurement gives one of the most robust measurement also with three measurement it is possible to calculate after the ions have been removed from the conditioning of the circulating water e g ammonium nh in the cation exchanger ions resulting from gaseous components must be removed in order to determine degas conductivity these are typically gases from the atmosphere which have penetrated into the system through leaks in the water steam circuit of all gases occurring in the atmosphere typically only carbon dioxide co dissolves chemically into ions in circulating water the remaining gases oxygen nitrogen etc dissolve physically and do not form ions and thus do not contribute to conductivity the

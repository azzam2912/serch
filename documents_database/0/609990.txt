it involves substitution by a hydroxyl group with a possible ring expansion it is named after the russian chemist nikolai jakovlevich demjanov dem anov demianov 1861 1938 the reaction process begins with diazotization of the amine by nitrous acid the diazonium group is a good leaving group forming nitrogen gas when displaced from the organic structure this displacement can occur via a rearrangement path a in which one of the sigma bonds adjacent to the diazo group migrates this migration results in an expansion of the ring the resulting carbocation is then attacked by a molecule of water alternately the diazo group can be displaced directly by a molecule of water in an s2 reaction path b both routes lead to formation of an alcohol the demjanov rearrangement is a method to produce a 1 carbon ring enlargement in four five or six membered rings the resulting five six and seven membered rings can then be used in further synthetic reactions it has been shown that the demjanov reaction is susceptible to regioselectivity one example of this is a study conducted by d fattori looking at the regioselectivity of the demjanov rearrangement in one carbon enlargements of naked sugars it

wilkinson in 1963 to illustrate a difficulty when finding the root of a polynomial the location of the roots can be very sensitive to perturbations in the coefficients of the polynomial the polynomial is sometimes the term wilkinson s polynomial is also used to refer to some other polynomials appearing in wilkinson s discussion wilkinson s polynomial arose in the study of algorithms for finding the roots of a polynomial it is a natural question in numerical analysis to ask whether the problem of finding the roots of p from the coefficients c is well conditioned that is we hope that a small change in the coefficients will lead to a small change in the roots unfortunately this is not the case here the problem is ill conditioned when the polynomial has a multiple root for instance the polynomial x has a double root at x 0 however the polynomial x a perturbation of size has roots at which is much bigger than when is small it is therefore natural to expect that ill conditioning also occurs when the polynomial has zeros which are very close however the problem may also be extremely ill conditioned for polynomials with well separated

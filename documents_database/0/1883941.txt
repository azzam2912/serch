coehoorn et al were the first able to observe an actual exchange spring magnet exchange spring magnets are cheaper than many magnets containing rare earth transition metals re tm magnets as the hard phase of the magnet which commonly comprises re tm material can be less than 15 of the overall magnet by volume first proposed by kneller and hawig in 1991 the exchange spring magnet utilizes the epitaxy between hard and soft magnetic materials the hard material helps retain the soft material s anisotropy which increases its coercivity the magnetic hysteresis loop of an exchange spring magnet theoretically takes on a shape resembling that of a summation of its hard and soft magnetic components as seen in figure 1 meaning its energy product is higher than those of its components a magnet s maximum energy product bh which is roughly proportional to its coercivity h and magnetization saturation m is used as a metric of its ability to do magnetic work as bh is twice the magnet s available magnetostatic energy the exchange spring magnet offers a geometry able to improve upon the previously reported maximum energy products of materials such as rare earth transition metal complexes while both

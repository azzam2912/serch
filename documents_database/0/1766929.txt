it will link the italian and french high speed rail networks and will be long the core of the project is the mont d ambin base tunnel a long tunnel crossing the alps between susa valley in italy and maurienne in france the tunnel will be the longest rail tunnel in the world ahead of the 57 1 km gotthard base tunnel it represents one third of the estimated overall cost of the project and is the only part of the line where work has started like the swiss nrla project the line has twin aims of transferring freight traffic across the alps from trucks to rail to reduce air pollution and co2 emissions and of providing faster passenger transport the new line will considerably shorten the journey times and its reduced gradients and much wider curves compared to the existing line will also allow heavy freight trains to transit between the two countries at and with much reduced energy costs its design speed of is slightly below the threshold used by the european commission to define high speed railways the line is therefore part instead of the ten t trans european conventional rail network within its mediterranean corridor previously

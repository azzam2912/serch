operations performed by the coprocessor may be floating point arithmetic graphics signal processing string processing cryptography or i o interfacing with peripheral devices by offloading processor intensive tasks from the main processor coprocessors can accelerate system performance coprocessors allow a line of computers to be customized so that customers who do not need the extra performance do not need to pay for it coprocessors vary in their degree of autonomy some such as fpus rely on direct control via coprocessor instructions embedded in the cpu s instruction stream others are independent processors in their own right capable of working asynchronously they are still not optimized for general purpose code or they are incapable of it due to a limited instruction set focused on accelerating specific tasks it is common for these to be driven by direct memory access dma with the host processor building a command list the playstation 2 s emotion engine contained an unusual dsp like simd vector unit capable of both modes of operation to make best use of mainframe computer processor time input output tasks were delegated to separate systems called channel i o the mainframe would not require any i o processing at all instead

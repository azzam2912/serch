because of its high spatial resolution and ability to noninvasively visualize internal organs magnetic resonance mr imaging is widely believed to be an ideal platform for in vivo molecular imaging for this reason mr contrast agents that can detect molecular events are an active field of research one group of compounds that has shown particular promise is enzyme activated mr contrast agents enzyme activated mr contrast agents are compounds that cause a detectable change in image intensity when in the presence of the active form of a certain enzyme this makes them useful for in vivo assays of enzyme activity they are distinguished from current clinical mr contrast agents that give only anatomical information such as aqueous gadolinium compounds by their ability to make molecular processes visible enzyme activated contrast agents are powerful tools for molecular imaging to date galactosidase activated contrast agents have attracted the most attention in the literature although there no theoretical reason that other enzymes could not be used to activate contrast agents also mechanisms other than enzyme activation such as ca dependent activation can theoretically be used in general enzyme activated agents contain a paramagnetic metal ion which can affect the t or t relaxation

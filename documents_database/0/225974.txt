such eutectic alloys are liquids at room temperature typically melting at while commercial galinstan melts at an example of a typical eutectic mixture is 68 ga 22 in and 10 sn by weight though proportions vary between 62 95 ga 5 22 in 0 16 sn by weight while remaining eutectic the exact composition of the commercial product galinstan is not publicly known due to the low toxicity and low reactivity of its component metals galinstan finds use as a replacement for many applications that previously employed the toxic liquid mercury or the reactive nak sodium potassium alloy the name galinstan is a portmanteau of gallium indium and stannum latin for tin the brand name galinstan is a registered trademark of the german company geratherm medical ag but galinstan is in common use for any eutectic alloy of gallium indium and tin galinstan tends to be wet and adhere to many materials including glass which limits its use compared to mercury galinstan is commercially used as a mercury replacement in thermometers due to its nontoxic properties but the inner tube surface must be coated with gallium oxide to prevent the alloy from wetting the glass surface galinstan has higher reflectivity

this tendency of the abundance of the chemical elements was first reported by giuseppe oddo in 1914 and william draper harkins in 1917 all atoms bigger than hydrogen are formed in stars or supernovae through nucleosynthesis when gravity temperature and pressure reach levels high enough to fuse protons and neutrons together protons and neutrons form the atomic nucleus which accumulates electrons to form atoms the number of protons in the nucleus called atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element the oddo harkins rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another thus increasing their atomic number it is possible that in elements with even atomic numbers protons are paired with each member of the pair balancing the spin of the other even parity thus enhances nucleon stability this postulate however does not apply to the universe s most abundant and simplest element from the periodic table of elements hydrogen with an atomic number of 1 this may be because in its ionized form a hydrogen atom becomes a single proton of which is theorized to have been one of the first major conglomerates of quarks during the initial second of

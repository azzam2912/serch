it is used to mobilize stored energy during fasting or exercise and usually occurs in fat adipocytes lipolysis is induced by several hormones including glucagon epinephrine norepinephrine growth hormone atrial natriuretic peptide brain natriuretic peptide and cortisol in the body stores of fat are referred to as adipose tissue in these areas intracellular triglycerides are stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets when lipases are phosphorylated they access lipid droplets and through multiple steps of hydrolysis breakdown triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol each step of hydrolysis leads to the removal of one fatty acid the first step and the rate limiting step of lipolysis is carried out by adipose triglyceride lipase atgl this enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to diacylglycerol subsequently hormone sensitive lipase hsl catalyzes the hydrolysis of diacylglycerol to monoacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol lipase mgl catalyzes the hydrolysis of monoacylglycerol to glycerol perilipin 1a is a key protein regulator of lipolysis in adipose tissue this lipid droplet associated protein when deactivated will prevent the interaction of lipases with triglycerides in the lipid droplet and grasp the atgl co activator comparative gene identification 58 cgi 58 a k a abhd5 when perilipin 1a is phosphorylated by pka it releases cgi

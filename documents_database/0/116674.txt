the two pictures only differ by a basis change with respect to time dependency which corresponds to the difference between active and passive transformations the heisenberg picture is the formulation of matrix mechanics in an arbitrary basis in which the hamiltonian is not necessarily diagonal it further serves to define a third hybrid picture the interaction picture in the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics the state vectors do not change with time while observables satisfy where is the hamiltonian and denotes the commutator of two operators in this case and taking expectation values automatically yields the ehrenfest theorem featured in the correspondence principle by the stone von neumann theorem the heisenberg picture and the schr dinger picture are unitarily equivalent just a basis change in hilbert space in some sense the heisenberg picture is more natural and convenient than the equivalent schr dinger picture especially for relativistic theories lorentz invariance is manifest in the heisenberg picture since the state vectors do not single out the time or space this approach also has a more direct similarity to classical physics by simply replacing the commutator above by the poisson bracket the heisenberg equation reduces to an equation in hamiltonian mechanics for

this section presents those two contexts each national variant in the family of r2 signalling protocols conveys at least the following where forward is the direction from the dialling telephone s switch to the called telephone s switch and where backward is the direction from the called telephone s switch to the calling telephone s switch r2 line signalling is a family of protocols that govern the resource acquisition and resource release related to a two party telephone call attempt and if successful the establishment of a two party telephone call although in the 1960s r2 line signalling was represented as electrical pulses on a two wire or four wire circuit by the latter 1970s these analog electrical pulses also could be represented in digital form by a signalling ds0 channel in the trunk which is normally channel 16 in an e1 trunk r2 register signalling is a family of protocols that govern the conveyance of addressing information during the addressing phase and how the call attempt turned out during the disposition phase although in the 1960s r2 register signalling was represented by electromechanical devices that could generate multi frequency audio tones and by electromechanical devices that could detect those

the z model had just entered production when france fell to the germans during world war ii a small number were produced during the war but the german occupation government would not allow full scale production to start after the war small numbers were built to equip new designs but the rapid introduction of the jet engine ended further development the 12z differed from the earlier 12y primarily in the use of four valves per cylinder operated by dual overhead cams as opposed to two valves operated by a single camshaft this gave the cylinders considerably better volumetric efficiency and faster operation raising the rpm from 2 400 to 2 700 the engine was also designed to run only on 100 octane fuel instead of 87 which was common at that point which allowed the compression ratio to rise from the 12y s 5 8 1 to the 12z s 6 75 1 these changes raised the power from 1 000 to 1 300 hp 750 to 970 kw at sea level the engine continued to use a single stage single speed supercharger and therefore lacked the all altitude performance of german and british designs but tuning the supercharger for

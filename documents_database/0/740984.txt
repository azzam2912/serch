the system may be said to be underspecified if the system is linear then the presence of more than one solution implies that there is an infinite number of solutions but that property does not extend to nonlinear systems an indeterminate system is consistent the latter implying that there exists at least one solution for a system of linear equations the number of equations in an indeterminate system could be the same as the number of unknowns less than the number of unknowns an underdetermined system or greater than the number of unknowns an overdetermined system conversely any of those three cases may or may not be indeterminate the following examples of indeterminate systems of equations have respectively fewer equations than as many equations as and more equations than unknowns in linear systems indeterminacy occurs if and only if the number of independent equations the rank of the augmented matrix of the system is less than the number of unknowns and is the same as the rank of the coefficient matrix for if there are at least as many independent equations as unknowns that will eliminate any stretches of overlap of the equations surfaces in the geometric space of the

robustness in development is known as canalization according to the kind of perturbation involved robustness can be classified as mutational environmental recombinational or behavioral robustness etc robustness is achieved through the combination of many genetic and molecular mechanisms and can evolve by either direct or indirect selection several model systems have been developed to experimentally study robustness and its evolutionary consequences mutational robustness also called mutation tolerance describes the extent to which an organism s phenotype remains constant in spite of mutation robustness can be empirically measured for several genomes and individual genes by inducing mutations and measuring what proportion of mutants retain the same phenotype function or fitness more generally robustness corresponds to the neutral band in the distribution of fitness effects of mutation i e the frequencies of different fitnesses of mutants proteins so far investigated have shown a tolerance to mutations of roughly 66 i e two thirds of mutations are neutral conversely measured mutational robustnesses of organisms vary widely for example 95 of point mutations in c elegans have no detectable effect and even 90 of single gene knockouts in e coli are non lethal viruses however only tolerate 20 40 of mutations and hence are

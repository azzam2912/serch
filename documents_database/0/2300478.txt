it is also known as the stal turbine from the company name stal the machine is flowed through steam in radial direction from the inside to the outside and consists of two halves that rotate against each other as a result each rotor blade of the one turbine half serves simultaneously as the guide blade of the other half the different direction of rotation of the two halves is either compensated by a gearbox connected downstream or by separate generators during the generation of electrical power the ljungstr m turbine can either be used on a condenser or else for the supply of a district heating grid and is thus flexible to use it was therefore used in large industrial complexes which could use both the exhaust of this engine for combined heat and power as well as its electric energy the functionality has been employed for several power plants in principle the maximum power is about 32 mw since the two turbine halves can not be constructed as large as desired coupled with a parsons turbine its output can be increased to 50 mw since the current steam power plants have a significantly higher performance the ljungstr m turbine

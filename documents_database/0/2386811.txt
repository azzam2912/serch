its maximum apparent visual magnitude is 9 49 but shows a variation in brightness down to a magnitude of 10 46 in a periodic cycle of roughly 8 hours the observed variability is typical of w ursae majoris variable stars so the two stars in this system form a contact binary the observed spectral type of both stars in this system is g5 and one of them is a main sequence star very similar to the sun they are orbiting so close that their envelopes touch each other this is a dynamically stable phase that should last until one of the two stars leaves the main sequence the system could also host a third body with an orbital period of 19 046 days with a minimum mass of 0 007 and an eccentricity of 0 22 but not all data collected in time are consistent with this hypothesis the two stars eclipse each other during their orbit but they have an elongated shape so they show a constant variation instead of discrete eclipses anyway a periodicity can be seen clearly but it changes with time the period shows a long term trend and a periodic modulation of 7 000 days

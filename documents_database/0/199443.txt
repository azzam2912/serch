when a sound is followed by another sound separated by a sufficiently short time delay below the listener s echo threshold listeners perceive a single auditory event its perceived spatial location is dominated by the location of the first arriving sound the first wave front the lagging sound also affects the perceived location however its effect is suppressed by the first arriving sound the haas effect is a psychoacoustical effect described in 1949 by helmut haas in his ph d thesis it is often equated with the underlying precedence effect the law of the first wavefront was described and named in 1948 by lothar cremer the precedence effect was described and named in 1949 by wallach et al they showed that when two identical sounds are presented in close succession they will be heard as a single fused sound in their experiments fusion occurred when the lag between the two sounds was in the range 1 to 5 ms for clicks and up to 40 ms for more complex sounds such as speech or piano music when the lag was longer the second sound was heard as an echo additionally wallach et al demonstrated that when successive sounds coming from

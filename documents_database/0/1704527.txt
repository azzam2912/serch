the third jackson q bessel function is the same as the hahn exton q bessel function the three jackson q bessel functions are given in terms of the q pochhammer symbol and the basic hypergeometric function formula 1 by they can be reduced to the bessel function by the continuous limit there is a connection formula between the first and second jackson q bessel function for integer order the q bessel functions satisfy by using the relations we obtain hahn mentioned that formula 11 has infinitely many real zeros ismail proved that for formula 12 all non zero roots of formula 11 are real the function formula 14 is a completely monotonic function the first and second jackson q bessel function have the following recurrence relations see and when formula 12 the second jackson q bessel function satisfies formula 18 for formula 19 formula 20 the following formulas are the q analog of the generating function for the bessel function see formula 23 is the q exponential function the second jackson q bessel function has the following integral representations see and where formula 26is the q pochhammer symbol this representation reduces to the integral representation of the bessel function in

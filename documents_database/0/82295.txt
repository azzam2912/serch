it is achieved by any one of the following equivalent actions formally the i th row j th column element of a is the j th row i th column element of a if a is an matrix then a is an matrix to avoid confusing the reader between the transpose operation and a matrix raised to the t power the formula 2 symbol denotes the transpose operation the transpose of a matrix was introduced in 1858 by the british mathematician arthur cayley for matrices a b and scalar c we have the following properties of transpose which is written as a b in einstein summation convention a square matrix whose transpose is equal to itself is called a symmetric matrix that is a is symmetric if a square matrix whose transpose is equal to its negative is called a skew symmetric matrix that is a is skew symmetric if a square complex matrix whose transpose is equal to the matrix with every entry replaced by its complex conjugate denoted here with an overline is called a hermitian matrix equivalent to the matrix being equal to its conjugate transpose that is a is hermitian if a square complex matrix whose

in the past many of the implementations use the apache hadoop platform however today it is primarily focused on apache spark mahout also provides java scala libraries for common maths operations focused on linear algebra and statistics and primitive java collections mahout is a work in progress a number of algorithms have been implemented while mahout s core algorithms for clustering classification and batch based collaborative filtering are implemented on top of apache hadoop using the map reduce paradigm it does not restrict contributions to hadoop based implementations contributions that run on a single node or on a non hadoop cluster are also welcomed for example the taste collaborative filtering recommender component of mahout was originally a separate project and can run stand alone without hadoop starting with the release 0 10 0 the project shifted its focus to building a backend independent programming environment code named samsara the environment consists of an algebraic backend independent optimizer and an algebraic scala dsl unifying in memory and distributed algebraic operators supported algebraic platforms are apache spark h2o and apache flink support for mapreduce algorithms started being gradually phased out in 2014

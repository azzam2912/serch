typical examples include operation below the maximum power rating current rating or voltage rating power semiconductor devices have a maximum power dissipation rating usually quoted at a case temperature of the datasheet for the device also includes a derating curve which indicates how much a device will dissipate without getting damaged at any given case temperature and this must be taken into account while designing a system as can be seen from the derating curve image for a hypothetical bipolar junction transistor the device rated for 100 w at cannot be expected to dissipate anything more than about 40 w if the ambient temperature is such that the temperature at which the device s case will stabilise after heat sinking is this final case temperature is a function of the thermal resistance between the device s case and the heat sink and the heat sink and the ambient this includes the heat sink s temp watt rating with lower values implying better cooling characteristics some capacitors voltage capability is reduced at higher temperatures because the softened dielectric e g a polymer is softened further by the heat and its breakdown field strength is reduced derating curves are included in data

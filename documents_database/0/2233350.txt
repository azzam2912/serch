it is one of the best known examples of indeterminate problems in the early history of mathematics the problem appears as the final problem in zhang qiujian suanjing problem 38 in chapter 3 however the problem and its variants have appeared in the medieval mathematical literature of india europe and the arab world the name hundred fowls problem is due to the belgian historian louis van hee the hundred fowls problem as presented in zhang qiujian suanjing can be translated as follows let x be the number of cocks y be the number of hens and z be the number of chicks then the problem is to find x y and z satisfying the following equations obviously only non negative integer values are acceptable expressing y and z in terms of x we get since x y and z all must be integers the expression for y suggests that x must be a multiple of 4 hence the general solution of the system of equations can be expressed using an integer parameter t as follows since y should be a non negative integer the only possible values of t are 0 1 2 and 3 so the complete set of

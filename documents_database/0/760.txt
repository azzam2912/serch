they are found above the kidneys each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla the adrenal cortex itself is divided into three zones the zona glomerulosa the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis the adrenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones mineralocorticoids glucocorticoids and androgens mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance the glucocorticoids cortisol and cortisone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression the innermost layer of the cortex the zona reticularis produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs the production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells the medulla produces the catecholamine adrenaline and noradrenaline which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations a number of endocrine diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland overproduction of cortisol leads to cushing s syndrome whereas insufficient production is associated with addison s disease congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by

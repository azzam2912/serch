troughs may be at the surface or aloft or both under various conditions most troughs bring clouds showers and a wind shift particularly following the passage of the trough this results from convergence or squeezing which forces lifting of moist air behind the trough line unlike fronts there is not a universal symbol for a trough on a weather chart the weather charts in some countries or regions mark troughs by a line in the united states a trough may be marked as a dashed line or bold line in the uk hong kong and fiji it is represented by a bold line extended from a low pressure center or between two low pressure centers in macau and australia it is a dashed line if they are not marked troughs may still be identified as an extension of isobars away from a low pressure center a trough is not in a general term a boundary but an elongated area of lower air pressure there are changes in wind direction across a trough but there is no change in air mass while not specifically a surface boundary troughs reflect the change in atmospheric conditions in the upper atmosphere as such troughs

they appeared in the 1930s and were most commonly used in the 1950s and 1960s but were replaced by telescopic shock absorbers in the 1970s one of the earliest patents for a hydraulic lever arm shock absorber was awarded in 1925 to georges de ram who was already an established maker of friction disk shock absorbers hydraulic shock absorbers appeared as a development to replace the previous friction disks these had at best provided a constant damping force no matter what the size or speed of the suspension movement with a viscous device using hydraulic oil the resistance force increased with speed so providing better damping for larger suspension bumps the first hydraulic shock absorbers were of the rotary vane pattern these consisted of a cylindrical oil filled body bolted to the chassis a lever arm was attached to the axle and inside the cylinder this rotated a spindle carrying a vane or paddle this vane had only a small hole in it through which the hydraulic oil could pass resistance to flow through the hole provided the damping effect these were first developed by maurice houdaille around 1906 but remained largely ignored in favour of the simpler friction devices

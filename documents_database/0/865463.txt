if this occurs in only some cells it is called mosaic triploidy and is less severe most embryos with triploidy miscarry early in development many organ systems are affected by triploidy but the central nervous system and skeleton are the most severely affected common central nervous system defects seen in triploidy include holoprosencephaly hydrocephalus increased amount of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain ventriculomegaly arnold chiari malformation agenesis of the corpus callosum and neural tube defects skeletal manifestations include cleft lip palate hypertelorism club foot and syndactyly of fingers three and four congenital heart defects hydronephrosis omphalocele and meningocele spina bifida are also common cystic hygromas occur but are uncommon triploid fetuses have intrauterine growth restriction beginning early in the pregnancy as early as 12 weeks and does not affect the head as severely as the body oligohydramnios low levels of amniotic fluid is common in triploid pregnancies placental abnormalities are common in triploidy most frequently the placenta is enlarged and may have cysts within in some cases the placenta may be unusually small having ceased to grow triploidy can result from either two sperm fertilizing one egg polyspermy 60 or from one sperm fertilizing an egg with two copies of

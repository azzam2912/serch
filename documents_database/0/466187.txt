although computationally efficient in principle the method as initially formulated was not useful due to its numerical instability in 1970 ojalvo and newman showed how to make the method numerically stable and applied it to the solution of very large engineering structures subjected to dynamic loading this was achieved using a method for purifying the lanczos vectors i e by repeatedly reorthogonalizing each newly generated vector with all previously generated ones to any degree of accuracy which when not performed produced a series of vectors that were highly contaminated by those associated with the lowest natural frequencies in their original work these authors also suggested how to select a starting vector i e use a random number generator to select each element of the starting vector and suggested an empirically determined method for determining formula 3 the reduced number of vectors i e it should be selected to be approximately 1 5 times the number of accurate eigenvalues desired soon thereafter their work was followed by paige who also provided an error analysis in 1988 ojalvo produced a more detailed history of this algorithm and an efficient eigenvalue error test there are in principle four ways to write the iteration

it can also serve to investigate measure validate or verify other quality attributes of the system such as scalability reliability and resource usage performance testing a subset of performance engineering is a computer science practice which strives to build performance standards into the implementation design and architecture of a system load testing is the simplest form of performance testing a load test is usually conducted to understand the behaviour of the system under a specific expected load this load can be the expected concurrent number of users on the application performing a specific number of transactions within the set duration this test will give out the response times of all the important business critical transactions the database application server etc are also monitored during the test this will assist in identifying bottlenecks in the application software and the hardware that the software is installed on stress testing is normally used to understand the upper limits of capacity within the system this kind of test is done to determine the system s robustness in terms of extreme load and helps application administrators to determine if the system will perform sufficiently if the current load goes well above the expected maximum soak

the protein encoded by this gene is an atp specific scs beta subunit that dimerizes with the scs alpha subunit to form scs a an essential component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle scs a hydrolyzes atp to convert succinyl coa to succinate defects in this gene are a cause of myopathic mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome a pseudogene of this gene has been found on chromosome 6 provided by refseq jul 2008 scs also known as succinyl coa ligase sucl is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit encoded by the suclg1 gene and a subunit encoded by either the sucla2 gene or the suclg2 gene which determines the enzyme specificity for either adp or gdp sucla2 is the scs variant containing the sucla2 encoded subunit amino acid sequence alignment of the two subunit types reveals a homology of 50 identity with specific regions conserved throughout the sequences sucla2 is located on chromosome 13 and contains 13 exons as a subunit of scs sucla2 is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of succinyl coa to succinate and acetoacetyl coa accompanied by the substrate level phosphorylation of adp to atp as a step in the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle

in 1942 gordon lynn walls described this concept which states that placental mammals were mainly or even exclusively nocturnal through most of their evolutionary story starting with their origin 225 million years ago and only ending with the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago while some mammal groups have later evolved to fill diurnal niches the approximately 160 million years spent as nocturnal animals has left a lasting legacy on basal anatomy and physiology and most mammals are still nocturnal mammals evolved from cynodonts a group of superficially dog like mammal like reptiles in the wake of the permian triassic mass extinction the emerging archosaurian groups that flourished after the extinction including crocodiles and dinosaurs and their ancestors drove the remaining larger cynodonts into extinction leaving only the smaller forms the surviving cynodonts could only succeed in niches with minimal competition from the diurnal dinosaurs evolving into the typical small bodied insectivorous dwellers of the nocturnal undergrowth while the early mammals continued to develop into several probably quite common groups of animals during the mesozoic they all remained nocturnal only with the massive extinction at the end of the cretaceous did the dinosaurs leave the stage open for

it did not go into service but seven variants using five different engines were produced one of them setting several speed with useful load records and another the potez 506 setting three altitude world records the potez 50 was a single bay sesquiplane both upper and lower wings were in two parts and were unswept with constant chord though the trailing edge of the upper wing tapered outboard into rounded tips the lower wing had a smaller chord as well as being about one third shorter both were built around two spruce and plywood box spars and were fabric covered the outward leaning pairs of interplane struts were closer on the lower wing as its spars were closer together additional wire bracing completed the structure the upper wing was braced over the fuselage on parallel pairs of outward and slightly backward leaning cabane struts to the upper fuselage the lower wings were attached to the fuselage the wings lacked dihedral and were mounted with marked stagger only the upper wing carried ailerons which occupied about half the span the potez 50 and its variants were powered by five different nose mounted engines two inlines and three radials detailed below the

they are found in all domains of life these proteins have peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity which catalyzes the isomerization of peptide bonds from trans form to cis form at proline residues and facilitates protein folding cyclophilin a is a cytosolic and highly abundant protein the protein belongs to a family of isozymes including cyclophilins b and c and natural killer cell cyclophilin related protein major isoforms have been found within single cells including inside the endoplasmic reticulum and some are even secreted human genes encoding proteins containing the cyclophilin domain include cyclophilin a cypa also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase a ppia which is found in the cytosol has a beta barrel structure with two alpha helices and a beta sheet other cyclophilins have similar structures to cyclophilin a the cyclosporin cyclophilin a complex inhibits a calcium calmodulin dependent phosphatase calcineurin the inhibition of which is thought to suppress organ rejection by halting the production of the pro inflammatory molecules tnf alpha and interleukin 2 cyclophilin a is also known to be recruited by the gag polyprotein during hiv 1 virus infection and its incorporation into new virus particles is essential for hiv 1 infectivity cyclophilin d ppif note that literature

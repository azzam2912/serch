the concept includes flybys of jupiter saturn neptune and a kuiper belt object a focus on neptune and its largest moon triton would help answer some of the questions generated by voyager 2 flyby in 1989 and would provide clues to ice giant formation and evolution the argo mission was meant to compete for the new frontiers mission 4 650m one of the reasons argo was not formally proposed was the shortage of plutonium 238 for the required radioisotope thermoelectric generator rtg for electric power the current launch window for this mission was particularly favorable it opened in 2015 and lasts through the end of 2019 so future missions would need to be redesigned for the relevant planetary alignments it was noted that although it offered a neptune mission at the price of new frontier s budget it would be flyby only limiting the amount of time at neptune and triton compared to an orbiter however the advantage would be access to a wide variety of kuiper belt objects by using a gravity assist at neptune which would allow a wide range of objects to potentially be targeted in addition with a flyby of jupiter and saturn the planetary society

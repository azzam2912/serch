the quantum spin hall state of matter is the cousin of the integer quantum hall state and that does not require the application of a large magnetic field the quantum spin hall state does not break charge conservation symmetry and spin formula 1 conservation symmetry in order to have well defined hall conductances the first proposal for the existence of a quantum spin hall state was developed by charles kane and gene mele who adapted an earlier model for graphene by f duncan m haldane which exhibits an integer quantum hall effect the kane and mele model is two copies of the haldane model such that the spin up electron exhibits a chiral integer quantum hall effect while the spin down electron exhibits an anti chiral integer quantum hall effect a relativistic version of the quantum spin hall effect was introduced in the 1990s for the numerical simulation of chiral gauge theories the simplest example consisting of a parity and time reversal symmetric u 1 gauge theory with bulk fermions of opposite sign mass a massless dirac surface mode and bulk currents that carry chirality but not charge the spin hall current analogue overall the kane mele model has a

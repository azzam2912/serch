the animal does not move toward or away from the stimulus but moves at either a slow or fast rate depending on its comfort zone in this case a fast movement non random means that the animal is searching for its comfort zone but a slow movement indicates that it has found it there are two main types of kineses both resulting in aggregations however the stimulus does not act to attract or repel individuals orthokinesis in which the speed of movement of the individual is dependent upon the stimulus intensity for example the locomotion of a woodlice in relation to humidity with increased humidity there is an increase in the percentage time that the woodlice will remain stationary klinokinesis in which the frequency or rate of turning is proportional to stimulus intensity for example the behaviour of the flatworm dendrocoelum lacteum which turns more frequently in response to increasing light thus ensuring that it spends more time in dark areas the kinesis strategy controlled by the locally and instantly evaluated well being fitness can be described in simple words animals stay longer in good conditions and leave quicker bad conditions if the well being is measured by the local

while the effects of rhoa activity are not all well known it is primarily associated with cytoskeleton regulation mostly actin stress fibers formation and actomyosin contractility it acts upon several effectors among them rock1 rho associated coiled coil containing protein kinase 1 and diaph1 diaphanous homologue 1 a k a hdia1 homologue to mdia1 in mouse diaphanous in drosophila are the best described rhoa and the other rho gtpases are part of a larger family of related proteins known as the ras superfamily a family of proteins involved in the regulation and timing of cell division rhoa is one of the oldest rho gtpases with homologues present in the genomes since 1 5 billion years as a consequence rhoa is somehow involved in many cellular processes which emerged throughout evolution rhoa specifically is regarded as a prominent regulatory factor in other functions such as the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics transcription cell cycle progression and cell transformation the specific gene that encodes rhoa rhoa is located on chromosome 3 and consists of four exons which has also been linked as a possible risk factor for atherothrombolic stroke similar to other gtpases rhoa presents a rho insert in its primary sequence in

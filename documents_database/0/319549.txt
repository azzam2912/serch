this would allow the construction of integrated circuits made entirely from memristors which hp states could be simpler and less expensive to build hp says that it is possible for memristors to eventually replace transistors in the way that transistors replaced the vacuum tube the crossbar was introduced by hewlett packard scientists in the journal of applied physics which provides a basis for constructing logic gates using memristors the crossbar latch consists of a signal line crossed by two control lines depending on the voltages sent down the various lines it can simulate the action of the three major logic gates and or and not the abstract of the patent is as follows this application was developed by greg snider of hewlett packard and employs crossbar latches to replicate the functions of a half adder which form the basis of modern computational architectures in this application a crossbar tile is formed of a layer of horizontal row wires and a layer of vertical column wires in which memristor or similar materials are sandwiched between the horizontal and vertical wire layers each intersection or junction of the crossbar tile is configurable to be at a high resistance state in which there

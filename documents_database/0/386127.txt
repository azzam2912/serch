this colorless water soluble compound finds many applications sulfamic acid melts at 205 c before decomposing at higher temperatures to water sulfur trioxide sulfur dioxide and nitrogen sulfamic acid hnso may be considered an intermediate compound between sulfuric acid hso and sulfamide hnso effectively replacing a hydroxyl oh group with an amine nh group at each step this pattern can extend no further in either direction without breaking down the sulfonyl so moiety sulfamates are derivatives of sulfamic acid sulfamic acid is produced industrially by treating urea with a mixture of sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid or oleum the conversion is conducted in two stages in this way approximately 96 000 tonnes were produced in 1995 the compound is well described by the formula hnso not the tautomer hnso oh the relevant bond distances are 1 44 for the s o and 1 77 for the s n the greater length of the s n is consistent with a single bond furthermore a neutron diffraction study located the hydrogen atoms all three of which are 1 03 distant from the nitrogen in the solid state the molecule of sulfamic acid is well described by a zwitterionic form aqueous solutions of

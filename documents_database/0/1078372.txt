in planar chromatography in particular the retardation factor r is defined as the ratio of the distance traveled by the center of a spot to the distance traveled by the solvent front ideally the values for r are equivalent to the r values used in column chromatography although the term retention factor is sometimes used synonymously with retardation factor in regard to planar chromatography the term is not defined in this context however in column chromatography the retention factor or capacity factor k is defined as the ratio of time an analyte is retained in the stationary phase to the time it is retained in the mobile phase which is inversely proportional to the retardation factor in chromatography the retardation factor r is the fraction of the sample in the mobile phase at equilibrium defined as the retardation factor r is commonly used in paper chromatography and thin layer chromatography for analyzing and comparing different substances it can be mathematically described by the following ratio an r value will always be in the range 0 to 1 if the substance moves it can only move in the direction of the solvent flow and cannot move faster than the solvent for

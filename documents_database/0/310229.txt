it is a standard destructive test method used to determine the quality of gate oxides in mos devices it is equal to the total accumulated charge passing through the dielectric layer just before failure thus qbd is a measure of time dependent gate oxide breakdown as a measure of oxide quality qbd can also be a useful predictor of product reliability under specified electrical stress conditions voltage is applied to the mos structure to force a controlled current through the oxide i e to inject a controlled amount of charge into the dielectric layer by measuring the time after which the measured voltage drops towards zero when electrical breakdown occurs and integrating the injected current over time the charge needed to break the gate oxide is determined this gate charge integral is defined as formula 1 where formula 2 is the measurement time at the step just prior to destructive avalanche breakdown there are five common variants of the qbd test method for the v ramp test procedure the measured current is integrated to obtain qbd the measured current is also used as a detection criterion for terminating the voltage ramp one of the defined criteria is the change of

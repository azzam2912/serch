the first ortholog of this protein was discovered in humans subsequently through the use of algorithms and bioinformatics homologs of c1orf131 have been discovered in numerous species and as a result the name of the majority of the proteins in this protein family is uncharacterized protein c1orf131 homolog in humans c1orf131 is located on the minus strand of chromosome 1 and on the cytogenetic band 1q42 2 along with 193 other genes notably the gene upstream of c1orf131 is gnpat and the gene downstream of c1orf131 is trim67 when this gene is transcribed in humans c1orf131 most often forms an mrna of 1458 base pairs long which is composed of seven exons there are at least nine others alternative splice forms in humans that produce proteins they range in size from 129 base pairs 2 exons to 1458 base pairs 7 exons in the c1orf131 protein family the proteins are between 93 and 450 amino acids long however the majority tend to be between 160 295 amino acids long they have a molecular weight between 10 6 and 49 0 kda with the majority between 18 6 and 32 7 kda they have an isoelectric point between 9 6 and

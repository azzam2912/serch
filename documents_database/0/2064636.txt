she is a professor in the department of biology at stanford university where she is the susan b ford professor of humanities and sciences a bass university fellow and a howard hughes medical institute professor mcconnell graduated with a joint a b degree from harvard college and radcliffe college in 1980 she did her doctoral work in the research group of simon levay and received her phd in neurobiology from harvard university in 1987 she was a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of carla j shatz at stanford university mcconnell s research focuses on understanding how neurons in the developing cerebral cortex are produced differentiated and connected to form functional circuits mcconnell s research showed that progression through the cell cycle plays a key role in determining the final differentiated state of a neural progenitor cell mcconnell also confirmed the hypothesis that asymmetric cell division as determined by the orientation of the dividing progenitor s cleavage plane regulates cortical development her work elucidated the first molecular mechanism for this process showing that asymmetrically inherited notch proteins determine whether a new daughter cell will differentiate into a neuron or remain a neural progenitor her work also showed that developing cortical neurons

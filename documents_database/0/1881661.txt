the study aimed to identify the partner genes to the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 fgfr1 involved in the syndrome using the 5 race pcr technique fgfr1op2 was identified as a novel gene with no known function fgfr1op2 when fused with the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 fgfr1 is shown to cause myeloproliferative syndrome the protein encoded by the fgfr1 gene belongs to the fibroblast growth factor receptor family fgfrs usually contain an extracellular ligand binding domain a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain the extracellular domain specifies which ligand the receptor will bind to and mediates ligand induced receptor dimerization when fgfr1op2 is fused to fgfr1 it may exhibit constitutive kinase activity furthermore fgfr1op2 is possibly involved in some steps of the wound healing pathway the following tables compare the homo sapiens fgfr1op2 gene and protein to orthologs in both of the following tables the divergence from the homo sapiens fgfr1op2 gene or protein to the ortholog was found using timetree ortholog mrna and protein sequences were found using ncbi s blast and ucsc s blat tool the accession numbers as well as the sequence length and the sequence similarity were compiled using blast the mrna

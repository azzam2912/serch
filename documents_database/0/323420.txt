crossing of an ocean or sea basin or any other major tectonic structure e g a fault zone by an individual track constitutes a baseline individual tracks are superimposed and if they coincide according to a specified criterion e g shared baselines or compatible track geometries the resulting summary lines are considered generalized or standard tracks generalized tracks suggest the pre existence of ancestral biotas which subsequently become fragmented by tectonic and or climate change the area where two or more generalized tracks intersect is called node it means that different ancestral biotic and geological fragments interrelate in space time as a consequence of terrain collision docking or suturing thus constituting a composite area a concentration of numerical genetical or morphological diversity within a taxon in a given area constitutes a main massing over the last two decades panbiogeography as first conceived by croizat and further developed by researchers in new zealand and latin america became established as a productive research programme in historical biogeography panbiogeography provides a method for analyzing the geographic spatial structure of distributions in order to generate predictions about the evolution of species and other taxa in space and time panbiogeographic key concepts of track node

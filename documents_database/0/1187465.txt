a green of a group is a ring formed from all the isomorphism classes of the finite dimensional linear representations of the group for a given group the ring will depend on the base field of the representations the case of complex coefficients is the most developed but the case of algebraically closed fields of characteristic p where the sylow p subgroups are cyclic is also theoretically approachable given a group g and a field f the elements of its representation ring r g are the formal differences of isomorphism classes of finite dimensional linear f representations of g for the ring structure addition is given by the direct sum of representations and multiplication by their tensor product over f when f is omitted from the notation as in r g then f is implicitly taken to be the field of complex numbers succinctly the representation ring of g is the grothendieck ring of the category of finite dimensional representations of g any representation defines a character g c such a function is constant on conjugacy classes of g a so called class function denote the ring of class functions by c g if g is finite the homomorphism r

junctions 8 was the first integrated version arcady is the acronym for assessment of roundabout capacity and delay this software produced by the transport research laboratory uk models traffic capacity queues and delays at roundabouts the software is largely based on empirical relationships between roundabout geometry and capacity which were established as the result of extensive research carried out on existing roundabouts on the uk road network as well as controlled test track facilities over a period of over a decade the program is used by traffic engineers when assessing existing layouts or when analysing the impacts of proposed design changes estimates of annual accident frequencies can also be obtained the capacity and safety relationships which arcady utilises are discussed in the uk s design manual for roads and bridges rodel is similar to arcady and utilises trl equations under licence from trl papers on arcady from arcady 7 onwards the software has been capable of communicating with certain cad software aiding real time design analysis arcady 7 introduced the ability to model simple networks of linked roundabouts in arcady 8 the hcm 2010 methodology for roundabout analysis was made available arcady 8 also introduced a simulation technique to deal

together these subunits are composed of 4 rna species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins this gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 60s subunit the protein belongs to the l23p family of ribosomal proteins it is located in the cytoplasm the protein may be one of the target molecules involved in mediating growth inhibition by interferon in yeast the corresponding protein binds to a specific site on the 26s rrna this gene is co transcribed with the u42a u42b u101a and u101b small nucleolar rna genes which are located in its third first second and fourth introns respectively as is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome l23a has been identified as an autoimmune target that causes a form of rheumatoid arthritis in mice and which also causes a reaction from t cells and autoantibodies from human rheumatoid arthritis patients

the indian ocean gyre is composed of two major currents the south equatorial current and the west australian current normally moving counter clockwise in the winter the indian ocean gyre reverses direction due to the seasonal winds of the south asian monsoon in the summer the land is warmer than the ocean so surface winds blow from the ocean to the land however during the winter these temperatures reverse making the winds blow from the land to the ocean because most of the air pressure gradient is retained behind the tibetan plateau air pressure gradients over the indian ocean and the gyre are small this results in winds of moderate strength due to the protection from the full force winds blowing off the mongolian high pressure region because of these moderate dry winds the winter monsoon season in the indian ocean region is the dry season for most of southern asia due to this seasonal wind cycle the currents of the indian ocean which make up the indian ocean gyre are directly affected causing reversal like the other gyres it contains a garbage patch a garbage patch is a suspended region of marine debris within the water column that circulate

given polynomials with coefficients in a field k it may not be obvious whether there is a smaller field k and other polynomials defined over k which still define v the issue of field of definition is of concern in diophantine geometry throughout this article k denotes a field the algebraic closure of a field is denoted by adding a superscript of alg e g the algebraic closure of k is k the symbols q r c and f represent respectively the field of rational numbers the field of real numbers the field of complex numbers and the finite field containing p elements affine n space over a field f is denoted by a f results and definitions stated below for affine varieties can be translated to projective varieties by replacing a k with projective space of dimension n 1 over k and by insisting that all polynomials be homogeneous a k algebraic set is the zero locus in a k of a subset of the polynomial ring k x x a k variety is a k algebraic set that is irreducible i e is not the union of two strictly smaller k algebraic sets a k morphism is a

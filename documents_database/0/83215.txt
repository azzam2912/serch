after that vertical angles zenith angles or alternatively elevation angles are obtained with respect to this local vertical and horizontal angles in the plane of the local horizon perpendicular to the vertical levelling instruments again are used to obtain geopotential differences between points on the earth s surface these can then be expressed as height differences by conversion to metric units the earth s gravity field can be described by a potential as follows which expresses the gravity acceleration vector as the gradient of formula 2 the potential of gravity the vector triad formula 3 is the orthonormal set of base vectors in space pointing along the formula 4 coordinate axes note that both gravity and its potential contain a contribution from the centrifugal pseudo force due to the earth s rotation we can write where formula 6 is the potential of the gravitational field formula 2 that of the gravity field and formula 8 that of the centrifugal force field the centrifugal force per unit of mass i e acceleration is given by where is the vector pointing to the point considered straight from the earth s rotational axis it can be shown that this pseudo force field in

the standard defines a declarative fine grained attribute based access control policy language an architecture and a processing model describing how to evaluate access requests according to the rules defined in policies as a published standard specification one of the goals of xacml is to promote common terminology and interoperability between access control implementations by multiple vendors xacml is primarily an attribute based access control system abac where attributes bits of data associated with a user or action or resource are inputs into the decision of whether a given user may access a given resource in a particular way role based access control rbac can also be implemented in xacml as a specialization of abac the xacml model supports and encourages the separation of the access decision from the point of use when access decisions are baked into client applications or based on local machine userids and access control lists acls it is very difficult to update the decision criteria when the governing policy changes when the client is decoupled from the access decision authorization policies can be updated on the fly and affect all clients immediately version 1 0 was ratified by oasis standards organization in 2003 version 2

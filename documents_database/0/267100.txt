sgi to replace their earlier indy series like the indy the o2 used a single mips microprocessor and was intended to be used mainly for multimedia its larger counterpart is the sgi octane the o2 was sgi s last attempt at a low end workstation originally known as the moosehead project the o2 architecture featured a proprietary high bandwidth unified memory architecture uma to connect system components a pci bus is bridged onto the uma with one slot available it had a designer case and an internal modular construction two scsi drives could be mounted on special caddies 1 in the later r10000 r12000 models due to heat constraints and an optional video capture sound cassette mounted on the far left side the o2 comes in two distinct cpu flavours the low end mips 180 to 350 mhz r5000 or rm7000 based units and the higher end 150 to 400 mhz r10000 or r12000 based units the 200 mhz r5000 cpus with 1 mb l2 cache are generally noticeably faster than the 180 mhz r5000s with only 512 kb cache there is a hobbyist project that has successfully retrofitted a 600 mhz rm7xxx mips processor into the o2 there are

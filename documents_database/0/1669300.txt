in 1969 he received his diploma th se de troisi me cycle at university of paris xi in orsay with philippe meyer and claude bouchiat and in 1971 he completed his doctorate doctorat d tat there in 1969 he and his classmate from ens and orsay jo l scherk together with john h schwarz and david gross at princeton university examined divergences in one loop diagrams of the bosonic string theory and discovered the cause of tachyon divergences from 1971 to 1974 neveu was at the laboratory for high energy physics of the university of paris xi where he and scherk showed that spin 1 excitations of strings could describe yang mills theories in 1971 neveu with john schwarz in princeton developed at the same time as pierre ramond 1971 the first string theory that also described fermions called rns formalism after its three originators this was an early appearance of the ideas of supersymmetry which were being developed independently at that time by several groups a few years later neveu working in princeton with david gross developed the gross neveu model with roger dashen and brosl hasslacher he examined among other things quantum field theoretic models of extended hadrons

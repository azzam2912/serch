hikeshi is found on chromosome 11 in humans and chromosome 7 in mice similar sequences orthologs are found in most animal and fungal species the mouse homolog lethal gene on chromosome 7 rinchik 6 protein is encoded by the l7rn6 gene when the l7rn6 protein is disrupted in mice the mice display severe emphysema at birth as a result of disorganization of the golgi apparatus and formation of aberrant vesicular structures within club cells hikeshi is a protein coding gene in homo sapiens alternate names for the gene are flj43020 hspc138 hspc179 and l7rn6 located on long arm of chromosome 11 at area q14 2 the entire gene including introns and exons is 42 698 base pairs on the plus strand the mrna of hikeshi variant 1 includes exons 1 3 4 5 and 7 amounting to 1 183 base pairs with base pairs 239 to 832 representing the coding regions variant 1 is the longest and most common protein coding variant the three other main variants use an alternate exon sequence that throws off the reading frame causing early termination of the mrna sequence and undergoes protein decay the table below shows the different variants and exon usage the

as with all forms of colonialism it is based on exogenous domination typically organized or supported by an imperial authority settler colonialism is enacted by a variety of means ranging from violent depopulation of the previous inhabitants to more subtle legal means such as assimilation or recognition of indigenous identity within a colonial framework although the settler colonial logic of elimination has manifested as genocidal it is not invariably so unlike other forms of colonialism the imperial power does not always represent the same nationality as the settlers however the colonizing authority generally views the settlers as racially superior to the previous inhabitants which may give settlers social movements and political demands greater legitimacy than those of colonized peoples in the eyes of the home colonies whereas natural and human resources are the main motivation behind other forms of colonialism normal colonialism typically ends eventually whereas settler colonialism lasts indefinitely except in the rare event of complete evacuation or settler decolonization settler colonialism is generally discussed in terms of the one way flow of british values which overtake and repudiate the culture and history of the location in question transnational and global studies of settler colonialism often give more importance

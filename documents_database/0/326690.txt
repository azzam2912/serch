ami was designed built and is operated by the cavendish astrophysics group ami was designed primarily for the study of galaxy clusters by observing secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background cmb arising from the sunyaev zel dovich sz effect both arrays are used to observe radiation with frequencies between 12 and 18 ghz and have very similar system designs the telescopes are used to observe both previously known galaxy clusters in an attempt to determine for example their masses and temperatures and to carry out surveys in order to locate previously undiscovered clusters the ami large array ami la is composed of eight 12 8 metre diameter equatorially mounted parabolic antennas which were previously part of the ryle telescope the antennas are separated by distances ranging between 18 and 110 m the telescope has an angular resolution of approximately 30 arcseconds the la is used to image the radio sources mainly radio galaxies that contaminate the small array observations of the cmb the la is being used to carry out the tenth cambridge survey of radio sources the first results from the survey were used to extend the measured 15 ghz source counts to sub millijansky levels this is

this dark green powder is slightly soluble in polar solvents including water it is used as a catalyst for cyclopropanation of alkenes rhodium ii acetate is usually prepared by the heating of hydrated rhodium iii chloride in acetic acid chcooh rhodium ii acetate dimer undergoes ligand exchange the replacement of the acetate group by other carboxylates and related groups the structure of rhodium ii acetate features a pair of rhodium atoms each with octahedral molecular geometry defined by four acetate oxygen atoms water and a rh rh bond of length 2 39 the water adduct is exchangeable and a variety of other lewis bases bind to the axial positions copper ii acetate and chromium ii acetate adopt similar structures the application of dirhodium tetraacetate to organic synthesis was pioneered by teyssie and co workers an extensive range of reactions including insertion into bonds and the cyclopropanation of alkenes and aromatic systems it selectively binds ribonucleosides vs deoxynucleosides by binding selectively to ribonucleosides at their 2 and 3 oh groups rhodium ii acetate dimer compared to copper ii acetate is more reactive and useful in differentiating ribonucleosides and deoxynucleosides because it is soluble in aqueous solution like water whereas copper ii

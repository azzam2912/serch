it was released as the band s fourth single and third single from their debut album the title is a reference to saul bellow s henderson the rain king adam duritz said about this song i read this book in college when i was at berkeley called henderson the rain king and the main character in the book was kind of this big open wound of a person eugene henderson he just sort of bled all over everyone around him for better or for worse full of joy full of sorrow he just made a mess of everything and when i wrote the song years later it didn t really have anything to do with the book except the book had kind of become a totem for how i felt about creativity and writing that it was just this thing where you just took everything inside of you and just sort of funny noise sprayed it all over everything and not to worry too much about it you try and craft it but not to be self conscious about it in any case and it s sort of a song about everything that goes into writing all the feelings everything

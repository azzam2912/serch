it is highly toxic and reacts slowly with water its main use is as a ligand in metal complexes as a ligand it parallels carbon monoxide in metal carbonyls and indeed its toxicity is due to its binding with the iron in blood hemoglobin in a similar way to carbon monoxide phosphorus trifluoride has an f p f bond angle of approximately 96 3 gaseous pf has a standard enthalpy of formation of 945 kj mol 226 kcal mol the phosphorus atom has a nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift of 97 ppm downfield of hpo phosphorus trifluoride hydrolyzes especially at high ph but it is less hydrolytically sensitive than phosphorus trichloride it does not attack glass except at high temperatures and anhydrous potassium hydroxide may be used to dry it with little loss with hot metals phosphides and fluorides are formed with lewis bases such as ammonia addition products adducts are formed and pf is oxidized by oxidizing agents such as bromine or potassium permanganate as a ligand for transition metals pf is a strong acceptor it forms a variety of metal complexes with metals in low oxidation states pf forms several complexes for which the corresponding co derivatives see

in the osi model it is handled by the lowest two layers the data link layer and the physical layer in most communication systems the transmitting point applies source coding followed by channel coding and lastly line coding this produces the baseband signal the presence of filters may perform pulse shaping some systems then use modulation to multiplex many baseband signals into a broadband signal the receiver un does these transformations in reverse order demodulation trellis decoding error detection and correction decompression some communication systems omit one or more of these steps or use techniques that combine several of these steps together for example a morse code transmitter combines source coding channel coding and line coding into one step typically followed by an amplitude modulation step barcodes on the other hand add a checksum digit during channel coding then translate each digit into a barcode symbol during line coding omitting modulation source coding is the elimination of redundancy to make efficient use of storage space and or transmission channels examples of source coding are in digital telecommunications channel coding is a pre transmission mapping applied to a digital signal or data file usually designed to make error correction or at

the analyte can be a drug biochemical substance or cell in an organism or organic sample the measured entity is often called the analyte the measurand or the target of the assay an assay usually aims to measure an analyte s intensive property and express it in the relevant measurement unit e g molarity density functional activity in enzyme international units degree of effect in comparison to a standard etc if the assay involves exogenous reactants the reagents then their quantities are kept fixed or in excess so that the quantity and quality of the target are the only limiting factors the difference in the assay outcome is used to deduce the unknown quality or quantity of the target in question some assays e g biochemical assays may be similar to chemical analysis and titration however assays typically involve biological material or phenomena that are intrinsically more complex in composition or behavior or both thus reading of an assay may be noisy and involve greater difficulties in interpretation than an accurate chemical titration on the other hand older generation qualitative assays especially bioassays may be much more gross and less quantitative e g counting death or dysfunction of an organism

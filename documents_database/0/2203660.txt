the site is one of the longest standing sssis in england having been listed since 1954 and displays the interaction of a fluid magma rock now known as the whin sill interacting with older sedimentary rock coastal erosion at the site enables sections of the geological strata to be seen in turn the soil associated with the whin sill gives rise to a distinct pattern of vegetation which on its own merits is at this site found notable the bamburgh coast and hills sssi is situated on the east coast of the far north east of england in the county of northumberland about north east of the town of bamburgh the site is t shaped the bar of the t running for approximately along the north west south east orientated beachfront north of bamburgh and the descender running inland for some following a south east facing escarpment as high ground at circa above sea level falls to a new level at circa both the coast and the escarpment expose sections of strata of whin sill and underlying rock making the site advantageous for studies of local geology the strata at bamburgh is complex and appears to show areas of faults

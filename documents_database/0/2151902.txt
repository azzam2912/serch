the y axis represents the load on the engine the contour lines show the specific fuel consumption indicating the areas of the speed load regime where the engine is more or less efficient the map contains each possible condition combining rotational speed and mean effective pressure it shows the result of specific fuel consumption a typical rotation power output p linear to formula 1 is reached on several locations on the map but differing in the amount of fuel consumption automatic transmissions are designed to keep the engine at the speed with the lowest possible fuel consumption given the power demand the map also shows the efficiency of the engine depending on the fuel type diesel and gasoline engines reach up to 210 g kwh and about 40 efficiency using natural gas this efficiency is reached at 200 g kwh average values are 160 180 g kwh for slow moving two stroke diesel boat engines using fuel oil reaching up to 55 efficiency at 300 rpm 195 210 g kwh at cooled and pre charged diesel engines for passenger cars trucks 195 225 g kwh non charged otto cycle gasoline engines for passenger cars 250 350 g kwh

their distinguishing features include lower temperature pressure ranges 50 to 100 c and a special proton conducting polymer electrolyte membrane pemfcs generate electricity and operate on the opposite principle to pem electrolysis which consumes electricity they are a leading candidate to replace the aging alkaline fuel cell technology which was used in the space shuttle pemfcs are built out of membrane electrode assemblies mea which include the electrodes electrolyte catalyst and gas diffusion layers an ink of catalyst carbon and electrode are sprayed or painted onto the solid electrolyte and carbon paper is hot pressed on either side to protect the inside of the cell and also act as electrodes the pivotal part of the cell is the triple phase boundary tpb where the electrolyte catalyst and reactants mix and thus where the cell reactions actually occur importantly the membrane must not be electrically conductive so the half reactions do not mix operating temperatures above 100 c are desired so the water byproduct becomes steam and water management becomes less critical in cell design a proton exchange membrane fuel cell transforms the chemical energy liberated during the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to electrical energy as opposed to the

common examples of spaces that groups act on are sets vector spaces and topological spaces actions of groups on vector spaces are called representations of the group for a given finite set the symmetric group is an abstraction used to describe the permutations of elements of that set the concept of group action formalizes the relationship between the group and the permutations of the set it relates each element of the group to a particular transformation subgroups of the symmetric group including the symmetric group itself are called permutation groups a permutation representation of a group g is a representation of g as a group of permutations of some set and may be described as a group representation of g by permutation matrices to include non finite cases the concept of permutation is generalized as a bijective transformation the bijective transformations of a set form a group whose subgroups are transformation groups an example is the group of linear transformations that act on a vector space group action is an extension to the notion of symmetric group in which every element of the group acts as a bijective transformation on the given set without being identified with that transformation this

equivalently it can be described as a complete graph with vertices located on the integer square grid formula 1 such that all mutual distances between the vertices are integers while all other grid points have a non integer distance to at least one vertex erd s diophantine graphs are named after paul erd s and diophantus of alexandria they form a subset of the set of diophantine figures which are defined as complete graphs in the diophantine plane for which the length of all edges are integers unit distance graphs thus erd s diophantine graphs are exactly the diophantine figures that cannot be extended the existence of erd s diophantine graphs follows from the erd s anning theorem according to which infinite diophantine figures must be collinear in the diophantine plane hence any process of extending a non collinear diophantine figure by adding vertices must eventually reach a figure that can no longer be extended any set of zero or one point can be trivially extended and any diophantine set of two points can be extended by more points on the same line therefore all diophantine sets with fewer than three nodes can be extended so erd s diophantine graphs

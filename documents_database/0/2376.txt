it is the most familiar of the theories of physics the concepts it covers such as mass acceleration and force are commonly used and known the subject is based upon a three dimensional euclidean space with fixed axes called a frame of reference the point of concurrency of the three axes is known as the origin of the particular space classical mechanics utilises many equations as well as other mathematical concepts which relate various physical quantities to one another these include differential equations manifolds lie groups and ergodic theory this page gives a summary of the most important of these this article lists equations from newtonian mechanics see analytical mechanics for the more general formulation of classical mechanics which includes lagrangian and hamiltonian mechanics every conservative force has a potential energy by following two principles one can consistently assign a non relative value to u in the following rotational definitions the angle can be any angle about the specified axis of rotation it is customary to use but this does not have to be the polar angle used in polar coordinate systems the unit axial vector defines the axis of rotation formula 2 unit vector in direction of r formula

it was discovered by lewis swift on november 19 1897 at a distance of about 50 milion light years and redshift of 1057 km s it is one of the closest galaxies of fornax cluster to us it is a member of it along with other 200 galaxies in cluster ic 1993 is a galaxy with several spiral arms in its disc and it has a hubble classification of r sa s bc indicating it is a intermediate spiral galaxy with ring on its outer edges it is a remote galaxy far from center of fornax cluster it is at the edge of fornax cluster near the galaxy is bright foreground star that makes deep observations more difficult so the galaxy s apparent magnitude is 12 6 its size on night sky is 2 5 x 2 2 which is along with it distance proportional to real size of 45 000 light years ic 1993 is one of the 25 galaxies known have rings or partial rings most resemble local collisional ring galaxies in morphology size and clumpy star formation clump ages range from to yr and clump masses go up to several solar masses based on color evolution models

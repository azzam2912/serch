developed in 2010 by national institute of standards and technology physicists the clock was 37 times more precise than the then existing international standard the quantum logic clock is based on an aluminium spectroscopy ion with a logic atom both the aluminum based quantum clock and the mercury based optical atomic clock track time by the ion vibration at an optical frequency using a uv laser that is 100 000 times higher than the microwave frequencies used in nist f1 and other similar time standards around the world quantum clocks like this are able to be far more precise than microwave standards the nist team are not able to measure clock ticks per second because the definition of a second is based on the nist f1 which cannot measure a more precise machine however the aluminum ion clock s measured frequency to the current standard is 1121015393207857 4 7 hz nist have attributed the clock s accuracy to the fact that it is insensitive to background magnetic and electric fields and unaffected by temperature in march 2008 physicists at nist described an experimental quantum logic clock based on individual ions of beryllium and aluminum this clock was compared to nist

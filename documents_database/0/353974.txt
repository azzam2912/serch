in the cryptobiotic state all measurable metabolic processes stop preventing reproduction development and repair when environmental conditions return to being hospitable the organism will return to its metabolic state of life as it was prior to the cryptobiosis anhydrobiosis is the most studied form of cryptobiosis and occurs in situations of extreme desiccation the term anhydrobiosis derives from the greek for life without water and is most commonly used for the desiccation tolerance observed in certain invertebrate animals such as bdelloid rotifers tardigrades brine shrimp nematodes and at least one insect a species of chironomid polypedilum vanderplanki however other life forms including the resurrection plant craterostigma plantagineum the majority of plant seeds and many microorganisms such as bakers yeast also exhibit desiccation tolerance studies have shown that some anhydrobiotic organisms can survive for decades even centuries in the dry state invertebrates undergoing anhydrobiosis often contract into a smaller shape and some proceed to form a sugar called trehalose desiccation tolerance in plants is associated with the production of another sugar sucrose these sugars are thought to protect the organism from desiccation damage in some creatures such as bdelloid rotifers no trehalose has been found which has led scientists to propose

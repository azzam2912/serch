driving the pinion into rotation causes the rack to be driven linearly driving the rack linearly will cause the pinion to be driven into a rotation for example in a rack railway the rotation of a pinion mounted on a locomotive or a railcar engages a rack between the rails and forces a train up a steep slope for every pair of conjugate involute profile there is a basic rack this basic rack is the profile of the conjugate gear of infinite pitch radius i e a toothed straight edge a generating rack is a rack outline used to indicate tooth details and dimensions for the design of a generating tool such as a hob or a gear shaper cutter rack and pinion combinations are often used as part of a simple linear actuator where the rotation of a shaft powered by hand or by a motor is converted to linear motion the rack carries the full load of the actuator directly and so the driving pinion is usually small so that the gear ratio reduces the torque required this force thus torque may still be substantial and so it is common for there to be a reduction gear immediately

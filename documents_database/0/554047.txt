medical genetics differs from human genetics in that human genetics is a field of scientific research that may or may not apply to medicine while medical genetics refers to the application of genetics to medical care for example research on the causes and inheritance of genetic disorders would be considered within both human genetics and medical genetics while the diagnosis management and counselling people with genetic disorders would be considered part of medical genetics in contrast the study of typically non medical phenotypes such as the genetics of eye color would be considered part of human genetics but not necessarily relevant to medical genetics except in situations such as albinism genetic medicine is a newer term for medical genetics and incorporates areas such as gene therapy personalized medicine and the rapidly emerging new medical specialty predictive medicine medical genetics encompasses many different areas including clinical practice of physicians genetic counselors and nutritionists clinical diagnostic laboratory activities and research into the causes and inheritance of genetic disorders examples of conditions that fall within the scope of medical genetics include birth defects and dysmorphology mental retardation autism mitochondrial disorders skeletal dysplasia connective tissue disorders cancer genetics teratogens and prenatal diagnosis medical genetics

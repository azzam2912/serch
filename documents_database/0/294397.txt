it can relate to networking electronics or physics in computer networks propagation delay is the amount of time it takes for the head of the signal to travel from the sender to the receiver it can be computed as the ratio between the link length and the propagation speed over the specific medium propagation delay is equal to d s where d is the distance and s is the wave propagation speed in wireless communication s c i e the speed of light in copper wire the speed s generally ranges from 59c to 77c this delay is the major obstacle in the development of high speed computers and is called the interconnect bottleneck in ic systems in electronics digital circuits and digital electronics the propagation delay or gate delay is the length of time which starts when the input to a logic gate becomes stable and valid to change to the time that the output of that logic gate is stable and valid to change often on manufacturers datasheets this refers to the time required for the output to reach 50 of its final output level when the input changes to 50 of its final input level reducing gate

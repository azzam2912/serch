no directives for parallel execution are required nowadays parallel shared memory symmetric multiprocessors smp are complex machines where a large number of architectural aspects have to be simultaneously addressed in order to achieve high performance recent commodity smp machines for technical computing can have many tightly coupled cores good examples are smp machines based on intel multi core processors or ibm power multi core processors the number of cores per smp node probably will be doubling next couple of years according to the unveiled plans of computer manufacturing companies multi cores are intended to exploit a thread level parallelism identified by software hence the most challenging task is to find an efficient way of how to harness power of multi core processors for processing an application program in parallel existent openmp paradigm of the static parallelization with a fork join runtime library works pretty well for loop intensive regular array based computations only however compile time parallelization methods are weak in general and almost inapplicable for irregular applications a novel bmdfm binary modular data flow machine technology mainly uses dynamic scheduling to exploit parallelism of an application program thus bmdfm avoids mentioned disadvantages of the compile time methods bmdfm is

there is no confirmed function of ccdc37 the human gene ccdc37 is found on chromosome 3 at the band 3q21 3 it extends from base pairs 90 403 731 to 90 429 231 making the gene 25 500 base pairs long it is located on the plus strand and contains 17 exons the ortholog space of ccdc37 is fairly broad including mammals reptiles birds amphibians fish invertebrates and fungi the gene encodes a protein called ccdc37 this protein in 611 amino acids in length and has a molecular weight of 71 1 kilodaltons and an isoelectric point of pi 6 7 ccdc37 contains a duf4200 region located from amino acid 151 to 269 there is no known frunction for duf4200 ccdc37 also contains three coiled coil domains at amino acids 164 203 392 436 and 526 571 the protein has several probable post translational modifications it contains four possible pest sequence at amino acids 17 36 293 304 337 360 and 360 395 it also contains a possible substrate of n acetyltransferase a at ser ccdc37 has a predicted nuclear localization via reinhard s method reliability 94 1 using a bipartite nuclear localization signal peptide starting at amino acid 155

a network of approximately 170 seismic stations along with data generated from sources such as infrasound hydroacoustics and radionuclide detection is used to identify and locate nuclear detonations forensic seismology is specifically used to locate nuclear detonations that may have occurred underneath the ground seismic stations record underground pressure waves and transmit this data for processing via secure communication links there are many challenges involved with trying to differentiate a nuclear explosion from other natural and man made phenomena such as earthquakes mining explosions and construction nuclear explosions exceeding 150 kilotons generate pressure waves that primarily travel through the earth s core and mantle these types of explosions are straightforward to identify because the mixture of rock the signals pass through is fairly homogeneous and the signals generated are free from noise smaller nuclear explosions are more difficult to identify because pressure waves primarily travel through the earth s upper mantle and crust leading to signal distortion due to the heterogeneity of rocks at this depth nations may also conduct clandestine underground tests that are not easily identifiable one method of hiding an underground nuclear detonation is called decoupling this involves detonating a nuclear warhead in an underground cavity in

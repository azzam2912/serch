when the universe began matter was distributed homogeneously but over billions of years galaxies clusters of galaxies and superclusters have coalesced and must according to einstein s theory of general relativity warp the space time around them while the standard model acknowledges this fact it assumes that such inhomogeneities are not sufficient to affect large scale averages of gravity in our observations when two separate type ia supernovae were independently observed in 1998 to be further away than our calculations showed they should be it was concluded that the expansion of the universe is accelerating and dark energy a repulsive energy inherent in space was proposed to explain the acceleration while still unexplained in nature and origin dark energy is widely accepted as comprising almost 70 of the universe s energy density by contrast inhomogeneous cosmologies assume that the backreactions of denser structures as well as those of very empty voids on space time are significant enough that when not taken into account they distort our understanding of time and our observations of distant objects following thomas buchert s publication of equations in 1997 and 2000 that derive from general relativity but also allow for the inclusion of local gravitational

under a majority of taxation systems around the world and until recently under the united states tax system firms are taxed on their profits and individuals are taxed on their personal income for example a firm that earns 100 in profits in the united states would have to pay around 30 in taxes if it then distributes these profits to its owners as dividends then the owners in turn pay taxes on this income say 20 on the 70 of dividends the 100 of profits turned into 50 of investor income if instead the firm finances with debt then assuming the firm owes 100 of interest to investors its profits are now 0 investors now pay taxes on their interest income say 30 this implies for 100 of profits before taxes investors got 70 this tax related encouragement of debt financing has not gone uncriticized for example some critics have argued that the cost of equity should also be deductible which could reduce the internal revenue code s influence on capital structure decisions potentially reducing the economic instability attributable to excessive debt financing

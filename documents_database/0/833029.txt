it is a quantum field theory of a set of non interacting particles the primons it is called a gas or a free model because the particles are non interacting the idea of the primon gas was independently discovered by donald spector and bernard julia later works by bakas and bowick and spector explored the connection of such systems to string theory consider a space with states eigenstates formula 1 labelled by the prime numbers p the second quantized converts states into particles the primons a multi particle state is given by the numbers formula 2 of primons in the single particle states formula 3 this corresponds to the factorization of formula 5 into primes the labelling by the integer n is unique since every number has a unique factorization into primes if we take a simple quantum hamiltonian h to have eigenvalues proportional to log p that is with we are naturally led to the partition function z is given by the riemann zeta function with s e k t where k is boltzmann s constant and t is the absolute temperature the divergence of the zeta function at s 1 corresponds to the divergence of the partition function

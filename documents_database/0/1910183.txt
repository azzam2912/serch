three have been launched the first in december 2010 the first two launches failed before fourth stage ignition the first as a result of a problem with the blok dm s fuel load initial versions of the blok dm 03 are powered by a single rd 58m engine fueled by rg 1 and oxidised by liquid oxygen the last evolution is powered by the improved rd 58mf a less powerful but more efficient evolution of the venerable engine it can carry 25 more propellant than the blok dm 2 which it replaced as a proton upper stage for some government launches however most government launches and all commercial missions use the briz m instead the payloads for the first two blok dm 03 launches were groups of three uragan m satellites for the glonass programme with further missions slated to carry three more uragan m satellites and two ekspress satellites on separate launches the blok dm can inject payloads into orbit more accurately than the briz m making it better suited for launching satellites such as the uragan m which lack apogee motors when production ended in 2012 five blok dm 03 stages had been produced by rkk energia for

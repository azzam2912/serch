more technically it is the relationship between the maxillary upper and mandibular lower teeth when they approach each other as occurs during chewing or at rest static occlusion refers to contact between teeth when the jaw is closed and stationary while dynamic occlusion refers to occlusal contacts made when the jaw is moving the masticatory system also involves the periodontium the tmj and other skeletal components and the neuromusculature therefore the tooth contacts should not be looked at in isolation as the primary baby teeth begin to erupt at 6 months of age the maxillary and mandibular teeth aim to occlude with one another the erupting teeth are moulded into position by the tongue the cheeks and lips during development upper and lower primary teeth should be correctly occluding and aligned after 2 years whilst they are continuing to develop with full root development complete at 3 years of age around a year after development of the teeth is complete the jaws continue to grow which results in spacing between some of the teeth diastema this effect is greatest in the anterior front teeth and can be seen from around age 4 5 years this spacing is important as it

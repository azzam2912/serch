the set r of real numbers together with the operation of addition and the usual ordering relation between pairs of numbers is an archimedean group by a result of otto h lder every archimedean group is isomorphic to a subgroup of this group the name archimedean comes from otto stolz who named the archimedean property after its appearance in the works of archimedes an additive group consists of a set of elements an associative addition operation that combines pairs of elements and returns a single element an identity element or zero element whose sum with any other element is the other element and an additive inverse operation such that the sum of any element and its inverse is zero a group is a linearly ordered group when in addition its elements can be linearly ordered in a way that is compatible with the group operation for all elements x y and z if x y then x z y z and z x z y the notation na where n is a natural number stands for the group sum of n copies of a an archimedean group g is a linearly ordered group subject to the following additional condition the

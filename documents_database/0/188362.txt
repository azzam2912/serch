this method allows the generation of pulses of light with a duration as short as a few femtoseconds the optical kerr effect is a process which results from the nonlinear response of an optical medium to the electric field of an electromagnetic wave the refractive index of the medium is dependent on the field strength because of the non uniform power density distribution in a gaussian beam as found in laser resonators the refractive index changes across the beam profile the refractive index experienced by the beam is greater in the center of the beam than at the edge thus a rod of an active kerr medium functions as a lens for high intensity light this is called self focusing and in extreme cases leads to material destruction in the laser cavity short bursts of light will then be focused differently from continuous waves cw to favor the pulsed mode over cw the cavity could be made unstable for cw operation but more often a low stability is a by product of a cavity design putting emphasis on aperture effects older designs used a hard aperture that simply cuts off while modern designs use a soft aperture that means the

it is a derivative of the compound with the iupac name tetrazene tetrazene is slightly more impact sensitive than mercury fulminate when pressed enough its sensitivity is reduced or destroyed this is known as dead pressing it also decomposes in boiling water in contact with fire it readily explodes producing large amounts of black smoke it is prepared by reacting sodium nitrite with an aminoguanidine salt dissolved in acetic acid at 30 40 c the decomposition of tetrazene is quite rapid around 90 c a sample of tetrazene was heated in an oven at 90 c and its rate of thermal decomposition was monitored by infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy the thermal decomposition reaction is autocatalytic and it is likely that the same reaction can occur at even lower temperatures however at much slower rates many explosives are considered to be highly sensitive to mechanical stimuli such as impact friction stab heat static electricity flame etc since explosive compounds are subject to friction practically every time they are handled it is of particular interest to be aware of the sensitivity to friction the sensitivity of tetrazene was determined using a fskm pex friction sensitivity tester the probability of ignition of tetrazene

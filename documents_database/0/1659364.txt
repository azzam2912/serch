the ppg signal consists of pulses that reflect the change in vascular blood volume with each cardiac beat beat to beat fluctuations known as photoplethysmogram variability ppgv are found in the signal baseline and amplitude which reflects various physiological influences such as respiration and regulation of vascular tone by the sympathetic nervous system the beat to beat variation of the ppg in time domain can be represented in the frequency domain by means of signal transformation methods such as fast fourier transform or autoregressive model the spectrum can be divided into two main bands that is low frequency lf band ranging from 0 04 to 0 15 hz and high frequency hf band between 0 15 and 0 6 hz the lf band can be subdivided into a mid frequency mf band from 0 09 hz to 0 15 hz the integration of the power spectral density over the frequency range will give the spectral power low frequency oscillation in the ppg is found to reflect the sympathetic control over the peripheral circulation whilst the high frequency component is related to the mechanical consequence of respiration on venous return the ppgv was found to be useful in detecting blood loss

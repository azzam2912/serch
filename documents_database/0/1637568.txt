this phenomenon is understood to be an important source of novelty in evolution providing for an expanded repertoire of molecular activities the underlying mutational event of duplication may be a conventional gene duplication mutation within a chromosome or a larger scale event involving whole chromosomes aneuploidy or whole genomes polyploidy a classic view owing to susumu ohno which is known as ohno model he explains how duplication creates redundancy the redundant copy accumulates beneficial mutations which provides fuel for innovation knowledge of evolution by gene duplication has advanced more rapidly in the past 15 years due to new genomic data more powerful computational methods of comparative inference and new evolutionary models several models exist that try to explain how new cellular functions of genes and their encoded protein products evolve through the mechanism of duplication and divergence although each model can explain certain aspects of the evolutionary process the relative importance of each aspect is still unclear this page only presents which theoretical models are currently discussed in the literature review articles on this topic can be found at the bottom in the following a distinction will be made between explanations for the short term effects preservation of a gene

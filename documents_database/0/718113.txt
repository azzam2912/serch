developed originally for use in scandinavia this hydrological transport model has also been applied in a large number of catchments on most continents this is the major application of hbv and has gone through much refinement it comprises the following routines the hbv model is a lumped conceptual catchment model that has relatively few model parameters and minimal forcing input requirement usually the daily temperature and the daily precipitation first the snow is calculated after defining a threshold melting temperature tt usually 0 c and a parameter cmelt that reflects the equivalent melted snow for the difference of temperature the result is divided into a liquid part that is the surface runoff and a second part that infiltrates second the soil moisture is calculated after defining an initial value and the field capacity fc third calculation of the actual evapotranspiration etpa first by using an external model ex penman for finding the potential etp and then fitting the result to the temperatures and the permanent wilting point pwp of the catchment in question a parameter c which reflects the increase in the etp with the differences in temperatures actual temperature and monthly mean temperature the model consists of considering the

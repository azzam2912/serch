this assumption allowed planck to derive a formula for the entire spectrum of the radiation emitted by a black body planck was unable to justify this assumption based on classical physics he considered quantization as being purely a mathematical trick rather than as is now known a fundamental change in the understanding of the world in other words planck then contemplated virtual oscillators in 1905 albert einstein adapted the planck postulate to explain the photoelectric effect but einstein proposed that the energy of photons themselves was quantized and that quantization was not merely a feature of microscopic oscillators planck s postulate was further applied to understanding the compton effect and was applied by niels bohr to explain the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom and derive the correct value of the rydberg constant

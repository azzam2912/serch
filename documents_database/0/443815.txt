block cellular automata are useful for simulations of physical quantities because it is straightforward to choose transition rules that obey physical constraints such as reversibility and conservation laws a block cellular automaton consists of the following components in each time step the transition rule is applied simultaneously and synchronously to all of the tiles in the partition then the partition is shifted and the same operation is repeated in the next time step and so forth in this way as with any cellular automaton the pattern of cell states changes over time to perform some nontrivial computation or simulation the simplest partitioning scheme is probably the margolus neighborhood named after norman margolus who first studied block cellular automata using this neighborhood structure in the margolus neighborhood the lattice is divided into cell blocks or squares in two dimensions or cubes in three dimensions etc which are shifted by one cell along each dimension on alternate timesteps a closely related technique due to k morita and m harao consists in partitioning each cell into a finite number of parts each part being devoted to some neighbor the evolution proceeds by exchanging the corresponding parts between neighbors and then applying on each

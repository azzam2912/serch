they are helical structures containing guanine tetrads that can form from one two or four strands the unimolecular forms often occur naturally near the ends of the chromosomes better known as the telomeric regions and in transcriptional regulatory regions of multiple genes and oncogenes four guanine bases can associate through hoogsteen hydrogen bonding to form a square planar structure called a guanine tetrad g tetrad or g quartet and two or more guanine tetrads from g tracts continuous runs of guanine can stack on top of each other to form a g quadruplex the placement and bonding to form g quadruplexes are not random and serve very unusual functional purposes the quadruplex structure is further stabilized by the presence of a cation especially potassium which sits in a central channel between each pair of tetrads they can be formed of dna rna lna and pna and may be intramolecular bimolecular or tetramolecular depending on the direction of the strands or parts of a strand that form the tetrads structures may be described as parallel or antiparallel g quadruplex structures can be computationally predicted from dna or rna sequence motifs but their actual structures can be quite varied within and between

it is a simple generalization of the euler method for ordinary differential equations to stochastic differential equations it is named after leonhard euler and gisiro maruyama unfortunately the same generalization cannot be done for any arbitrary deterministic method consider the stochastic differential equation see it calculus with initial condition x x where w stands for the wiener process and suppose that we wish to solve this sde on some interval of time 0 t then the euler maruyama approximation to the true solution x is the markov chain y defined as follows the random variables w are independent and identically distributed normal random variables with expected value zero and variance formula 6 an area that has benefited significantly from sde is biology or more precisely mathematical biology here the number of publications on the use of stochastic model grew as most of the models are nonlinear demanding numerical schemes the graphic depicts a stochastic differential equation being solved using the euler scheme the deterministic counterpart is shown as well the following python code implements the euler maruyama method and uses it to solve the ornstein uhlenbeck process defined by the random numbers for formula 9 are generated using the numpy

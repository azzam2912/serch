the general doctrinal outlook of the ra gama s tra is that of esoteric buddhism and buddha nature with some influence from yogacara there have been questions regarding the translation of this sutra as it was not sponsored by the imperial chinese court and as such the records regarding its translation in the early eighth century were not carefully preserved see history however it has never been classified as apocrypha in any chinese language tripitakas including the taisho tripitaka where it is placed in the esoteric sutra category the sutra was translated into tibetan during the late eighth to early ninth century and a complete translation exists in tibetan mongolian and the manchu languages see translations current consensus is that the text is a compilation of indic materials with extensive editing in china rather than a translation of a single text from sanskrit a sanskrit language palm leaf manuscript consisting of 226 leaves with 6 leaves missing was discovered in a temple in china if verified the perennial questions regarding the authenticity of the ra gama s tra can be put to rest the complete title preserved in meaning an alternate translation of the title reads an original sanskrit version

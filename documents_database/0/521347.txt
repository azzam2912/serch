4 is a string sextet in one movement composed by arnold schoenberg in 1899 composed in just three weeks it is considered his earliest important work it was inspired by richard dehmel s poem of the same name combined with the influence of schoenberg s strong feelings upon meeting mathilde von zemlinsky the sister of his teacher alexander von zemlinsky whom he would later marry the movement can be divided into five distinct sections which refer to the five stanzas of dehmel s poem however there are no unified criteria regarding movement separation dehmel s poem from 1896 describes a man and woman walking through a dark forest on a moonlit night the woman shares a dark secret with her new lover she bears the child of another man the stages of dehmel s poem are reflected throughout the composition beginning with the sadness of the woman s confession a neutral interlude wherein the man reflects upon the confession and a finale reflecting the man s bright acceptance and forgiveness of the woman o sieh wie klar das weltall schimmert es ist ein glanz um alles her see how brightly the universe gleams there is a radiance on everything schoenberg

its molecule has a heterocyclic core with four carbon and two oxygen atoms the formula can also be written as it is a crystalline colorless solid sparingly soluble in water it decomposes on heating with release of carbon dioxide and acetone the compound can easily lose an hydrogen ion from the methylene element in the ring carbon 5 which creates a double bond between it and one of the adjacent carbons number 4 or 6 and a negative charge in the corresponding oxygen the resulting anion is stabilized by resonance between the two alternatives so that the double bond is delocalized and each oxygen in the carbonyls has a formal charge of 1 2 the ionization constant p k is 4 97 which makes it behave as a strong monobasic acid in this and other properties the compound resembles dimedone and barbituric acid however while dimedone exists in solution predominantly as the mono enol tautomer meldrum s acid is almost entirely as the diketone form the high acidity of this compound was long considered anomalous it is 8 orders of magnitude more acidic than the closely related compound dimethyl malonate in 2004 ohwada and coworkers determined that the energy minimizing

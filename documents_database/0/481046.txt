it has an apparent visual magnitude of 2 712 making it readily visible to the naked eye at night parallax measurements place it at a distance of from the sun gamma aquilae is a relatively young star with an age of about 100 million years nevertheless it has reached a stage of its evolution where it has consumed the hydrogen at its core and expanded into what is termed a bright giant star with a stellar classification of k3 ii the star is now burning helium into carbon in its core after it has finished generating energy through nuclear fusion gamma aquilae will become a white dwarf the interferometry measured angular diameter of gamma aquilae is mas which at its estimated distance equates to a physical radius of about 95 times the radius of the sun with almost six times the sun s mass this is an enormous star that is radiating over times the luminosity of the sun an effective temperature of in its outer envelope gives it the orange hue typical of k type stars a 1991 catalogue of photometry reported that gamma aquilae showed some variation in its brightness but this has not been confirmed aquilae latinised

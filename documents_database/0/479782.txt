colour the collected data can then be used to construct digital 3d models a 3d scanner can be based on many different technologies each with its own limitations advantages and costs many limitations in the kind of objects that can be digitised are still present for example optical technology may encounter many difficulties with shiny reflective or transparent objects for example industrial computed tomography scanning and structured light 3d scanners can be used to construct digital 3d models without destructive testing collected 3d data is useful for a wide variety of applications these devices are used extensively by the entertainment industry in the production of movies and video games including virtual reality other common applications of this technology include augmented reality motion capture gesture recognition robotic mapping industrial design orthotics and prosthetics reverse engineering and prototyping quality control inspection and the digitization of cultural artifacts the purpose of a 3d scanner is usually to create a 3d model this 3d model consists of a point cloud of geometric samples on the surface of the subject these points can then be used to extrapolate the shape of the subject a process called reconstruction if colour information is collected at each point

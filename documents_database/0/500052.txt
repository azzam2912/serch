it was founded to study vector bundles on topological spaces by means of ideas now recognised as general k theory that were introduced by alexander grothendieck the early work on topological theory is due to michael atiyah and friedrich hirzebruch let be a compact hausdorff space and formula 1 or formula 2 then formula 3 is defined to be the grothendieck group of the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of finite dimensional vector bundles over under whitney sum tensor product of bundles gives theory a commutative ring structure without subscripts formula 4 usually denotes complex theory whereas real theory is sometimes written as formula 5 the remaining discussion is focused on complex theory as a first example note that the theory of a point are the integers this is because vector bundles over a point are trivial and thus classified by their rank and the grothendieck group of the natural numbers is the integers there is also a reduced version of theory formula 6 defined for a compact pointed space cf reduced homology this reduced theory is intuitively modulo trivial bundles it is defined as the group of stable equivalence classes of bundles two bundles and are said to be

there are two main kinds of solitons in order to understand how a spatial soliton can exist we have to make some considerations about a simple convex lens as shown in the picture on the right an optical field approaches the lens and then it is focused the effect of the lens is to introduce a non uniform phase change that causes focusing this phase change is a function of the space and can be represented with formula 1 whose shape is approximately represented in the picture the phase change can be expressed as the product of the phase constant and the width of the path the field has covered we can write it as where formula 3 is the width of the lens changing in each point with a shape that is the same of formula 1 because formula 5 and n are constants in other words in order to get a focusing effect we just have to introduce a phase change of such a shape but we are not obliged to change the width if we leave the width l fixed in each point but we change the value of the refractive index formula 6 we will get

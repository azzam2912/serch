the imperative programming style of esterel allows the simple expression of parallelism and preemption as a consequence it is well suited for control dominated model designs the development of the language started in the early 1980s and was mainly carried out by a team of ecole des mines de paris and inria led by g rard berry in france current compilers take esterel programs and generate c code or hardware rtl implementations vhdl or verilog the language is still under development with several compilers out the commercial version of esterel is the development environment esterel studio the company that commercialize it synfora initiated a normalization process with the ieee in april 2007 however the working group p1778 dissolved march 2011 the esterel v7 reference manual version v7 30 initial ieee standardization proposal is publicly available the notion of time used in esterel differs from that of non synchronous languages in the following way the notion of physical time is replaced with the notion of order only the simultaneity and precedence of events are considered this means that the physical time does not play any special role this is called multiform notion of time an esterel program describes a totally ordered

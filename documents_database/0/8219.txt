a memory leak may also happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code a memory leak has symptoms similar to a number of other problems and generally can only be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the programs source code a space leak occurs when a computer program uses more memory than necessary in contrast to memory leaks where the leaked memory is never released the memory consumed by a space leak is released but later than expected because they can exhaust available system memory as an application runs memory leaks are often the cause of or a contributing factor to software aging a memory leak reduces the performance of the computer by reducing the amount of available memory eventually in the worst case too much of the available memory may become allocated and all or part of the system or device stops working correctly the application fails or the system slows down vastly due to thrashing memory leaks may not be serious or even detectable by normal means in modern operating systems normal memory used by an application is released when the application terminates this means that a memory leak

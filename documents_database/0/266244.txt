they exist in form of molecular crystals or amorphous thin films in general they are electrical insulators but become semiconducting when charges are either injected from appropriate electrodes upon doping or by photoexcitation in molecular crystals the energetic separation between the top of the valence band and the bottom conduction band i e the band gap is typically 2 5 4 ev while in inorganic semiconductors the band gaps are typically 1 2 ev this implies that they are in fact insulators rather than semiconductors in the conventional sense they become semiconducting only when charge carriers are either injected from the electrodes or generated by intentional or unintentional doping charge carriers can also be generated in the course of optical excitation it is important to realize however that the primary optical excitations are neutral excitons with a coulomb binding energy of typically 0 5 1 0 ev the reason is that in organic semiconductors their dielectric constants are as low as 3 4 this impedes efficient photogeneration of charge carriers in neat systems in the bulk efficient photogeneration can only occur in binary systems due to charge transfer between donor and acceptor moieties otherwise neutral excitons decay radiatively to the

an explosive yield of one terajoule is equal to because the accuracy of any measurement of the energy released by tnt has always been problematic the conventional definition is that one kiloton of tnt is held simply to be equivalent to 10 calories the yield to weight ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon the practical maximum yield to weight ratio for fusion weapons thermonuclear weapons has been estimated to six megatons of tnt per metric ton of bomb mass 25 tj kg yields of 5 2 megatons ton and higher have been reported for large weapons constructed for single warhead use in the early 1960s since then the smaller warheads needed to achieve the increased net damage efficiency bomb damage bomb mass of multiple warhead systems have resulted in decreases in the yield mass ratio for single modern warheads in order of increasing yield most yield figures are approximate as a comparison the blast yield of the gbu 43 massive ordnance air blast bomb is 0 011 kt and that of the oklahoma city bombing using a truck based fertilizer bomb was 0 002 kt most artificial non nuclear explosions are considerably

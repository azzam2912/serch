the ground is said to be floating when this connection does not exist conductors are also described as having a floating voltage if they are not connected electrically to another non floating conductor without such a connection voltages and current flows are induced by electromagnetic fields or charge accumulation within the conductor rather than being due to the usual external potential difference of a power source electrical equipment may be designed with a floating ground for one of several reasons one is safety for example a low voltage dc power supply such as a mobile phone charger is connected to the mains through a transformer of one type or another and there is no direct electrical connection between the current return path on the low voltage side and physical ground earth ensuring that there is no electrical connection between mains voltage and the low voltage plug makes it much easier to guarantee safety of the supply it also allows the charger to safely only connect to live and neutral which allows a two prong plug in countries where this is relevant indeed any home appliance with a two prong plug must have a floating ground another application is in electronic

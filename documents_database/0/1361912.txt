it is a basal form possibly related to kentisuchus according to several phylogenetic analyses that have been conducted in recent years and is the oldest known tomistomine to date fossils have been found from belgium and the united kingdom it had large supratemporal fenestrae in relation to its orbits similar to kentisuchus and thecachampsa dollosuchus was originally described on the basis of numerous mandibular fragments found from the early to middle eocene bracklesham beds in the united kingdom the material cannot be distinguished from other related longirostrine or long snouted crocodilians a nearly complete skeleton from belgium irscnb 482 described by swinton and referred to dollosuchus formed the basis of the new taxon dollosuchoides densmorei the skeleton itself is open to the public eye at the type species of dollosuchus is d dixoni many other species that once belonged to other genera have been proposed as members of the genus but little work has been published to support these claims charactosuchus kugleri another eocene crocodilian has been suggested to be synonymous with dollosuchus but this is no longer likely because c kugleri is now thought to be a member of the family crocodylidae and thus closer related to modern crocodiles

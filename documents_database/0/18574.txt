its numerical value is approximately it is not known whether is irrational let alone transcendental catalan s constant was named after eug ne charles catalan the similar but apparently more complicated series can be evaluated exactly and is equal to 32 some identities involving definite integrals include where the last three formulas are related to malmsten s integrals if is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind as a function of the elliptic modulus then with the gamma function the integral is a known special function called the inverse tangent integral and was extensively studied by srinivasa ramanujan appears in combinatorics as well as in values of the second polygamma function also called the trigamma function at fractional arguments simon plouffe gives an infinite collection of identities between the trigamma function and catalan s constant these are expressible as paths on a graph in low dimensional topology catalan s constant is a rational multiple of the volume of an ideal hyperbolic octahedron and therefore of the hyperbolic volume of the complement of the whitehead link it also appears in connection with the hyperbolic secant distribution catalan s constant occurs frequently in relation to the clausen function the inverse tangent

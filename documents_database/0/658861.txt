wigler and lucito currently run laboratories at cshl using roma to explore genomic copy number variation in cancer and other genetic diseases in this technique two genomes are compared for their differences in copy number on a microarray the roma technology emerged from a previous method called representational difference analysis rda roma in comparison to other comparative genomic hybridization cgh techniques has the advantage of reducing the complexity of a genome with a restriction enzyme which highly increases the efficiency of genomic fragment hybridization to a microarray in roma a genome is digested with a restriction enzyme ligated with adapters specific to the restriction fragment sticky ends and amplified by pcr after the pcr step representations of the entire genome restriction fragments are amplified to pronounce relative increases decreases or preserve equal copy number in the two genomes the representations of the two different genomes are labeled with different fluorophores and co hybridized to a microarray with probes specific to locations across the entire human genome after analysis of the roma microarray image is completed a copy number profile of the entire human genome is generated this allows researchers to detect with high accuracy amplifications amplicons and deletions that occur

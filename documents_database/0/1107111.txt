the systematic name of this enzyme class is s malate oxygen oxidoreductase other names in common use include fad dependent malate oxidase malic oxidase and malic dehydrogenase ii this enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism it employs one cofactor fad the enzyme is commonly localized on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane although another family member malate dehydrogenase 2 nad is found in the mitochondrial matrix malate oxidase belongs to the family of malate dehydrogenases ec 1 1 1 37 mdh that reversibly catalyze the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate by means of the reduction of a cofactor the most common isozymes of malate dehydrogenase use nad or nadp as a cofactor to accept electrons and protons however the main difference of malate oxidase is that it normally employs fad as redox partner as alternative contrary to pyridine based nad nadp fad comprises a quinone moiety which is reduced by the forward reaction fad is thereby converted to fadh in this case malate oxidase is qualified as malate dehydrogenase quinone in mutant strains of escherichia coli lacking the activity of nad dependent malate dehydrogenase malate oxidase is expressed it is suggested that products of malate dehydrogenase could be responsible for

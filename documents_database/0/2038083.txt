the ostrogradsky instability has been proposed as an explanation as to why no differential equations of higher order than two appear to describe physical phenomena the main points of the proof can be made clearer by considering a one dimensional system with a lagrangian formula 1 the euler lagrange equation is non degeneracy of formula 3 means that the canonical coordinates can be expressed in terms of the derivatives of formula 4 and vice versa thus formula 5 is a function of formula 6 if it was not the jacobian formula 7 would vanish which would mean that formula 3 is degenerate meaning that we can write formula 9 or inverting formula 10 since the evolution of formula 11 depends upon four initial parameters this means that there are four canonical coordinates we can write those as and by using the definition of the conjugate momentum due to non degeneracy we can write formula 16 as formula 17 note that only three arguments are needed since the lagrangian itself only has three free parameters by legendre transforming we find the hamiltonian to be we now notice that the hamiltonian is linear in formula 19 this is ostrogradsky s instability and

originally the apc superfamily consisted of subfamilies under the transporter classification number tc 2 a 3 this superfamily has since been expanded to include eighteen different families the most recent families added include the paap putative amino acid permease livcs branched chain amino acid cation symporter nramp natural resistance associated macrophage protein csta carbon starvation a protein kup k uptake permease bene benzoate h virginia symporter and ae anion exchanger bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis is used to continually expand currently existing families and superfamilies other constituents of the apc superfamily are the aaap family tc 2 a 18 the haaap family tc 2 a 42 and the lct family tc 2 a 43 some of these proteins exhibit 11 tmss eukaryotic members of this superfamily have been reviewed by wipf et al 2002 and fischer et al 1998 currently recognized families within the apc superfamily with tc numbers in blue include there are several apc proteins expressed in humans and they are slc proteins there are 11 slc families including apc proteins slc4 5 6 7 11 12 23 26 32 36 and 38 the atypical slc tmem104 is also clustered to the apc clan the topology of the well

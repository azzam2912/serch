it is an alternative to axiomatic set theory as a foundation for much but not all of mathematics a precursor to second order arithmetic that involves third order parameters was introduced by david hilbert and paul bernays in their book grundlagen der mathematik the standard axiomatization of second order arithmetic is denoted by z second order arithmetic includes but is significantly stronger than its first order counterpart peano arithmetic unlike peano arithmetic second order arithmetic allows quantification over sets of natural numbers as well as numbers themselves because real numbers can be represented as infinite sets of natural numbers in well known ways and because second order arithmetic allows quantification over such sets it is possible to formalize the real numbers in second order arithmetic for this reason second order arithmetic is sometimes called analysis sieg 2013 p 291 second order arithmetic can also be seen as a weak version of set theory in which every element is either a natural number or a set of natural numbers although it is much weaker than zermelo fraenkel set theory second order arithmetic can prove essentially all of the results of classical mathematics expressible in its language a subsystem of second order

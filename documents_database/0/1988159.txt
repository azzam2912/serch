the main concept behind the software is separation of domain and hpc knowledge and leaving each part to the respective experts while the gpi space as framework integrates both parts together gpi space is making use of gpi to solve big data problems more efficient than current solutions gpi space was first introduced in a domain specific version for geology under the name sdpa seismic development and programming architecture at seg 2010 in houston gpi space comes with several layers that make up the core of the parallel programming development software the runtime engine is responsible to distribute the available jobs across the available systems in a large scale hpc clusters these can be heterogeneous and consist of traditional compute nodes as well as nodes with accelerator cards such as gpus or intel s xeon phi besides the mere scheduling and distribution of jobs the runtime engine is also adding fault tolerance jobs are monitored after they have been assigned and reassigned to different resources in case the initially assigned hardware fails new hardware can be added dynamically the workflow engine translates instructions from an existing workflow in xml format with special gpi space tags into the runtime environments internal

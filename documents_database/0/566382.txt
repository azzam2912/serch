the compound is a derivative of aniline consisting of an amine bound to two phenyl groups the compound is a colorless solid but commercial samples are often yellow due to oxidized impurities diphenylamine dissolves well in many common organic solvents and is moderately soluble in water it is used mainly for its antioxidant properties diphenylamine is widely used as an industrial antioxidant dye mordant and reagent and is also employed in agriculture as a fungicide and antihelmintic diphenylamine is manufactured by the thermal deamination of aniline over oxide catalysts it is a weak base with a k of 10 with strong acids it forms salts for example treatment with sulfuric acid gives the bisulfate ch nh hso as a white or yellowish powder with m p 123 125 c diphenylamine undergoes various cyclisation reactions with sulfur it gives phenothiazine a precursor to pharmaceuticals with iodine it undergoes dehydrogenation to give carbazole with release of hydrogen iodide arylation with iodobenzene gives triphenylamine diphenylamine is used as a pre or postharvest scald inhibitor for apples applied as an indoor drench treatment its anti scald activity is the result of its antioxidant properties which protect the apple skin from the oxidation products of

initially intended for use by computer monitors and video cards the standard made its way into consumer televisions the parameters defined by standard include horizontal blanking and vertical blanking intervals horizontal frequency and vertical frequency collectively pixel clock rate or video signal bandwidth and horizontal vertical sync polarity the standard was adopted in 2002 and superseded the generalized timing formula cvt timings include the necessary pauses in picture data known as blanking intervals to allow crt displays to reposition their electron beam at the end of each horizontal scan line as well as the vertical repositioning necessary at the end of each frame cvt also specifies a mode cvt r which significantly reduces these blanking intervals to a period insufficient for crt displays to work correctly in the interests of saving video signal bandwidth when modern displays such as lcd monitors are being used since such displays typically do not require these pauses in the picture data in revision 1 2 released in 2013 a new reduced blanking timing version 2 mode was added which further reduces the horizontal blanking interval from 160 to 80 pixels increases pixel clock precision from 0 25 mhz to 0 001 mhz and adds

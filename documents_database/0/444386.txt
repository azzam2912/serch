there are two classes of radio halos mini halos and giant radio halos the linear size of giant radio halos is about 700kpc 1mpc whereas mini halos are typically less than 500kpc giant radio halos are more often observed in highly x ray luminous cluster samples than less luminous x ray clusters formula 1 in complete samples they have a very low surface brightness and do not have obvious galaxy counterparts in contrast to radio galaxies which have agn counterparts however their morphologies typically follow the distribution of gas in the intra cluster medium mini halos however while similar to giant halos are found at the center of cooling core clusters but around a radio galaxy the cause of radio haloes is still debated but they may be caused by reacceleration of mildly relativistic electrons during a merger event between galaxy clusters the generated turbulent motions of the intra cluster plasma drive magneto hydrodynamical waves which couples with mildly relativistic particles i e of energy on the level of 100 mev and accelerate them up to energy of 10 gev or more an alternative model suggests they are caused by secondary electrons generated by collisions between cosmic ray protons crp

it is a strong oxidizing agent for organic oxidation reactions such as in baeyer villiger oxidations of ketones it is the most reactive of the organic peroxy acids allowing it to successfully oxidise relatively unreactive alkenes to epoxides where other peroxy acids are ineffective it can also oxidise the chalcogens in some functional groups such as by transforming selenoethers to selones it is a potentially explosive material and is not commercially available but it can be quickly prepared as needed its use as a laboratory reagent was pioneered and developed by william d emmons at standard ambient temperature and pressure trifluoroperacetic acid is a colourless liquid with a boiling point of 162 c it is soluble in acetonitrile dichloromethane diethyl ether and sulfolane and readily reacts with water like all peroxy acids it is potentially explosive and requires careful handling it is not commercially available but can be made in the lab and stored for up to several weeks at 20 c some preparative methods result in mixtures containing residual hydrogen peroxide and trifluoroacetic acid and heating such a mixture is extremely hazardous the hydrogen peroxide can be decomposed using manganese dioxide for safety before heating trifluoroperacetic acid can be

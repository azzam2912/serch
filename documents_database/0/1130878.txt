the encoded protein is one of the cytochrome c oxidase cox complex iv assembly factors human cox is a multimeric protein complex that requires several assembly factors cytochrome c oxidase cox catalyzes the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen which helps to maintain the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is necessary for aerobic atp production the encoded protein is a metallochaperone that is involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii mutations in this gene are associated with fatal infantile encephalocardiomyopathy and myopia 6 the sco2 gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 22 at position 13 33 and it spans 2 871 base pairs the sco2 gene produces a 15 1 kda protein composed of 136 amino acids the protein contains an n terminal mitochondrial targeting presequence of 41 amino acids and shares identity with the yeast protein in regions between glycine 102 and glycine 242 in human sco2 sco2 is a subunit of the enzyme mammalian cytochrome c oxidase cox complex iv the sco2 gene encodes for a protein essential for the assembly and function of mammalian cytochrome c oxidase cox complex iv of the mitochondrial respiratory chain

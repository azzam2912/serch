however in casual usage the terms are often used interchangeably the term upper arm is redundant in anatomy but in informal usage is used to distinguish between the two terms in the human body the muscles of the upper limb can be classified by origin topography function or innervation while a grouping by innervation reveals embryological and phylogenetic origins the functional topographical classification below reflects the similarity in action between muscles with the exception of the shoulder girdle where muscles with similar action can vary considerably in their location and orientation the shoulder girdle or pectoral girdle composed of the clavicle and the scapula connects the upper limb to the axial skeleton through the sternoclavicular joint the only joint in the upper limb that directly articulates with the trunk a ball and socket joint supported by the subclavius muscle which acts as a dynamic ligament while this muscle prevents dislocation in the joint strong forces tend to break the clavicle instead the acromioclavicular joint the joint between the acromion process on the scapula and the clavicle is similarly strengthened by strong ligaments especially the coracoclavicular ligament which prevents excessive lateral and medial movements between them these two joints allow a

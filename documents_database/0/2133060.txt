in the quantum mechanics the domain space of the wave functions formula 5 is the classical configuration space formula 2 in classical field theory the configuration space of the field is an infinite dimensional space the single point denoted formula 7 in this space is represented by the set of functions formula 8 where formula 9 and formula 10 represents an index set in quantum field theory it is expected that the hilbert space is also the formula 11 space on the configuration space of the field which is infinite dimensional with respect to some borel measure naturally defined however it is often hard to define a concrete borel measure on the classical configuration space since the integral theory on infinite dimensional space is involved thus the intuitive expectation should be modified and the concept of quantum configuration space should be introduced as a suitable enlargement of the classical configuration space so that an infinite dimensional measure often a cylindrical measure can be well defined on it in quantum field theory the quantum configuration space the domain of the wave functions formula 12 is larger than the classical configuration space while in the classical theory we can restrict ourselves to

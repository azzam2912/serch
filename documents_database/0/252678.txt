exerts chaotropic activity this has an effect on the stability of the native state of other molecules in the solution mainly macromolecules proteins nucleic acids by weakening the hydrophobic effect for example a chaotropic agent reduces the amount of order in the structure of a protein formed by water molecules both in the bulk and the hydration shells around hydrophobic amino acids and may cause its denaturation conversely an antichaotropic agent kosmotropic is a molecule in an aqueous solution that will increase the hydrophobic effects within the solution antichaotropic salts like ammonium sulphate can be used to precipitate substances from the impure mixture this is used in protein purification processes to remove undesired proteins from solution a chaotropic agent is a substance which disrupts the structure of and denatures macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids e g dna and rna chaotropic solutes increase the entropy of the system by interfering with intermolecular interactions mediated by non covalent forces such as hydrogen bonds van der waals forces and hydrophobic effects macromolecular structure and function is dependent on the net effect of these forces see protein folding therefore it follows that an increase in chaotropic solutes in a biological system will

kinetic inductance is observed in high carrier mobility conductors e g superconductors and at very high frequencies a change in electromotive force emf will be opposed by the inertia of the charge carriers since like all objects with mass they prefer to be traveling at constant velocity and therefore it takes a finite time to accelerate the particle this is similar to how a change in emf is opposed by the finite rate of change of magnetic flux in an inductor the resulting phase lag in voltage is identical for both energy storage mechanisms making them indistinguishable in a normal circuit kinetic inductance formula 1 arises naturally in the drude model of electrical conduction considering not only the dc conductivity but also the finite relaxation time collision time formula 2 of the mobile charge carriers when it is not tiny compared to the wave period 1 f this model defines a complex conductance at radian frequency 2 f given by formula 3 the imaginary part represents the kinetic inductance the drude complex conductivity can be expanded into its real and imaginary components formula 4 where formula 5 is the mass of the charge carrier i e the effective electron mass

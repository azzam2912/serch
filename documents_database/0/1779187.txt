analogue sites are used in the frame of space exploration to either study geological or biological processes observed on other planets or to prepare astronauts for surface extra vehicular activity analogue sites are places on earth with assumed past or present geological environmental or biological conditions of a celestial body analogue site studies are necessary because they help to understand geological processes on earth which can be extrapolated to other solar system bodies in order to interpret and validate the data received from orbiters or planetary rovers analogue sites are also important for optimizing scientific and technological needs and exploration strategies in robotic or manned missions to the moon or mars the definition of space analogues is therefore rather vast reaching from places on earth that exhibit geologic or atmospheric characteristics which are close to those observed on other celestial bodies to sites that are used for space mission simulations to test sampling or drilling equipment space suits or the performance of astronauts in reduced gravity some sites are therefore suited to test instruments for exobiological research or to train sampling procedures for field explorations other sites offer an extreme environment that can be used by astronauts to prepare for

hybrid rice therefore has two genetically different parents as with other types of hybrids hybrid rice typically displays heterosis or hybrid vigor such that when it is grown under the same conditions as comparable high yielding inbred rice varieties it can produce up to 30 more rice high yield crops like hybrid rice are one of the most important tools for combating world food crises the first hybrid rice varieties were released in china in crop breeding although the use of heterosis in first generation seeds or f1 is well known its application in rice was limited because of the self pollination character of that crop in 1974 chinese scientists successfully transferred the male sterility gene from wild rice to create the cytoplasmic genetic male sterile cms line and hybrid combination the first generation of hybrid rice varieties were three line hybrids and produced yields that were about 15 to 20 percent greater than those of improved or high yielding varieties of the same growth duration chinese scientist yuan longping the father of hybrid rice is the most famous researchers on hybrid rice in the 1960s he made his seminal discovery of the genetic basis of heterosis in rice this

they are also used in furniture medical and aerospace applications much larger gas springs are found in machines that are used in industrial manufacturing the press tooling industry where the forces they are required to exert often range from 2500n to 400 000n forty tonnes gas springs are manufactured in many varieties including if the internal plunger has a diaphragm which extends to the side of the gas tube it will cease to move once an applied force is constant and will support a weight like a normal spring if a fine hole exists in the plunger however it is termed a slow dampened spring and can be used on heavy doors and windows a gas spring designed for fast operation is termed a quick gas spring and is used in the manufacture of air guns and recoil buffers reducing the gas volume and hence increasing its internal pressure by means of a movable end stop or allowing one tube to slide over another can allow the characteristics of a gas spring to be adjusted during operation the rod may be hollow by use of clever seals or may consist of multiple small diameter rods a small amount of oil

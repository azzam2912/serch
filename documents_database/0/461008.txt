dynkin systems are sometimes referred to as systems dynkin himself used this term or d system these set families have applications in measure theory and probability a major application of systems is the theorem see below let be a nonempty set and let formula 2 be a collection of subsets of i e formula 2 is a subset of the power set of then formula 2 is a dynkin system if equivalently formula 2 is a dynkin system if the second definition is generally preferred as it usually is easier to check an important fact is that a dynkin system which is also a system i e closed under finite intersections is a algebra this can be verified by noting that conditions 2 and 3 together with closure under finite intersections imply closure under countable unions given any collection formula 16 of subsets of formula 1 there exists a unique dynkin system denoted formula 18 which is minimal with respect to containing formula 19 that is if formula 20 is any dynkin system containing formula 19 then formula 22 formula 18 is called the dynkin system generated by formula 16 note formula 25 for another example let formula 26 and

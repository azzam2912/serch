the algorithms are typically modeled after the immune system s characteristics of learning and memory for use in problem solving the field of artificial immune systems ais is concerned with abstracting the structure and function of the immune system to computational systems and investigating the application of these systems towards solving computational problems from mathematics engineering and information technology ais is a sub field of biologically inspired computing and natural computation with interests in machine learning and belonging to the broader field of artificial intelligence artificial immune systems ais are adaptive systems inspired by theoretical immunology and observed immune functions principles and models which are applied to problem solving ais is distinct from computational immunology and theoretical biology that are concerned with simulating immunology using computational and mathematical models towards better understanding the immune system although such models initiated the field of ais and continue to provide a fertile ground for inspiration finally the field of ais is not concerned with the investigation of the immune system as a substrate for computation unlike other fields such as dna computing ais emerged in the mid 1980s with articles authored by farmer packard and perelson 1986 and bersini and varela 1990 on

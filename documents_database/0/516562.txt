these observed spectral lines are due to the electron making transitions between two energy levels in an atom the classification of the series by the rydberg formula was important in the development of quantum mechanics the spectral series are important in astronomical spectroscopy for detecting the presence of hydrogen and calculating red shifts a hydrogen atom consists of an electron orbiting its nucleus the electromagnetic force between the electron and the nuclear proton leads to a set of quantum states for the electron each with its own energy these states were visualized by the bohr model of the hydrogen atom as being distinct orbits around the nucleus each energy state or orbit is designated by an integer as shown in the figure the bohr model was later replaced by quantum mechanics in which the electron occupies an atomic orbital rather than an orbit but the allowed energy levels of the hydrogen atom remained the same as in the earlier theory spectral emission occurs when an electron transitions or jumps from a higher energy state to a lower energy state to distinguish the two states the lower energy state is commonly designated as and the higher energy state is designated as

usually the bit stream contains data bits defining the identification code and a number of bits to ensure correct reception of the data bits iso 11784 specifies the structure of the identification code iso 11785 specifies how a transponder is activated and how the stored information is transferred to a transceiver the characteristics of the transmission protocols between transponder and transceiver these standards are updated and expanded in iso 14223 which regulates advanced transponders for animals and iso 24631 which regulates testing procedures for conformance with iso 11784 11785 as well as performance the technical concept of animal identification described is based on the principle of radio frequency identification rfid iso 11785 is applicable in connection with iso 11784 which describes the structure and the information content of the codes stored in the transponder the international organization for standardization iso draws attention to the fact that compliance with clause 6 and annex a of this international standard may involve the use of patents concerning methods of transmission the carrier frequency for animal identification is 134 2 khz there are two iso approved protocols in use to communicate between tag and reader in dbp a 1 is encoded as 00 or

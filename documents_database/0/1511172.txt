in many circumstances if a potential is not h stable it is not possible to define a grand canonical partition function in finite volume because of catastrophic configurations with infinite particles located in a finite space consider a system of particles in positions formula 1 the interaction or potential between a particle in position formula 2 and a particle in position formula 3 is where formula 5 is a real even possibly unbounded function then formula 5 is h stable if there exists formula 7 such that for any formula 8 and any formula 9 the notion of h stability in quantum mechanics is more subtle while in the classical case the kinetic part of the hamiltonian is not important as it can be zero independently of the position of the particles in the quantum case the kinetic term plays an important role in the lower bound for the total energy because of the uncertainty principle in fact stability of matter was the historical reason for introducing such a principle in mechanics the definition of stability is where e is the ground state energy classical h stability implies quantum h stability but the converse is false the criterion is especially

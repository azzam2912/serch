the first was issued in 1647 and the second in 1679 the two collections were important in preserving many works of english renaissance drama the 1647 folio was published by the booksellers humphrey moseley and humphrey robinson it was modelled on the precedents of the first two folio collections of shakespeare s plays published in 1623 and 1632 and the first two folios of the works of ben jonson of 1616 and 1640 1 the title of the book was given as comedies and tragedies written by francis beaumont and john fletcher gentlemen though the prefatory matter in the folio recognised that philip massinger rather than francis beaumont collaborated with fletcher on some of the plays included in the volume in fact the 1647 volume contained almost nothing of beaumont s work seventeen works in fletcher s canon that had already been published prior to 1647 and the rights to these plays belonged to the stationers who had issued those volumes robinson and moseley therefore concentrated on the previously unpublished plays in the fletcher canon most of these plays had been acted onstage by the king s men the troupe of actors for whom fletcher had functioned as house dramatist

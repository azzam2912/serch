it holds up to 400 million bytes of data with an access time of 95 milliseconds to 600 milliseconds depending on the addressed strip position and data arrangement in each data cell the 2321 houses up to ten removable and interchangeable data cells each data cell contains 200 strips of magnetic tape which are the basic recording media strips are wide and long the total storage capacity is 400 million bytes or 800 million decimal digits up to eight 2321s can be attached to the ibm 2841 control unit allowing an overall capacity of over three gb in comparison to the contemporary ibm 2311 disk device the ibm 2321 data cell device holds 55 times more data while being only seven times slower 85ms and 600ms access times respectively one fully loaded ibm 2841 control unit connected with eight ibm 2321 data cell devices has the capacity of 441 ibm 2311 disk devices which would need to be connected to 56 ibm 2841 control units which would require seven data channels the data cell makes use of three concurrently operating separate seeking systems a servo hydraulic one to rotate the bins to select the proper subcell and two solenoid driven

consequently the visual fields of the two eyes appear tilted relative to each other the corresponding latent condition a condition in which torsion occurs only in the absence of appropriate visual stimuli is called cyclophoria cyclotropia is often associated with other disorders of strabism can result in double vision and can cause other symptoms in particular head tilt in some cases subjective and objective cyclodeviation may result from surgery for oblique muscle disorders if the visual system cannot compensate for it cyclotropia and rotational double vision cyclodiplopia may result the role of cyclotropia in vision disorders is not always correctly identified in several cases of double vision once the underlying cyclotropia was identified the condition was solved by surgical cyclotropia correction conversely artificially causing cyclotropia in cats leads to reduced vision acuity resulting in a defect similar to strabismic amblyopia cyclotropia can be detected using subjective tests such as the maddox rod test the bagolini striated lens test the phase difference haploscope of aulhorn or the lancaster red green test lrgt among these the lrgt is the most complete cyclotropia can also be diagnosed using a combination of subjective and objective tests before surgery both subjective and objective torsion should

in other words a subgroup of the group is normal in if and only if for all and the usual notation for this relation is formula 1 normal subgroups are important because they and only they can be used to construct quotient groups of the given group furthermore the normal subgroups of are precisely the kernels of group homomorphisms with domain which means that they can be used to internally classify those homomorphisms variste galois was the first to realize the importance of the existence of normal subgroups a subgroup of a group is called a normal subgroup of if it is invariant under conjugation that is the conjugation of an element of by an element of is always in the usual notation for this relation is formula 1 and the definition may be written in symbols as formula 3 for any subgroup of the following conditions are equivalent to being a normal subgroup of therefore any one of them may be taken as the definition given two normal subgroups and of their intersection formula 11and their product formula 12 are also normal subgroups of the normal subgroups of form a lattice under subset inclusion with least element and greatest

examples of toxic agents are an immune cell or some types of venom e g from the puff adder bitis arietans or brown recluse spider loxosceles reclusa treating cells with the cytotoxic compound can result in a variety of cell fates the cells may undergo necrosis in which they lose membrane integrity and die rapidly as a result of cell lysis the cells can stop actively growing and dividing a decrease in cell viability or the cells can activate a genetic program of controlled cell death apoptosis cells undergoing necrosis typically exhibit rapid swelling lose membrane integrity shut down metabolism and release their contents into the environment cells that undergo rapid necrosis in vitro do not have sufficient time or energy to activate apoptotic machinery and will not express apoptotic markers apoptosis is characterized by well defined cytological and molecular events including a change in the refractive index of the cell cytoplasmic shrinkage nuclear condensation and cleavage of dna into regularly sized fragments cells in culture that are undergoing apoptosis eventually undergo secondary necrosis they will shut down metabolism lose membrane integrity and lyse cytotoxicity assays are widely used by the pharmaceutical industry to screen for cytotoxicity in compound libraries

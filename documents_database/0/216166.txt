dis double genos race is a class of trematodes in the platyhelminthes phylum consisting of parasitic flatworms known as flukes with a syncytial tegument and usually two suckers one ventral and one oral adults are particularly common in the digestive tract but occur throughout the organ systems of all classes of vertebrates once thought to be related to the monogenea it is now recognised that they are closest to the aspidogastrea and that the monogenea are more closely allied with the cestoda around 6 000 species have been described to date characteristic features of the digenea include a syncytial tegument that is a tegument where the junctions between cells are broken down and a single continuous cytoplasm surrounds the entire animal a similar tegument is found in other members of the neodermata a group of platyhelminths comprising the digenea aspidogastrea monogenea and cestoda digeneans possess a vermiform unsegmented body plan and have a solid parenchyma with no body cavity coelom as in all platyhelminths there are typically two suckers an anterior sucker surrounding the mouth and a ventral sucker sometimes termed the acetabulum on the ventral surface the oral sucker surrounds the mouth while the ventral sucker is a blind

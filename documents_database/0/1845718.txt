the muscles that control vertebrate locomotion are affiliated with tissues that are springy such as tendons which lie within the muscles and connective tissue a spring can be a mechanism for different actions involved in hopping running walking and serve in other diverse functions such as metabolic energy conservation attenuation of muscle power production and amplification of muscle power production when a body is running walking or hopping it uses springs as a way to store energy which indicates that elastic mechanisms have a great influence on its dynamics when a force is applied to a spring it bends and stores energy in the form of elastic strain energy and when it recoils after the force has been released this energy is released as well elastic proteins provide the property of elasticity which gives the spring the ability to bend reversibly without the loss of energy and the ability to bend to large strains with small force elastic proteins also contain high resilience and low stiffness which helps with the function of elastic strain energy while running tendons are able to reduce the metabolic rate of muscle activity by reducing the volume of the muscle that is active to produce

a commonly used decomposition in the control field is to decompose a system into two or more lower order subsystems called lower order subsystem decomposition here in contrast additive state decomposition is to decompose a system into two or more subsystems with the same dimension as that of the original system taking a system for example it is decomposed into two subsystems and where and respectively the lower order subsystem decomposition satisfies by contrast the additive state decomposition satisfies consider an original system as follows where formula 3 first a primary system is brought in having the same dimension as the original system where formula 4 from the original system and the primary system the following secondary system is derived new variables formula 6 are defined as follows then the secondary system can be further written as follows from the definition it follows the process is shown in this picture in fact the idea of the additive state decomposition has been implicitly mentioned in existing literature an existing example is the tracking controller design which often requires a reference system to derive error dynamics the reference system primary system is assumed to be given as follows based on the reference

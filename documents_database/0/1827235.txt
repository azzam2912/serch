it is an experimental science that seeks to explain how nurture shapes nature where nature refers to biological heredity and nurture refers to virtually everything that occurs during the life span e g social experience diet and nutrition and exposure to toxins behavioral epigenetics attempts to provide a framework for understanding how the expression of genes is influenced by experiences and the environment to produce individual differences in behaviour cognition personality and mental health epigenetic gene regulation involves changes other than to the sequence of dna and includes changes to histones proteins around which dna is wrapped and dna methylation these epigenetic changes can influence the growth of neurons in the developing brain as well as modify activity of the neurons in the adult brain together these epigenetic changes on neuron structure and function can have a marked influence on an organism s behavior in biology and specifically genetics epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene activity which are not caused by changes in the dna sequence the term can also be used to describe the study of stable long term alterations in the transcriptional potential of a cell that are not necessarily heritable examples of mechanisms that

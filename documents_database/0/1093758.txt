the most commonly used compounds for contrast enhancement are gadolinium based such mri contrast agents shorten the relaxation times of nuclei within body tissues following oral or intravenous administration in mri scanners sections of the body are exposed to a very strong magnetic field causing primarily the hydrogen nuclei spins of water in tissues to be polarized in the direction of the magnetic field an intense radiofrequency pulse is applied that tips the magnetization generated by the hydrogen nuclei in the direction of the receiver coil where the spin polarization can be detected random molecular rotational oscillations matching the resonance frequency of the nuclear spins provide the relaxation mechanisms that bring the net magnetization back to its equilibrium position in alignment with the applied magnetic field the magnitude of the spin polarization detected by the receiver is used to form the mr image but decays with a characteristic time constant known as the t1 relaxation time water protons in different tissues have different t1 values which is one of the main sources of contrast in mr images a contrast agent usually shortens but in some instances increases the value of t1 of nearby water protons thereby altering the contrast in

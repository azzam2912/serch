the technique was first introduced to resolve interactions in electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra it is currently practiced in a variety of modalities mainly in the areas of biophysics and heterogeneous catalysis in the standard continuous wave cwendor experiment a sample is placed in a magnetic field and irradiated sequentially with a microwave followed by radio frequency the changes are then detected by monitoring variations in the polarization of the saturated electron paramagnetic resonance epr transition endor is illustrated by a two spin system involving one electron s 1 2 and one proton i 1 2 interacting with an applied magnetic field the hamiltonian for the two spin system mentioned above can be described as the four terms in this equation describe the electron zeeman interaction ez the nuclear zeeman interaction nz the hyperfine interaction hfs and the nuclear quadrupole interaction q respectively the electron zeeman interaction describes the interaction between an electron spin and the applied magnetic field the nuclear zeeman interaction is the interaction of the magnetic moment of the proton with an applied magnetic field the hyperfine interaction is the coupling between the electron spin and the proton s nuclear spin the nuclear quadrupole interaction is present

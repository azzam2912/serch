to a given task cost of application of i t on the technical side in the development of computer hardware software and systems data efficiency can refer to many things such as packing bits on a physical medium or chip area usage on a silicon wafer or the use of data in programming so as to require less time and computation resources examples of these two categories of use for data efficiency managerial and technical can be found in process industries and computer chip research and development 1 traditional water wastewater management procedures include travel to pump stations reading and hand recording of meter numbers transposition of log sheets and other manual operations this whole process can be said to have low data efficiency 2 in the design of today s dynamic random access memory dram computer chips r d optimizes parameters such as row and column access times chip area usage burst length and row granularity input output times are measured in very small fractions of a second the latest versions of these chips are said to have high data efficiency both these examples above show the application of different information technologies that process data to reach a defined

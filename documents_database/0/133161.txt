it may be located at the surface of the cell or in vesicles based on their structural and functional characteristics the neurotransmitter receptor can be classified into two broad categories metabotropic and ionotropic receptors ionotropic receptors form an ion channel pore in contrast metabotropic receptors are indirectly linked with ion channels on the plasma membrane of the cell through signal transduction mechanisms often g proteins hence g protein coupled receptors are inherently metabotropic other examples of metabotropic receptors include tyrosine kinases and guanylyl cyclase receptors both receptor types are activated by specific neurotransmitters when an ionotropic receptor is activated it opens a channel that allows ions such as na k or cl to flow in contrast when a metabotropic receptor is activated a series of intracellular events are triggered that can also result in ion channels opening or other intracellular events but involve a range of second messenger chemicals this class of receptors includes the metabotropic glutamate receptors muscarinic acetylcholine receptors gaba receptors and most serotonin receptors as well as receptors for norepinephrine epinephrine histamine dopamine neuropeptides and endocannabinoids the g protein coupled receptors have seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains most of them are monomeric proteins although gaba receptors require heterodimerization

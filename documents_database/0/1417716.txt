according to domenico bertoloni meli christiaan huygens coined the term centrifugal force in his 1659 de vi centrifuga and wrote of it in his 1673 horologium oscillatorium on pendulums isaac newton coined the term centripetal force vis centripita in his discussions of gravity in his 1684 de motu corporum gottfried leibniz as part of his solar vortex theory conceived of centrifugal force as a real outward force which is induced by the circulation of the body upon which the force acts an inverse cube law centrifugal force appears in an equation representing planetary orbits including non circular ones as leibniz described in his 1689 tentamen de motuum coelestium causis leibniz s equation is still used today to solve planetary orbital problems although his solar vortex theory is no longer used as its basis leibniz produced an equation for planetary orbits in which the centrifugal force appeared as an outward inverse cube law force in the radial direction newton himself appears to have previously supported an approach similar to that of leibniz later newton in his principia crucially limited the description of the dynamics of planetary motion to a frame of reference in which the point of attraction is fixed in

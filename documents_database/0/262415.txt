it adds support for stereo signals and higher sampling rates another main improvement is the use of transform coding transform coded excitation tcx additionally to acelp this greatly improves the generic audio coding automatic switching between transform coding and acelp provides both good speech and audio quality with moderate bit rates as amr wb operates at internal sampling rate 12 8 khz amr wb also supports various internal sampling frequencies ranges from 12 8 khz to 38 4 khz amr wb uses 16 khz sampling frequency with a resolution of 14 bits left justified in a 16 bit word amr wb uses 16 24 32 48 khz sampling frequencies with a resolution of 16 bits in a 16 bit word 3gpp originally developed the amr wb audio codec for streaming and messaging services in global system for mobile communications gsm and third generation 3g cellular systems its primary target applications are packet switched streaming service pss multimedia messaging service mms and multimedia broadcast and multicast service mbms file storage of amr wb encoded audio is specified within the 3gp container format 3gpp defined iso based multimedia file format defined in 3gpp ts 26 244 the amr wb codec has a

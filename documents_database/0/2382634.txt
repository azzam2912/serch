the aim of phewas studies or phewass is to examine many different phenotypes to see which if any are associated with a given genetic variant it is a complementary approach to the genome wide association study or gwas methodology a fundamental difference between the gwas and phewas designs is in the direction of inference in phewass it is from exposure to outcome the reverse of that used in gwass the approach has proven useful in rediscovering previously reported genotype phenotype associations as well as in identifying new ones the phewas approach was originally developed partly due to the widespread availability of anonymized electronic health record ehr data however phewass have also been conducted using data from existing epidemiological studies in 2010 a proof of concept phewas study was published based on ehr billing codes from a single study site though this study was generally underpowered its results suggested the potential existence of new associations between multiple phenotypes possibly due to a common underlying cause as of 2016 this study is the oldest phewas in the ehr linked emerge database this paper also coined the abbreviation phewas

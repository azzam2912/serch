due to tissues esterases enzymes gplc should act as a prodrug and lead to glycine carnitine and propionic acid in the body gplc has been shown in two studies to result in an increase in blood levels of nitrate nitrite a surrogate marker of nitric oxide not a direct measure of nitric oxide when used at a daily dose of 4 5 grams in one study gplc was provided to previously sedentary men and women who were also assigned to supervised aerobic exercise for eight weeks a significant increase in resting levels of blood nitrate nitrite was noted for subjects receiving gplc compared to placebo in a double blind design subjects who received gplc were also noted as having lower levels of malondialdehyde a lipid peroxidation biomarker indicating free radical mediated oxidation of lipids increased free radical production may be associated with impaired nitric oxide bioavailability in another study gplc or a placebo was provided to resistance trained men for four weeks each with a two week washout period between each four week period using a double blind design at the end of each four week period resting blood samples were obtained in addition to blood samples following isometric exercise

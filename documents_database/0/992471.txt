one example of a system which satisfies the perfect forward secrecy property is one in which a compromise of one key by an attacker and consequent decryption of messages encrypted with that key does not undermine the security of previously used keys forward secrecy does not refer to protecting the content of the message but rather to the protection of keys used to decrypt messages one example of a system which uses forward anonymity is a public key cryptography system where the public key is well known and used to encrypt a message and an unknown private key is used to decrypt it in this system one of the keys is always said to be compromised but messages and their participants are still unknown by anyone without the corresponding private key originally introduced by whitfield diffie paul van oorschot and michael james wiener to describe a property of sts station to station protocol involving a long term secret either a private key or a shared password public key cryptography is a common form of a forward anonymous system it is used to pass encrypted messages preventing any information about the message from being discovered if the message is intercepted by

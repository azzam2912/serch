usually glycerol 3 phosphate is generated from glucose by glycolysis but when glucose concentration drops in the cytosol it is generated by another pathway called glyceroneogenesis glyceroneogenesis uses pyruvate alanine glutamine or any substances from the tca cycle as precursors for glycerol 3 phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pepc k which is an enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate is the main regulator for this pathway glyceroneogenesis can be observed in adipose tissue and also liver it is a significant biochemical pathway which regulates cytosolic lipid levels intense suppression of glyceroneogenesis may lead to metabolic disorder such as type 2 diabetes in mammals triglycerol or its backbone glycerol 3 phosphate is usually synthesized from glucose through glycolysis glucose will be degraded though glycolysis until fructose 1 6 bisphosphate is broken down to glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate dihydroxyacetone phosphate is significant in synthesizing triglycerides because it can be used to generate glycerol 3 phosphate however glycerol 3 phosphate is generated through a different pathway when an organism is deficient of carbohydrates such as glucose during fasting or low carbohydrate diet glycerol 3 phosphate is generated by another metabolic pathway called glyceroneogenesis which uses precursors other than glucose glyceroneogenesis

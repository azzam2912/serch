in various hematopoietic cells lyn has emerged as a key enzyme involved in the regulation of cell activation in these cells a small amount of lyn is associated with cell surface receptor proteins including the b cell antigen receptor bcr cd40 or cd19 the abbreviation lyn is derived from lck yes novel tyrosine kinase lck and yes also being members of the src kinase family lyn has been described to have an inhibitory role in myeloid lineage proliferation following engagement of the b cell receptors lyn undergoes rapid phosphorylation and activation lyn activation triggers a cascade of signaling events mediated by lyn phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs itam of the receptor proteins and subsequent recruitment and activation of other kinases including syk phosholipase c 2 plc 2 and phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase these kinases provide activation signals which play critical roles in proliferation ca mobilization and cell differentiation lyn plays an essential role in the transmission of inhibitory signals through phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs itim in regulatory proteins such as cd22 pir b and fc riib1 their itim phosphorylation subsequently leads to recruitment and activation of phosphatases

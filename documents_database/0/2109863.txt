members of the family are known as polykrikoids the family contains two genera polykrikos and pheopolykrikos the most distinctive feature of polykrikoids is their formation of multinucleate pseudocolonies consisting of an even number of subunit zooids the two genera differ in number of nuclei possessing two nuclei regardless of the number of zooids is a synapomorphy for polykrikos whereas pheopolykrikos possess equal numbers of nuclei and zooids along with the warnowiaceae warnowiids polykrikoids are known for possessing unusually complex subcellular structures in particular an extrusome complex of two organelles called the nematocyst and taeniocyst is considered a synapomorphy for polykrikos molecular phylogenetics studies suggest some inconsistency in the taxonomy of this group particularly in the assignment of species to one of the two genera most polykrikoids are planktonic although one species p lebourae is benthic the family includes photosynthetic heterotrophic and mixotrophic species some species such as p kofoidii are of scientific interest due to their status as predators of other dinoflagellates a behavior that is significant in the regulation of algal blooms others such as ph hartmanii which has been reclassified p hartmanii are themselves causes of ichthyotoxic algal blooms the reproductive behaviors of polykrikoids are mostly not well

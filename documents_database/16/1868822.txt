the evolution of the queue can be described by the lindley equation the system is described in kendall s notation where the g denotes a general distribution for both interarrival times and service times and the 1 that the model has a single server different interarrival and service times are considered to be independent and sometimes the model is denoted gi gi 1 to emphasise this kingman s formula gives an approximation for the mean waiting time in a g g 1 queue lindley s integral equation is a relationship satisfied by the stationary waiting time distribution which can be solved using the wiener hopf method few results are known for the general g g k model as it generalises the m g k queue for which few metrics are known bounds can be computed using mean value analysis techniques adapting results from the m m c queue model using heavy traffic approximations empirical results or approximating distributions by phase type distributions and then using matrix analytic methods to solve the approximate systems in a g g 2 queue with heavy tailed job sizes the tail of the delay time distribution is known to behave like the tail of an

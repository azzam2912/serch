because single molecules constitute the smallest stable structures imaginable this miniaturization is the ultimate goal for shrinking electrical circuits the field is often termed simply as molecular electronics but this term is also used to refer to the distantly related field of conductive polymers and organic electronics which uses the properties of molecules to affect the bulk properties of a material a nomenclature distinction has been suggested so that molecular materials for electronics refers to this latter field of bulk applications while molecular scale electronics refers to the nanoscale single molecule applications treated here conventional electronics have traditionally been made from bulk materials ever since their invention in 1958 the performance and complexity of integrated circuits has undergone exponential growth a trend named moore s law as feature sizes of the embedded components have shrunk accordingly as the structures shrink the sensitivity to deviations increases in a few technology generations when the minimum feature sizes reaches 13 nm the composition of the devices must be controlled to a precision of a few atoms for the devices to work with bulk methods growing increasingly demanding and costly as they near inherent limits the idea was born that the components could instead

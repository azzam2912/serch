this technique enables bidirectional communications over one strand of fiber as well as multiplication of capacity the term wdm is commonly applied to an optical carrier which is typically described by its wavelength whereas frequency division multiplexing typically applies to a radio carrier which is more often described by frequency this is purely conventional because wavelength and frequency communicate the same information specifically frequency in hertz which is cycles per second multiplied by wavelength the physical length of one cycle equals the velocity of the carrier wave in vacuum this is the velocity of light usually denoted by the lower case letter c in glass fiber it is substantially slower usually about 0 7 times c the data rate which ideally might be at the carrier frequency in practical systems is always a fraction of the carrier frequency a wdm system uses a multiplexer at the transmitter to join the several signals together and a demultiplexer at the receiver to split them apart with the right type of fiber it is possible to have a device that does both simultaneously and can function as an optical add drop multiplexer the optical filtering devices used have conventionally been etalons stable solid

they are deep in the sense that the energy required to remove an electron or hole from the trap to the valence or conduction band is much larger than the characteristic thermal energy kt where k is the boltzmann constant and t is temperature deep traps interfere with more useful types of doping by compensating the dominant charge carrier type annihilating either free electrons or electron holes depending on which is more prevalent they also directly interfere with the operation of transistors light emitting diodes and other electronic and opto electronic devices by offering an intermediate state inside the band gap deep level traps shorten the non radiative life time of charge carriers and through the shockley read hall srh process facilitate recombination of minority carriers having adverse effects on the semiconductor device performance common chemical elements that produce deep level defects in silicon include iron nickel copper gold and silver in general transition metals produce this effect while light metals such as aluminium do not surface states and crystallographic defects in the crystal lattice can also play role of deep level traps

the phases are edit time compile time link time distribution time installation time load time and run time lifecycle phases do not necessarily happen in a linear order and they can be intertwined in various ways for example when modifying a program a software developer may need to repeatedly edit compile install and execute it on his own computer to ensure sufficient quality before it can be distributed to users copies of the modified program are then downloaded installed and executed by users on their computers edit time is when the source code of the program is being edited this spans initial creation to any bug fix refactoring or addition of new features editing is typically performed by a person but automated design tools and metaprogramming systems may also be used compile time is when source code is translated into machine code by a compiler part of this involves language checking such as ensuring proper use of the type system the result of successful compilation is an executable link time connects all of the necessary machine code components of a program including externals it is very common for programs to use functions implemented by external libraries all of which must

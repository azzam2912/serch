in a very loose sense it is a set whose elements are not tightly clustered as defined by the topology on the space anywhere the order of operations is important for example the set of rational numbers as a subset of real numbers r has the property that its interior has an empty closure but it is not nowhere dense in fact it is dense in r equivalently a nowhere dense set is a set that is not dense in any nonempty open set the surrounding space matters a set a may be nowhere dense when considered as a subset of a topological space x but not when considered as a subset of another topological space y notably a set is always dense in its own subspace topology every subset of a nowhere dense set is nowhere dense and the union of finitely many nowhere dense sets is nowhere dense that is the nowhere dense sets form an ideal of sets a suitable notion of negligible set the union of countably many nowhere dense sets however need not be nowhere dense thus the nowhere dense sets need not form a sigma ideal instead such a union is called a meagre

it may be written as where y is a matrix with series of multivariate measurements each column being a set of measurements on one of the dependent variables x is a matrix of observations on independent variables that might be a design matrix each column being a set of observations on one of the independent variables b is a matrix containing parameters that are usually to be estimated and u is a matrix containing errors noise the errors are usually assumed to be uncorrelated across measurements and follow a multivariate normal distribution if the errors do not follow a multivariate normal distribution generalized linear models may be used to relax assumptions about y and u the general linear model incorporates a number of different statistical models anova ancova manova mancova ordinary linear regression t test and f test the general linear model is a generalization of multiple linear regression to the case of more than one dependent variable if y b and u were column vectors the matrix equation above would represent multiple linear regression hypothesis tests with the general linear model can be made in two ways multivariate or as several independent univariate tests in multivariate tests the columns

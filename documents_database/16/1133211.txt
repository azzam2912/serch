it belongs to the transforming growth factor beta tgf superfamily like many other members of this superfamily it is involved in cell differentiation in early embryogenesis playing a key role in signal transfer from the node in the anterior primitive streak to lateral plate mesoderm lpm nodal signaling is important very early in development for mesoderm and endoderm formation and subsequent organization of left right axial structures in addition nodal seems to have important functions in neural patterning stem cell maintenance and many other developmental processes including left right handedness nodal can bind type i and type ii serine threonine kinase receptors with cripto 1 acting as its co receptor signaling through smad 2 3 and subsequent translocation of smad 4 to the nucleus promotes the expression of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation nodal also further activates its own expression via a positive feedback loop it is tightly regulated by inhibitors lefty a lefty b cerberus and tomoregulin 1 which can interfere with nodal receptor binding nodal is a widely distributed cytokine the presence of nodal is not limited to vertebrates it is also known to be conserved in other deuterostomes cephalochordates tunicates and echinoderms and protostomes such as

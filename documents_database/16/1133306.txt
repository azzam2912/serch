chloride conductance of these channels can be modulated by agents such as benzodiazepines that bind to the gaba receptor at least 16 distinct subunits of gaba a receptors have been identified gaba receptors are composed of 5 subunits with an extracellular ligand binding domains and ion channel domains that are integral to the membrane ligand binding to these receptors activates the channel recent research has produced several ligands that are selective for gaba receptors containing the subunit subtype selective agonists for produce anxiolytic effects without sedative amnesia ataxia selective a agonists also show lack of dependence and could make them superior to currently marketed drugs the gabra3 transcript undergoes pre mrna editing by the adar family of enzymes a to i editing changes an isoleucine codon to code for a methionine residue this editing is thought to be important for brain development as the level of editing is low at birth and becomes almost 100 in an adult brain the editing occurs in an rna stem loop found in exon 9 the structured loci was identified using a specialised bioinformatics screen of the human genome the proposed function of the edit is to alter chloride permeability of the gaba receptor

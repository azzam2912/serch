parabolas and lines in the real affine plane in order to simplify the structure to any curve formula 1 the point formula 3 is added a further advantage of this completion is the plane geometry of the completed parabolas lines is isomorphic to the geometry of the plane sections of a cylinder s below originally the classical laguerre plane was defined as the geometry of the oriented lines and circles in the real euclidean plane see here we prefer the parabola model of the classical laguerre plane we define formula 4 the set of points formula 5 the set of cycles the incidence structure formula 6 is called classical laguerre plane the point set is formula 7 plus a copy of formula 8 see figure any parabola line formula 9 gets the additional point formula 3 points with the same x coordinate cannot be connected by curves formula 9 hence we define two points formula 12 are parallel formula 13 if formula 14 or there is no cycle containing formula 15 and formula 16 for the description of the classical real laguerre plane above two points formula 17 are parallel if and only if formula 18 formula 19 is an

a typical use is with handling of molten aluminium they also are exceptionally corrosion resistant and hence are also used in the chemical industry sialons also have high wear resistance low thermal expansion and good oxidation resistance up to above 1000 c they were first reported around 1971 sialons are ceramics based on the elements silicon si aluminium al oxygen o and nitrogen n they are solid solutions of silicon nitride sin where si n bonds are partly replaced with al n and al o bonds the substitution degrees can be estimated from the lattice parameters the charge discrepancy caused by the substitution can be compensated by adding metal cations such as li mg ca y and ln where ln stands for lanthanide sialons exist in three basic forms which are iso structural with one of the two common forms of silicon nitride alpha and beta and with orthorhombic silicon oxynitride they are hence named as and o sialons sialons are produced by first combining a mixture of raw materials including silicon nitride alumina aluminium nitride silica and the oxide of a rare earth element such as yttrium the powder mix is fabricated into a green compact by isostatic powder

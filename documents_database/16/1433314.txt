the principal concepts were wirth viewed modula 2 as a successor to his earlier programming languages pascal and modula the language design was also influenced by the mesa language and the new programming possibilities of the early personal computer xerox alto both from xerox that wirth saw during his 1976 sabbatical year at xerox parc the computer magazine byte devoted the august 1984 issue to the language and its surrounding environment modula 2 is a general purpose procedural language sufficiently flexible to do systems programming but with much broader application in particular it was designed to support separate compilation and data abstraction in a straightforward way much of the syntax is based on wirth s earlier and better known language pascal modula 2 was designed to be broadly similar to pascal with some elements and syntactic ambiguities removed and the important addition of the module concept and direct language support for multiprogramming the language allows compilation in a single pass and in a compiler of gutknecht and wirth was about four times faster than earlier multi pass compilers here is an example of the source code for the hello world program the modula 2 module may be used to encapsulate

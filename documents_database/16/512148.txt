it is a g g matrix where c has genus g the rank of the hasse witt matrix is the hasse or hasse witt invariant this definition as given in the introduction is natural in classical terms and is due to helmut hasse and ernst witt 1936 it provides a solution to the question of the p rank of the jacobian variety j of c the p rank is bounded by the rank of h specifically it is the rank of the frobenius mapping composed with itself g times it is also a definition that is in principle algorithmic there has been substantial recent interest in this as of practical application to cryptography in the case of c a hyperelliptic curve the curve c is superspecial if h 0 that definition needs a couple of caveats at least firstly there is a convention about frobenius mappings and under the modern understanding what is required for h is the transpose of frobenius see arithmetic and geometric frobenius for more discussion secondly the frobenius mapping is not f linear it is linear over the prime field z p z in f therefore the matrix can be written down but does not represent

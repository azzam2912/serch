p solubilization ability of rhizosphere microorganisms is considered to be one of the most important traits associated with plant phosphate nutrition it is generally accepted that the mechanism of mineral phosphate solubilization by psb strains is associated with the release of low molecular weight organic acids through which their hydroxyl and carboxyl groups chelate the cations bound to phosphate thereby converting it into soluble forms psb have been introduced to the agricultural community as phosphate biofertilizer phosphorus p is one of the major essential macronutrients for plants and is applied to soil in the form of phosphate fertilizers however a large portion of soluble inorganic phosphate which is applied to the soil as chemical fertilizer is immobilized rapidly and becomes unavailable to plants currently the main purpose in managing soil phosphorus is to optimize crop production and minimize p loss from soils psb have attracted the attention of agriculturists as soil inoculums to improve the plant growth and yield when psb is used with rock phosphate it can save about 50 of the crop requirement of phosphatic fertilizer the use of psb as inoculants increases p uptake by plants simple inoculation of seeds with psb gives crop yield responses equivalent

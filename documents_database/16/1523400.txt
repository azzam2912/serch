semen can be used successfully indefinitely after cryopreservation for human sperm the longest reported successful storage is 24 years it can be used for sperm donation where the recipient wants the treatment in a different time or place or as a means of preserving fertility for men undergoing vasectomy or treatments that may compromise their fertility such as chemotherapy radiation therapy or surgery the most common cryoprotectant used for semen is glycerol 10 in culture medium often sucrose or other di trisaccharides are added to glycerol solution cryoprotectant media may be supplemented with either egg yolk or soy lecithin with the two having no statistically significant differences compared to each other regarding motility morphology ability to bind to hyaluronate in vitro or dna integrity after thawing additional cryoprotectants can be used to increase sperm viability and fertility rates post freezing treatment of sperm with heparin binding proteins prior to cryopreservation showed decreased cryoinjury and generation of ros the addition of nerve growth factor as a cryoprotectant decreases sperm cell death rates and increased motility after thawing incorporation of cholesterol into sperm cell membranes with the use of cyclodextrins prior to freezing also increases sperm viability semen is frozen using either

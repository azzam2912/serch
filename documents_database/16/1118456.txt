its most explored and useful property is photoluminescence which can be easily detected from an individual n v center especially those in the negative charge state n v electron spins at n v centers localized at atomic scales can be manipulated at room temperature by applying a magnetic field electric field microwave radiation or light or a combination resulting in sharp resonances in the intensity and wavelength of the photoluminescence these resonances can be explained in terms of electron spin related phenomena such as quantum entanglement spin orbit interaction and rabi oscillations and analysed using advanced quantum optics theory an individual n v center can be viewed as a basic unit of a quantum computer and it has potential applications in novel more efficient fields of electronics and computational science including quantum cryptography spintronics and masers the nitrogen vacancy center is a point defect in the diamond lattice it consists of a nearest neighbor pair of a nitrogen atom which substitutes for a carbon atom and a lattice vacancy two charge states of this defect neutral n v and negative n v are known from spectroscopic studies using optical absorption photoluminescence pl electron paramagnetic resonance epr and optically detected magnetic

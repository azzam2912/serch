the word derives from two greek words iso meaning equal and sbestos meaning extinguishable when an isosbestic plot is constructed by the superposition of the absorption spectra of two species whether by using molar absorptivity for the representation or by using absorbance and keeping the same molar concentration for both species the isosbestic point corresponds to a wavelength at which these spectra cross each other a pair of substances can have several isosbestic points in their spectra when a 1 to 1 one mole of reactant gives one mole of product chemical reaction including equilibria involves a pair of substances with an isosbestic point the absorbance of the reaction mixture at this wavelength remains invariant regardless of the extent of reaction or the position of the chemical equilibrium this occurs because the two substances absorb light of that specific wavelength to the same extent and the analytical concentration remains constant for the reaction the analytical concentration is the same at any point in the reaction the absorbance of the reaction mixture assuming it depends only on x and y is but at the isosbestic point both molar absorptivities are the same hence the absorbance does not depend on the extent

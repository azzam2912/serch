the epithet cornea is in reference to the cortex appearing hard and close textured niebla cornea is recognized by the thallus divided into broad strap like branches that arise from a central basal attachment point usually with a well marked blackened area extending a short distance above the base the branches are rather simple or irregularly divided into secondary branches occasionally with small terminal clusters of often 4 cup shaped apothecia or when no apothecia are present the branches often terminate in short lobes of unequal length that develop as an extension of the branch margins black dot like pycnidia are scattered along the margins of the upper parts of branches and lobes and occasionally on reticulate ridges but forms with thick branches and undeveloped apothecia are more densely covered with pycnidia along branch margins niebla cornea is further characterized by the presence of the lichen substance sekikaic acid along with triterpenes and pigments concentrated near base the firm cortex of niebla cornea is surprisingly only 45 60 m thick in contrast to that of n eburnea 65 125 m thick a similar species that also differs by having divaricatic acid although niebla cornea can often be distinguished by its

very similar structures had been observed in 1994 by peter j f harris edman tsang john claridge and malcolm green ever since the discovery of the fullerene the family of carbon nanostructures has been steadily expanded included in this family are single walled and multi walled carbon nanotubes swnts and mwnts carbon onions and cones and most recently swnhs these swnhs with about 40 50 nm in tubule length and about 2 3 nm in diameter are derived from swnts and ended by a five pentagon conical cap with a cone opening angle of 20 moreover thousands of swnhs associate with each other to form the dahlia like and bud like structured aggregates which have an average diameter of about 80 100 nm the former consists of tubules and graphene sheets protruding from its surface like petals of a dahlia while the latter is composed of tubules developing inside the particle itself their unique structures with high surface area and microporosity make swnhs become a promising material for gas adsorption biosensing drug delivery gas storage and catalyst support for fuel cell single walled carbon nanohorns are an example of the family of carbon nanocones swnhs can be synthesized with high

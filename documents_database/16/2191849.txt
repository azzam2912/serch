t jaynes can be considered as a generalization of the principle of maximum entropy it postulates that the most unbiased probability distribution of paths is the one that maximizes their shannon entropy this entropy of paths is sometimes called the caliber of the system and is given by the path integral the principle of maximum caliber was proposed by edwin t jaynes in 1980 in an article titled the minimum entropy production principle over the context of to find a principle for to derive the non equilibrium statistical mechanics the principle of maximum caliber can be considered as a generalization of the principle of maximum entropy defined over the paths space the caliber formula 2 is of the form where for n constraints it is shown that the probability functional is in the same way for n dynamical constraints defined in the interval formula 6 of the form it is shown that the probability functional is following jaynes hypothesis there exist publications in which the principle of maximum caliber appears to emerge as a result of the construction of a framework which describes a statistical representation of systems with many degrees of freedom

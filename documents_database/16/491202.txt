according to special relativity the rate of a clock c traveling between two synchronized laboratory clocks a and b as seen by a laboratory observer is slowed down relative to the laboratory clock rates since any periodic process can be considered a clock the lifetimes of unstable particles such as muons must also be affected so that moving muons should have a longer lifetime than resting ones a variety of experiments confirming this effect have been performed both in the atmosphere and in particle accelerators another type of time dilation experiments is the group of ives stilwell experiments measuring the relativistic doppler effect the emergence of the muons is caused by the collision of cosmic rays with the upper atmosphere after which the muons reach earth the probability that muons can reach the earth depends on their half life which itself is modified by the relativistic corrections of two quantities a the mean lifetime of muons and b the length between the upper and lower atmosphere at earth s surface this allows for a direct application of length contraction upon the atmosphere at rest in inertial frame s and time dilation upon the muons at rest in s length of

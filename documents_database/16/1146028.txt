john s and ramsey the exposed coastal section of the manx northern railway between peel road and glen mooar viaduct was served by a small halt in the very early days of the railway this section of line caused the railway company headaches over many years owing to subsidence which was regularly rectified by the dumping of used locomotive ash along the sides of the running line this area is also cited as the reason for the railway acquiring a turntable to turn only the coaches to equalise the weathering of paintwork at this exposed point today the trackbed is walkable and it has sunk even further the halt was only short lived and built to serve excursions for picnickers it had no road access but did offer a basic waiting shelter which survived in use as a lineside hut until the closure of the railway

capable of moving along the blood circulation they can occur also in bile ducts gallbladder and liver parenchyma in these organs they produce pathological lesions leading to parasitic diseases they have complex life cycles requiring two or three different hosts with free living larval stages in water the body of liver flukes is leaf like and flattened the body is covered with a tegument they are hermaphrodites having complete sets of both male and female reproductive systems they have simple digestive systems and primarily feed on blood the anterior end is the oral sucker opening into the mouth inside mouth lead to a small pharynx which is followed by an extended intestine that runs through the entire length of the body the intestine is heavily branched and anus is absent instead the intestine runs along an excretory canal that opens at the posterior end adult flukes produce eggs that are passed out through the excretory pore the eggs infect different species of snails as intermediate hosts in which they grow into larvae the larvae are released into the environment from where the definitive hosts humans and other mammals get the infection in some species another intermediate host is required generally

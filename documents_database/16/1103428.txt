the systematic name of this enzyme class is s adenosyl l methionine nicotinamide n methyltransferase this enzyme is also called nicotinamide methyltransferase this enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism nnmt affects a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle which plays a role in metabolic regulation nnmt is found in human fat cells and the liver nnmt processes vitamin b3 and has been linked with certain types of cancer silencing the gene that codes for nnmt reduces its presence and increases the presence of sugar transporter glut4 mice that produced large amounts of glut4 were insulin sensitive and protected against diabetes while mice with no glut4 were insulin resistant and at risk high levels of nnmt are often found in the fat cells of animals that are insulin resistant when the researchers silenced the nnmt gene in mice on high fat diets the mice gained less weight than those in whom the nnmt gene was functioning normally the mice did not change their eating or exercise habits antisense oligonucleotide aso technology can be used to silence the expression of the nnmt gene only in fat and liver cells asos are short strings of dna that can be designed to

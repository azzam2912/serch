daniel danny hillis to turn hillis s doctoral work at the massachusetts institute of technology mit on massively parallel computing architectures into a commercial product named the connection machine the company moved in 1984 from waltham to kendall square in cambridge massachusetts close to the mit ai lab thinking machines made some of the most powerful supercomputers of the time and by 1993 the four fastest computers in the world were connection machines the firm filed for bankruptcy in 1994 its hardware and parallel computing software divisions were acquired in time by sun microsystems on the hardware side thinking machines produced several connection machine models in chronological order the cm 1 cm 2 cm 200 cm 5 and cm 5e the cm 1 and 2 came first in models with 64k 65 536 bit serial processors 16 processors per chip and later the smaller 16k and 4k configurations the connection machine was programmed in a variety of specialized programming languages including lisp and cm lisp derived from common lisp c derived by thinking machines from c and cm fortran these languages used proprietary compilers to translate code into the parallel instruction set of the connection machine the cm 1 through

a oxocarbenium ion is represented by two limiting resonance structures one in the form of a carbenium ion with the positive charge on carbon and the other in the form of an oxonium species with the formal charge on oxygen as a resonance hybrid the true structure somewhere between the two compared to neutral carbonyl compounds like ketones or esters the carbenium ion form is a larger contributor to the structure they are common reactive intermediates in the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds and are a commonly used strategy for chemical glycosylation these ions have since been proposed as reactive intermediates in a wide range of chemical transformations and have been utilized in the total synthesis of several natural products in addition they commonly appear in mechanisms of enzyme catalyzed biosynthesis and hydrolysis of carbohydrates in nature anthocyanins are natural flavylium dyes which are stabilized oxocarbenium compounds anthocyanins are responsible for the colors of a wide variety of common flowers such as pansies and edible plants such as eggplant and blueberry the best lewis structure for an oxocarbenium ion contains an oxygen carbon double bond with the oxygen atom attached to an additional group and consequently taking on a formal positive

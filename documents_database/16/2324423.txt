it works by better isolating user space and kernel space memory kpti was merged into linux kernel version 4 15 and backported to linux kernels 4 14 11 4 9 75 4 4 110 windows and macos released similar updates kpti does not address the related spectre vulnerability the kpti patches were based on kaiser short for kernel address isolation to have side channels efficiently removed a technique conceived in 2016 and published in june 2017 back when meltdown was not known yet kaiser makes it harder to defeat kaslr a 2014 mitigation for a much less severe issue in 2014 the linux kernel adopted kernel address space layout randomization kaslr which makes it more difficult to exploit other kernel vulnerabilities which relies on kernel address mappings remaining hidden from user space despite prohibiting access to these kernel mappings it turns out that there are several side channel attacks in modern processors that can leak the location of this memory making it possible to work around kaslr kaiser addressed these problems in kaslr by eliminating some sources of address leakage whereas kaslr merely prevents address mappings from leaking kaiser also prevents the data from leaking thereby covering the meltdown case

magnetic water treatment is regarded as unproven and unscientific vendors of magnetic water treatment devices frequently use pictures and testimonials to support their claims but omit quantitative detail and well controlled studies advertisements and promotions generally omit system variables such as corrosion or system mass balance analyticals as well as measurements of post treatment water such as concentration of hardness ions or the distribution structure and morphology of suspended particles duration of exposure and field strength gradient rate of change and orientation along or perpendicular to flow are variously cited as important to the results magnetic water treatment proponent klaus kronenberg proposed that the shapes of solute lime molecules are modified by strong magnetic fields leading them to precipitate as spherical or round crystals rather than deposit as sheets or platelets of hard crystals simon parsons of the school of water sciences at cranfield university proposed that the magnetic field reduces the surface charge on small particles increasing the tendency to coagulate as large particles that stay with the flow rather than depositing as scale however an internal study in 1996 at lawrence livermore national laboratory found no difference in preferred crystal structure of scale deposited in magnetic water treatment

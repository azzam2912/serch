it is mostly composed of iron silicon and oxygen with smaller fractions of calcium and several other metals together with armalcolite and tranquillityite it is one of the three minerals which were discovered on the moon it was then found in lunar and martian meteorites as well as a mineral in the earth s crust pyroxferroite can also be produced by annealing synthetic clinopyroxene at high pressures and temperatures the mineral is metastable and gradually decomposes at ambient conditions but this process can take billions of years pyroxferroite is named from pyroxene and ferrum latin for iron as the iron rich analogue of pyroxmangite the word pyroxene in turn comes from the greek words for fire and stranger pyroxenes were named this way because of their presence in volcanic lavas where they are sometimes seen as crystals embedded in volcanic glass it was assumed they were impurities in the glass hence the name fire strangers however they are simply early forming minerals that crystallized before the lava erupted pyroxferroite was first discovered in 1969 in lunar rock samples from the sea of tranquility during the apollo missions together with armalcolite and tranquillityite it is one of the three minerals which

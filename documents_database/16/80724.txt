in other words the set of positive integers is well ordered by its natural or magnitude order in which formula 1 precedes formula 2 if and only if formula 2 is either formula 1 or the sum of formula 1 and some positive integer other orderings include the ordering formula 6 and formula 7 the phrase well ordering principle is sometimes taken to be synonymous with the well ordering theorem on other occasions it is understood to be the proposition that the set of integers formula 8contains a well ordered subset called the natural numbers in which every nonempty subset contains a least element depending on the framework in which the natural numbers are introduced this second order property of the set of natural numbers is either an axiom or a provable theorem for example in the second sense this phrase is used when that proposition is relied on for the purpose of justifying proofs that take the following form to prove that every natural number belongs to a specified set formula 19 assume the contrary which implies that the set of counterexamples is non empty and thus contains a smallest counterexample then show that for any counterexample there is

the construction while not functorial is a fundamental tool in scheme theory in this article all rings will be assumed to be commutative and with identity let s be a graded ring where formula 1 is the direct sum decomposition associated with the gradation the irrelevant ideal of s is the ideal of elements of positive degree formula 2 we say an ideal is homogeneous if it is generated by homogeneous elements then as a set for brevity we will sometimes write x for formula 4 we may define a topology called the zariski topology on formula 4 by defining the closed sets to be those of the form where a is a homogeneous ideal of s as in the case of affine schemes it is quickly verified that the v a form the closed sets of a topology on x indeed if formula 7 are a family of ideals then we have formula 8 and if the indexing set i is finite then formula 9 equivalently we may take the open sets as a starting point and define a common shorthand is to denote d sf by d f where sf is the ideal generated by f for any

this method was discovered by emil fischer in 1896 the cyanohydrin itself is derived from a separate aldehyde the reactants of the oxazole synthesis itself the cyanohydrin of an aldehyde and the other aldehyde itself are usually present in equimolar amounts both reactants usually have an aromatic group which appear at specific positions on the resulting heterocycle a more specific example of fischer oxazole synthesis involves reacting mandelic acid nitrile with benzaldehyde to give 2 5 diphenyl oxazole fischer developed the fischer oxazole synthesis during his time at berlin university the fischer oxazole synthesis was one of the first syntheses developed to produce 2 5 disubstituted oxazoles the fischer oxazole synthesis is a type of dehydration reaction which can occur under mild conditions in a rearrangement of the groups that would not seem possible the reaction occurs by dissolving the reactants in dry ether and passing through the solution dry gaseous hydrogen chloride the product which is the 2 5 disubstituted oxazole precipitates as the hydrochloride and can be converted to the free base by the addition of water or by boiling with alcohol the cyanohydrins and aldehydes used for the synthesis are usually aromatic however there have been instances

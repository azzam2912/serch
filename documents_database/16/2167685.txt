the white and chalky shell has a fusiform shape fresh specimens are pale pink the shell shows no axial sculpture the whorls contain a smooth upper and a gemmate lower keel the protoconch smooth the height of the spire equals about that of the aperture with siphonal canal sculpture each whorl is tabulated below the suture and the tabulation ends anteriorly in a prominent spiral thread then follows a second tabulation terminating in a row of oval gemmules about 15 on the body whorl just posterior to the gemmules is a fine spiral thread carrying the abruptly curved sharp threads of the anal sinus these threads are regularly interspaced elevated and very distinct on both tabulations they are covered by the first spiral but override the second with a sharp downward bend on the body whorl they change their character becoming mere striations and more numerous than in the fasciole of the anal sinus a second slightly gemmed thread appears on the body whorl and 2 fine spiral lines on the anterior tabulation on the base of the shell there are 4 strong spirals and on the siphonal canal about 10 much weaker the spireis conic very little higher than

in 1963 gr tzer and schmidt proved that every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some algebra thus there is essentially no restriction on the shape of a congruence lattice of an algebra the finite lattice representation problem asks whether the same is true for finite lattices and finite algebras that is does every finite lattice occur as the congruence lattice of a finite algebra in 1980 p lfy and pudl k proved that this problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding whether every finite lattice occurs as an interval in the subgroup lattice of a finite group for an overview of the group theoretic approach to the problem see p lfy 1993 and p lfy 2001 this problem should not be confused with the congruence lattice problem this is among the oldest unsolved problems in universal algebra until it is answered the theory of finite algebras is incomplete since given a finite algebra it is unknown whether there are a priori any restrictions on the shape of its congruence lattice

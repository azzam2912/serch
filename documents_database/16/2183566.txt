in this model pain only dcs is modelled by a single tissue which is diffusion limited for gas uptake and bubble formation during decompression causes phase equilibration of partial pressures between dissolved and free gases the driving mechanism for gas elimination in this tissue is inherent unsaturation also called partial pressure vacancy or the oxygen window where oxygen metabolised is replaced by more soluble carbon dioxide this model was used to explain the effectiveness of the torres straits island pearl divers empirically developed decompression schedules which used deeper decompression stops and less overall decompression time than the current naval decompression schedules this trend to deeper decompression stops has become a feature of more recent decompression models brian a hills analysed the existing decompression hypotheses frequently referenced in the literature of the time and identified three basic characteristics of comprehensive theoretical approaches to modeling decompression hills found no evidence of discontinuity in the incidence of decompression symptoms for exposure depth variations which he interpreted as suggesting that either a single critical tissue or a continuous range of tissues are involved and that correlation was not improved by assuming an infinite range of half times in a conventional exponential model after later

plates are defined as plane structural elements with a small thickness compared to the planar dimensions the typical thickness to width ratio of a plate structure is less than 0 1 a plate theory takes advantage of this disparity in length scale to reduce the full three dimensional solid mechanics problem to a two dimensional problem the aim of plate theory is to calculate the deformation and stresses in a plate subjected to loads of the numerous plate theories that have been developed since the late 19th century two are widely accepted and used in engineering these are the kirchhoff love theory is an extension of euler bernoulli beam theory to thin plates the theory was developed in 1888 by love using assumptions proposed by kirchhoff it is assumed that a mid surface plane can be used to represent the three dimensional plate in two dimensional form the following kinematic assumptions that are made in this theory the kirchhoff hypothesis implies that the displacement field has the form where formula 1 and formula 2 are the cartesian coordinates on the mid surface of the undeformed plate formula 3 is the coordinate for the thickness direction formula 4 are the in

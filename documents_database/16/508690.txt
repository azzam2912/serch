crosstalk is usually caused by undesired capacitive inductive or conductive coupling from one circuit or channel to another crosstalk is a significant issue in structured cabling audio electronics integrated circuit design wireless communication and other communications systems in structured cabling crosstalk refers to electromagnetic interference from one unshielded twisted pair to another twisted pair normally running in parallel signals traveling through adjacent pairs of wire interfere with each other the pair causing the interference is called the disturbing pair while the pair experiencing the interference is the disturbed pair in stereo audio reproduction crosstalk can refer to signal leaking across from one program channel to another reducing channel separation and stereo imaging crosstalk between channels in mixing consoles and between studio feeds is a much more noticeable problem as these are likely to be carrying very different programmes or material crosstalk is an electrical effect and can be quantified with a crosstalk measurement crosstalk measurements are made on audio systems to determine the amount of signal leaking across from one channel to another the independent broadcasting authority published a weighting curve for use in crosstalk measurement that gives due emphasis to the subjective audibility of different frequencies in the absence

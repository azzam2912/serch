in our galaxy embedded clusters can mostly be found within the galactic disk or near the galactic center where most of the star formation activity is happening the sizes of stellar objects born in embedded clusters are distributed according to initial mass function with many low mass stars formed for every high mass star nevertheless the high mass stars of temperature class o and b which are significantly hotter and more luminous than the low mass stars have a disproportionate effect on their interstellar environment by ionizing the gas surrounding them creating h ii regions many ultra compact h ii regions the precursors to massive protostars are associated with embedded clusters over time radiation pressure from the stellar objects will disperse the molecular cloud and give rise to the better known open cluster several famous embedded clusters include the trapezium cluster in the orion nebula l1688 in the rho ophiuchi cloud complex ngc 2244 in the rosette nebula the cluster in the trifid nebula ngc 6611 in the eagle nebula and trumpler 14 15 and 16 in the carina nebula

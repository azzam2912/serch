in instances where two pipes made of dissimilar materials are to be joined most commonly pvc and copper the fittings will be made of one or more compatible materials appropriate for the connection compression fittings for attaching tubing piping commonly have ferrules or olives in the uk in them compression fittings are also used extensively for hot and cold water faucets taps and toilet stop valves compression fittings are well suited to this application as these valves are usually located in confined spaces where copper pipe would be difficult to solder without creating a fire hazard also the fittings allow easy disconnection and reconnection in small sizes the compression fitting is composed of an outer compression nut and an inner compression ring or ferrule sometimes referred to as an olive that is typically made of brass or copper ferrules vary in shape and material but are most commonly in the shape of a ring with beveled edges to work properly the ferrule must be oriented correctly usually the ferrule is fitted such that the longest sloping face of the ferrule faces away from the nut when the nut is tightened the ferrule is compressed between the nut and the receiving

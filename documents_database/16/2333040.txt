it is an instance of the popular metropolis hastings algorithm that extends its use to cases where the target density is not available analytically it relies on the fact that the metropolis hastings algorithm can still sample from the correct target distribution if the target density in the acceptance ratio is replaced by an estimate it is especially popular in bayesian statistics where it is applied if the likelihood function is not tractable see example below the aim is to simulate from some probability density function formula 1 the algorithm follows the same steps as the standard metropolis hastings algorithm except that the evaluation of the target density is replaced by a non negative and unbiased estimate for comparison the main steps of a metropolis hastings algorithm are outlined below given a current state formula 2 the metropolis hastings algorithm proposes a new state according to some density formula 3 the algorithm then sets formula 4 with probability otherwise the old state is kept that is formula 6 if the density formula 7 is not available analytically the above algorithm cannot be employed the pseudo marginal metropolis hastings algorithm in contrast only assumes the existence of an estimator formula 8

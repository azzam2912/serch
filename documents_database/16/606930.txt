corliss engines were generally about 30 percent more fuel efficient than conventional steam engines with fixed cutoff this increased efficiency made steam power more economical than water power allowing industrial development away from millponds corliss engines were typically used as stationary engines to provide mechanical power to line shafting in factories and mills and to drive dynamos to generate electricity many were quite large standing many metres tall and developing several hundred horsepower albeit at low speed turning massive flywheels weighing several tons at about 100 revolutions per minute some of these engines have unusual roles as mechanical legacy systems and because of their relatively high efficiency and low maintenance requirements some remain in service into the early 21st century see for example the engines at the hook norton brewery and the distillerie dillon in the list of operational engines corliss engines have four valves for each cylinder with steam and exhaust valves located at each end corliss engines incorporate distinct refinements in both the valves themselves and in the valve gear that is the system of linkages that operate the valves the use of separate valves for steam admission and exhaust means that neither the valves nor the steam

it is the distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same phase on the wave such as two adjacent crests troughs or zero crossings and is a characteristic of both traveling waves and standing waves as well as other spatial wave patterns the inverse of the wavelength is called the spatial frequency wavelength is commonly designated by the greek letter lambda the term wavelength is also sometimes applied to modulated waves and to the sinusoidal envelopes of modulated waves or waves formed by interference of several sinusoids assuming a sinusoidal wave moving at a fixed wave speed wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency of the wave waves with higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths wavelength depends on the medium for example vacuum air or water that a wave travels through examples of waves are sound waves light water waves and periodic electrical signals in a conductor a sound wave is a variation in air pressure while in light and other electromagnetic radiation the strength of the electric and the magnetic field vary water waves are variations in the height of a body of water in a crystal lattice vibration atomic positions vary the range of

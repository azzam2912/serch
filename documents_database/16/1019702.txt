pmos transistors operate by creating an inversion layer in an n type transistor body this inversion layer called the p channel can conduct holes between p type source and drain terminals the p channel is created by applying voltage to the third terminal called the gate like other mosfets pmos transistors have four modes of operation cut off or subthreshold triode saturation sometimes called active and velocity saturation while pmos logic is easy to design and manufacture a mosfet can be made to operate as a resistor so the whole circuit can be made with pmos fets it has several shortcomings as well the worst problem is that there is a direct current dc through a pmos logic gate when the pun is active that is whenever the output is high which leads to static power dissipation even when the circuit sits idle also pmos circuits are slow to transition from high to low when transitioning from low to high the transistors provide low resistance and the capacitive charge at the output accumulates very quickly similar to charging a capacitor through a very low resistance but the resistance between the output and the negative supply rail is much greater so

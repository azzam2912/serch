it was used in precision clocks and watches to place the source of power closer to the escapement thereby increasing the accuracy by evening out variations in drive force caused by unevenness of the friction in the geartrain in spring driven precision clocks a gravity remontoire is often used to replace the uneven force delivered by the mainspring running down by the more constant force of gravity acting on a weight in turret clocks it serves to separate the large forces needed to drive the hands from the modest forces needed to drive the escapement which keeps the pendulum swinging a remontoire should not be confused with a maintaining power spring which is used only to keep the timepiece going while it is being wound remontoires are used because the timekeeping mechanism in clocks and watches the pendulum or balance wheel is never isochronous its rate is affected by changes in the drive force applied to it in spring driven timepieces the drive force declines as the mainspring runs down in weight driven clocks the drive force provided by a weight suspended by a cord is more constant but imperfections in the gear train and variations in lubrication also cause

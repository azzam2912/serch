fabs normally supply antenna rules which are rules that must be obeyed to avoid this problem a violation of such rules is called an antenna violation the word antenna is something of a misnomer in this context the problem is really the collection of charge not the normal meaning of antenna which is a device for converting electromagnetic fields to from electrical currents occasionally the phrase antenna effect is used in this context but this is less common since there are many effects and the phrase does not make clear which is meant figure 1 a shows a side view of a typical net in an integrated circuit each net will include at least one driver which must contain a source or drain diffusion in newer technology implantation is used and at least one receiver which will consist of a gate electrode over a thin gate dielectric see figure 2 for a detailed view of a mos transistor since the gate dielectric is so thin only a few molecules thick a big worry is breakdown of this layer this can happen if the net somehow acquires a voltage somewhat higher than the normal operating voltage of the chip historically the

the goal of the program was to apply concepts from artificial intelligence to the problem of designing and implementing computer software software would be described by models in very high level languages essentially equivalent to first order logic and then transformation rules would transform the specification into efficient code the air force hoped to be able to generate the software to control weapons systems and other command and control systems using this method as software was becoming ever more critical to usaf weapons systems it was realized that improving the quality and productivity of the software development process could have significant benefits for the military as well as for information technology in other major us industries in the early 1980s the united states air force realized that they had received significant benefits from applying artificial intelligence technologies to solving expert problems such as the diagnosis of faults in aircraft the air force commissioned a group of researchers from the artificial intelligence and formal methods communities to develop a report on how such technologies might be used to aid in the more general problem of software development the report described a vision for a new approach to software development rather than

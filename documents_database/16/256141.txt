generally speaking information granules are collections of entities that usually originate at the numeric level and are arranged together due to their similarity functional or physical adjacency indistinguishability coherency or the like at present granular computing is more a theoretical perspective than a coherent set of methods or principles as a theoretical perspective it encourages an approach to data that recognizes and exploits the knowledge present in data at various levels of resolution or scales in this sense it encompasses all methods which provide flexibility and adaptability in the resolution at which knowledge or information is extracted and represented as mentioned above granular computing is not an algorithm or process there is no particular method that is called granular computing it is rather an approach to looking at data that recognizes how different and interesting regularities in the data can appear at different levels of granularity much as different features become salient in satellite images of greater or lesser resolution on a low resolution satellite image for example one might notice interesting cloud patterns representing cyclones or other large scale weather phenomena while in a higher resolution image one misses these large scale atmospheric phenomena but instead notices smaller scale

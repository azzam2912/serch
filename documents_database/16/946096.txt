usually flank speed is reserved for situations in which a ship finds itself in imminent danger such as coming under attack by aircraft flank speed is very fuel inefficient and often unsustainable because of propulsion system limitations the related term emergency may not be any faster than flank but it indicates that the ship should be brought up to maximum speed in the shortest possible time other speeds include one third two thirds standard and full one third and two thirds are the respective fractions of standard speed full is greater than standard but not as great as flank in surface ship nuclear marine propulsion the differentiation between full speed and flank speed is of lesser significance because vessels can be run at or very near their true maximum speed for a sustained duration with little regard for fuel expended a top consideration of oil powered ships in us nuclear submarine propulsion full speed is 50 reactor power flank speed is 100 power although limits may be reached for the propulsion turbine first stage pressure or for reactor thermal power in mw depending upon the specifics of the individual propulsion plant before 100 reactor power is reached in addition for

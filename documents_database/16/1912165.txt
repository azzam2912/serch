they contain a vast diversity of omnivorous and carnivorous songbirds widespread in africa and australia many of which superficially resemble shrikes it was defined and named by cacraft and colleagues in 2004 and contains the bushshrikes malaconotidae helmetshrikes prionopidae ioras aegithinidae vangas vangidae and the australian butcherbirds magpies currawongs and woodswallows artamidae molecular analysis in 2006 added the bornean bristlehead to the group though its position in the malconotoidea is unclear it was initially thought related to the butcherbirds and woodswallows but now is thought to be an early offshoot in 2012 jerome fuchs and colleagues extensively analysed the malaconotoidea called by them malaconotidea using both mitochondrial and nuclear dna the resulting tree suggested that the group originated in australasia and prolifically diversified in africa after an ancestor crossed to africa between 45 and 33 7 million years ago during the late eocene this is based on the basal position of group comprising the woodswallows and butcherbirds and allies and most likely the boatbills complicating the picture is that some malaysian species such as the bornean bristlehead flycatcher shrikes the philentoma s and woodshrikes appear to be more closely related to african species a cladistic study of the bony characteristics

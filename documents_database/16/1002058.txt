the taxon was described by gustaf johan billberg in 1820 the tribe was previously treated as a higher level taxon the subfamily lithosiinae within the lichen and tiger moth family arctiidae the ranks of the family and its subdivisions were lowered in a recent reclassification while keeping the contents of the family and its subdivisions largely unchanged these changes in rank triggered changes in the suffixes in the names the family arctiidae as a whole was reclassified as the subfamily arctiinae within the family erebidae the original subfamily lithosiinae was lowered to tribe status as lithosiini and its original tribes were lowered to subtribe status by changing the ini suffix to ina e g acsalini became acsalina thus the present name lithosiini used to refer to only a subgroup of the entire lichen moth group lithosiinae but now it refers to the entire group the systematics of the lithosiini are in need of revision for example the proposed subtribes afridina cisthenina endrosina and eudesmina require validation and delimitation of content the arrangement followed here is based on the preliminary consensus list of savela 2007 the tribe currently contains about 2752 species many genera in the tribe lithosiini are included in

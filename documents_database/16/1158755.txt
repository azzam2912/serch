talin 1 is ubiquitously expressed and is localized to costamere structures in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells and to focal adhesions in smooth muscle and non muscle cells talin 1 functions to mediate cell cell adhesion via the linkage of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and in the activation of integrins altered expression of talin 1 has been observed in patients with heart failure however no mutations in tln1 have been linked with specific diseases human talin 1 is 270 0 kda molecular weight and 2541 amino acids the n terminal region of talin 1 is 50 kda in size and homologous to members of the erm protein family which have a globular ferm domain residues 86 400 that links the actin cytoskeleton to adhesion proteins in addition to f actin the n terminal region of talin 1 binds layilin 1 and 3 integrin and focal adhesion kinase talin 1 n terminal region also binds acidic phospholipids for insertion into lipid bilayers the rod domain 200 kda has considerable flexibility and houses a conserved actin binding site three vinculin binding sites and also has an additional integrin binding site termed ibs2 the head and rod domains are connected by an

after receiving his b s undergraduate degree from the city college of new york in 1952 he studied under richard feynman and john r pellam at california institute of technology where he received his ph d in physics in 1961 thereafter he spent the following 31 years 1961 to 1992 as a faculty member in the physics department at ucla dr chester is perhaps best known for his text book for student physicists called primer of quantum mechanics which connects the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics directly to its philosophical underpinnings among his more substantial contributions to the field he predicted and demonstrated a bernoulli effect in the electron gas he is known for playing with and challenging the formal constructs of the scientific publication one example of this can be found in an experiment regarding the wave function of superfluid helium a published technical description of an experiment to detect the diffraction because of its order parameter wave function property of bulk superfluid helium flow through a grating written in rhymed verse he showed that the notion of identity identification is connected to the concept of symmetry he established the connection via the mathematical apparatus of group theory the

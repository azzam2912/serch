to give himself the middle of the week off he makes a simple change by moving up the date of execution for lord farrow from wednesday to monday however this simple change goes completely awry when the queen allows farrow s wife to visit her husband in prison on monday the day before his originally scheduled execution not aware that he has already been executed as he is already too late blackadder pretends to be farrow disguising himself with a bag over his head as the queen had given lady farrow a death warrant to give to edmund should he refuse her he is nearly thwarted first when he discovers that farrow had many individual traits such as a deep voice being much taller than him and missing half an arm and then when lady farrow attempts to take the bag off his head nevertheless he manages to go undetected afterward the queen decides to pardon farrow saying he probably is innocent anyway and everything looks bleak for blackadder deciding that the only way to get around this problem is to pretend that they had been taking farrow to see the queen when he said something traitorous in the hallway

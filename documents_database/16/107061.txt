the electric current flows mainly at the skin of the conductor between the outer surface and a level called the skin depth the skin effect causes the effective resistance of the conductor to increase at higher frequencies where the skin depth is smaller thus reducing the effective cross section of the conductor the skin effect is due to opposing eddy currents induced by the changing magnetic field resulting from the alternating current at 60 hz in copper the skin depth is about 8 5 mm at high frequencies the skin depth becomes much smaller increased ac resistance due to the skin effect can be mitigated by using specially woven litz wire because the interior of a large conductor carries so little of the current tubular conductors such as pipe can be used to save weight and cost conductors typically in the form of wires may be used to transmit electrical energy or signals using an alternating current flowing through that conductor the charge carriers constituting that current usually electrons are driven by an electric field due to the source of electrical energy an alternating current in a conductor produces an alternating magnetic field in and around the conductor when the

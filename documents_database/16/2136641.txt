b is called the symmetrized version of a usually denoted formula 4 these algorithms show up in solving the classical isoperimetric inequality problem which asks given all two dimensional shapes of a given area which of them has the minimal perimeter for details see isoperimetric inequality the conjectured answer was the disk and steiner in 1838 showed this to be true using the steiner symmetrization method described below from this many other isoperimetric problems sprung and other symmetrization algorithms for example rayleigh s conjecture is that the first eigenvalue of the dirichlet problem is minimized for the ball see rayleigh faber krahn inequality for details another problem is that the newtonian capacity of a set a is minimized by formula 4 and this was proved by polya and g szego 1951 using circular symmetrization described below if formula 6 is measurable then it is denoted by formula 7 the symmetrized version of formula 8 i e a ball formula 9 such that formula 10 we denote by formula 11 the symmetric decreasing rearrangement of nonnegative measurable function f and define it as formula 12 where formula 13 is the symmetrized version of preimage set formula 14 the methods described below

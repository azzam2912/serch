standard models are used in order to verify by comparison of wind tunnel test results with previously published results the complete measurement chain in a wind tunnel including wind tunnel structure quality of the airstream model positioning transducers and force balances data acquisition system and data reduction software more specifically standard wind tunnel models are used for besides results from wind tunnel tests of standard models are used as test cases for verification of computational fluid dynamics cfd computer codes in most wind tunnels standard models are tested during the commissioning and calibration of the facility this sometimes has an unfortunate effect that the test results are not as good as they can be because the wind tunnel and its measurement system have not yet been optimally tuned at the time of the test however some laboratories have adopted the practice of periodical testing of a standard model every couple of years in order to provide a continued confidence in the reliability of measurements in their wind tunnels standard wind tunnel models are usually but not always intended for one of the basic wind tunnel measurement types such as the measurement of forces and moments with force balances or measurements

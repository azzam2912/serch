the method of incremental deformation can be used to solve static quasi static and time dependent problems the governing equations of the motion are ones of the classical mechanics such as the conservation of mass and the balance of linear and angular momentum which provide the equilibrium configuration of the material the main corresponding mathematical framework is described in the main raymond ogden s book non linear elastic deformations and in biot s book mechanics of incremental deformations which is a collection of his main papers let formula 1 be a three dimensional euclidean space let formula 2 be two regions occupied by the material in two different instants of time let formula 3 be the deformation which transforms the tissue from formula 4 i e the material reference configuration to the loaded configuration formula 5 i e current configuration let formula 6 be a formula 7 diffeomorphism from formula 4 to formula 5 with formula 10 being the current position vector given as a function of the material position formula 11 the deformation gradient is given by formula 12 considering a hyperelastic material with an elastic strain energy density formula 13 the piola kirchhoff stress tensor formula 14 is

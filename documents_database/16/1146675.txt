certain atoms such as oxygen will almost always set their two or more covalent bonds in non collinear directions due to their electron configuration water ho is an example of a bent molecule as well as its analogues the bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms is approximately 104 45 nonlinear geometry is commonly observed for other triatomic molecules and ions containing only main group elements prominent examples being nitrogen dioxide no sulfur dichloride scl and methylene ch this geometry is almost always consistent with vsepr theory which usually explains non collinearity of atoms with a presence of lone pairs there are several variants of bending where the most common is axe where two covalent bonds and two lone pairs of the central atom a form a complete 8 electron shell they have central angles from 104 to 109 5 where the latter is consistent with a simplistic theory which predicts the tetrahedral symmetry of four sp hybridised orbitals the most common actual angles are 105 107 and 109 they vary because of the different properties of the peripheral atoms x other cases also experience orbital hybridisation but in different degrees axe molecules such as sncl have only one lone

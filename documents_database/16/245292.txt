he is currently a permanent member of the simons center for geometry and physics at stony brook university and a professor in pure mathematics at imperial college london donaldson s father was an electrical engineer in the physiology department at the university of cambridge and his mother earned a science degree there donaldson gained a ba degree in mathematics from pembroke college cambridge in 1979 and in 1980 began postgraduate work at worcester college oxford at first under nigel hitchin and later under michael atiyah s supervision still a postgraduate student donaldson proved in 1982 a result that would establish his fame he published the result in a paper self dual connections and the topology of smooth 4 manifolds which appeared in 1983 in the words of atiyah the paper stunned the mathematical world whereas michael freedman classified topological four manifolds donaldson s work focused on four manifolds admitting a differentiable structure using instantons a particular solution to the equations of yang mills gauge theory which has its origin in quantum field theory one of donaldson s first results gave severe restrictions on the intersection form of a smooth four manifold as a consequence a large class of the topological

robertson in 1940 where formula 3 is the root mean square turbulent velocity and formula 4 are turbulent velocity in all three directions here formula 5 is the longitudinal correlation and formula 6 is the lateral correlation of velocity at two different points from continuity equation we have thus formula 8 uniquely determines the two point correlation function theodore von k rm n and leslie howarth derived the evolution equation for formula 8 from navier stokes equation as where formula 11 uniquely determines the triple correlation tensor l g loitsiankii derived an integral invariant for the decay of the turbulence by taking the fourth moment of the k rm n howarth equation in 1939 i e if formula 5 decays faster than formula 15 as formula 16 and also in this limit if we assume that formula 17 vanishes we have the quantity which is invariant lev landau and evgeny lifshitz showed that this invariant is equivalent to conservation of angular momentum however ian proudman and w h reid showed that this invariant does not hold always since formula 19 is not in general zero at least in the initial period of the decay in 1967 philip saffman showed that

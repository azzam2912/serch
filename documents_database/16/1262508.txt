gordon in 1998 and used to describe and theorise about concurrent systems that include mobility here mobility means both computation carried out on mobile devices i e networks that have a dynamic topology and mobile computation i e executable code that is able to move around the network the ambient calculus provides a unified framework for modeling both kinds of mobility it is used to model interactions in such concurrent systems as the internet since its inception the ambient calculus has grown into a family of closely related ambient calculi the fundamental primitive of the ambient calculus is the ambient an ambient is informally defined as a bounded place in which computation can occur the notion of boundaries is considered key to representing mobility since a boundary defines a contained computational agent that can be moved in its entirety examples of ambients include the key properties of ambients within the ambient calculus are computation is represented as the crossing of boundaries i e the movement of ambients there are four basic operations or capabilities on ambients the ambient calculus provides a reduction semantics that formally defines what the results of these operations are communication within i e local to an

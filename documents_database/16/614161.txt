portal frame structures can be constructed using a variety of materials and methods these include steel reinforced concrete and laminated timber such as glulam the connections between the columns and the rafters are designed to be moment resistant i e they can carry bending forces they were first developed in the 1960s and have now become the most common form of enclosure for spans of 20 to 60 m because of these very strong and rigid joints some of the bending moment in the rafters is transferred to the columns this means that the size of the rafters can be reduced or the span can be increased for the same size rafters this makes portal frames a very efficient construction technique to use for wide span buildings portal frame construction is therefore typically seen in warehouses barns and other places where large open spaces are required at low cost and a pitched roof is acceptable generally portal frames are used for single story buildings but they can be used for low rise buildings with several floors where they can be economic if the floors do not span right across the building in these circumstances a skeleton frame with internal columns

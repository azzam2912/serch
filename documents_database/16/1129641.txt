in humans it is encoded by the stc1 gene this gene encodes a secreted homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and may have autocrine or paracrine functions the only known molecular function of human stanniocalcin 1 to date is a sumo e3 ubiquitin ligase activity in the sumoylation cycle however stc1 interacts with many proteins in the cytoplasm mitochondria endoplasmatic reticulum and in dot like fashion in the cell nucleus the n terminal region of stc1 is the function region which is responsible to establish the interaction with its partners including sumo1 low resolution studies shows that stc1 is an anti parallel homodimer in solution and the cysteine 202 is responsible for its dimerization all the 5 disulfide bonds of human stc1 are conserved and have the same profile of fish stc the gene contains a 5 utr rich in cag trinucleotide repeats the encoded protein contains 11 conserved cysteine residues and is phosphorylated by protein kinase c exclusively on its serine residues the protein may play a role in the regulation of renal and intestinal calcium and phosphate transport cell metabolism or cellular calcium phosphate homeostasis overexpression of human stanniocalcin 1 in mice produces

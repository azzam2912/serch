it was discovered by it may also have been discovered but not published by ernst witt in 1940 the leech lattice is the unique lattice in with the following list of properties the last condition is equivalent to the condition that unit balls centered at the points of do not overlap each is tangent to 196 560 neighbors and this is known to be the largest number of non overlapping 24 dimensional unit balls that can simultaneously touch a single unit ball compare with 6 in dimension 2 as the maximum number of pennies which can touch a central penny see kissing number this arrangement of 196 560 unit balls centred about another unit ball is so efficient that there is no room to move any of the balls this configuration together with its mirror image is the only 24 dimensional arrangement where 196 560 unit balls simultaneously touch another this property is also true in 1 2 and 8 dimensions with 2 6 and 240 unit balls respectively based on the integer lattice hexagonal tiling and e8 lattice respectively it has no root system and in fact is the first unimodular lattice with no roots vectors of norm less

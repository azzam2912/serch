it was one of the largest members of this group the holotype vf 1 consists of a very elongated cervical vertebra probably the fifth today the middle section is missing the original find was about long but had been sawed into three parts most of the fossil consists of an internal infilling or mould the thin bone walls are missing on most of the surface the find had not presented the whole vertebra a piece was absent from its posterior end as well frey and martill estimated the total length to have been using for comparison the relative position of the smallest shaft diameter of the fifth cervical vertebra of quetzalcoatlus from this again the total neck length was extrapolated at about from the relatively slender vertebra the length dimension was then selected to be compared to that of quetzalcoatlus estimated at long resulting in a ratio of 1 18 applying that ratio to the overall size frey and martill in 1998 concluded that the wingspan of arambourgiania had been compared with the of quetzalcoatlus and that arambourgiania was thus the largest pterosaur then known later estimates have been more moderate sometimes as low as seven metres in the early

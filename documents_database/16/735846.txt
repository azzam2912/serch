for windows vista the boot sector or uefi loads the windows boot manager a file named bootmgr on either the system or the boot partition accesses the boot configuration data store and uses the information to load the operating system then the bcd invokes the boot loader and in turn proceeds to initiate the windows kernel initialization at this point proceeds similarly to previous windows nt versions windows vista introduces a complete overhaul of the windows operating system loader architecture the earliest known reference to this revised architecture is included within powerpoint slides distributed by microsoft during the windows hardware engineering conference of 2004 when the operating system was codenamed longhorn this documentation mentions that the windows operating system loader would be undergoing a significant restructuring in order to support efi and to do some major overhaul of legacy code the new boot architecture completely replaces the ntldr architecture used in previous versions of windows nt most of the steps that follows the nt kernel being loaded including kernel initialization and user space initialization is kept the same as in earlier nt systems refactoring in winlogon resulted in gina being completely replaced by credential providers and graphical components in windows

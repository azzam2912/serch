jones comments that canter could have chosen a bizarre ending an apocalyptic one a happy or a sad one instead he goes for the crap ending option and you come away feeling cheated and used shame really i was willing to forgive the various failures in plot and style because i was quite getting into the neanderthals kirkus reviews states an effective blend of scientific fact and shamanistic fancy one that weaves a genuinely magic spell publishers weekly states canter s approach fails to do his premise or his characters particularly the appealing ember full justice entertainment weekly rated the book a c and states that ember from the sun s plucked straight from the pulp fantasies of edgar rice burroughs

planetary surfaces are found on solid objects of planetary mass including terrestrial planets including earth dwarf planets natural satellites planetesimals and many other small solar system bodies sssbs the study of planetary surfaces is a field of planetary geology known as surface geology but also a focus of a number of fields including planetary cartography topography geomorphology atmospheric sciences and astronomy land or ground is the term given to non liquid planetary surfaces the term landing is used to describe the collision of an object with a planetary surface and is usually at a velocity in which the object can remain intact and remain attached in differentiated bodies the surface is where the crust meets the planetary boundary layer anything below this is regarded as being sub surface or sub marine most bodies more massive than super earths including stars and gas giants as well as smaller gas dwarfs transition contiguously between phases including gas liquid and solid as such they are generally regarded as lacking surfaces planetary surfaces and surface life are of particular interest to humans as it the primary habitat of the species which has evolved to move over land and breathe air human space exploration and

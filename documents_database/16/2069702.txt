this material is used in the radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs that power voyager 1 voyager 2 galileo ulysses cassini and new horizons spacecraft sige thermoelectric material converts enough radiated heat into electrical power to fully meet the power demands of each spacecraft the properties of the material and the remaining components of the rtg contribute towards the efficiency of this thermoelectric conversion heavily doped semiconductors such as silicon germanium sige thermoelectric couples also called thermocouples or unicouples are used in space exploration sige alloys present good thermoelectric properties their performance in thermoelectric power production is characterized by high dimensionless figures of merit zt under high temperatures which has been shown to be near 2 in some nanostructured sige models sige alloy devices are mechanically rugged and can withstand severe shock and vibration due to its high tensile strength i e 7000 psi and low dislocation density sige material is malleable with standard metallurgical equipment and bonds easily to construct components sige alloy devices can operate under high temperatures i e 1300 c without degradation due to their electronic stability low thermal expansion coefficient and high oxidation resistance near the sun solar cell performance deteriorates from high incident particle flux and

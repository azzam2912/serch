to ensure via robustness ipc sponsored a round robin exercise that developed a time to failure calculator in integrated circuit design a via is a small opening in an insulating oxide layer that allows a conductive connection between different layers a via on an integrated circuit is often called a through chip via or through silicon via tsv through glass vias tgv have been studied by corning glass for semiconductor packaging due to the reduced electrical loss of glass versus silicon packaging a via connecting the lowest layer of metal to diffusion or poly is typically called a contact in printed circuit board design a via consists of two pads in corresponding positions on different layers of the board that are electrically connected by a hole through the board the hole is made conductive by electroplating or is lined with a tube or a rivet high density multilayer pcbs may have microvias blind vias are exposed only on one side of the board while buried vias connect internal layers without being exposed on either surface thermal vias carry heat away from power devices and are typically used in arrays of about a dozen a via consists of a via may

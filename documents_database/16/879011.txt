it is one of the main items of the spacecraft thermal design primarily intended to reduce heat loss by thermal radiation in its basic form it does not appreciably insulate against other thermal losses such as heat conduction or convection it is therefore commonly used on satellites and other applications in vacuum where conduction and convection are much less significant and radiation dominates mli gives many satellites and other space probes the appearance of being covered with gold foil the principle behind mli is radiation balance to see why it works start with a concrete example imagine a square meter of a surface in outer space held at a fixed temperature of 300 k with an emissivity of 1 facing away from the sun or other heat sources from the stefan boltzmann law this surface will radiate 460 w now imagine placing a thin but opaque layer 1 cm away from the plate also with an emissivity of 1 this new layer will cool until it is radiating 230 w from each side at which point everything is in balance the new layer receives 460 w from the original plate 230 w is radiated back to the original plate and

the development of the computer algebra systems in the second half of the 20th century is part of the discipline of computer algebra or symbolic computation which has spurred work in algorithms over mathematical objects such as polynomials computer algebra systems may be divided into two classes specialized and general purpose the specialized ones are devoted to a specific part of mathematics such as number theory group theory or teaching of elementary mathematics general purpose computer algebra systems aim to be useful to a user working in any scientific field that requires manipulation of mathematical expressions to be useful a general purpose computer algebra system must include various features such as the library must not only provide for the needs of the users but also the needs of the simplifier for example the computation of polynomial greatest common divisors is systematically used for the simplification of expressions involving fractions this large amount of required computer capabilities explains the small number of general purpose computer algebra systems the main ones are axiom maxima magma maple mathematica and sagemath computer algebra systems began to appear in the 1960s and evolved out of two quite different sources the requirements of theoretical physicists and

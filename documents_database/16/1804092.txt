of arm ltd and amd full details of astc were first presented publicly at the high performance graphics 2012 conference in a paper by olson et al entitled adaptive scalable texture compression astc was adopted as an official extension for both opengl and opengl es by the khronos group on 6 august 2012 both profiles ldr and full are supported on the latest mali versions including the mali t620 mali t720 mali t760 mali t820 t830 and mali t860 t880 nvidia s kepler and maxwell based tegra socs intel gpus in skylake and later processors on linux all gallium 3d drivers have a software fallback since 2018 so astc can be used on any amd radeon gpu the method of compression is an evolution of color cell compression with features including numerous closely spaced fractional bit rates multiple color formats support for high dynamic range hdr textures and real 3d texture support the stated primary design goal for astc is to enable content developers to have better control over the space quality tradeoff inherent in any lossy compression scheme with astc the ratio between adjacent bit rates is of the order of 25 making it less expensive to increase quality

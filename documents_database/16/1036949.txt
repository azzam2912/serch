it was the first type i toxin antitoxin pair to be identified through characterisation of a plasmid stabilising locus it is a type i system because the toxin is neutralised by a complementary rna rather than a partnered protein type ii toxin antitoxin the hok sok system involves three genes when e coli undergoes cell division the two daughter cells inherit the long lived hok toxin from the parent cell due to the short half life of the sok antitoxin daughter cells inherit only small amounts and it quickly degrades if a daughter cell has inherited the r1 plasmid it has inherited the sok gene and a strong promoter which brings about high levels of transcription so much so that in an r1 positive cell sok transcript exists in considerable molar excess over hok mrna sok rna then indirectly inhibits the translation of hok by inhibiting mok translation there is a complementary region where sok transcript binds hok mrna directly pictured but it does not occlude the shine dalgarno sequence instead sok rna regulates the translation of the mok open reading frame which nearly entirely overlaps that of hok it is this translation coupling which effectively allows sok rna to

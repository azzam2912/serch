by comparing observations lying closely on either side of the threshold it is possible to estimate the average treatment effect in environments in which randomization is unfeasible first applied by donald thistlethwaite and donald campbell to the evaluation of scholarship programs the rdd has become increasingly popular in recent years recent within study comparisons of randomised controlled trials rcts and rdds have empirically demonstrated the internal validity of the design the intuition behind the rdd is well illustrated using the evaluation of merit based scholarships the main problem with estimating the causal effect of such an intervention is the endogeneity of performance to the assignment of treatment e g scholarship award since high performing students are more likely to be awarded the merit scholarship and continue performing well at the same time comparing the outcomes of awardees and non recipients would lead to an upward bias of the estimates even if the scholarship did not improve grades at all awardees would have performed better than non recipients simply because scholarships were given to students who were performing well ex ante despite the absence of an experimental design a rdd can exploit exogenous characteristics of the intervention to elicit causal effects

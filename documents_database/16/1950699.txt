the genus and species is very easily identified by whorls of small plates surrounding the base of the primary shell wall no other shoreline barnacle species in the southern hemisphere has that feature this species is considered to be a relic as these plates are found only in primitive living lineages of acorn barnacles or in older fossil species the fact that this is an intertidal species is unusual because living primitive relic species are often found in more isolated habitats such as deep ocean basins and abyssal hydrothermal vents catomerus is characterized by eight primary shell wall plates with the rostrolatus entering the sheath a membraneous basis and up to eight whorls of basal imbricating plates the imbricating plates are strongly carinate medially and are reduced in height extending only partly up the shell wall the scutum has a well defined lateral depressor muscle depression the opercular plate and soft part morphology were re described in detail by poltarukha 2006 a full synonymy of c polymerus as at 1976 is provided by newman ross 197640 unlike all other known balanomorpha catomerus has both ovigerous frenae and ovigerous branchiae this is a plesiomorphic condition as ovigerous frenae are a characteristic

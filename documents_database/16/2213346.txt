the oil field is located approximately 64 km offshore of southeastern australia the total area of this field is 26 9 km and is composed of 10 mappable units during the late jurassic a rift complex forms between the australian plate tasman fold belt and the antarctic plate this rifting continues through the early cretaceous and in the middle cretaceous begins to assist in the separation of gondwana in is what now southern australia during this same time ocean crust is created to the west of tasmania and the separation of the australian plate from new zealand the antarctic plate and the campbell plateau occurs during the late cretaceous more extension occurs in this region which creates syn rift troughs this extension forms the central depression which is an integral part of the petroleum system and is the location of nearly all of the oil gas fields in the gippsland basin also during the late cretaceous volcanism occurred due to the tasman sea rifting from the eocene to the middle miocene a compressional tectonic period begins and forms a series of anticlines as well as nearly all of the structural features present today the strzelecki group is a geologic group

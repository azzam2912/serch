the connectors mechanically couple and align the cores of fibers so light can pass better connectors lose very little light due to reflection or misalignment of the fibers in all about 100 different types of fiber optic connectors have been introduced to the market optical fiber connectors are used to join optical fibers where a connect disconnect capability is required due to the polishing and tuning procedures that may be incorporated into optical connector manufacturing connectors are often assembled onto optical fiber in a supplier s manufacturing facility however the assembly and polishing operations involved can be performed in the field for example to terminate long runs at a patch panel optical fiber connectors are used in telephone exchanges for customer premises wiring and in outside plant applications to connect equipment and cables or to cross connect cables most optical fiber connectors are spring loaded so the fiber faces are pressed together when the connectors are mated the resulting glass to glass or plastic to plastic contact eliminates signal losses that would be caused by an air gap between the joined fibers performance of optical fiber connectors can be quantified by insertion loss and return loss measurements of these parameters

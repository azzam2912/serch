it was the first discovered binary compound of a noble gas it is produced by the chemical reaction of xenon with fluorine according to the chemical equation this reaction is exothermic releasing an energy of 251 kj mol xenon tetrafluoride is a colorless crystalline substance its structure was determined by both nmr spectroscopy and x ray crystallography in 1963 the structure is square planar as has been confirmed by neutron diffraction studies according to vsepr theory in addition to four fluoride ligands the xenon center has two lone pairs of electrons these lone pairs are mutually trans xenon tetrafluoride sublimes at a temperature of 115 7 c 240 26 f xenon tetrafluoride is produced by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1 5 ratio in a nickel container to 400 c some xenon hexafluoride is also produced and this production is increased with an increased fluorine concentration in the input mixture the nickel is not a catalyst for this reaction nickel containers are used because they react with fluorine to form a protective non peeling layer of nickel fluoride on their interior surfaces xenon tetrafluoride hydrolyzes at low temperatures to form elemental xenon oxygen hydrofluoric acid and

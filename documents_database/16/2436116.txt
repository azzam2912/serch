although synthetic it is related structurally to natural alkaloidsparteine it is a white crystalline solid it has been widely investigated as a chelating agent many derivatives are known bispidine has a bicyclic scaffold consisting of two condensed piperidines the unsubstituted bispidine backbone can assume three conformations a chair chair boat chair and a boat boat in the gas phase the chair chair conformation predominates a convenient route to synthesize the bispidine molecule involves a pent 1 en 3 one and a prop 2 en 1 amine leading to a bis carbethoxyethyl allylamine which converts in 1 allylpiperidin 4 one by acid hydrolysis and decarboxylation then a mannich reaction occurs in particular a condensation of a 4 piperidone derivative with paraformaldehyde and allylamine in presence of acetic acid forms n n diallylbispidin 9 one this latter results in the final bispidine after treatment with ethyl chloroformate in the presence of nai followed by alkaline hydrolysis the reaction with formaldehyde gives the diazaadamantane the bispidine unit can be chemically functionalized in several positions of its rigid bicyclic scaffold leading to a large number of bispidine type ligands the first bispidine based ligands dates back to 1930 when carl mannich reported the synthesis

the tire is a hoop of steel that is fitted around the steel wheel centre the tire is machined with a shoulder on its outer face to locate it on the wheel centre and a groove on the inside diameter of the flange face the inside diameter of the tire is machined to be slightly less than the diameter of the wheel centre on which it is mounted to give an interference fit the tire is fitted by heating to a controlled temperature avoiding overheating this causes the tire to expand the wheel centre usually already mounted on the axle is lowered into the tire which is flange side up the tire cools and the retaining ring a shaped steel bar rolled into a hoop is fitted into the groove hydraulically operated rolls swage the groove down on to the retaining ring the tire is primarily held in place by its interference fit the shoulder on the outside and the retaining ring also keep the tire in place if the interference fit is lost this is most often due to severe drag braking down a gradient or due to an error in the machining removal of a worn tire is

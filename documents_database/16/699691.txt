it is one of a number of binary format handlers in the kernel that are involved in preparing a user space program to run the executable formats are registered through the special purpose file system codice 1 file system interface usually mounted under part of proc this is either done directly by sending special sequences to the codice 2 procfs file or using a wrapper like debian based distributions binfmt support package or systemd s codice 3 the codice 2 file contains lines which define executable types to be handled each line is of the form codice 5 each format has a corresponding file entry in the codice 33 directory which can be read to get information about a given file format binfmt misc allows java programs to be passed directly to the java virtual machine another common usage is to execute pe executables compiled for ms dos or microsoft windows through wine for example the following line will run dos and windows exe files identified by the mz type code using wine codice 34 to run exe net files with mono codice 35 binfmt misc can also be combined with qemu to execute programs for other processor architectures as

the term itself is derived via latin from greek meaning additional manner of expression the act of paraphrasing is also called paraphrasis a paraphrase typically explains or clarifies the text that is being paraphrased for example the signal was red might be paraphrased as the train was not allowed to pass because the signal was red a paraphrase is usually introduced with verbum dicendi a declaratory expression to signal the transition to the paraphrase for example in the signal was red that is the train was not allowed to proceed the that is signals the paraphrase that follows a paraphrase does not need to accompany a direct quotation the paraphrase typically serves to put the source s statement into perspective or to clarify the context in which it appeared a paraphrase is typically more detailed than a summary one should add the source at the end of the sentence for example when the light was red trains could not go wikipedia paraphrase may attempt to preserve the essential meaning of the material being paraphrased thus the intentional or otherwise reinterpretation of a source to infer a meaning that is not explicitly evident in the source itself qualifies as original research

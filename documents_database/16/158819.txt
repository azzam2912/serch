the problem of computing n th residue classes is believed to be computationally difficult the decisional composite residuosity assumption is the intractability hypothesis upon which this cryptosystem is based the scheme is an additive homomorphic cryptosystem this means that given only the public key and the encryption of formula 1 and formula 2 one can compute the encryption of formula 3 the scheme works as follows if using p q of equivalent length a simpler variant of the above key generation steps would be to set formula 23 and formula 24 where formula 25 as the original paper points out decryption is essentially one exponentiation modulo formula 36 a notable feature of the paillier cryptosystem is its homomorphic properties along with its non deterministic encryption see electronic voting in applications for usage as the encryption function is additively homomorphic the following identities can be described however given the paillier encryptions of two messages there is no known way to compute an encryption of the product of these messages without knowing the private key paillier cryptosystem exploits the fact that certain discrete logarithms can be computed easily for example by binomial theorem this indicates that therefore if then thus the original

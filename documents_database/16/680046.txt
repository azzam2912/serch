this compound is part of the group of materials called the transition metal dichalcogenides it occurs naturally as the rare mineral tungstenite this material is a component of certain catalysts used for hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrification ws adopts a layered structure similar or isotypic with mos instead with w atoms situated in trigonal prismatic coordination sphere in place of mo atoms owing to this layered structure ws forms inorganic nanotubes which were discovered after heating a thin sample of ws in 1992 bulk ws forms dark gray hexagonal crystals with a layered structure like the closely related mos it exhibits properties of a dry lubricant although it has long been thought that ws is relatively stable in ambient recent reports on the ambient air oxidation of monolayer ws have found this to not be the case in the monolayer form ws is converted rather rapidly over the course of days in ambient light and atmosphere as observed with a light microscope to tungsten oxide via a photooxidation reaction involving visible wavelengths of light readily absorbed by ws 1 88 ev or the edge of the absorption spectrum it is thought that this oxidation occurs via a dexter electron transfer or f

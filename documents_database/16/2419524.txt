she develops materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion nazar demonstrated that interwoven composites could be used to improve the energy density of lithium sulphur batteries she was awarded the 2019 chemical institute of canada medal nazar studied chemistry at the university of british columbia where she earned a bachelor s degree in 1978 she was inspired to study chemistry after being inspired by her first year professor her father had trained as a scientist and ran his own jewellery making business nazar joined the university of toronto for her graduate studies and completed a phd under the supervision of geoffrey ozin in 1984 she was a postdoctoral researcher at exxon research and engineering company she joined the university of waterloo in the late 1980s when she became interested in electrochemistry and inorganic chemistry nazar works in materials chemistry at the university of waterloo where she designs energy storage devices and electrochemical systems her research group create new materials and nanostructures for lithium sulfur batteries including interwoven composites she develops structural probes to understand how the morphology of materials that are capable of charge ionic redox processes impact their functions these techniques include nuclear magnetic resonance nmr electrochemistry ac impedance

it is the smallest class in the ac hierarchy and consists of all families of circuits of depth o 1 and polynomial size with unlimited fanin and gates and or gates we allow not gates only at the inputs it thus contains nc which has only bounded fanin and and or gates integer addition and subtraction are computable in ac but multiplication is not at least not under the usual binary or base 10 representations of integers from a descriptive complexity viewpoint dlogtime uniform ac is equal to the descriptive class fo bit of all languages describable in first order logic with the addition of the bit predicate or alternatively by fo or by turing machine in the logarithmic hierarchy in 1984 furst saxe and sipser showed that calculating the parity of an input cannot be decided by any ac circuits even with non uniformity it follows that ac is not equal to nc because a family of circuits in the latter class can compute parity more precise bounds follow from switching lemma using them it has been shown that there is an oracle separation between the polynomial hierarchy and pspace

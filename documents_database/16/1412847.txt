the carbon dioxide released from the baking of bricks or smelting of iron these emissions can also be considered to be upfront carbon emissions or uce embodied carbon refers to the carbon footprint associated with building materials from cradle to grave and can be quantified as a part of environmental impact using life cycle assessment lca in the carbon profiling model these emissions are measured as embodied carbon efficiency ece measured as kg of co m year as of 2018 embodied carbon is responsible 11 of global ghg emissions and 28 of global building sector emissions embodied carbon will be responsible for almost half of total new construction emissions between now and 2050 zero carbon architecture similar to zero energy building incorporates design techniques that maximize embodied carbon steve webb co founder of webb yates engineers says we ve known for a long time that aluminium steel concrete and ceramics have very high embodied energy high carbon frames should be taxed like cigarettes there should be a presumption in favour of timber and stone occupational carbon emissions relate to the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere from the direct use of energy to run the building e g

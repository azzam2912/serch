species within the family were formerly referred to the heterobasidiomycetes or jelly fungi since many have gelatinous basidiocarps fruit bodies that produce spores on septate basidia around 100 species are known worldwide all are believed to be saprotrophic most growing on dead wood fruit bodies of several auricularia species are cultivated for food on a commercial scale especially in china the family was established in 1897 by german mycologist gustav lindau to accommodate species of fungi having gymnocarpous basidiocarps with the hymenium exposed and auricularioid basidia more or less cylindrical basidia with lateral septa it included not only the genus auricularia but also platygloea jola saccoblastia and stypinella helicobasidium in 1922 british mycologist carleton rea recognized the family as containing the genera auricularia eocronartium helicobasidium platygloea and stilbum both lindau and rea placed the family within the auriculariales but some subsequent authors placed it within the tremellales a radical revision was undertaken in 1984 when american mycologist robert joseph bandoni used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the ultrastructure of the septal pore apparatus in the auriculariales this revealed that species of fungi with auricularioid basidia were not necessarily closely related and that auricularia had more in common with exidia and

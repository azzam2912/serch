the two step subgroup test is a similar theorem which requires the subset to be closed under the operation and taking of inverses let formula 1 be a group and let formula 2 be a nonempty subset of formula 3 if for all formula 4 and formula 5 in formula 2 formula 7 is in formula 2 then formula 2 is a subgroup of formula 3 let g be a group let h be a nonempty subset of g and assume that for all a and b in h ab is in h to prove that h is a subgroup of g we must show that h is associative has an identity has an inverse for every element and is closed under the operation so thus h is a subgroup of g a corollary of this theorem is the two step subgroup test which states that a nonempty subset of a group is itself a group if the subset is closed under the operation as well as under the taking of inverses

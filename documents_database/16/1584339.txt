in 1897 the ohio historical society sponsored an excavation of the mound under the leadership of clarence loveberry who oversaw the digging of a large tunnel into the mound s side loveberry s investigation yielded artifacts of the adena culture and evidence of rotten logs on the floor of the mound but in publishing the results of his excavation he observed that neither a tomb nor any isolated burials were discovered within the mound since 1897 other adena mounds have been excavated and shown to have wooden tombs in off center locations presumably to complicate the efforts of those who would loot the mounds accordingly it is possible that the brown mound likewise has an off center tomb despite the loveberry excavation the brown mound remains one of the most important adena mounds in ohio it is one of the largest known adena mounds and it has been damaged less than almost every other large adena mound accordingly it is a highly valuable archaeological site in recognition of its archaeological value the austin brown mound was listed on the national register of historic places in 1974 it is one of eighteen archaeological sites on the register in ross county among

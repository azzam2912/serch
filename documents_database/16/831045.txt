as derived below and depend only on the motions and positions of stars in the solar neighborhood as of 2018 the most accurate values of these constants are formula 1 15 3 0 4 km s kpc formula 2 11 9 0 4 km s kpc from the oort constants it is possible to determine the orbital properties of the sun such as the orbital velocity and period and infer local properties of the galactic disk such as the mass density and how the rotational velocity changes as a function of radius from the galactic center by the 1920s a large fraction of the astronomical community had recognized that some of the diffuse cloud like objects or nebulae seen in the night sky were collections of stars located beyond our own local collection of star clusters these galaxies had diverse morphologies ranging from ellipsoids to disks the concentrated band of starlight that is the visible signature of the milky way was indicative of a disk structure for our galaxy however our location within our galaxy made structural determinations from observations difficult classical mechanics predicted that a collection of stars could be supported against gravitational collapse by either random velocities of

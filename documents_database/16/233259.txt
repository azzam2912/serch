it is one of three small moons known as the alkyonides that lie between the orbits of the larger mimas and enceladus it is also designated as 33 pallene was discovered by the cassini imaging team in 2004 during the cassini huygens mission it was given the temporary designation in 2005 the name pallene was provisionally approved by the iau division iii working group for planetary system nomenclature and was ratified at the iau general assembly in 2006 the name refers to pallene one of the alkyonides the seven beautiful daughters of the giant alkyoneus after the discovery in 2004 it was realized that pallene had been first photographed on august 23 1981 by the space probe it had appeared in a single photograph and had been provisionally named and estimated to orbit 200 000 km from saturn because it had not been visible in other images it had not been possible to compute its orbit at the time but recent comparisons have shown it to match pallene s orbit pallene is visibly affected by a perturbing mean longitude resonance with the much larger enceladus although this effect is not as large as mimas s perturbations on methone the perturbations

the barrage is opened during a rising high tide to allow the sea water in then shut as the tide turns the water stored above the barrage is then forced through an artificial channel to provide water features the nature of artificial whitewater courses necessitates the need for a drop in the river and enough water flow to provide hydraulics when this isn t possible often in flat low lying areas electric pumps are used to lift and re circulate the water to the top of the course the shapes of these courses are commonly circular or u shaped pumped courses are extremely expensive to run typically 1 2 megawatts of electrical power are needed to pump 15 cubic metres per second of water down a course with a 5 meter drop in height

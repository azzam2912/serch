the boeing 747 400 combi less than six months old at the time flew through a thick cloud of volcanic ash from mount redoubt which had erupted the day before all four engines failed leaving only critical systems on backup electrical power one report assigns the engine shutdown to the turning of the ash into a glass coating inside the engines that fooled the engine temperature sensors and led to an auto shutdown of all four engines when all four main generators shut off due to the failure of all the engines a momentary power interruption occurs when the flight instruments transfer to standby power standby power on the 747 400 is provided by two batteries and inverters the captain performed the engine restart procedure which failed on the first few attempts and repeated it until restart was achieved on some of the attempts as one or more but not all engines started to operate the main generator switched back on this switching on and off caused repeated power transfer interruptions to the flight instruments the temporary blanking of the instruments gave the appearance that standby power had failed these power transfers were later verified from the flight data recorder

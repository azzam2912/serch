this pamphlet helped to establish darwin s reputation amongst renowned scientific publications however upon learning of this pamphlet s publication darwin was a good deal horrified at henslow making public what had been written without care or accuracy darwin came to know henslow through his attendance at his scientific talks at cambridge university he had heard of henslow through his brother erasmus who greatly revered him as a man of scientific brilliance and integrity although he was actually studying theology inspired by henslow he soon became a visitor to henslow s house and subsequently met the scientific fraternity henslow obviously rated darwin highly although at the time darwin had few formal credentials this is evident by henslow s consideration that darwin should accompany robert fitzroy as a companion on the voyage of the beagle henslow had initially been asked himself he turned this down dissuaded by his wife his brother in law leonard jenyns then accepted the post but changed his mind at the last moment it was at this point that henslow sent fitzroy a letter indicating that he knew someone who would perfectly fit the bill and then wrote darwin a letter who was on a field trip

in advertising materials bethlehem steel claimed the process was more effective than hot dip galvanization the most common means of using zinc to protect steel the process is similar to that of electrolytic sulfuric acid zinc plating with few differences from bethanization the electrolytic sulfuric acid zinc plating process uses zinc anodes while bethanization uses inert mild steel anodes instead the electrolytes used are manufactured by using zinc oxide dross and dissolving it in sulfuric acid in 1936 bethlehem steel spent 30 million 1936 dollars to build a factory in johnstown pennsylvania capable of creating large amounts of bethanized wire uniformity the zinc coating surrounding the wire is tightly bonded to the steel and uniformly distributed weak spots on the wire will not be found ductility bethanizing steel with 99 9 percent zinc bonds them together tightly without any room for layers of zinc iron alloy zinc iron alloy is a brittle substance that induces cracking leaving steel at critical points exposed the zinc coating is more ductile and less brittle resistance to corrosion and fatigue bethanized wire is claimed to have protection against corrosion and corrosion fatigue equal to that of hot galvanized steel wire strength wire that has

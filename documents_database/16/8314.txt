groups fields graphs universes of set theory from the perspective of mathematical logic the objects of study are models of theories in a formal language a set of sentences in a formal language is one of the components that form a theory a model of a theory is a structure e g an interpretation that satisfies the sentences of that theory model theory recognizes and is intimately concerned with a duality it examines semantical elements meaning and truth by means of syntactical elements formulas and proofs of a corresponding language in a summary definition dating from 1973 model theory developed rapidly during the 1990s and a more modern definition is provided by wilfrid hodges 1997 other nearby areas of mathematics include combinatorics number theory arithmetic dynamics analytic functions and non standard analysis in a similar way to proof theory model theory is situated in an area of interdisciplinarity among mathematics philosophy and computer science the most prominent professional organization in the field of model theory is the association for symbolic logic this article focuses on finitary first order model theory of infinite structures finite model theory which concentrates on finite structures diverges significantly from the study of infinite structures in

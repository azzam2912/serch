when water insoluble gases such as anesthetic agent no nitrous oxide are breathed in large quantities they can be dissolved in body fluids rapidly this leads to a temporary increase in both the concentrations and partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the alveolus the effect is named for bernard raymond fink 1914 2000 whose 1955 paper first explained it when a patient is recovering from no anaesthesia large quantities of this gas cross from the blood into the alveolus down its concentration gradient and so for a short period of time the o and co in the alveolus are diluted by this gas a sufficiently large decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen leads to hypoxia the decrease in co pressure can also potentiate this effect when ventilation is suppressed leading to potential hypoxaemia nonetheless this effect only lasts a couple of minutes and hypoxia can be avoided by increasing the fractional inspired oxygen concentration when recovering from no anaesthesia it is for this reason that entonox a 50 50 combination of nitrous oxide and oxygen is suitable for use by para medical staff such as ambulance officers it provides sufficient nitrous oxide for pain relief with sufficient

dickerson 508 u s 366 1993 was a decision by the supreme court of the united states the court unanimously held that when a police officer who is conducting a lawful patdown search for weapons feels something that plainly is contraband the object may be seized even though it is not a weapon by a 6 to 3 vote however the court held that the officer in this case had gone beyond the limits of a lawful patdown search before he could determine that the object was contraband making the search and the subsequent seizure unlawful under the fourth amendment associate justice byron white gave the opinion of the court the defendant timothy dickerson was in a known drug area an officer investigated by ordering a patdown of dickerson to search for any weapons during that search he felt a small lump in his coat without further evidence he reached in and grabbed the lump and found it was cocaine in lower court dickerson moved that the cocaine be suppressed as evidence because the officer violated his right against unreasonable search and seizure under the fourth amendment to the united states constitution but the trial court overruled this objection ruling

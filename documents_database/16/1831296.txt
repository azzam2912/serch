the album was released on august 12 2014 by rhymesayers entertainment the album features guest appearances from vince staples aloe blacc catero gangrene sick jacken krondon fashawn rapsody domo genesis vinnie paz and action bronson in a june 2012 interview with allhiphop evidence spoke about the album saying directors of photography is the next dilated peoples album and i m excited about it nervous about it everything in between we never broke up or anything like that we ve been supporting each other on our solo missions most people who know the details about dilated know that we re solo artists who came together to make something bigger and this is just a return to genesis so to speak he continued sometimes we ve got to be conscious of each other when we re in a group because not all of our views reflect each others visions all the time so it s been fun to just do what we wanted to do in these off years solo expressing ourselves i think our next dilated record could really be a great sound because of this freedom we ve had i m looking forward to it in an october 2013 interview

these methods were developed around 1900 by the german mathematicians carl runge and wilhelm kutta the most widely known member of the runge kutta family is generally referred to as rk4 the classic runge kutta method or simply as the runge kutta method let an initial value problem be specified as follows here formula 2 is an unknown function scalar or vector of time formula 3 which we would like to approximate we are told that formula 4 the rate at which formula 2 changes is a function of formula 3 and of formula 2 itself at the initial time formula 8 the corresponding formula 2 value is formula 10 the function formula 11 and the initial conditions formula 8 formula 10 are given now pick a step size h 0 and define for n 0 1 2 3 using here formula 16 is the rk4 approximation of formula 17 and the next value formula 16 is determined by the present value formula 19 plus the weighted average of four increments where each increment is the product of the size of the interval h and an estimated slope specified by function f on the right hand side of the differential

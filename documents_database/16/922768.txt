in this type of reactor a fluid gas or liquid is passed through a solid granular material usually a catalyst possibly shaped as tiny spheres at high enough velocities to suspend the solid and cause it to behave as though it were a fluid this process known as fluidization imparts many important advantages to an fbr as a result fbrs are used for many industrial applications the solid substrate the catalytic material upon which chemical species react material in the fluidized bed reactor is typically supported by a porous plate known as a distributor the fluid is then forced through the distributor up through the solid material at lower fluid velocities the solids remain in place as the fluid passes through the voids in the material this is known as a packed bed reactor as the fluid velocity is increased the reactor will reach a stage where the force of the fluid on the solids is enough to balance the weight of the solid material this stage is known as incipient fluidization and occurs at this minimum fluidization velocity once this minimum velocity is surpassed the contents of the reactor bed begin to expand and swirl around much like an

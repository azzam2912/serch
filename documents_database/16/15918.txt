time sharing systems are multi user systems most batch processing systems for mainframe computers may also be considered multi user to avoid leaving the cpu idle while it waits for i o operations to complete however the term multitasking is more common in this context an example is a unix server where multiple remote users have access such as via a serial port or secure shell to the unix shell prompt at the same time another example uses multiple x window sessions spread across multiple terminals powered by a single machine this is an example of the use of thin client similar functions were also available under mp m concurrent dos multiuser dos and flexos some multi user operating systems such as windows versions from the windows nt family support simultaneous access by multiple users for example via remote desktop connection as well as the ability for a user to disconnect from a local session while leaving processes running doing work on their behalf while another user logs into and uses the system the operating system provides isolation of each user s processes from other users while enabling them to execute concurrently management systems are implicitly designed to be used

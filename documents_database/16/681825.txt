it plays a critical role in the brain s interpretation of equilibrium the membrane serves to determine if the body or the head is tilted in addition to the linear acceleration of the body the linear acceleration could be in the horizontal direction as in a moving car or vertical acceleration such as that felt when an elevator moves up or down the otolithic membrane is part of the otolith organs in the vestibular system the otolith organs include the utricle and the saccule the otolith organs are beds of sensory cells in the inner ear specifically small patches of hair cells overlying the hair cells and their hair bundles is a gelatinous layer and above that layer is the otolithic membrane the utricle serves to measure horizontal accelerations and the saccule responds to vertical accelerations the reason for this difference is the orientation of the macula in the two organs the utricular macula lie horizontal in the utricle while the saccular macula lies vertical in the saccule every hair cell in these sensory beds consist of 40 70 stereocilia and a kinocilium the sterocilia and kinocilium are embedded in the otolithic membrane and are essential in the function of

the input sequence is usually created by emulating the game and using tools such as slow motion frame by frame advance memory watch and save states to create an extremely precise series of inputs the idea is not to make gameplay easier for players but rather to produce a demonstration of gameplay that would be practically impossible for a human player tool assisted speedruns often feature gameplay that would otherwise be impossible or prohibitively difficult to perform in real time producers of tool assisted speedruns do not compete with unassisted speedrunners of video games on the contrary collaborative efforts between the two groups often take place the opposite of tas is rta which refers to regular speedruns performed by humans rta stands for real time attack a portmanteau of real time and time attack the term was coined during the early days of doom speedrunning during which the first of these runs were made although they were sometimes also referred to as built demos when andy aurican kempling released a modified version of the doom source code that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions it was possible for the first players to start

unlike those animals which can generate their own heat internally endothermic insects must rely on external sources to provide their heat ectothermic thus insects persisting in winter weather must tolerate freezing or rely on other mechanisms to avoid freezing loss of enzymatic function and eventual freezing due to low temperatures daily threatens the livelihood of these organisms during winter not surprisingly insects have evolved a number of strategies to deal with the rigors of winter temperatures in places where they would otherwise not survive two broad strategies for winter survival have evolved within insecta as solutions to their inability to generate significant heat metabolically migration is a complete avoidance of the temperatures that pose a threat an alternative to migration is weathering the cold temperatures present in its normal habitat this cold hardiness is separated into two categories freeze avoidance and freeze tolerance see insect migration migration of insects differs from migration of birds bird migration is a two way round trip movement of each individual whereas this is not usually the case with insects as a consequence of the typically short lifespan of insects adult insects who have completed one leg of the trip may be replaced by a

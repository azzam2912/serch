such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes there are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them historically mills were powered by hand e g via a hand crank working animal e g horse mill wind windmill or water watermill today they are usually powered by electricity the grinding of solid materials occurs through mechanical forces that break up the structure by overcoming the interior bonding forces after the grinding the state of the solid is changed the grain size the grain size disposition and the grain shape milling also refers to the process of breaking down separating sizing or classifying aggregate material for instance rock crushing or grinding to produce uniform aggregate size for construction purposes or separation of rock soil or aggregate material for the purposes of structural fill or land reclamation activities aggregate milling processes are also used to remove or separate contamination or moisture from aggregate or soil and to produce dry fills prior to transport or structural filling grinding may serve the following purposes in engineering in spite of a great number of studies in the field of fracture schemes there is no formula known which connects

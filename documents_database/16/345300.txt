the otherwise unalterable area assuming no overscan of the display raster bar style effects were common on the atari 2600 and atari 8 bit family because they could be easily displayed using the hardware of those systems and then later in demos for the commodore 64 amiga atari st zx spectrum and amstrad cpc the term copperbar comes from a graphics coprocessor on the amiga home computer referred to as the copper a shortened form of coprocessor it can be programmed to change the display colors per scan line without requiring the cpu except to update the position of the bars once per frame such computers had limited graphical abilities and usually a fixed number of colours or inks e g a maximum of 16 on the amstrad cpc that could be displayed at any one time which were often assigned from a colour look up table clut which maps each displayable colour to one of a larger selection of possible colours palette of which the hardware was capable e g 27 on the cpc raster bars and similar effects e g having a hud that uses a different set of colours than does the playing area are achieved by

this ratio also known as the pure perfect fifth is chosen because it is one of the most consonant and easiest to tune by ear and because of importance attributed to the integer 3 as novalis put it the musical proportions seem to me to be particularly correct natural proportions alternatively it can be described as the tuning of the syntonic temperament in which the generator is the ratio 3 2 i e the untempered perfect fifth which is 702 cents wide the system had been mainly attributed to pythagoras sixth century bc by modern authors of music theory while ptolemy and later boethius ascribed the division of the tetrachord by only two intervals called semitonium tonus tonus in latin 256 243 9 8 9 8 to eratosthenes the so called pythagorean tuning was used by musicians up to the beginning of the 16th century the pythagorean system would appear to be ideal because of the purity of the fifths but some consider other intervals particularly the major third to be so badly out of tune that major chords may be considered a dissonance the pythagorean scale is any scale which can be constructed from only pure perfect fifths 3

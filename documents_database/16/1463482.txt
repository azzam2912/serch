hpa is a systematic technique for reducing hydrogen consumption and hydrogen generation through integration of hydrogen using activities or processes in the petrochemical industry petroleum refineries hydrogen distribution networks and hydrogen purification a mass analysis is done by representing the purity and flowrate for each stream from the hydrogen consumers sinks such as hydrotreaters hydrocrackers isomerization units and lubricant plants and the hydrogen producers sources such as hydrogen plants and naphtha reformers streams from hydrogen purifiers membrane reactors pressure swing adsorption and continuous distillation and off gas streams from low or high pressure separators the source demand diagram shows bottlenecks surplus or shortages the hydrogen pinch is the purity at which the hydrogen network has neither hydrogen surplus nor deficit after the analysis refopt from the centre for process integration at the university of manchester is used as a tool for process integration with which the process is optimized the methodology was also developed into commercial software by companies such as linnhoff march and aspentech the aspen product incorporated the work of nick hallale formerly a lecturer at university of manchester and was the first method to consider multiple components rather than a pseudo binary mixture of hydrogen and methane

this is because the reed sternberg cell rsc variants popcorn cells that characterize this form of the disease invariably express b lymphocyte markers such as cd20 thus making nlphl an unusual form of hodgkin s lymphoma and that unlike classic hl nlphl may progress to diffuse large b cell lymphoma there are small but clear differences in prognosis between the various forms lymphocyte predominant hl is an uncommon subtype composed of vague nodules of numerous reactive lymphocytes admixed with large popcorn shaped rsc unlike classic rsc the non classic popcorn shaped rs cells of nlphl are cd15 and cd30 negative while positive for the b cell marker cd20 the anti cd20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been used in lymphocyte predominant hodgkin s lymphoma with encouraging results bcl6 gene rearrangements have been frequently observed the characteristics of nlphl differ from classical hodgkin lymphoma chl lymphocyte predominant lp popcorn cells are present embedded in nodules consisting of b cells and other reactive cells mainly reactive t cells reed sternberg and hodgkin rsh cells are rarely seen and immunohistochemistry shows a different pattern on the malignant cells rsh cells typically express cd15 and cd30 whereas lp cells lack expression of these markers but

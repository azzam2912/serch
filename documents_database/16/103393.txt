the causes of water uptake are photosynthesis and transpiration the rate of transpiration can be estimated in two ways 1 indirectly by measuring the distance the water level drops in the graduated tube over a measured length of time it is assumed that this is due to the cutting taking in water which in turn is necessary to replace an equal volume of water lost by transpiration 2 directly by measuring the reduction in mass of the potometer over a period of time here it is assumed that any loss in mass is due to transpiration there are two main types of potometers the bubble potometer as detailed below and the mass potometer the mass potometer consists of a plant with its root submerged in a beaker this beaker is then placed on a digital balance readings can be made to determine the amount of water lost by the plant the limitations in using the potometer introducing the air bubbles is not very easy the twig may not remain for a long time any change in the outside air temperature may affect the position of the air bubble on the capillary tube potometer do not measure the lost water during

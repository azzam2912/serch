a perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely without an energy source this kind of machine is impossible as it would violate the first or second law of thermodynamics these laws of thermodynamics apply regardless of the size of the system for example the motions and rotations of celestial bodies such as planets may appear perpetual but are actually subject to many processes that slowly dissipate their kinetic energy such as solar wind interstellar medium resistance gravitational radiation and thermal radiation so they will not keep moving forever thus machines that extract energy from finite sources will not operate indefinitely because they are driven by the energy stored in the source which will eventually be exhausted a common example is devices powered by ocean currents whose energy is ultimately derived from the sun which itself will eventually burn out machines powered by more obscure sources have been proposed but are subject to the same inescapable laws and will eventually wind down in 2017 new states of matter time crystals were discovered in which on a microscopic scale the component atoms are in continual repetitive motion thus satisfying the literal definition of perpetual motion however these

this tetrahedral species is isoelectronic with tetrafluoroberyllate tetrafluoromethane cf and tetrafluoroammonium and is valence isoelectronic with many stable and important species including the perchlorate anion which is used in similar ways in the laboratory it arises by the reaction of fluoride salts with the lewis acid bf treatment of tetrafluoroboric acid with base or by treatment of boric acid with hydrofluoric acid the popularization of has led to decreased use of in the laboratory as a weakly coordinating anion with organic compounds especially amine derivatives forms potentially explosive derivatives disadvantages to include its slight sensitivity to hydrolysis and decomposition via loss of a fluoride ligand whereas does not suffer from these problems safety considerations however overshadow this inconvenience with a formula weight of 86 8 bf is also conveniently the smallest weakly coordinating anion from the point of view of equivalent weight often making it the anion of choice for preparing cationic reagents or catalysts for use in synthesis in the absence of other substantial differences in chemical or physical factors the anion is less nucleophilic and basic and therefore more weakly coordinating than nitrates halides or even triflates thus when using salts of one can usually assume that the

every wavelength of visible light is perceived as a spectral color in a continuous spectrum the colors of sufficiently close wavelengths are indistinguishable for the human eye the spectrum is often divided into named colors though any division is somewhat arbitrary the spectrum is continuous traditional colors in english include red orange yellow green blue and violet in some other languages the ranges corresponding to color names do not necessarily agree with those in english the division used by isaac newton in his color wheel was red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet a mnemonic for this order is roy g biv less commonly vibgyor is also used for the reverse order in modern divisions of the spectrum indigo is often omitted one needs at least trichromatic color vision for there to be a distinction between spectral and non spectral colours trichromacy gives a possibility to perceive both hue and saturation in the chroma in color models capable of representing spectral colors such as cieluv a spectral color has the maximal saturation in color spaces which include all or most spectral colors they form a part of boundary of the set of all real colors if luminance is counted

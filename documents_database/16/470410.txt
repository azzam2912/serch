the form of the equation is a second order partial differential equation the equation describes the evolution of acoustic pressure formula 1 or particle velocity u as a function of position x and time formula 2 a simplified form of the equation describes acoustic waves in only one spatial dimension while a more general form describes waves in three dimensions for lossy media more intricate models need to be applied in order to take into account frequency dependent attenuation and phase speed such models include acoustic wave equations that incorporate fractional derivative terms see also the acoustic attenuation article or the survey paper the wave equation describing sound in one dimension position formula 3 is where formula 1 is the acoustic pressure the local deviation from the ambient pressure and where formula 6 is the speed of sound provided that the speed formula 6 is a constant not dependent on frequency the dispersionless case then the most general solution is where formula 9 and formula 10 are any two twice differentiable functions this may be pictured as the superposition of two waveforms of arbitrary profile one formula 9 travelling up the x axis and the other formula 10 down the

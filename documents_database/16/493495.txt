trade names include perbunan nipol krynac and europrene nitrile butadiene rubber nbr is a family of unsaturated copolymers of 2 propenenitrile and various butadiene monomers 1 2 butadiene and 1 3 butadiene although its physical and chemical properties vary depending on the polymer s composition of nitrile this form of synthetic rubber is unusual in being generally resistant to oil fuel and other chemicals the more nitrile within the polymer the higher the resistance to oils but the lower the flexibility of the material it is used in the automotive and aeronautical industry to make fuel and oil handling hoses seals grommets and self sealing fuel tanks since ordinary rubbers cannot be used it is used in the nuclear industry to make protective gloves nbr s ability to withstand a range of temperatures from makes it an ideal material for aeronautical applications nitrile butadiene is also used to create moulded goods footwear adhesives sealants sponges expanded foams and floor mats its resilience makes nbr a useful material for disposable lab cleaning and examination gloves nitrile rubber is more resistant than natural rubber to oils and acids and has superior strength but has inferior flexibility nitrile gloves are therefore more puncture

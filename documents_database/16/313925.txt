when photographic film is developed the area that was exposed darkens and forms a visible image in the early days of photography the nature of the invisible change in the silver halide crystals of the film s emulsion coating was unknown so the image was said to be latent until the film was treated with photographic developer in more physical terms a latent image is a small cluster of metallic silver atoms formed in or on a silver halide crystal due to reduction of interstitial silver ions by photoelectrons a photolytic silver cluster if intense exposure continues such photolytic silver clusters grow to visible sizes this is called printing out the image on the other hand the formation of a visible image by the action of photographic developer is called developing out the image the size of a silver cluster in the latent image can be as small as a few silver atoms however in order to act as an effective latent image center at least four silver atoms are necessary on the other hand a developed silver grain can have billions of silver atoms therefore photographic developer acting on the latent image is a chemical amplifier with a gain

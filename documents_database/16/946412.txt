tetraphenylphosphonium and especially tetraphenylarsonium salts were formerly of interest in gravimetric analysis of perchlorate and related oxyanions this colourless salt is used to generate lipophilic salts from inorganic and organometallic anions thus php is useful as a phase transfer catalyst again because it allows inorganic anions to dissolve in organic solvents the cation is tetrahedral pphcl crystallises as the anhydrous salt which is normal item of commerce as well as a monohydrate and a dihydrate in x ray crystallography salts are of interest as they often crystallise easily the rigidity of the phenyl groups facilitates packing and elevates the melting point relative to alkyl based quaternary ammonium salts also since these salts are soluble in organic media a wide range of solvents can be employed for their crystallisation pphcl and many analogous compounds can be prepared by the reaction of chlorobenzene with triphenylphosphine catalysed by nickel salts the compound was originally prepared as the corresponding bromide salt cas no 2751 90 8 which in turn was synthesized by passing dry oxygen through the reaction of phenylmagnesium bromide and triphenylphosphine the synthesis probably proceeds via the reaction of the grignard reagent with triphenylphosphine oxide

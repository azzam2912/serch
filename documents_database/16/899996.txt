in the paleolithic age humans did not need constructed tracks in open country the first improved trails would have been at fords mountain passes and through swamps the first improvements would have consisted largely of clearing trees and big stones from the path as commerce increased the tracks were often flattened or widened to accommodate human and animal traffic some of these dirt tracks were developed into fairly extensive networks allowing communications trade and governance over wide areas the incan empire in south america and the iroquois confederation in north america neither of which had the wheel are examples of effective use of such paths the first goods transport was on human backs and heads but the use of pack animals including donkeys and horses developed during the neolithic age the first vehicle is believed to have been the travois a frame used to drag loads which probably developed in eurasia after the first use of bullocks castrated cattle for pulling ploughs in about 5000 bc sleds developed which are more difficult to build than travois but are easier to propel over smooth surfaces pack animals ridden horses and bullocks dragging travois or sleds require wider paths and higher clearances

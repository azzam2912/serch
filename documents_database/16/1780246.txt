it features instrumentals the entire album was re released as cd2 of hard works in 2008 this compilation stated the album was from 1989 when he was touring with the rolling stones in the steel wheels era this was confusing as the album seems to be released on 7 september 1998 and sources such as allmusic even state so it is possible that the 1998 release date marks a re issue some sources suggest a release of the album occurred in 1996 this seems to lean more evidence that that the 1998 release date marks a re issue living tradition said the works was a good showcase for beer s talents phil is not an acoustic fiddle player as everything is pre amped to get the sound he wants in fact he has recorded this himself there s a good mix of tunes some traditional some written by phil himself going back some twenty years in hard works the album remains intact but every two separate tracks from the original appears as one track on hard works three tracks of hard works even contains what was three separate tracks in the works this totals 10 tracks

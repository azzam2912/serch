these autosomal dominant mutations cause a reduction i e a haploinsufficiency in the cellular levels of the gene s product gata2 the gata2 protein is a transcription factor critical for the embryonic development maintenance and functionality of blood forming lympathic forming and other tissue forming stem cells in consequence of these mutations cellular levels of gata2 are deficient and individuals develop over time hematological immunological lymphatic or other presentations that may begin as apparently benign abnormalities but commonly progress to severe organ e g lung failure opportunistic infections virus infection induced cancers the myelodysplastic syndrome and or leukemia gata2 deficiency is a life threatening and precancerous condition the various presentations of gata2 deficiency include 1 monocytopenia and mycobacterium avium complex dendritic cell monocyte b and nk lymphocyte deficiency i e monomac or monomac dcml 2 emberger syndrome 3 familial myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia i e familial mds aml 3 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia i e cmml and 4 other anomalies such as aplastic anemia chronic neutropenia and wide ranging immunological defects each of these presentations is characterized by a specific constellation of signs and symptoms but often includes signs and symptoms more characteristic of other gata2 deficiency presentations furthermore individuals

mcmahon is a professor of biological sciences and pharmacology at vanderbilt university mcmahon has contributed several important discoveries to the field of chronobiology and vision his research focuses on connecting the anatomical location in the brain to specific behaviors as a graduate student under gene block mcmahon identified that the basal retinal neurons brns of the molluscan eye exhibited circadian rhythms in spike frequency and membrane potential indicating they are the clock neurons he became the 1986 winner of the society for neuroscience s donald b lindsley prize in behavioral neuroscience for his work later he moved on to investigate visual circadian and serotonergic mechanisms of neuroplasticity in addition he helped find that constant light can desynchronize the circadian cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus scn he has always been interested in the underlying causes of behavior and examining the long term changes in behavior and physiology in the neurological modular system recently mcmahon helped identify a novel retrograde neurotransmission system in the retina involving the melanopsin ganglion cells in retinal dopaminergic amacrine neurons mcmahon earned his bachelor of arts in biology from university of virginia in 1980 immediately after graduating mcmahon began a ph d program in biology at northwestern

some animals that use this method of feeding are clams krill sponges baleen whales and many fish including some sharks some birds such as flamingos and certain species of duck are also filter feeders filter feeders can play an important role in clarifying water and are therefore considered ecosystem engineers they are also important in bioaccumulation and as a result as indicator organisms most forage fish are filter feeders for example the atlantic menhaden a type of herring lives on plankton caught in midwater adult menhaden can filter up to four gallons of water a minute and play an important role in clarifying ocean water they are also a natural check to the deadly red tide in addition to these bony fish four types of cartilaginous fishes are also filter feeders the whale shark sucks in a mouthful of water closes its mouth and expels the water through its gills during the slight delay between closing the mouth and opening the gill flaps plankton is trapped against the dermal denticles which line its gill plates and pharynx this fine sieve like apparatus which is a unique modification of the gill rakers prevents the passage of anything but fluid out through

he was originally a watch dealer but at 30 years old took up experiments and observations in physics peltier was the author of numerous papers in different departments of physics but his name is specially associated with the thermal effects at junctions in a voltaic circuit he introduced the peltier effect peltier also introduced the concept of electrostatic induction 1840 based on the modification of the distribution of electric charge in a material under the influence of a second object closest to it and its own electrical charge this effect has been very important in the recent development of non polluting cooling mechanisms peltier initially trained as a watchmaker and was up to his 30s working as a watch dealer peltier worked with abraham louis breguet in paris later he worked with various experiments on electrodynamics and noticed that in an electronic element when current flows through a temperature gradient or temperature difference is generated at a current flow in 1836 he published his work and in 1838 his findings were confirmed by emil lenz furthermore peltier dealt with topics from the atmospheric electricity and meteorology in 1840 he published a work on the causes and formation of hurricanes peltier

software systems of this kind have similarities to product lifecycle management plm systems they guide the development of new or improved technologies from its conception through development and into manufacturing furthermore they borrow on concepts of manufacturing execution systems mes systems but tailor them for r d rather than for production pdes integrate people with different backgrounds from potentially different legal entities data from diverse sources information knowledge and business processes documented benefits of process development execution systems include a process development execution system pdes is a system used by companies to perform development activities for high tech manufacturing processes software systems of this kind leverage diverse concepts from other software categories like plm manufacturing execution system mes ecm but focus on tools to speed up the technology development rather than the production a pdes is similar to a manufacturing execution systems mes in several ways the key distinguishing factor of a pdes is that it is tailored for steering the development of a manufacturing process while mes is tailored for executing the volume production using the developed process therefore the toolset and focus of a pdes is on lower volume but higher flexibility and experimentation freedom the tools of

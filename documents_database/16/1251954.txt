the term originated from the name of the equipment steppers that exposes the photoresist to light integrated circuits have two primary classes of mask sets 1 base layers that are used to build the structures that make up the logic such as transistors and 2 metal layers that connect the logic together typically when an integrated circuit manufacturer such as intel or amd invests money to do a stepping i e a revision to the masks they have found bugs in the logic have made improvements to the design that allow for faster processing have found a way to increase yield or improve the bin splits i e create faster transistors and hence faster cpus improve maneuverability to more easily identify marginal circuits or reduce test time which can reduce the cost of testing the part many integrated circuits have a means of interrogating them in order to discover their stepping level for example on x86 cpus executing the cpuid with the eax register set to 1 will place values in other registers that show the cpu s stepping level stepping identifiers are commonly an alphabetic letter followed by a numeric number for example b2 usually the letter indicates the

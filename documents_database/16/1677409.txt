this protein domain is only found in viruses it causes sars severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans which causes high rates of mortality it is produced by a type of virus named the coronavirus sars cov x4 is the protein domain which is a unique type i transmembrane protein the precise protein of sars x4 like protein remains to be elucidated however it has been suggested that it has binding activity to integrin i domains additionally it is thought to induce apoptosis via a caspase dependent pathway in different types of tissue or in simpler terms inducing cell death through an enzymatic pathway also it contains a motif which has been demonstrated to mediate copii dependent transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum and the protein is targeted to the golgi apparatus it remains unknown as to why the protein may be involved with cell trafficking the structure of the coronavirus x4 protein also known as 7a and u122 shows similarities to the immunoglobulin like fold despite the fact they do not share sequence similarity their structure contains seven beta strands which form two beta sheets compactly arranged in an immunoglobulin like beta sandwich fold

mir 155 plays a role in various physiological and pathological processes exogenous molecular control in vivo of mir 155 expression may inhibit malignant growth viral infections and enhance the progression of cardiovascular diseases the mir155hg was initially identified as a gene that was transcriptionally activated by promoter insertion at a common retroviral integration site in b cell lymphomas and was formerly called bic b cell integration cluster the mir155hg is transcribed by rna polymerase ii and the resulting 1 500 nucleotide rna is capped and polyadenylated the 23 nucleotide single stranded mir 155 which is harbored in exon 3 is subsequently processed from the parent rna molecule the mir155hg rna transcript does not contain a long open reading frame orf however it does include an imperfectly base paired stem loop that is conserved across species this non coding rna ncrna is now defined as a primary mirna pri mirna once mir 155 pri mirna is transcribed this transcript is cleaved by the nuclear microprocessor complex of which the core components are the rnase iii type endonuclease drosha and the digeorge critical region 8 dgcr8 protein to produce a 65 nucleotide stem loop precursor mirna pre mir 155 see figure 2

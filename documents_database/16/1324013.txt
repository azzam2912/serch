it is a special case of the integer knapsack problem and has applications wider than just currency it is also the most common variation of the coin change problem a general case of partition in which given the available denominations of an infinite set of coins the objective is to find out the number of possible ways of making a change for a specific amount of money without considering the order of the coins it is weakly np hard but may be solved optimally in pseudo polynomial time by dynamic programming coin values can be modeled by a set of distinct positive integer values whole numbers arranged in increasing order as through the problem is given an amount also a positive integer to find a set of non negative positive or zero integers with each representing how often the coin with value is used which minimize the total number of coins subject to an application of change making problem can be found in computing the ways one can make a nine dart finish in a game of darts another application is computing the possible atomic or isotopic composition of a given mass charge peak in mass spectrometry a classic dynamic

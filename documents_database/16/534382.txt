barrel refers to the cylindrical shape of the cylinder group result of the pistons being spaced evenly around the central crankshaft and aligned parallel to the crankshaft axis whilst the z crank alludes to the shape of the crankshaft the key advantage of the axial design is that the cylinders are arranged in parallel around the output crank shaft in contrast to radial and inline engines both types having cylinders at right angles to the shaft as a result it is a very compact cylindrical engine allowing variation in compression ratio of the engine while running in a swashplate engine the piston rods stay parallel with the shaft and piston side forces that cause excessive wear can be eliminated almost completely the small end bearing of a traditional connecting rod one of the most problematic bearings in a traditional engine is eliminated an alternate design the rand cam engine replaces the plate with one or more sinusoidal cam surfaces vanes mounted parallel to a shaft mounted inside a cylindrical barrel that are free to sliding up and down ride the sinuous cam the segments formed by rotor stator walls and vanes constituting combustion chambers in effect these spaces serving the

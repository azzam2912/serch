intermolecular forces are weak relative to intramolecular forces the forces which hold a molecule together for example the covalent bond involving sharing electron pairs between atoms is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules both sets of forces are essential parts of force fields frequently used in molecular mechanics the investigation of intermolecular forces starts from macroscopic observations which indicate the existence and action of forces at a molecular level these observations include non ideal gas thermodynamic behavior reflected by virial coefficients vapor pressure viscosity superficial tension and absorption data the first reference to the nature of microscopic forces is found in alexis clairaut s work theorie de la figure de la terre other scientists who have contributed to the investigation of microscopic forces include laplace gauss maxwell and boltzmann attractive intermolecular forces are categorized into the following types information on intermolecular forces is obtained by macroscopic measurements of properties like viscosity pressure volume temperature pvt data the link to microscopic aspects is given by virial coefficients and lennard jones potentials a hydrogen bond is the attraction between the lone pair of an electronegative atom and a hydrogen atom that is bonded to an electronegative atom usually nitrogen

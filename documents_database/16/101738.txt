it forms the radial border of the carpal tunnel the trapezium is distinguished by a deep groove on its anterior surface it is situated at the radial side of the carpus between the scaphoid and the first metacarpal bone the metacarpal bone of the thumb it is homologous with the first distal carpal of reptiles and amphibians the trapezium is an irregular shaped carpal bone found within the hand the trapezium is found within the distal row of carpal bones and is directly adjacent to the metacarpal bone of the thumb on its ulnar surface are found the trapezoid and scaphoid bones the superior surface is directed upward and medialward medially it is smooth and articulates with the scaphoid laterally it is rough and continuous with the lateral surface the inferior surface is oval concave from side to side convex from before backward so as to form a saddle shaped surface for articulation with the base of the first metacarpal bone this saddle shaped articulation is partially responsible for the thumb s opposable motion the dorsal surface is smooth the palmar surface is narrow and rough at its upper part is a deep groove running from above obliquely downward and

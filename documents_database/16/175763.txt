this means that the difference between the counts of ones and zeros in a string of at least 20 bits is no more than two and that there are not more than five ones or zeros in a row this helps to reduce the demand for the lower bandwidth limit of the channel necessary to transfer the signal an 8b 10b code can be implemented in various ways where the design may focus on specific parameters such as hardware requirements dc balance etc one implementation was designed by k odaka for the dat digital audio recorder kees schouhamer immink designed an 8b 10b code for the dcc audio recorder the ibm implementation was described in 1983 by al widmer and peter franaszek as the scheme name suggests eight bits of data are transmitted as a 10 bit entity called a symbol or character the low five bits of data are encoded into a 6 bit group the 5b 6b portion and the top three bits are encoded into a 4 bit group the 3b 4b portion these code groups are concatenated together to form the 10 bit symbol that is transmitted on the wire the data symbols are often referred

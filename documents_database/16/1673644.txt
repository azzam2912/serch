the family was originally called amoebidiaceae and considered the sole family of the fungal order amoebidiales that included two genera amoebidium and paramoebidium however amoebidiidae is now monogeneric as it was recently emended to include only amoebidium and paramoebidium is now the sole genus of the family paramoebidiidae species of amoebidium are considered obligate symbionts of freshwater dwelling arthropod hosts such as midge larvae and water fleas daphnia however because amoebidium species attach to the exoskeleton exterior of the host and grow in axenic culture at least some species may be facultative symbionts the amoeb prefix refers to the amoeba like dispersal cells that are produced during the life cycle of amoebidium as the family is monogeneric the description follows that of the genus amoebidium amoebidium species are single celled cigar shaped or tubular in vegetative growth form thallus and attach to the exoskeleton of various freshwater arthropod hosts crustaecea or insecta by means of a secreted glue like basal holdfast the thalli are coenocytic i e lack divisions within the cell and are unbranched sexual reproduction is unknown asexual reproduction may proceed along two different routes 1 the entire content of the cell divides into elongated uninucleate spores known

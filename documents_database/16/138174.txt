it began as a galois module theory of ideal class groups initiated by as part of the theory of cyclotomic fields in the early 1970s barry mazur considered generalizations of iwasawa theory to abelian varieties more recently early 1990s ralph greenberg has proposed an iwasawa theory for motives iwasawa worked with so called formula 1 extensions infinite extensions of a number field formula 2 with galois group formula 3 isomorphic to the additive group of p adic integers for some prime p every closed subgroup of formula 4 is of the form formula 5 so by galois theory a formula 1 extension formula 7 is the same thing as a tower of fields such that formula 9 iwasawa studied classical galois modules over formula 10 by asking questions about the structure of modules over formula 11 more generally iwasawa theory asks questions about the structure of galois modules over extensions with galois group a p adic lie group let formula 12 be a prime number and let formula 13 be the field generated over formula 14 by the formula 12th roots of unity iwasawa considered the following tower of number fields where formula 17 is the field generated by adjoining

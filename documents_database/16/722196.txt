splice site consensus sequences that drive exon recognition are located at the very termini of introns the deletion of the splicing site results in one or more introns remaining in mature mrna and may lead to the production of abnormal proteins when a splice site mutation occurs the mrna transcript possesses information from these introns that normally should not be included introns are supposed to be removed while the exons are expressed the mutation must occur at the specific site at which intron splicing occurs within non coding sites in a gene directly next to the location of the exon the mutation can be an insertion deletion frame shift etc the splicing process itself is controlled by the given sequences known as splice donor and splice acceptor sequences which surround each exon mutations in these sequences may lead to retention of large segments of intronic dna by the mrna or to entire exons being spliced out of the mrna these changes could result in production of a nonfunctional protein an intron is separated from its exon by means of the splice site acceptor site and donor site relating to the splice sites signal to the spliceosome where the actual cut

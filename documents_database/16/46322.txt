anti aliasing is used in digital photography computer graphics digital audio and many other applications anti aliasing means removing signal components that have a higher frequency than is able to be properly resolved by the recording or sampling device this removal is done before re sampling at a lower resolution when sampling is performed without removing this part of the signal it causes undesirable artifacts such as the black and white noise near the top of figure 1 a below in signal acquisition and audio anti aliasing is often done using an analogue anti aliasing filter to remove the out of band component of the input signal prior to sampling with an analogue to digital converter in digital photography optical anti aliasing filters made of birefringent materials smooth the signal in the spatial optical domain the anti aliasing filter essentially blurs the image slightly in order to reduce the resolution to or below that achievable by the digital sensor the larger the pixel pitch the lower the achievable resolution at the sensor level in computer graphics anti aliasing improves the appearance of jagged polygon edges or jaggies so they are smoothed out on the screen however it incurs a performance

elegans to humans they were first discovered in drosophila through a mutant screen for genes involved in axon guidance the drosophila roundabout mutant was named after its phenotype which resembled the circular traffic junctions see roundabout the robo receptors are most well known for their role in the development of the nervous system where they have been shown to respond to secreted slit ligands one well studied example is the requirement for slit robo signaling in regulation of axonal midline crossing slit robo signaling is also critical for many neurodevelopmental processes including formation of the olfactory tract the optic nerve and motor axon fasciculation in addition slit robo signaling contributes to cell migration and the development of other tissues such as the lung kidney liver muscle and breast mutations in robo genes have been linked to multiple neurodevelopmental disorders in humans a large scale screen of the drosophila genome for mutants that exhibited axon guidance defects led to the discovery of the roundabout robo mutation in robo mutants axons were observed to inappropriately cross and recross the midline it was subsequently found that the secreted protein slit was the ligand for the roundabout receptor vertebrate slit proteins were identified shortly

the active loudspeaker is a normal driver and the passive radiator is of similar construction but without a voice coil and magnet assembly it is not attached to a voice coil or wired to an electrical circuit or power amplifier in the same way as a ported loudspeaker a passive radiator system uses the sound otherwise trapped in the enclosure to excite a resonance that makes it easier for the speaker system to create the deepest pitches e g basslines the passive radiator resonates at a frequency determined by its mass and the springiness of the air in the enclosure it is tuned to the specific enclosure by varying its mass e g by adding weight to the cone internal air pressure produced by movements of the active driver cone moves the passive radiator cone this resonance simultaneously reduces the amount that the woofer has to move passive radiators prs are used instead of a reflex port for several reasons in small volume enclosures tuned to low frequencies the length of the required port becomes very large they are also used to reduce or eliminate the objectionable noises of port turbulence and compressive flow caused by high velocity airflow in

the general scheme of electron flow in the por p450 system is the definitive evidence for the requirement of por in cytochrome p450 mediated reactions came from the work of lu junk and coon who dissected the p450 containing mixed function oxidase system into three constituent components por cytochrome p450 and lipids since all microsomal p450 enzymes require por for catalysis it is expected that disruption of por would have devastating consequences por knockout mice are embryonic lethal probably due to lack of electron transport to extrahepatic p450 enzymes since liver specific knockout of por yields phenotypically and reproductively normal mice that accumulate hepatic lipids and have remarkably diminished capacity of hepatic drug metabolism the reduction of cytochrome p450 is not the only physiological function of por the final step of heme oxidation by mammalian heme oxygenase requires por and o in yeast por affects the ferrireductase activity probably transferring electrons to the flavocytochrome ferric reductase human por gene has 16 exons and the exons 2 16 code for a 677 amino acid por protein ncbi np 000932 2 there is a single copy of 50 kb por gene ncbi nm 000941 2 in humans on chromosome 7 7q11 23

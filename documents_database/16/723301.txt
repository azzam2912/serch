cycle times phase splits and offsets for a traffic situation for individual intersections as well as for the whole network scats is based on the automatic plan selection from a library in response to the data derived from loop detectors or other road traffic sensors scats uses sensors at each traffic signal to detect vehicle presence in each lane and pedestrians waiting to cross at the local site the vehicle sensors are generally inductive loops installed within the road pavement the pedestrian sensors are usually push buttons various other types of sensors can be used for vehicle presence detection provided that a similar and consistent output is achieved information collected from the vehicle sensors allows scats to calculate and adapt the timing of traffic signals in the network scats is installed at about 42 000 intersections in over 1800 cities in 40 countries in australia where the system was first developed the majority of signalised intersections are scats operated around 11 000 the architecture of scats is at two basic levels local and master the local is the control cabinet at the roadside which provides the normal signal control as well as processing of traffic information deduced from the vehicle

that is the atoms share one pair of electrons where the bond forms therefore a single bond is a type of covalent bond when shared each of the two electrons involved is no longer in the sole possession of the orbital in which it originated rather both of the two electrons spend time in either of the orbitals which overlap in the bonding process as a lewis structure a single bond is denoted as a a or a a for which a represents an element moore stanitski and jurs 329 in the first rendition each dot represents a shared electron and in the second rendition the bar represents both of the electrons shared in the single bond a covalent bond can also be a double bond or a triple bond a single bond is weaker than either a double bond or a triple bond this difference in strength can be explained by examining the component bonds of which each of these types of covalent bonds consists moore stanitski and jurs 393 usually a single bond is a sigma bond an exception is the bond in diboron which is a pi bond in contrast the double bond consists of one sigma

similarly to glm a link function relates the expected value of the response variable to a linear predictor which in case of gflm is obtained by forming the scalar product of the random predictor function formula 1 with a smooth parameter function formula 2 functional linear regression functional poisson regression and functional binomial regression with the important functional logistic regression included are special cases of gflm applications of gflm include classification and discrimination of stochastic processes and functional data a key aspect of gflm is estimation and inference for the smooth parameter function formula 2 which is usually obtained by dimension reduction of the infinite dimensional functional predictor a common method is to expand the predictor function formula 1 in an orthonormal basis of l space the hilbert space of square integrable functions with the simultaneous expansion of the parameter function in the same basis this representation is then combined with a truncation step to reduce the contribution of the parameter function formula 2 in the linear predictor to a finite number of regression coefficients functional principal component analysis fpca that employs the karhunen lo ve expansion is a common and parsimonious approach to accomplish this other orthogonal expansions like

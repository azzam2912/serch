it was proposed in 1969 by the british computer scientist and logician tony hoare and subsequently refined by hoare and other researchers the original ideas were seeded by the work of robert w floyd who had published a similar system for flowcharts the central feature of hoare logic is the hoare triple a triple describes how the execution of a piece of code changes the state of the computation a hoare triple is of the form where formula 2 and formula 3 are assertions and formula 4 is a command formula 2 is named the precondition and formula 3 the postcondition when the precondition is met executing the command establishes the postcondition assertions are formulae in predicate logic hoare logic provides axioms and inference rules for all the constructs of a simple imperative programming language in addition to the rules for the simple language in hoare s original paper rules for other language constructs have been developed since then by hoare and many other researchers there are rules for concurrency procedures jumps and pointers using standard hoare logic only partial correctness can be proven while termination needs to be proved separately thus the intuitive reading of a hoare triple is

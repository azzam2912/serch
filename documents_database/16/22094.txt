the amount of attenuation for each frequency depends on the filter design a high pass filter is usually modeled as a linear time invariant system it is sometimes called a low cut filter or bass cut filter high pass filters have many uses such as blocking dc from circuitry sensitive to non zero average voltages or radio frequency devices they can also be used in conjunction with a low pass filter to produce a bandpass filter in the optical domain high pass and low pass have the opposite meanings with a high pass filter more commonly long pass passing only longer wavelengths lower frequencies and vice versa for low pass more commonly short pass the simple first order electronic high pass filter shown in figure 1 is implemented by placing an input voltage across the series combination of a capacitor and a resistor and using the voltage across the resistor as an output the product of the resistance and capacitance r c is the time constant it is inversely proportional to the cutoff frequency f that is where f is in hertz is in seconds r is in ohms and c is in farads figure 2 shows an active electronic

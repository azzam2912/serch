therefore mutations in the genes that encode for the daz proteins can have detrimental consequences for fertility the three members of the daz protein family include boule boll dazl dazla and daz daz1 daz2 daz3 and daz4 daz1 is located on the y chromosome in higher primates and is important for spermatogenesis boule and dazl are important for both oogenesis and spermatogenesis boule and dazl are both located on autosomes as single copies however daz is located with multiple copies in the y chromosome only boule is present from invertebrates dazl is from vertebrates and daz is present from primates each daz protein family member was discovered individually over a period of time by different research groups boule was first identified in drosophila with homologs being found in other organisms from sea anemone to humans dazl is thought to have come from boule by a gene duplication event and was first discovered in mice but is present in all vertebrates and the y chromosomal daz gene was first found in infertile males but is also present in apes and old world monkeys daz arose during primate evolution by i transposition moving from the autosomal gene to the y chromosome ii

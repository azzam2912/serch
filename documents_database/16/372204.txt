this can be defined theoretically as the points in space which project on corresponding points in the two retinas that is on anatomically identical points the horopter can be measured empirically in which it is defined using some criterion the concept of horopter can then be extended as a geometrical locus of points in space where a specific condition is met as other quantities that describe the functional principles of the visual system it is possible to provide a theoretical description of the phenomenon the measurement with psycho physical experiments usually provide an empirical definition that slightly deviates from the theoretical one the underlying theory is that this deviation represents an adaptation of the visual system to the regularities that can be encountered in natural environments the horopter as a special set of points of single vision was first mentioned in the eleventh century by ibn al haytham known to the west as alhazen he built on the binocular vision work of ptolemy and discovered that objects lying on a horizontal line passing through the fixation point resulted in single images while objects a reasonable distance from this line resulted in double images thus alhazen noticed the importance of some

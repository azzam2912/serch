the test determines whether the network still meets the port condition after the two ports have been combined the test is a sufficient but not necessary test to check if two two port networks can be connected in a series series configuration first of all just the input ports are connected in series a voltage is applied to the input and the open circuit voltage is measured calculated between the output terminals to be connected if there is a voltage drop the two port networks cannot be combined in series the same test is repeated from the output side of the two port networks series connection of the output ports application of a voltage to the output measurement calculation of the open circuit voltage between the input terminals to be connected only if there is no voltage drop in both cases a combination of the two ports networks is permissible the first example fails the series series test because the through path between the lower terminals of 2 port 1 short circuit part of the circuitry in 2 port 2 the second example passes the series series test the 2 ports are the same as in the first example but

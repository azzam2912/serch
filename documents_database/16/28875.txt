naval architecture involves basic and applied research design development design evaluation classification and calculations during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle preliminary design of the vessel its detailed design construction trials operation and maintenance launching and dry docking are the main activities involved ship design calculations are also required for ships being modified by means of conversion rebuilding modernization or repair naval architecture also involves formulation of safety regulations and damage control rules and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet statutory and non statutory requirements the word vessel includes every description of watercraft including non displacement craft wig craft and seaplanes used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water the principal elements of naval architecture are hydrostatics concerns the conditions to which the vessel is subjected while at rest in water and to its ability to remain afloat this involves computing buoyancy displacement and other hydrostatic properties such as trim the measure of the longitudinal inclination of the vessel and stability the ability of a vessel to restore itself to an upright position after being inclined by wind sea or loading conditions hydrodynamics concerns the flow of water around

lake wales ridge within which tulane lake lies is a linear highland that consists of unconsolidated quartz sands of the pliocene cypresshead formation these sands rest upon impermeable miocene sediments that overlie limestone which was dissolved by groundwater and collapsed to form tulane lake it is oblong in shape has a surface area of eighty eight acres and has a maximum depth of seventy feet it is surrounded by residential housing in avon park florida the organic rich sediments which underlie the bottom of lake tulane provide one of the few records of ancient climates within eastern north america that extends beyond the late glacial period 15 000 cal years bp cores from the bottom of lake tulane have yielded a record of paleoclimates and paleovegetation which date back to before 60 000 bp the pre holocene pollen record shows alternating periods of pinus pine dominated and quercus ambrosia oak ragweed dominated vegetation the periods of pinus dominated vegetation correlate with heinrich events h1 to h5 this correlation demonstrates a linkage between continental and oceanic climate events the periods of pinus dominated vegetation are interpreted to represent periods of relatively high precipitation associated with relatively warm waters in the gulf

the somatosensory system is a complex system of sensory neurons and neural pathways that responds to changes at the surface or inside the body the axons as afferent nerve fibers of sensory neurons connect with or respond to various receptor cells these sensory receptor cells are activated by different stimuli such as heat and nociception giving a functional name to the responding sensory neuron such as a thermoreceptor which carries information about temperature changes other types include mechanoreceptors chemoreceptors and nociceptors which send signals along a sensory nerve to the spinal cord where they may be processed by other sensory neurons and then relayed to the brain for further processing sensory receptors are found all over the body including the skin epithelial tissues muscles bones and joints internal organs and the cardiovascular system somatic senses are sometimes referred to as somesthetic senses with the understanding that somesthesis includes the sense of touch proprioception sense of position and movement and depending on usage haptic perception the mapping of the body surfaces in the brain is called somatotopy in the cortex it is also referred to as the cortical homunculus this brain surface cortical map is not immutable however dramatic shifts can

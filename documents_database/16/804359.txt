the term biosignal is often used to refer to bioelectrical signals but it may refer to both electrical and non electrical signals the usual understanding is to refer only to time varying signals although spatial parameter variations e g the nucleotide sequence determining the genetic code are sometimes subsumed as well electrical biosignals or bioelectrical time signals usually refers to the change in electric current produced by the sum of an electrical potential difference across a specialized tissue organ or cell system like the nervous system thus among the best known bioelectrical signals are eeg ecg eog and emg are measured with a differential amplifier which registers the difference between two electrodes attached to the skin however the galvanic skin response measures electrical resistance and the meg measures the magnetic field induced by electrical currents electroencephalogram of the brain with the development of methods for remote measurement of electric fields using new sensor technology electric biosignals such as eeg and ecg can be measured without electric contact with the skin this can be applied for example for remote monitoring of brain waves and heart beat of patients who must not be touched in particular patients with serious burns electrical currents

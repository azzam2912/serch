note that this sde makes sense for any real parameter formula 3 although the drift term is singular at zero since w was assumed to have started from the origin the initial condition is x 0 a notation for the bessel process of dimension started at zero is for n 2 the n dimensional wiener process is transient from its starting point with probability one i e x 0 for all t 0 it is however neighbourhood recurrent for n 2 meaning that with probability 1 for any r 0 there are arbitrarily large t with x 2 meaning that x r for all t sufficiently large for n 0 the bessel process is usually started at points other than 0 since the drift to 0 so strong that the process becomes stuck at 0 as soon as it hits 0 0 and 2 dimensional bessel processes are related to local times of brownian motion via the ray knight theorems the law of a brownian motion near x extrema is the law of a 3 dimensional bessel process theorem of tanaka

in the american south it is a dominant plant species found on clay flats and backwater areas near streams and rivers the species reproduces aggressively both by seed and sprouts from roots and from stumps of cut trees water hickory is a major component of wetland forests now in the south eastern us because of the selective cutting of more desirable tree species for the lumber industry it is considered important in cleansing drainage waters since the plants slow water flow during flooding allowing sediments to fall out of the water column this tree species is tolerant of wet soils but grows best on well draining soils near rivers and other water ways water hickory inhabits the atlantic and gulf coastal plains from southeastern virginia to southern florida alabama west into eastern texas and the mississippi valley north to southern illinois water hickory attains its best growth on moist but well drained loamy or silty soils in the mississippi river valley and along some coastal plain streams however because of its slow growth rate and past logging and land management practices it is rare on these sites except where it has been favored by repeated high grade logging water hickory

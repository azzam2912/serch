the very first uses for these machines was the inspection of gauges and parts produced by jig grinding while bearing some resemblance to a coordinate measuring machine cmm its usage and accuracy envelope differs significantly originally universal measuring machines were created to fill a need to continuously measure geometric features in both an absolute and comparative capacity rather than a point based coordinate measuring system a cmm provides a rapid method for inspecting absolute points but geometric relationships must be calculated rather than measured directly in theory by using an accurate spindle with an electronic test indicator rather than a probe a universal measuring machine fills this need the indicator can be accurately controlled and moved across a part either along a linear axis or radially around the spindle to continuously record profile and geometry this gives the universal machine a very strong advantage over other measuring methods when profiling radii contours and holes as the detail of the feature can be of any arbitrary resolution the analog record generated by the machine can be fed directly into a compensator on computer numerical control cnc machine tools correcting the machine on a per job basis in practice the universal measuring

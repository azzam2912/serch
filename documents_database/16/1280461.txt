technically they are thermoplastic elastomers consisting of linear segmented block copolymers composed of hard and soft segments tpu is a block copolymer consisting of alternating sequences of hard and soft segments or domains formed by the reaction of 1 diisocyanates with short chain diols so called chain extenders and 2 diisocyanates with long chain diols by varying the ratio structure and or molecular weight of the reaction compounds an enormous variety of different tpu can be produced this allows urethane chemists to fine tune the polymer s structure to the desired final properties of the material for example a greater ratio of hard to soft segments will result in a more rigid tpu while the reverse is also true the final resin consists of linear polymeric chains in block structures such chains contain low polarity segments which are rather long called soft segments alternating with shorter high polarity segments called hard segments both types of segments are linked together by covalent links so that they actually form block copolymers the polarity of the hard pieces creates a strong attraction between them which causes a high degree of aggregation and order in this phase forming crystalline or pseudo crystalline areas located

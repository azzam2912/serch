it grew out of two lighting systems developed in the late 1870s and early 1880s arc lamp street lighting running on high voltage alternating current ac and large scale low voltage direct current dc indoor incandescent lighting being marketed by thomas edison s company in 1886 the edison system was faced with new competition an alternating current system developed by george westinghouse s company that used transformers to step down from a high voltage so ac could be used for indoor lighting using high voltage allowed an ac system to transmit power over longer distances from more efficient large central generating stations as the use of ac spread rapidly the edison electric light company claimed in early 1888 that high voltages used in an alternating current system were hazardous and that the design was inferior to and infringed on the patents behind their direct current system in the spring of 1888 a media furor arose over electrical fatalities caused by pole mounted high voltage ac lines attributed to the greed and callousness of the arc lighting companies that used them in june of that year harold p brown a new york electrical engineer claimed the ac based lighting companies were

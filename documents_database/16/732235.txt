spicer spicer orbits the sun in the central main belt at a distance of 2 1 3 3 au once every 4 years and 5 months 1 619 days its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 23 and an inclination of 6 with respect to the ecliptic spicer s spectra is that of a x type and xc type in smass classification scheme which indicates a transitional stage to the carbonaceous c type asteroid it has also been characterized as a p type asteroid by the neowise mission in january 2005 photometric measurements of spicer made by american astronomer brian warner at the palmer divide observatory gave a lightcurve with a well defined rotation period of hours and a brightness variation of magnitude according to the survey carried out by nasa s wide field infrared survey explorer with its subsequent neowise mission spicer measures 16 721 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0 062 while the collaborative asteroid lightcurve link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0 057 and calculates a diameter of 18 43 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12 4 this minor planet was named after american anthropologist edward h spicer

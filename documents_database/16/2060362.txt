this scenario arises when we aim at learning from a source data distribution a well performing model on a different but related target data distribution for instance one of the tasks of the common spam filtering problem consists in adapting a model from one user the source distribution to a new one who receives significantly different emails the target distribution domain adaptation has also been shown to be beneficial for learning unrelated sources note that when more than one source distribution is available the problem is referred to as multi source domain adaptation let formula 1 be the input space or description space and let formula 2 be the output space or label space the objective of a machine learning algorithm is to learn a mathematical model a hypothesis formula 3 able to attach a label from formula 2 to an example from formula 1 this model is learned from a learning sample formula 6 usually in supervised learning without domain adaptation we suppose that the examples formula 7 are drawn i i d from a distribution formula 8 of support formula 9 unknown and fixed the objective is then to learn formula 10 from formula 11 such that it

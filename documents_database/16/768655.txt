there are three trunctions including a bitruncation and a tritruncation which creates the truncated 600 cell the truncated 120 cell or truncated hecatonicosachoron is a uniform 4 polytope constructed by a uniform truncation of the regular 120 cell 4 polytope it is made of 120 truncated dodecahedral and 600 tetrahedral cells it has 3120 faces 2400 being triangles and 720 being decagons there are 4800 edges of two types 3600 shared by three truncated dodecahedra and 1200 are shared by two truncated dodecahedra and one tetrahedron each vertex has 3 truncated dodecahedra and one tetrahedron around it its vertex figure is an equilateral triangular pyramid the bitruncated 120 cell or hexacosihecatonicosachoron is a uniform 4 polytope it has 720 cells 120 truncated icosahedra and 600 truncated tetrahedra its vertex figure is a digonal disphenoid with two truncated icosahedra and two truncated tetrahedra around it the truncated 600 cell or truncated hexacosichoron is a uniform 4 polytope it is derived from the 600 cell by truncation it has 720 cells 120 icosahedra and 600 truncated tetrahedra its vertex figure is a pentagonal pyramid with one icosahedron on the base and 5 truncated tetrahedra around the sides the truncated 600 cell consists

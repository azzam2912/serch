the existence of marsupionta is a postulation by some researchers as a category devolving upon a notional unification between marsupials marsupial marsupialia metatheria with the egg laying monotremes monotremata protheria under this suggested classification placental mammals eutheria would be the sister subclass to marsupionta the marsupionta hypothesis was proposed in 1947 by w k gregory and has since been the subject of multiple studies this merging of marsupials and monotremes into the hypothesized subclass of marsupionta is contrary to the widespread belief that pouch and placental mammals share the common subclass theria that excludes monotremes under this scheme that splits the marsupials from the monotremes monotremes are placed by themselves in the subclass yinotheria yinotheria are characterised by a number of common derived characteristics synapomorphies which include among others viviparia the birth of live pups the presence of teats and several features in the skull and shoulder girdle structures common morphological features of the marsupionta exist only in the epipubic pouch bones the two epipubic bones that protrude from the pelvis bone are present in both monotremes and marsupials but are missing in placentals however some primitive mammals as well as fossil ancestors of the cretaceous higher mammals also exhibit

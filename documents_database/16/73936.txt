kirby and paris showed that it is unprovable in peano arithmetic but it can be proven in stronger systems such as second order arithmetic this was the third example of a true statement that is unprovable in peano arithmetic after g del s incompleteness theorem and gerhard gentzen s 1943 direct proof of the unprovability of induction in peano arithmetic the paris harrington theorem was a later example laurence kirby and jeff paris introduced a graph theoretic hydra game with behavior similar to that of goodstein sequences the hydra named for the mythological multi headed hydra of lerna is a rooted tree and a move consists of cutting off one of its heads a branch of the tree to which the hydra responds by growing a finite number of new heads according to certain rules kirby and paris proved that the hydra will eventually be killed regardless of the strategy that hercules uses to chop off its heads though this may take a very long time just like for goodstein sequences kirby and paris showed that it cannot be proven in peano arithmetic alone goodstein sequences are defined in terms of a concept called hereditary base n notation this notation

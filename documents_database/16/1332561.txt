the carbon grids can be used in place of welded wire mesh in most structures and is imbedded the same way as a welded wire mesh carbon fiber s high strength high modulus resistance to creep and excellent fatigue properties allow the carbon grid to provide excellent crack and structural reinforcement ideally the carbon tows yarns are constructed on top of each other in a superimposed design those aides with fiber alignment and toughness of the finished grid concrete is inherently strong in compression and weak in tension to address this issue concrete is often reinforced with steel in the form of rebar welded wire mesh or stressing strands prestressed or post tensioned in theory the concrete has to crack when loaded in tension for the steel to begin to share the load in the steel reinforced concrete composite the concrete helps protect the steel by providing an alkaline environment ph 13 in many cases to retard corrosion of the steel to properly protect the steel the concrete needs to cover the steel by more than the minimum thickness not have large cracks and not have its chemistry altered by environmental factors like chloride attack from deicing salts carbonation etc

specifically a four vector is an element of a four dimensional vector space considered as a representation space of the standard representation of the lorentz group the representation it differs from a euclidean vector in how its magnitude is determined the transformations that preserve this magnitude are the lorentz transformations which include spatial rotations and boosts a change by a constant velocity to another inertial reference frame four vectors describe for instance position in spacetime modeled as minkowski space a particle s four momentum the amplitude of the electromagnetic four potential at a point in spacetime and the elements of the subspace spanned by the gamma matrices inside the dirac algebra the lorentz group may be represented by 4 4 matrices the action of a lorentz transformation on a general contravariant four vector like the examples above regarded as a column vector with cartesian coordinates with respect to an inertial frame in the entries is given by matrix multiplication where the components of the primed object refer to the new frame related to the examples above that are given as contravariant vectors there are also the corresponding covariant vectors and these transform according to the rule where denotes the matrix

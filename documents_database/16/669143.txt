the fault extends for from culver city southeast through inglewood and other coastal communities to newport beach at which point the fault extends east southeast into the pacific ocean where it is known as the rose canyon fault the fault can be inferred on the earth s surface as passing along and through a line of hills extending from signal hill to culver city the fault has a slip rate of approximately 0 6 millimeter year 0 02 in year and is predicted to be capable of a 6 0 7 4 magnitude earthquake on the moment magnitude scale a 2017 study concluded that together the newport inglewood fault and rose canyon fault could produce an earthquake of 7 3 or 7 4 magnitude the fault was first identified after a 4 9 magnitude quake struck near inglewood california on june 21 1920 due to the lack of earthquake resistant construction in southern california at this time this quake caused considerable damage in the inglewood area and was a preview of what was to come almost 13 years later the long beach earthquake occurred on march 10 1933 centered along the southern segment of this fault and registering a magnitude

it is a colourless solid it is well known to form hydrogen bonded dimers and it is also a classic case of a compound that exists as tautomers the amide group can be involved in hydrogen bonding to other nitrogen and oxygen containing species the proton attached to the nitrogen can also move to the oxygen to give the second tautomer form 2 hydroxypyridine this lactam lactim tautomerism can also be exhibited in many related compounds the predominant solid state form is 2 pyridone this has been confirmed by x ray crystallography which shows that the hydrogen in solid state is closer to the nitrogen than to the oxygen because of the low electron density at the hydrogen the exact positioning is difficult and ir spectroscopy which shows that the c o longitudinal frequency is present whilst the o h frequencies are absent the determination of which of the two tautomeric forms is present in solution has been the subject of many publications the energy difference appears to be very small and is dependent on the polarity of the solvent non polar solvents favour the formation of 2 hydroxypyridine whereas polar solvents such as alcohols and water favour the formation

it was a huge theropod in the same size range as tyrannosaurus and the contemporary genus carcharodontosaurus the type species b ingens was described by ernst stromer in 1934 though the type specimen was destroyed during world war ii the exact placement of bahariasaurus is uncertain although it has been variously assigned to several theropod groups including carcharodontosauridae by rauhut in 1995 and tyrannosauroidea by chure in 2000 it is potentially synonymous with deltadromeus another theropod from the early late cretaceous of north africa this would possibly make it the largest ceratosaur more specimens would be needed to more accurately classify it and to determine its relationship to deltadromeus in 2016 the description and analysis of aoniraptor bahariasaurus was found along with aoniraptor and deltadromeus to probably form a still poorly known clade of megaraptoran tyrannosauroids different from the megaraptoridae

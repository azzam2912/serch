they are used to treat certain gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal discomfort bloating constipation heart burn nausea and vomiting and certain gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome gastritis gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia most prokinetic agents are grouped under the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system a world health organization drug classification system as atc code a03f activation of a wide range of serotonin receptors by serotonin itself or by certain prokinetic drugs results in enhanced gastrointestinal motility other prokinetic drugs may increase acetylcholine concentrations by stimulating the m receptor which causes acetylcholine release or by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase which metabolizes acetylcholine higher acetylcholine levels increase gastrointestinal peristalsis and further increase pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter thereby stimulating gastrointestinal motility accelerating gastric emptying and improving gastro duodenal coordination the 5 ht receptor is thought to play a significant role in both the physiology and pathophysiology of gi tract motility therefore 5 ht receptors have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for diseases related to gi dysmotility such as chronic constipation some of these prokinetic agents such as mosapride and cisapride classic benzamides have only moderate affinity for 5ht receptors in recent years it has become clear that the selectivity profile is

the species is endemic to greece italy and the balkans in southern europe it is the largest european tortoise the marginated tortoise is herbivorous and hibernates for the winter the marginated tortoise was formally described by german naturalist johann david schoepff in 1789 its specific epithet marginata is a straightforward derivation from the latin term for marginated the nominate subspecies is the greek marginated tortoise testudo marginata marginata three additional subspecies of marginated tortoises have been named the sardinian marginated tortoise t m sarda is the name usually used to separate the population on the island of sardinia these tortoises have less strongly bent tiles in the posterior of their carapaces and the posterior of the carapace is almost smooth compared with the saw like t m marginata clearly distinct according to morphology and entirely allopatric it cannot be distinguished by mtdna cytochrome b and ndna issr sequence analysis lineage sorting has not occurred to a considerable degree consequently the more geographically isolated sardinian population is presumably of quite recent origin indeed it appears to derive from a deliberate introduction by humans though it is not clear whether this occurred in prehistoric times or more recently this might be resolved

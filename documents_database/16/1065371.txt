its chromosome has a high g c content 63 4 also a high proportion of acidic amino acids average 19 3 is found in the proteins of n pharaonis which results in low isoelectric points average pi 4 6 this is considered to be one of the adaptive features of haloarchaea which are known to apply the salt in strategy high internal salt concentrations in order to survive in their hypersaline environment falb et al further it is noteworthy that because the archaeon lacks the genetic encoding for key enzymes for glycolytic pathways it is not capable of sugar utilization natronomonas like the other members of halobacteriaceae has a distinct physiological characteristics because it not only requires high nacl concentrations but also high ph and low mg2 concentrations for growth it usually utilizes amino acids as the carbon source but the series of studies discovered that the archaeon has a high degree of nutritional self sufficiency also in contrast to other alkaliphiles which use sodium na instead of protons h as coupling ion between respiratory chain and atp synthase natronomonas uses protons as coupling ion the archaeon grows under highly alkaline conditions of ph around 11 which causes reduced levels

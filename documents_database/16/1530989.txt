600 c 680 a seventh century indian mathematician this formula is given in his treatise titled mahabhaskariya it is not known how bhaskara i arrived at his approximation formula however several historians of mathematics have put forward different hypotheses as to the method bhaskara might have used to arrive at his formula the formula is elegant simple and enables one to compute reasonably accurate values of trigonometric sines without using any geometry whatsoever the formula is given in verses 17 19 chapter vii mahabhaskariya of bhaskara i a translation of the verses is given below in modern mathematical notations for an angle x in degrees this formula gives bhaskara i s sine approximation formula can be expressed using the radian measure of angles as follows for a positive integer n this takes the following form the formula acquires an even simpler form when expressed in terms of the cosine rather than the sine using radian measure for angle and putting formula 4 one gets the assonance of formula 6 and formula 7 makes this expression especially pleasing as a mnemonic to express the previous formula with the constant formula 8 one can useformula 9 equivalent forms of bhaskara i s

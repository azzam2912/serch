it first appears during the middle ordovician around 470 million years ago and was a fairly common component of the fauna in some places during the period inhabiting the shallow seas of laurentia baltica and siberia its diversity and abundance became severely reduced following the ordovician silurian extinction events and the last remnants of the genus went extinct sometime during the wenlock cameroceras is a cephalopod a taxon of molluscs that includes the octopuses squids and cuttlefish from comparison with living cephalopods particularly the shelled chambered nautilus some inferences about the biology of cameroceras can be made the head of the animal would have been soft muscular tissue situated at the opening of the hard cone like shell with the mantle main body lying within the shell for protection tentacles would have grown from the base of the head like in a modern nautilus and these tentacles would have been used to seize and manipulate prey at the base of these tentacles within the buccal mass analogous to the mouth a hard keratinous beak would have bitten into the bodies of its prey and is assumed to have been strong enough to breach the prey s exoskeleton or shell within

this results in the faces of the arch not being perpendicular to its abutments and its plan view being a parallelogram rather than the rectangle that is the plan view of a regular or square arch in the case of a masonry skew arch the construction requires precise stonecutting as the cuts do not form right angles but once the principles were fully understood in the early 19th century it became considerably easier and cheaper to build a skew arch of brick the problem of building skew arch masonry bridges was addressed by a number of early civil engineers and mathematicians including giovanni barbara 1726 william chapman 1787 benjamin outram 1798 peter nicholson 1828 george stephenson 1830 edward sang 1835 charles fox 1836 george w buck 1839 and william froude c 1844 skew bridges are not a recent invention having been built on exceptional occasions since roman times but they were little understood and rarely used before the advent of the railway an early example of the skew arch is the arco barbara in the floriana lines fortifications in malta which was designed by the maltese architect and military engineer giovanni barbara in 1726 another notable exception is an aqueduct

the overall hull shape of the barge is a marriage of the french and dutch barge building influences she was converted to a hotel barge in 1996 l impressionniste is owned and operated by european waterways and sails on the canal de bourgogne in france the vessel is slab sided and has a flat lower part of the hull which means she was fairly cheap to build originally and space was maximized as the hull is effectively a box section during the 1960s she carried grain and timber making regular trips between paris and brussels she had a particularly long commercial hold for a vessel of 38 50m overall length and this eventually was one of the reasons her hull was well suited to be converted into a hotel barge her conversion took place in 1996 and was mainly done by verrian gray and geoffrey foot two english engineers her design and layout were based on la belle epoque which was built the year before and the original owners purchased the plans from european waterways she was originally powered by an 8 cylinder deutz diesel engine which produced this gave the barge a top speed of 16 km h she

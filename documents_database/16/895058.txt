the system records user actions and infers a generalized program that can be used on new examples pbe is intended to be easier to do than traditional computer programming which generally requires learning and using a programming language many pbe systems have been developed as research prototypes but few have found widespread real world application more recently pbe has proved to be a useful paradigm for creating scientific work flows pbe is used in two independent clients for the biomoby protocol seahawk and gbrowse moby also the programming by demonstration pbd term has been mostly adopted by robotics researchers for teaching new behaviors to the robot through a physical demonstration of the task the usual distinction in literature between these terms is that in pbe the user gives a prototypical product of the computer execution such as a row in the desired results of a query while in pbd the user performs a sequence of actions that the computer must repeat generalizing it to be used in different data sets for final users to automate a workflow in a complex tool e g photoshop the most simple case of pbd is the macro recorder

it is a forest inhabiting species found in the indian subcontinent and southeast asia this species is considered part of a superspecies with the barred eagle owl bubo sumatranus which looks quite similar but is allopatric in distribution replacing the larger spot bellied species in the southern end of the malay peninsula and the larger island in southeast asia extending down to borneo this like its close relative the barred eagle owl is one of the species that would have to be moved into ketupa if that genus is to be retained according to mtdna cytochrome b sequence data olsen et al 2002 unlike the fish owls that were also considered to be included in ketupa the barred and the spot bellied species are not closely tied to riparian habitats and piscivorous eating habits however all eagle owls and fish owls as well as the snowy owl bubo scandianus have been deemed insufficiently distinct to warrant separate genera and current authors generally treat all within the genus bubo due to its forest dwelling habits and some superficial characteristics it has been wondered by some authors if the spot bellied eagle owl is somehow related to the rainforest dwelling eagle owls

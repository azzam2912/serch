this white solid is widely used in agriculture and the production of pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds it is also used as an alcohol deterrent drug in canada europe and japan the molecule features a nitrile group attached to an amino group derivatives of this compound are also referred to as cyanamides the most common being calcium cyanamide cacn containing both a nucleophilic and electrophilic site within the same molecule cyanamide undergoes various reactions with itself cyanamide exists as two tautomers one with the connectivity n c nh and the other with the formula hn c nh carbodiimide tautomer the n c nh form dominates but in a few reactions e g silylation the diimide form appears to be important cyanamide dimerizes to give 2 cyanoguanidine dicyandiamide this dimerization is disfavored by acids and is inhibited by low temperatures the cyclic trimer is called melamine cyanamide is produced by hydrolysis of calcium cyanamide which in turn is prepared from calcium carbide via the frank caro process the conversion is conducted on slurries consequently most commercial cyanamide is sold as an aqueous solution cyanamide can be regarded as a functional single carbon fragment which can react as an electrophile or nucleophile

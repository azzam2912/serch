the name derives from the experiment s magnetization transfer pathway the magnetization of the amide proton of an amino acid residue is transferred to the amide nitrogen and then to the alpha carbons of both the starting residue and the previous residue in the protein s amino acid sequence in contrast the complementary hncoca experiment transfers magnetization only to the alpha carbon of the previous residue the hnca experiment is used often in tandem with hncoca to assign alpha carbon resonance signals to specific residues in the protein this experiment requires a purified sample of protein prepared with c and n isotopic labelling at a concentration greater than 0 1 mm and is thus generally only applied to recombinant proteins the spectrum produced by this experiment has 3 dimensions a proton axis a n axis and a c axis for residue i peaks will appear at h i n i c i and h i n i c i 1 while for the complementary hncoca experiment peaks appear only at h i n i c i 1 together these two experiments reveal the alpha carbon chemical shift for each amino acid residue in a protein and provide information linking adjacent

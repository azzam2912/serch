such variability is called random variability or noise on the other hand periodic variability occurs relatively regularly and in distinct modes of variability or climate patterns over the years the definitions of climate variability and the related term climate change have shifted while the term climate change now implies change that is both long term and of human causation in the 1960s the word climate change was used for what we now describe as climate variability that is climatic inconsistencies and anomalies there are different modes of variability recurring patterns of temperature or other climate variables they are quantified with different indices much in the way the dow jones industrial average which is based on the stock prices of 30 companies is used to represent the fluctuations in the stock market as a whole climate indices are used to represent the essential elements of climate climate indices are generally devised with the twin objectives of simplicity and completeness and each index typically represents the status and timing of the climate factor it represents by their very nature indices are simple and combine many details into a generalized overall description of the atmosphere or ocean which can be used to characterize

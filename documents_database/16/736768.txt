this type of power plant is still in a research phase two established options for possible medium term implementation of fusion energy production are magnetic confinement being used in the iter international project and laser based inertial confinement as used in the french laser m gajoule and in the american nif inertial confinement fusion icf including heavy ion inertial fusion hif has been proposed as a possible additional means of implementing a fusion power plant the operation of an ife reactor is in some ways analogous to the operation of the four stroke cycle of a petrol engine to allow such an operation an inertial fusion reactor is made of several subsets several projects of inertial fusion power plants have been proposed including power production plans based on the following experimental devices either in operation or under construction only the us and french projects are based on z pinch confinement others are based on laser confinement techniques livermore s ife life project was cancelled in january 2014 as of june 2006 megajoule and nif lasers were not yet in complete service inertial confinement and laser confinement fusion experiments had not gone beyond the first phase around 2010 nif and megajoule

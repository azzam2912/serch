aho hopcroft and ullman credit it to s rao kosaraju and micha sharir kosaraju suggested it in 1978 but did not publish it while sharir independently discovered it and published it in 1981 it makes use of the fact that the transpose graph the same graph with the direction of every edge reversed has exactly the same strongly connected components as the original graph the primitive graph operations that the algorithm uses are to enumerate the vertices of the graph to store data per vertex if not in the graph data structure itself then in some table that can use vertices as indices to enumerate the out neighbours of a vertex traverse edges in the forward direction and to enumerate the in neighbours of a vertex traverse edges in the backward direction however the last can be done without at the price of constructing a representation of the transpose graph during the forward traversal phase the only additional data structure needed by the algorithm is an ordered list l of graph vertices that will grow to contain each vertex once if strong components are to be represented by appointing a separate root vertex for each component and assigning to each

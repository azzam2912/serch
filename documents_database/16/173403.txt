displacement current density has the same units as electric current density and it is a source of the magnetic field just as actual current is however it is not an electric current of moving charges but a time varying electric field in physical materials as opposed to vacuum there is also a contribution from the slight motion of charges bound in atoms called dielectric polarization the idea was conceived by james clerk maxwell in his 1861 paper on physical lines of force part iii in connection with the displacement of electric particles in a dielectric medium maxwell added displacement current to the electric current term in amp re s circuital law in his 1865 paper a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field maxwell used this amended version of amp re s circuital law to derive the electromagnetic wave equation this derivation is now generally accepted as a historical landmark in physics by virtue of uniting electricity magnetism and optics into one single unified theory the displacement current term is now seen as a crucial addition that completed maxwell s equations and is necessary to explain many phenomena most particularly the existence of electromagnetic waves the electric displacement field is defined

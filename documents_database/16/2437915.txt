this concept was proposed to offer a vtol solution for both high hovering efficiency and high cruise speed using a large annular lift fan instead of the relatively small conventional circular lift fans used in the ryan xv 5 vertifan and the f 35b lightning ii jsf the ryan xv 5 and the f 35b use relatively smaller lift fans either fan in fuselage or fan in wing with very high disc loading according to the momentum theory of the ducted fan high disc loading leads to low hovering efficiency see power vs disc loadings jsf fan so the f 35b can hover for only a short time at the cost of range and useful load on the other hand helicopters apply long rotor blades to achieve low disc loading and high hovering efficiency but have a limited forward speed of less than 200 knots due to compressibility effects on the rotor blade tips the tilt rotor concept found in the v 22 osprey uses large diameter propellers but also has limited top speed to 300 knots the tilting ducted fans or shrouded propellers such as the doak vz 4 the bell x 22 were built in 1950s and 1960s

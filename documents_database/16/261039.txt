its composition varies depending on how it is made however it consists mainly of tricalcium phosphate or hydroxylapatite 57 80 calcium carbonate 6 10 and carbon 7 10 it is primarily used for filtration and decolorisation bone char is primarily made from cattle and pork bones however to prevent the spread of creutzfeldt jakob disease the skull and spine are no longer used the bones are heated in a sealed vessel at up to the oxygen concentration must be kept low while doing this as it affects the quality of the product particularly its adsorption capacity most of the organic material in the bones is driven off by heat and was historically collected as dippel s oil that which is not driven off remains as activated carbon in the final product heating bones in an oxygen rich atmosphere gives bone ash which is chemically quite different used bone char can be regenerated by washing with hot water to remove impurities followed by heating to in a kiln with a controlled amount of air the tricalcium phosphate in bone char can be used to remove fluoride and metal ions from water making it useful for the treatment of drinking supplies bone

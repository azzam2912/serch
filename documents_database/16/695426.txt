the basic idea is to identify dead ends i e combinations of variables that are not necessary to define a global minimum because there is always a way of replacing such combination by a better or equivalent one then we can refrain from searching such combinations further hence dead end elimination is a mirror image of dynamic programming in which good combinations are identified and explored further although the method itself is general it has been developed and applied mainly to the problems of predicting and designing the structures of proteins it closely related to the notion of dominance in optimization also known as substitutability in a constraint satisfaction problem the original description and proof of the dead end elimination theorem can be found in an effective dee implementation requires four pieces of information note that the criteria can easily be reversed to identify the maximum of a given function as well dead end elimination has been used effectively to predict the structure of side chains on a given protein backbone structure by minimizing an energy function formula 1 the dihedral angle search space of the side chains is restricted to a discrete set of rotamers for each amino acid

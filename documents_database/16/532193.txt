this verse continues the discussion of worry about material provisions in this verse jesus tells his followers not to be anxious about food but to rely on god as the birds who are worth far less than people are fully provided for in the king james version of the bible the text reads the world english bible translates the passage as for a collection of other versions see biblehub matthew 6 26 the opening verb in this verse can mean either consider or behold the second meaning implies that jesus speaking in the open air pointed to some birds nearby while speaking these lines birds of the sky literally translates as birds in heaven but this was a common expression for birds in flight through the air and does not imply the birds were with god there are several debates over this verse firstly it can be interpreted as a commandment to idleness to not farm or work for your food as god will provide for you this view can be countered by pointing out that birds are far from idle having to go to a great deal of effort to gather their food martin luther commented on this verse

it is available in two calibers 22lr the preferred sporting or target model and 32 s w long 7 65 mm there is a difference between models marked esp85 and esp85a both versions could have been had with either the 100 mm 4 inch or 153 mm 6 inch barrel there is even a shorter version where the barrel flushes with the forward front of the slide some models probably the esp85 have a longer trigger bar than the esp85a and also with a different placed disconnector notch in the slide these part do not interchange the esp85 also has a simpler all steel trigger whereas the esp85a has a forward rearward adjustable plastic steel trigger the feeding ramp between the esp85 and esp85a is also a bit different while one may attach the barrel to the frame the trigger will not work because rearward movement will stop against the feeding ramp but a usable conversion can be made with the help of a gunsmith although the precision is on par with any top notch target pistols the high barrel line compared to a pardini will increase felt recoil and doesn t lend itself to issf rapid fire matches reliability

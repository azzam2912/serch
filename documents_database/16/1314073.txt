it consists of an open topped cylindrical steel shell equipped with a roof that floats on the surface of the stored liquid the roof rises and falls with the liquid level in the tank as opposed to a fixed roof tank there is no vapor space ullage in the floating roof tank except for very low liquid level situations in principle this eliminates tank breathing loss and greatly reduces the evaporative loss of the stored liquid there is a rim seal system between the tank shell and roof to reduce rim evaporation the roof has support legs hanging down into the liquid at low liquid levels the roof eventually lands and a vapor space forms between the liquid surface and the roof similar to a fixed roof tank the support legs are usually retractable to increase the working volume of the tank external roof tanks are usually installed for environmental or economical reasons to limit product loss and reduce the likelihood of emission of volatile organic compounds vocs and other potential air pollutants normally the roof of the tank rests directly on the surface of the stored liquid leaving little vapor space and consequently leading to a much lower risk

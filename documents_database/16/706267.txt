httpsec provides cryptographically strong security at the application layer httpsec operates within the framework of the http authentication headers it uses rsa public keys for mutual authentication and ephemeral diffie hellman key exchange to ensure forward secrecy the protocol provides mutual authentication and message origin authentication via protection applied to 1 the integrity of url method and core http headers 2 the integrity of the message body 3 message sequence and 4 message replays it optionally provides message body encryption it does not provide header confidentiality as messages would no longer be http if their header fields were encrypted or integrity protection applied to secondary headers which may be legitimately altered by proxies the terms requester and responder are used in place of client and server for the two peers in the transaction this is to acknowledge that the peers that are being authenticated do not necessarily map one to one to client or server devices for example a server may host multiple endpoints that are distinctly identified there are three possible types of transaction initialisation continuation and challenge initialization transactions occur when a requester wishes to initiate a new shared secret agreement they are for protocol purposes only and

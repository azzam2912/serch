the appearance of these trangressive extreme phenotypes can be either positive or negative in terms of fitness if both parents favorable alleles come together it will result in a hybrid having a higher fitness than the two parents the hybrid species will show more genetic variation and variation in gene expression than their parents as a result the hybrid species will have some traits that are transgressive extreme in nature transgressive segregation can allow a hybrid species to populate different environments niches in which the parent species do not reside or compete in the existing environment with the parental species genetic there are many causes for transgressive segregation in hybrids one cause can be due to recombination of additive alleles recombination results in new pairs of alleles at two or more loci these different pairs of alleles can give rise to new phenotypes if gene expression has been changed at these loci another cause can be elevated mutation rate when mutation rates are high it is more probable that a mutation will occur and cause an extreme phenotypic change reduced developmental stability is another cause for transgressive segregation developmental stability refers to the capability of a genotype to go through

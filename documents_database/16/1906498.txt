it acetylates the n terminus of mature actin this gene encodes a member of the n acetyltransferase family n acetyltransferases modify proteins by transferring acetyl groups from acetyl coa to the n termini of protein substrates the encoded protein is a cytoplasmic n acetyltransferase with a substrate specificity for n termini that are enriched for acidic residues this gene is located in the tumor suppressor gene region on chromosome 3p21 3 and the encoded protein may play a role in cancer alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed this gene overlaps and is on the same strand as hyaluronoglucosaminidase 3 and some transcripts of each gene share a portion of the first exon provided by refseq jan 2011 naa80 acetylates the n terminus of mature actin this n terminal acetylation affects the rates of actin filament depolymerization and elongation and the overall morphology of the cell naa80 is a member of the gnat family of acetyltransferases it has an overall fold similar to the other n terminal acetyltransferases but has a more open basic active site to accommodate the acidic n terminus of actin naa80 can acetylate peptides with different n terminal residues but the presence of

due to natural gas cleaner burning properties the use of natural gas in merchant ship propulsion plants is becoming an option for companies in order to comply with imo and marpol environmental regulations the natural gas is stored in liquid state lng and the boil off gas is routed to and burned in dual fuel engines shipping companies have been cautious when choosing a propulsion system for their fleets the steam turbine system has been the main choice as the prime mover on lng carriers over the last several decades the decades old system on steam propelled lng carriers uses bog boil off gas lng carriers are heavily insulated to keep the lng at around 160 c to keep it liquefied what happens is that even with all the insulation the lng containment area is penetrated by heat which allows for naturally generated boil off gas bog lng shipping first became a possibility in 1959 when the methane pioneer a converted wwii freighter safely transported liquefied natural gas into the united kingdom after proving that lng can be safely transported across the ocean the lng shipping industry boomed and now employs 200 billion dollars annually in capital since the start

the process is characterized by the elongation of the fluid mass forming thin thread like regions between larger nodules of fluid the thread like regions continue to thin until they break forming individual droplets of fluid thread breakup occurs where two fluids or a fluid in a vacuum form a free surface with surface energy if more surface area is present than the minimum required to contain the volume of fluid the system has an excess of surface energy a system not at the minimum energy state will attempt to rearrange so as to move toward the lower energy state leading to the breakup of the fluid into smaller masses to minimize the system surface energy by reducing the surface area the exact outcome of the thread breakup process is dependent on the surface tension viscosity density and diameter of the thread undergoing breakup the examination of droplet formation has a long history first traceable to the work of leonardo da vinci who wrote he thus correctly attributed the fall of droplets to gravity and the mechanism which drives thread breakup to the cohesion of water molecules the first correct analysis of fluid thread breakup was determined qualitatively by thomas

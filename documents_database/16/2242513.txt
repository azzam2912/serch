this is a specification of the more general method of numerical continuation let formula 1 represent the variables of the system by abuse of notation and to facilitate the spectrum of ambient spaces over which one can solve system we do not use vector notation for formula 1 similarly for the polynomial systems formula 3 and formula 4 current canonical notation calls the start system formula 4 and the target system the system to solve formula 3 a very common homotopy the straight line homotopy between formula 3 and formula 4 is formula 9 in the above homotopy one starts the path variable at formula 10 and continues toward formula 11 another common choice is to run from formula 12 to formula 13 in principle the choice is completely arbitrary in practice regarding endgame methods for computing singular solutions using homotopy continuation the target time being formula 12 can significantly ease analysis so this perspective is here taken regardless of the choice of start and target times the formula 15 ought to be formulated such that formula 16 and formula 17 one has a choice in formula 18 including and beyond these specific start systems that closely mirror the structure

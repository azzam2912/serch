it was discovered in 1975 by diaconescu and later by goodman and myhill already in 1967 errett bishop posed the theorem as an exercise problem 2 on page 58 in foundations of constructive analysis for any proposition formula 1 we can build the sets and these are sets using the axiom of specification in classical set theory this would be equivalent to and similarly for formula 5 however without the law of the excluded middle these equivalences cannot be proven in fact the two sets are not even provably finite in the usual sense of being in bijection with a natural number though they would be in the dedekind sense assuming the axiom of choice there exists a choice function for the set formula 6 that is a function formula 7 such that by the definition of the two sets this means that which implies formula 10 but since formula 11 by the axiom of extensionality therefore formula 12 so thus formula 14 as this could be done for any proposition this completes the proof that the axiom of choice implies the law of the excluded middle the proof relies on the use of the full separation axiom in constructive

in contrast to other heating devices such as hotplates or bunsen burners glassware containers may be placed in direct contact with the heating mantle without substantially increasing the risk of the glassware shattering because the heating element of a heating mantle is insulated from the container so as to prevent excessive temperature gradients heating mantles may have various forms in a common arrangement electric wires are embedded within a strip of fabric that can be wrapped around a flask the current supplied to the device and hence the temperature achieved is regulated by a rheostat this type of heating mantle is quite useful for maintaining an intended temperature within a separatory funnel for example after the contents of a reaction have been removed from a primary heat source another variety of heating mantle may resemble a paint can and is constructed as a basket within a cylindrical canister often made of plastic or metal such as aluminium the rigid metal exterior supports a basket made of fabric and includes heating elements within the body of the heating mantle to heat an object it is placed within the basket of the heating mantle in further contrast to other methods of applying

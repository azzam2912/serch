she is known for her pioneering work in new fundamental tests of quantum theory including teleportation and cryptography reid graduated from the university of auckland with an msc in theoretical physics and then undertook phd studies in new zealand with dan walls frs graduating in 1984 she developed theories for the generation of squeezed states of light and quantum non demolition measurement following several years as a lecturer at the university of waikato new zealand she was awarded an australian qeii fellowship to do research at the university of queensland she later became a researcher with the australian research council centre of excellence in quantum and atom optics at the university of queensland she is currently professor at swinburne university of technology in melbourne and works as a researcher within the centre for quantum and optical sciences reid s work has focussed on the fundamental tests of quantum mechanics including of the einstein podolsky rosen paradox and bell s theorem based on parametric down conversion and quantum optics on working with squeezed states of light in the 1980s reid thought of a way to test for the original einstein s entanglement after noting scientists were able to amplify and detect

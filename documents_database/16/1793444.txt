it is an amalgamation of the different technologies and architectures for supercomputers and mainframes namely high computing power and high throughput in 2007 hoplon and ibm jointly started the gameframe project in which they used an ibm system z mainframe computer with attached cell b e blades the eight core parallel processing chips that power sony s playstation 3 to host their online game taikodom the project was carried further by a co operation between ibm and the university of california san diego in 2009 although the cell blades account for the required computing power it s the high data throughput of the mainframe which is of particular interest system z provides a high level of security and massive workload handling assuring the execution of its administrative tasks and guaranteeing an enduring connectivity to a huge number of clients cell b e takes over the most resource demanding calculations thus enabling the system z to fulfill its job this combination is an effective and financially attractive game server system as the most computation intensive tasks are offloaded from the expensive cpu cycles of system z and are carried out on the much more economical cell blades without offloading the server

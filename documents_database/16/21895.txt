in practice gouraud shading is most often used to achieve continuous lighting on triangle surfaces by computing the lighting at the corners of each triangle and linearly interpolating the resulting colours for each pixel covered by the triangle gouraud first published the technique in 1971 gouraud shading works as follows an estimate to the surface normal of each vertex in a polygonal 3d model is either specified for each vertex or found by averaging the surface normals of the polygons that meet at each vertex using these estimates lighting computations based on a reflection model e g the phong reflection model is then performed to produce colour intensities at the vertices for each screen pixel that is covered by the polygonal mesh colour intensities can then be interpolated from the colour values calculated at the vertices gouraud shading is considered superior to flat shading and requires significantly less processing than phong shading but usually results in a faceted look in comparison to phong shading gouraud shading s strength and weakness lies in its interpolation if a mesh covers more pixels in screen space than it has vertices interpolating colour values from samples of expensive lighting calculations at vertices is less

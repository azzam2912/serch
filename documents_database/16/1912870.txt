however being essential is highly dependent on the circumstances in which an organism lives for instance a gene required to digest starch is only essential if starch is the only source of energy recently systematic attempts have been made to identify those genes that are absolutely required to maintain life provided that all nutrients are available such experiments have led to the conclusion that the absolutely required number of genes for bacteria is on the order of about 250 300 these essential genes encode proteins to maintain a central metabolism replicate dna translate genes into proteins maintain a basic cellular structure and mediate transport processes into and out of the cell most genes are not essential but convey selective advantages and increased fitness two main strategies have been employed to identify essential genes on a genome wide basis directed deletion of genes and random mutagenesis using transposons in the first case individual genes or orfs are completely deleted from the genome in a systematic way in transposon mediated mutagenesis transposons are randomly inserted in as many positions in a genome as possible aiming to inactivate the targeted genes see figure below insertion mutants that are still able to survive or

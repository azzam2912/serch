brain and hence an approach to the mind body problem it was first proposed by the philosopher john searle in 1980 and is defined by two main theses 1 all mental phenomena from pains tickles and itches to the most abstruse thoughts are caused by lower level neurobiological processes in the brain and 2 mental phenomena are higher level features of the brain this entails that the brain has the right causal powers to produce intentionality however searle s biological naturalism does not entail that brains and only brains can cause consciousness searle is careful to point out that while it appears to be the case that certain brain functions are sufficient for producing conscious states our current state of neurobiological knowledge prevents us from concluding that they are necessary for producing consciousness in his own words the fact that brain processes cause consciousness does not imply that only brains can be conscious the brain is a biological machine and we might build an artificial machine that was conscious just as the heart is a machine and we have built artificial hearts because we do not know exactly how the brain does it we are not yet in a position

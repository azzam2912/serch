it belongs to the polyconic projection class which consists of map projections whose parallels are non concentric circular arcs except for the equator which is straight often the american polyconic is simply called the polyconic projection the american polyconic projection was probably invented by ferdinand rudolph hassler around 1825 it was commonly used by many map making agencies of the united states from the time of its proposal until the middle of the 20th century it is not used much these days having been replaced by conformal projections in the state plane coordinate system the american polyconic projection can be thought of as rolling a cone tangent to the earth at all parallels of latitude this generalizes the concept of a conic projection which uses a single cone to project the globe onto by using this continuously varying cone each parallel becomes a circular arc having true scale contrasting with a conic projection which can only have one or two parallels at true scale the scale is also true on the central meridian of the projection the projection is defined by where is the longitude of the point to be projected is the latitude of the point to be projected

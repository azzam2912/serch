the spectra typically include line emission from weakly ionized or neutral atoms such as o o n and s conversely the spectral line emission from strongly ionized atoms such as o ne and he is relatively weak the class of galactic nuclei was first identified by timothy heckman in the third of a series of papers on the spectra of galactic nuclei that were published in 1980 galaxies that contain liners are often referred to as liner galaxies liner galaxies are very common approximately one third of all nearby galaxies galaxies within approximately 20 40 mpc may be classified as liner galaxies approximately 75 of liner galaxies are either elliptical galaxies lenticular galaxies or s0 a sab galaxies spiral galaxies with large bulges and tightly wound spiral arms liners are found less frequently in sb scd galaxies spiral galaxies with small bulges and loosely wound spiral arms and they are very rare in nearby irregular galaxies liners also may be commonly found in luminous infrared galaxies lirgs a class of galaxies defined by their infrared luminosities that are frequently formed when two galaxies collide with each other approximately one quarter of lirgs may contain liners liners have been at the

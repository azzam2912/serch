addition polymerization differs from condensation polymerization which does co generate a product usually water addition polymers can be formed by chain polymerization when the polymer is formed by the sequential addition of monomer units to an active site in a chain reaction or by polyaddition when the polymer is formed by addition reactions between species of all degrees of polymerization addition polymers are formed by the addition of some simple monomer units repeatedly generally polymers are unsaturated compounds like alkenes alkalines etc the addition polymerization mainly takes place in free radical mechanism the free radical mechanism of addition polymerization completed by three steps i e initiation of free radical chain propagation termination of chain many common addition polymers are formed from unsaturated monomers usually having a c c double bond the most prevalent addition polymers are polyolefins i e polymers derived by the conversion of olefins alkenes to long chain alkanes the stoichiometry is simple this conversion can be induced by a variety of catalysts including free radicals acids carbanions and metal complexes examples of such polyolefins are polyethenes polypropylene pvc teflon buna rubbers polyacrylates polystyrene and pctfe when two or more types of monomers undergo addition polymerization the resulting

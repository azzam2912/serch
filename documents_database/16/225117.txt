the same or similar rock sequences occur across the wider northwest european chalk province it is characterised by thick deposits of chalk a soft porous white limestone deposited in a marine environment chalk is a limestone that consists of coccolith biomicrite a biomicrite is a limestone composed of fossil debris bio and calcium carbonate mud micrite most of the fossil debris in chalk consists of the microscopic plates which are called coccoliths of microscopic green algae known as coccolithophores in addition to the coccoliths the fossil debris includes a variable but minor percentage of the fragments of foraminifera ostracods and mollusks the coccolithophores lived in the upper part of the water column when they died the microscopic calcium carbonate plates which formed their shells settled downward through the ocean water and accumulated on the ocean bottom to form a thick layer of calcareous ooze which eventually became the chalk group the chalk group usually shows few signs of bedding other than lines of flint nodules which become common in the upper part nodules of the mineral pyrite also occur and are usually oxidized to brown iron oxide on exposed surfaces well known outcrops include the white cliffs of dover beachy

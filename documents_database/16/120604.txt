correctness properties typically one has hardware or software systems in mind whereas the specification contains safety requirements such as the absence of deadlocks and similar critical states that can cause the system to crash as well as liveness requirements in order to solve such a problem algorithmically both the model of the system and the specification are formulated in some precise mathematical language to this end the problem is formulated as a task in logic namely to check whether a given structure satisfies a given logical formula this general concept applies to many kinds of logic and suitable structures a simple model checking problem is verifying whether a given formula in the propositional logic is satisfied by a given structure property checking is used for verification when two descriptions are not functionally equivalent during refinement the specification is complemented with details that are unnecessary in the higher level specification there is no need to verify the newly introduced properties against the original specification since it is not even possible therefore the strict bi directional equivalence check is relaxed to a one way property check the implementation or design is regarded as a model of the circuit whereas the specifications are

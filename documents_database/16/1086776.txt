nf b is an essential transcription factor complex involved in all types of cellular processes including cellular metabolism chemotaxis etc phosphorylation and acetylation of rela are crucial post translational modifications required for nf b activation rela has also been shown to modulate immune responses and activation of rela is positively associated with multiple types of cancer rela or v rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog a is also known as p65 or nfkb3 it is located on chromosome 11 q13 and its nucleotide sequence is 1473 nucleotide long rela protein has four isoforms the longest and the predominant one being 551 amino acids rela is expressed alongside p50 in various cell types including epithelial endothelial cells and neuronal tissues rela is one member of the nf b family one of the essential transcription factors under intensive study seven proteins encoded by five genes are involved in the nf b complex namely p105 p100 p50 p52 rela c rel and relb like other proteins in this complex rela contains a n terminal rel homology domain rhd and also a c terminal transactivation domain tad rhd is involved in dna binding dimerization and nf b rel inhibitor interaction on the other hand

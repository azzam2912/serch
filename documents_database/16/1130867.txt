syngap1 is a ras gtpase activating protein that is critical for the development of cognition and proper synapse function mutations in humans can cause intellectual disability or epilepsy syngap1 is a complex protein with several functions that may be regulated temporally via complex isoforms a well documented function of syngap1 involves nmda receptor mediated synaptic plasticity and membrane insertion of ampa receptors through the suppression of upstream signaling pathways however syngap1 has also been shown to function cooperatively with unc51 1 in axon formation one way syngap1 affects these processes is through the map kinase signaling pathway by attenuation of ras signalling however alternative splicing and multiple translational start sites have been shown to cause opposing effects illustrating the importance of multiple functional domains that reside within the c and n termini for example the expression of an 1 or 2 c terminal variant of syngap1 will either increase or decrease synaptic strength respectively overall syngap1 is essential for development and survival which is evident as knockout mice die perinatally syngap1 is shown to localize at the postsynaptic density on the dendritic spines of excitatory synapses cultured neurons of syngap heterozygotic and homozygotic knockout mice display accelerated maturation of dendritic

during a long series of experiments sauria went on to add white phosphorus that helped ignite the mixture by friction he finalized the invention by adding gum arabic to hold the powders together and dipping pieces of wood into it sauria was a poor student at the time however nicolet communicated his invention to german industrialist friedrich kammerer who had patented it and used it in mass production of matches the british chemist john walker had introduced a very similar match some five years earlier where he used antimony sulfide instead of white phosphorus however the phosphorus matches became more popular mostly because of the reduced smell of sulfur and quickly replaced those made by walker around the time of sauria s death some 3 trillion of white phosphorus matches per year were produced worldwide however white phosphorus was soon proven to be toxic and banned by the international berne convention in 1906

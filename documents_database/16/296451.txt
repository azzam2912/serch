the numbers mean a tree where every node with children internal node has either two three or four child nodes 2 3 4 trees are b trees of order 4 like b trees in general they can search insert and delete in o log n time one property of a 2 3 4 tree is that all external nodes are at the same depth 2 3 4 trees are an isometry of red black trees meaning that they are equivalent data structures in other words for every 2 3 4 tree there exists at least one red black tree with data elements in the same order moreover insertion and deletion operations on 2 3 4 trees that cause node expansions splits and merges are equivalent to the color flipping and rotations in red black trees introductions to red black trees usually introduce 2 3 4 trees first because they are conceptually simpler 2 3 4 trees however can be difficult to implement in most programming languages because of the large number of special cases involved in operations on the tree red black trees are simpler to implement so tend to be used instead to insert a value we start at

in this phenomenon when the base of an npn transistor is turned on enough current flows through the emitter collector circuit that the silicon in the immediate vicinity of the emitter ground connection is pulled partially high sometimes by several volts thus raising the local ground as perceived at the gate to a value significantly above true ground relative to this local ground the base voltage can go negative thus shutting off the transistor as the excess local charge dissipates the transistor turns back on possibly causing a repeat of the phenomenon sometimes up to a half dozen bounces ground bounce is one of the leading causes of hung or metastable gates in modern digital circuit design this happens because the ground bounce puts the input of a flip flop effectively at voltage level that is neither a one nor a zero at clock time or causes untoward effects in the clock itself a similar phenomenon may be seen on the collector side called v sag where v is pulled unnaturally low as a whole ground bounce is a major issue in nanometer range technologies in vlsi ground bounce can also occur when the circuit board has poorly designed ground

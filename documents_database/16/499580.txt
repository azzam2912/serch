it is also possible to define higher dimensional gamma matrices when interpreted as the matrices of the action of a set of orthogonal basis vectors for contravariant vectors in minkowski space the column vectors on which the matrices act become a space of spinors on which the clifford algebra of spacetime acts this in turn makes it possible to represent infinitesimal spatial rotations and lorentz boosts spinors facilitate spacetime computations in general and in particular are fundamental to the dirac equation for relativistic spin particles in dirac representation the four contravariant gamma matrices are formula 3 is the time like hermitian matrix the other three are space like antihermitian matrices more compactly formula 4 and formula 5 where formula 6 denotes the kronecker product and the formula 7 for j 1 2 3 denote the pauli matrices analogous sets of gamma matrices can be defined in any dimension and for any signature of the metric for example the pauli matrices are a set of gamma matrices in dimension 3 with metric of euclidean signature 3 0 in 5 spacetime dimensions the 4 gammas above together with the fifth gamma matrix to be presented below generate the clifford algebra the defining

it provides practical techniques for extracting quantitative information about a three dimensional material from measurements made on two dimensional planar sections of the material stereology is a method that utilizes random systematic sampling to provide unbiased and quantitative data it is an important and efficient tool in many applications of microscopy such as petrography materials science and biosciences including histology bone and neuroanatomy stereology is a developing science with many important innovations being developed mainly in europe new innovations such as the proportionator continue to make important improvements in the efficiency of stereological procedures in addition to two dimensional plane sections stereology also applies to three dimensional slabs e g 3d microscope images one dimensional probes e g needle biopsy projected images and other kinds of sampling it is especially useful when the sample has a lower spatial dimension than the original material hence stereology is often defined as the science of estimating higher dimensional information from lower dimensional samples stereology is based on fundamental principles of geometry e g cavalieri s principle and statistics mainly survey sampling inference it is a completely different approach from computed tomography classical applications of stereology include the popular science fact that the human

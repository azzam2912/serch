the term was introduced by r h whittaker together with the terms alpha diversity diversity and beta diversity diversity whittaker s idea was that the total species diversity in a landscape is determined by two different things the mean species diversity in sites or habitats at a more local scale and the differentiation among those habitats according to this reasoning alpha diversity and beta diversity constitute independent components of gamma diversity the area or landscape of interest may be of very different sizes in different situations and no consensus has been reached on what spatial scales are appropriate to quantify gamma diversity it has therefore been proposed that the definition of gamma diversity does not need to be tied to a specific spatial scale but gamma diversity can be measured for an existing dataset at any scale of interest if results are extrapolated beyond the actual observations it needs to be taken into account that the species diversity in the dataset generally gives an underestimation of the species diversity in a larger area the smaller the available sample in relation to the area of interest the more species that actually exist in the area are not found in the sample

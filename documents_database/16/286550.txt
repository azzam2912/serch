throughout there have been two basic points the origin of these studies was the work of pontryagin postnikov and norman steenrod who first defined the pontryagin square postnikov square and steenrod square operations for singular cohomology in the case of mod 2 coefficients the combinatorial aspect there arises as a formulation of the failure of a natural diagonal map at cochain level the general theory of the steenrod algebra of operations has been brought into close relation with that of the symmetric group in the adams spectral sequence the bicommutant aspect is implicit in the use of ext functors the derived functors of hom functors if there is a bicommutant aspect taken over the steenrod algebra acting it is only at a derived level the convergence is to groups in stable homotopy theory about which information is hard to come by this connection established the deep interest of the cohomology operations for homotopy theory and has been a research topic ever since an extraordinary cohomology theory has its own cohomology operations and these may exhibit a richer set on constraints a cohomology operation formula 1 of type is a natural transformation of functors defined on cw complexes cohomology of cw

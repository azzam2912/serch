usually cells stay close to the tissue to which they belong since the communication between proximal cells as well as between cells and ecm provide essential signals for growth or survival when cells are detached from the ecm there is a loss of normal cell matrix interactions and they may undergo anoikis however metastatic tumor cells may escape from anoikis and invade other organs the word anoikis was coined by frisch and francis in a paper published in the journal of cell biology in 1994 anoikis in their words means the state of being without a home to describe the cells apoptotic response to the absence of cell matrix interactions the word apparently is a neologism construction consisting of three greek morphemes agglutinated together without house and the suffix the mechanism by which invading tumor cells survive the anoikis process remains largely unknown recent findings suggest that the protein trkb best known for its role in the nervous system might be involved together with its ligand brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf it seems that trkb could make tumor cells resistant to anoikis by activating phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pi3k signaling cascade in squamous cell carcinoma researchers have found that anoikis resistance

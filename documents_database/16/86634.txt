earlier cisco switches ran catos ios is a package of routing switching internetworking and telecommunications functions integrated into a multitasking operating system although the ios code base includes a cooperative multitasking kernel most ios features have been ported to other kernels such as qnx and linux for use in cisco products not all cisco products run ios notable exceptions include asa security products which run a linux derived operating system carrier routers which run ios xr and cisco s nexus switch and fc switch products which run cisco nx os the ios network operating system was developed in the 1980s for routers that had only 256 kb memory and low cpu processing power through modular extensions ios has been adapted to increasing hardware capabilities and new networking protocols when ios was developed cisco systems main product line were routers the company acquired a number of young companies that focused on network switches such as the inventor of the first ethernet switch kalpana and as a result cisco switches did not run the ios the cisco catalyst series would for some time run the catos in early modular chassis network switches from cisco modules with layer 3 routing functionalities were separate

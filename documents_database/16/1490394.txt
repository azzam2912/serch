in medicine the allocation of resources in an urgent situation is prioritized for those with the greatest need and those who would receive the greatest benefit similarly the two parameters of ecological triage are the level of threat and the probability of recovery because there are limitations to resources such as time money and manpower it is important to prioritize specific efforts and distribute resources efficiently ecological triage differentiates between areas with an attainable emergent need those who would benefit from preventative measures and those that are beyond repair ecological triage is not simple dichotomous decision making it involves an array of complex factors including assumptions mathematical calculations and planning for uncertainties when assessing an ecosystem there are a myriad of factors conservationists consider but there are also variables which they are unable to account for conservationists and scientists often have incomplete understanding of population dynamics impacts of external threats and efficacy of different conservation tactics it is important to incorporate these unknowns when assessing a population or ecosystem by following the principles of triage we are able to allow for the efficient allocation of resources as conservationists continue to develop the best options for ecological preservation and restoration due

assemblages of trilobites define trilobite zones the olenellus zone has traditionally marked the top of the lower cambrian and is followed by the eokochaspis zone the last two zones of the middle cambrian are the bathyuriscus elrathina zone contemporaneous with the burgess shale and the subsequent bolaspidella zone starting at the base of the drumian stage these are overlain by the lowermost upper cambrian cedaria zone alternative zoning names place the burgess shale in the peronopsis bonnerensis zone which is underlain by the oryctocephalus indicus zone e g spence shale and overlain perhaps not directly by the ptychagnostus punctuosus zone the lower middle cambrian glossopleura zone spence shale is above the albertella zone the elvinia zone is upper cambrian recently it has been proposed to subdivide the olenellus zone the following zones have been proposed to replace the upper olenellus zone each lower boundary is defined by the first occurrence of the naming species each upper boundary is defined by the first occurrence of the naming species of the overlying zone in case of the youngest zone this is eokochaspis nodosa that also marks the base of the wuliuan species nephrolenellus multinodus lower half mesonacis fremonti olenellus terminatus s l

a stochastic model is a tool for estimating probability distributions of potential outcomes by allowing for random variation in one or more inputs over time the random variation is usually based on fluctuations observed in historical data for a selected period using standard time series techniques distributions of potential outcomes are derived from a large number of simulations stochastic projections which reflect the random variation in the input s its application initially started in physics it is now being applied in engineering life sciences social sciences and finance see also economic capital like any other company an insurer has to show that its assets exceeds its liabilities to be solvent in the insurance industry however assets and liabilities are not known entities they depend on how many policies result in claims inflation from now until the claim investment returns during that period and so on so the valuation of an insurer involves a set of projections looking at what is expected to happen and thus coming up with the best estimate for assets and liabilities and therefore for the company s level of solvency the simplest way of doing this and indeed the primary method used is to look at

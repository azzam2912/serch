due to some of the astounding properties inherent to quantum computation notably entanglement and parallelism it is anticipated that qip technologies will offer capabilities and performances that are as yet unrivaled by their traditional equivalents these improvements could be in terms of computing speed guaranteed security and minimal storage requirements etc vlasov s work in 1997 focused on the use of a quantum system to recognize orthogonal images this was followed by efforts using quantum algorithms to search specific patterns in binary images and detect the posture of certain targets notably more optics based interpretation for quantum imaging were initially experimentally demonstrated in and formalized in after seven years venegas andraca and bose s qubit lattice describes quantum images in 2003 simultaneously lattorre proposed another kind of representation called the real ket whose purpose was to encode quantum images as a basis for further applications in qimp technically these pioneering efforts with the subsequent studies related to them can be classified into three main groups a lot of the effort in qip has been focused on designing algorithms to manipulate the position and color information encoded using the frqi and its many variants for instance frqi based fast geometric transformations

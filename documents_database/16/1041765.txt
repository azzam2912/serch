it was established in 1986 as part of an expansion of uta s college of engineering the arc contributes to the vision of uta and the university of texas system to transform the university into a full fledged research institution it showcases the aerodynamics research activities at uta and in its history has established itself as a unique facility at a university level the wind tunnels and equipment in the facility were mainly built by scouting for and upgrading decommissioned equipment from the government and industry currently masters and ph d students perform research in the fields of high speed gas dynamics propulsion including pulse detonation engines and computational fluid dynamics among other projects related to aerodynamics the development of the arc began in 1975 as an effort to develop a shock tube for experimental research in magnetohydrodynamic mhd power generation at the same time the engineering accreditation board recommended that the aerospace engineering department which has since merged back into the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering should have a high speed wind tunnel capability an arc heater was shipped to uta but was put in storage because of a lack of funds to acquire the support equipment necessary

it refers to the flow of external air to an indoor space as a result of pressure differences arising from natural forces there are two types of natural ventilation occurring in buildings wind driven ventilation and buoyancy driven ventilation wind driven ventilation arises from the different pressures created by wind around a building or structure and openings being formed on the perimeter which then permit flow through the building buoyancy driven ventilation occurs as a result of the directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior since the internal heat gains which create temperature differences between the interior and exterior are created by natural processes including the heat from people and wind effects are variable naturally ventilated buildings are sometimes called breathing buildings the static pressure of air is the pressure in a free flowing air stream and is depicted by isobars in weather maps differences in static pressure arise from global and microclimate thermal phenomena and create the air flow we call wind dynamic pressure is the pressure exerted when the wind comes into contact with an object such as a hill or a building and it is described by the following equation where

j m smith in 1957 is a type of predictive controller designed to control systems with a significant feedback time delay the idea can be illustrated as follows suppose the plant consists of formula 1 followed by a pure time delay formula 2 formula 3 refers to the z transform of the transfer function relating the inputs and outputs of the plant formula 4 as a first step suppose we only consider formula 1 the plant without a delay and design a controller formula 6 with a closed loop transfer function formula 7 that we consider satisfactory next our objective is to design a controller formula 8 for the plant formula 9 so that the closed loop transfer function formula 10 equals formula 11 solving formula 12 we obtain formula 13 the controller is implemented as shown in the following figure where formula 1 has been changed to formula 15 to indicate that it is a model used by the controller note that there are two feedback loops the outer control loop feeds the output back to the input as usual however this loop alone would not provide satisfactory control because of the delay this loop is feeding back outdated

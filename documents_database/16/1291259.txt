the human arntl gene has a predicted 24 exons and is located on the p15 band of the 11th chromosome the bmal1 protein is 626 amino acids long and plays a key role as one of the positive elements in the mammalian auto regulatory transcription translation negative feedback loop ttfl which is responsible for generating molecular circadian rhythms research has revealed that bmal1 is the only clock gene without which the circadian clock fails to function in humans bmal1 has also been identified as a candidate gene for susceptibility to hypertension diabetes and obesity and mutations in bmal1 have been linked to infertility gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis problems and altered sleep patterns bmal1 according to genome wide profiling is estimated to target more than 150 sites in the human genome including all of the clock genes and genes encoding for proteins that regulate metabolism the arntl gene was originally discovered in 1997 by two groups of researchers john b hogenesch et al in march under the name mop3 and ikeda and nomura in april as part of a superfamily of pas domain transcription factors in 1998 hogenesch s additional characterization of mop3 revealed that its role as the partner of bhlh

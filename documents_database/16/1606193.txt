pterygotioids were the most derived members of the infraorder diploperculata and the sister group of the adelophthalmoid eurypterids the group includes the basal and small hughmilleriids the larger and specialized slimonids and the famous pterygotids which were equipped with robust and powerful cheliceral claws though the more primitive hughmilleriids were small hughmilleria wangi being the smallest of all pterygotioids at just in length later members of the group particularly in the pterygotidae would become the largest known arthropods to ever exist with several genera surpassing in length among all currently recognized eurypterid clades the pterygotioidea is the most diverse containing over 50 species in 10 genera with the number of recognized eurypterid species being around 250 pterygotioids account for more than a fifth of all known eurypterid species though the group only existed for around 70 million years and during a time when most continents were separated by large expanses of water in contrast with previous and later periods of time when there had been supercontinents the pterygotioidea had the most cosmopolitan distribution of all eurypterid groups their fossils have been recovered from europe africa north america south america asia and australia with the earliest remains being from the early

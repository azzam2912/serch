they include gnrh agonists and gnrh antagonists these medications may be gnrh analogues like leuprorelin and cetrorelix peptides that are structurally related to gnrh or small molecules like elagolix and relugolix which are structurally distinct from and unrelated to gnrh analogues gnrh modulators affect the secretion of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone lh and follicle stimulating hormone fsh which in turn affects the gonads influencing their function and hence fertility as well as the production of sex steroids including that of estradiol and progesterone in women and of testosterone in men as such gnrh modulators can also be described as progonadotropic or antigonadotropic depending on whether they act to increase or decrease gonadotropins shortly after the discovery of gnrh by nobel laureates guillemin and schally researchers tried to modify the gnrh decapeptide with the intent to create analogues that could activate or block the receptor subsequent to the development and introduction of gnrh analogues non peptide or small molecule gnrh modulators were developed and introduced all gnrh modulators are contraindicated in pregnancy pregnancy category x a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist gnrh agonist is a gnrh modulator that activates the gnrh receptor resulting in increased secretion of fsh and lh initially it

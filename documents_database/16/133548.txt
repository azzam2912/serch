intel beat amd to market by nearly four years but amd priced its 40 mhz 486 at or below intel s price for a 33 mhz chip offering about 20 better performance for the same price while competing 486 chips such as those from cyrix benchmarked lower than the equivalent intel chip amd s 486 matched intel s performance on a clock for clock basis while the am386 was primarily used by small computer manufacturers the am486dx dx2 and sx2 chips gained acceptance among larger computer manufacturers especially acer and compaq in the 1994 time frame amd s higher clocked 486 chips provided superior performance to many of the early pentium chips especially the 60 and 66 mhz launch products while equivalent intel 80486dx4 chips were priced high and required a minor socket modification amd priced low intel s dx4 chips initially had twice the cache of the amd chips giving them a slight performance edge but amd s dx4 100 usually cost less than intel s dx2 66 the enhanced am486 series supported new features like extended power saving modes and an 8 kib write back l1 cache later versions even got an upgrade to 16 kib write back

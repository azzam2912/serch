action is a mathematical functional which takes the trajectory also called path or history of the system as its argument and has a real number as its result generally the action takes different values for different paths action has the dimensions of energy time or momentum length and its si unit is joule second hamilton s principle states that the differential equations of motion for any physical system can be re formulated as an equivalent integral equation thus there are two distinct approaches for formulating dynamical models it applies not only to the classical mechanics of a single particle but also to classical fields such as the electromagnetic and gravitational fields hamilton s principle has also been extended to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory in particular the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics makes use of the concept where a physical system randomly follows one of the possible paths with the phase of the probability amplitude for each path being determined by the action for the path empirical laws are frequently expressed as differential equations which describe how physical quantities such as position and momentum change continuously with time space or a generalization thereof given the initial and boundary

as such it is face uniform but with irregular face polygons it slightly resembles an inflated rhombic triacontahedron if one replaces each face of the rhombic triacontahedron with a single vertex and four triangles in a regular fashion one ends up with a disdyakis triacontahedron that is the disdyakis triacontahedron is the kleetope of the rhombic triacontahedron it also has the most faces among the archimedean and catalan solids with the snub dodecahedron with 92 faces in second place if the bipyramids and the trapezohedra are excluded the disdyakis triacontahedron has the most faces of any other strictly convex polyhedron where every face of the polyhedron has the same shape projected into a sphere the edges of a disdyakis triacontahedron define 15 great circles buckminster fuller used these 15 great circles along with 10 and 6 others in two other polyhedra to define his 31 great circles of the spherical icosahedron the edges of the polyhedron projected onto a sphere form 15 great circles and represent all 15 mirror planes of reflective i icosahedral symmetry as shown in this image combining pairs of light and dark triangles define the fundamental domains of the nonreflective i icosahedral symmetry the edges of

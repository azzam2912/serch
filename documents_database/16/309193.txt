it can then be used in dna or rna samples to detect the presence of nucleotide substances the rna target that are complementary to the sequence in the probe the probe thereby hybridizes to single stranded nucleic acid dna or rna whose base sequence allows probe target base pairing due to complementarity between the probe and target the labeled probe is first denatured by heating or under alkaline conditions such as exposure to sodium hydroxide into single stranded dna ssdna and then hybridized to the target ssdna southern blotting or rna northern blotting immobilized on a membrane or in situ to detect hybridization of the probe to its target sequence the probe is tagged or labeled with a molecular marker of either radioactive or more recently fluorescent molecules commonly used markers are p a radioactive isotope of phosphorus incorporated into the phosphodiester bond in the probe dna or digoxigenin which is a non radioactive antibody based marker dna sequences or rna transcripts that have moderate to high sequence similarity to the probe are then detected by visualizing the hybridized probe via autoradiography or other imaging techniques normally either x ray pictures are taken of the filter or the filter is

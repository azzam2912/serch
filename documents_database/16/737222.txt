monoterpenes may be linear acyclic or contain rings modified terpenes such as those containing oxygen functionality or missing a methyl group are called monoterpenoids monoterpenes and monoterpenoids are diverse they have relevance to the pharmaceutical cosmetic agricultural and food industries monoterpenes are derived biosynthetically from units of isopentenyl pyrophosphate which is formed from acetyl coa via the intermediacy of mevalonic acid in the hmg coa reductase pathway an alternative unrelated biosynthesis pathway of ipp is known in some bacterial groups and the plastids of plants the so called mep 2 methyl erythritol 4 phosphate pathway which is initiated from c sugars in both pathways ipp is isomerized to dmapp by the enzyme isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase geranyl pyrophosphate is the precursor to monoterpenes and hence monoterpenoids biosynthesis is mediated by terpene synthase elimination of the pyrophosphate group from geranyl pyrophosphate leads to the formation of acyclic monoterpenes such as ocimene and the myrcenes hydrolysis of the phosphate groups leads to the prototypical acyclic monoterpenoid geraniol additional rearrangements and oxidations provide compounds such as citral citronellal citronellol linalool and many others many monoterpenes found in marine organisms are halogenated such as halomon in addition to linear attachments the isoprene units can make

the intent of the builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation it is one of the gang of four design patterns the builder design pattern is one of the gof design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems in object oriented software the builder design pattern solves problems like creating and assembling the parts of a complex object directly within a class is inflexible it commits the class to creating a particular representation of the complex object and makes it impossible to change the representation later independently from without having to change the class the builder design pattern describes how to solve such problems a class the same construction process can delegate to different codice 1 objects to create different representations of a complex object the intent of the builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation by doing so the same construction process can create different representations advantages of the builder pattern include disadvantages of the builder pattern include in the above uml class diagram the codice 4 class doesn t create and assemble the codice 5 and codice 6 objects directly

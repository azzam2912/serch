this derivation justifies the so called logical interpretation of probability as the laws of probability derived by cox s theorem are applicable to any proposition logical a k a objective bayesian probability is a type of bayesian probability other forms of bayesianism such as the subjective interpretation are given other justifications cox wanted his system to satisfy the following conditions the postulates as stated here are taken from arnborg and sj din common sense includes consistency with aristotelian logic in the sense that logically equivalent propositions shall have the same plausibility the postulates as originally stated by cox were not mathematically rigorous although better than the informal description above e g as noted by halpern however it appears to be possible to augment them with various mathematical assumptions made either implicitly or explicitly by cox to produce a valid proof cox s notation cox s postulates and functional equations are the laws of probability derivable from these postulates are the following let formula 49 be the plausibility of the proposition formula 1 given formula 6 satisfying cox s postulates then there is a function formula 15 mapping plausibilities to interval 0 1 and a positive number formula 53 such that

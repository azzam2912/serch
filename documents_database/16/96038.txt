the exterior product of two vectors u and v denoted by is called a bivector and lives in a space called the exterior square a vector space that is distinct from the original space of vectors the magnitude of can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram with sides u and v which in three dimensions can also be computed using the cross product of the two vectors like the cross product the exterior product is anticommutative meaning that for all vectors u and v but unlike the cross product the exterior product is associative one way to visualize a bivector is as a family of parallelograms all lying in the same plane having the same area and with the same orientation a choice of clockwise or counterclockwise when regarded in this manner the exterior product of two vectors is called a 2 blade more generally the exterior product of any number k of vectors can be defined and is sometimes called a k blade it lives in a space known as the k th exterior power the magnitude of the resulting k blade is the volume of the k dimensional parallelotope whose edges are the given vectors just

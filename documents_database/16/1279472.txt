a number of control systems are available to operate locomotives on model railways analog systems where the speed and the direction of a train is controlled by adjusting the voltage on the track are still popular while they have recently given way to control systems based on computer technology some digital control systems provide the ability to independently control all aspects of operating a model railway using a minimum of wiring the rails themselves can be the only wiring required other systems are wireless control is achieved by sending a digital signal as well as power down the rails or wirelessly these digital signals can control all aspects of the model trains and accessories including signals turnouts lighting level crossings cranes turntables etc constant power is supplied to the track and digital signals are sent which require electronic decoders to be fitted to locomotives and other devices to interpret the commands controllers manage operation of locomotives with buttons for additional model features such as lighting and sound a digital system usually requires a central unit to generate digital address and command signals most central units also incorporate one or more locomotive controllers and a booster unit to generate the power

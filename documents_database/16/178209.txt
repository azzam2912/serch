development started at rolls royce in the 1940s but the design was used only briefly in the late 1950s and early 1960s before other turbofan designs replaced it however the conway engine was used in versions of the handley page victor vickers vc10 boeing 707 420 and douglas dc 8 40 the name conway is the english spelling of the river conwy in wales in keeping with rolls use of river names for gas turbine engines in early jet engines the exhaust was much faster and hotter than it had to be for efficient thrust contrary to the ideal froude efficiency capturing some of that energy would improve the fuel economy of the engine the turboprop engine is an obvious example which uses a series of additional turbine stages to capture the exhaust energy and power a propeller however there is a trade off in propeller efficiency compared to forward speed so turboprop engines are only efficient at speeds of up to this means there is a sweet spot between the efficiencies of the turboprop at low speeds and the jet at high speeds that was not being directly tackled this spot between about and was precisely where the vast

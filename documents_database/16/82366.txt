that is it satisfies the condition in terms of the entries of the matrix if formula 1 denotes the entry in the formula 2 th row and formula 3 th column then the skew symmetric condition is equivalent to the matrix is skew symmetric because throughout we assume that all matrix entries belong to a field formula 6 whose characteristic is not equal to 2 that is we assume that where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity and 0 the additive identity of the given field if the characteristic of the field is 2 then a skew symmetric matrix is the same thing as a symmetric matrix as a result of the first two properties above the set of all skew symmetric matrices of a fixed size forms a vector space the space of formula 15 skew symmetric matrices has dimension formula 16 let formula 17 denote the space of formula 15 matrices a skew symmetric matrix is determined by formula 19 scalars the number of entries above the main diagonal a symmetric matrix is determined by formula 20 scalars the number of entries on or above the main diagonal let formula 21 denote the space of formula 15 skew symmetric

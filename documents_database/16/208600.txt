the name is for marshall stone and john in quantum mechanics physical observables are represented mathematically by linear operators on hilbert spaces for a single particle moving on the real line there are two important observables position and momentum in the schr dinger representation quantum description of such a particle the position operator and momentum operator are respectively given by on the domain of infinitely differentiable functions of compact support on assume to be a fixed non zero real number in quantum theory is up to a factor of planck s constant which is not dimensionless it takes a small numerical value in terms of action units of the macroscopic world the operators satisfy the canonical commutation relation lie algebra already in his classic book hermann weyl observed that this commutation law was impossible to satisfy for linear operators acting on finite dimensional spaces unless vanishes this is apparent from taking the trace over both sides of the latter equation and using the relation the left hand side is zero the right hand side is non zero further analysis shows that in fact any two self adjoint operators satisfying the above commutation relation cannot be both bounded for notational convenience

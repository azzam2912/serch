the species foraging strategy involves climbing the trunks of trees in search of invertebrate prey on and under bark although some populations within the species range have declined the species iucn conservation status is of least concern the white browed treecreeper climacteris affinis is one of 7 species of australo papuan endemic treecreepers family climacteridae prior to the development of molecular diagnostic techniques the relationship of climacteridae to other avian families was long debated phylogenetic analysis has since revealed the family to be most closely related to bowerbirds and catbirds family ptilonorhynchidae together these two families are thought to represent one of the most ancient linages of songbirds oscines suborder passeri diverging early during the rise and radiation of oscines in australia the further split between climacteridae and ptilonorhynchidae is estimated to have occurred 58 7 35 2 million years ago within climacteridae two genera are recognised climacteris and cormobates molecular analysis estimates the divergence between genera to have occurred during the eocene early miocene period this estimate is further supported by the recovery of fossils referred to both genera within early miocene deposits in queensland australia these ancient fossils all exhibit morphological features associated with scansorial tree trunk climbing

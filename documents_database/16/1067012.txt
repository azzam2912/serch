the models consist of numeric representations of positions velocities and accelerations of major solar system bodies tabulated at equally spaced intervals of time covering a specified span of years barycentric rectangular coordinates of the sun eight major planets and pluto and geocentric coordinates of the moon are tabulated de405 created in may 1997 include both nutations and librations and is considered the fundamental planetary and lunar ephemerides of the astronomical almanac it is very large at 62 4 megabytes so smaller more targeted versions have been created based on de405 there have been many versions of the jpl de from the 1960s through the present in support of both robotic and manned spacecraft missions available documentation is sketchy but we know de69 was announced in 1969 to be the third release of the jpl ephemeris tapes and was a special purpose short duration ephemeris the then current jpl export ephemeris was de19 these early releases were distributed on magnetic tape in the days before personal computers computers were large and expensive and numerical integrations such as these were run by large organizations with ample resources the jpl ephemerides prior to de405 were integrated on a univac mainframe in double precision

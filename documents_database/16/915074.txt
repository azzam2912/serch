the disorder damages motor neurons which are specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement symptoms of jpls begin in early childhood and progress over a period of 15 to 20 years early symptoms include clumsiness muscle spasms weakness and stiffness in the legs and difficulty with balance as symptoms progress they become more serious and include weakness and stiffness in the arms and hands slurred speech drooling difficulty swallowing and an inability to walk juvenile primary lateral sclerosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered most often parents of affected individuals each carry one copy of the altered gene but do not show any signs or symptoms mutations in the als2 gene found on chromosome 2 are responsible for causing juvenile primary lateral sclerosis the als2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alsin alsin is abundant in motor neurons but its function is not fully understood mutations in the als2 gene in this disorder disrupt the instructions for producing alsin as a result alsin is unstable and decays rapidly or it is disabled and cannot function properly it is currently

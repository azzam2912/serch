when the cache is full the algorithm must choose which items to discard to make room for the new ones due to the inherent caching capability of nodes in information centric networking icn the icn can be viewed as a loosely connect network of caches which has unique requirements of caching policies unlike proxy servers in information centric networking the cache is a network level solution therefore it has rapidly changing cache states and higher request arrival rates moreover smaller cache sizes further impose different kind of requirements on the content eviction policies in particular eviction policies for information centric networking should be fast and lightweight various cache replication and eviction schemes for different information centric networking architectures and applications are proposed the time aware least recently used tlru is a variant of lru designed for the situation where the stored contents in cache have a valid life time the algorithm is suitable in network cache applications such as information centric networking icn content delivery networks cdns and distributed networks in general tlru introduces a new term ttu time to use ttu is a time stamp of a content page which stipulates the usability time for the content based on

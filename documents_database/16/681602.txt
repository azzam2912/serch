environmental radioactivity is not limited solely to actinides non actinides such as radon and radium are of note generally ingested insoluble actinide compounds such as high fired uranium dioxide and mixed oxide mox fuel will pass through the digestive system with little effect since they cannot dissolve and be absorbed by the body inhaled actinide compounds however will be more damaging as they remain in the lungs and irradiate the lung tissue ingested low fired oxides and soluble salts such as nitrate can be absorbed into the blood stream if they are inhaled then it is possible for the solid to dissolve and leave the lungs hence the dose to the lungs will be lower for the soluble form in india a large amount of thorium ore can be found in the form of monazite in placer deposits of the western and eastern coastal dune sands particularly in the tamil nadu coastal areas the residents of this area are exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average thorium is found at low levels in most rocks and soils where it is about three times more abundant than uranium and is about as common as

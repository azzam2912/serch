carson s rule does not apply well when the modulating signal contains discontinuities such as a square wave carson s rule originates from john renshaw carson s 1922 paper carson s bandwidth rule is expressed by the relation for example a typical vhf uhf two way radio signal using fm mode with 5 khz peak deviation and a maximum audio frequency of 3 khz would require an approximate bandwidth of 2 5 3 16 khz standard broadcast stereo fm with a peak deviation of 75 khz has a highest modulating frequency which combines l r and l r of 53 khz most of the energy therefore falls within an approximate bandwidth of 2 75 53 256 khz geographically close fm broadcast transmitters are almost always assigned nominal center frequencies at least 400 khz apart carson s bandwidth rule is often applied to transmitters antennas optical sources receivers photodetectors and other communications system components any frequency modulated signal will have an infinite number of sidebands and hence an infinite bandwidth but in practice all significant sideband energy 98 or more is concentrated within the bandwidth defined by carson s rule it is a useful approximation but setting the arbitrary definition of

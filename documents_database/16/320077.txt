it refers to the problem of finding a polynomial p of degree d such that certain derivatives have specified values at specified points where the data points formula 2 and the nonnegative integers formula 3 are given it differs from hermite interpolation in that it is possible to specify derivatives of p at some points without specifying the lower derivatives or the polynomial itself the name refers to george david birkhoff who first studied the problem in in contrast to lagrange interpolation and hermite interpolation a birkhoff interpolation problem does not always have a unique solution for instance there is no quadratic polynomial formula 4 such that formula 5 and formula 6 on the other hand the birkhoff interpolation problem where the values of formula 7 formula 8 and formula 9 are given always has a unique solution an important problem in the theory of birkhoff interpolation is to classify those problems that have a unique solution formulates the problem as follows let d denote the number of conditions as above and let k be the number of interpolation points given a d by k matrix e all of whose entries are either 0 or 1 such that exactly d

in particular proteasome subunit beta type 5 along with other beta subunits assemble into two heptameric rings and subsequently a proteolytic chamber for substrate degradation this protein contains chymotrypsin like activity and is capable of cleaving after large hydrophobic residues of peptide the eukaryotic proteasome recognized degradable proteins including damaged proteins for protein quality control purpose or key regulatory protein components for dynamic biological processes the constitutive subunit beta1 beta2 and beta 5 systematic nomenclature can be replaced by their inducible counterparts beta1i 2i and 5i when cells are under the treatment of interferon the resulting proteasome complex becomes the so called immunoproteasome an essential function of the modified proteasome complex the immunoproteasome is the processing of numerous mhc class i restricted t cell epitopes this gene encodes a member of the proteasome b type family also known as the t1b family that is a 20s core beta subunit this gene is located in the class ii region of the mhc major histocompatibility complex expression of this gene is induced by gamma interferon and this gene product replaces catalytic subunit 3 proteasome beta 5 subunit in the immunoproteasome proteolytic processing is required to generate a mature subunit two alternative transcripts

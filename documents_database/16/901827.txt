the style had a more general influence outside the university including in america but has been somewhat out of fashion since then it is sometimes said that the style originated from a ban in 1924 on the wearing of plus fours by oxford and cambridge undergraduates at lectures the bagginess allegedly allowed plus fours to be hidden underneath but the argument is undermined by the fact that the trousers especially in the early years were not sufficiently voluminous for this to be done with any success other theories include claims that the style was invented by harold acton of christ church or by bob boothby of magdalen but there is evidence of the term at least being used at significantly earlier dates the original trousers were in circumference at the bottoms but became increasingly larger to or more possibly due to misunderstanding of the measurement as the width rather than circumference the style made a comeback in 1970s britain among fans of northern soul a popular 1970s music movement the style was worn as a practical measure to enable fans to make the energetic and elaborate dance moves associated with the northern soul scene

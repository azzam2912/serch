it was invented by joseph desimone alexander and nikita ermoshkin and edward t samulski and was originally owned by eipi systems but is now being developed by carbon the continuous process begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light the window an ultraviolet light beam shines through the window illuminating the precise cross section of the object the light causes the resin to solidify the object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object an oxygen permeable membrane lies below the resin which creates a dead zone persistent liquid interface preventing the resin from attaching to the window photopolymerization is inhibited between the window and the polymerizer unlike stereolithography the printing process is continuous the inventors claim that it can creat objects up to 100 times faster than commercial three dimensional 3d printing methods clip objects have smooth sides unlike 2015 commercial 3d printers whose sides are typically rough to the touch some resins produce objects that are rubbery and flexible that could not be produced with earlier methods clip was at the time the original patent was filed an

the meagre subsets of a fixed space form a ideal of subsets that is any subset of a meagre set is meagre and the union of countably many meagre sets is meagre general topologists use the term baire space to refer to a broad class of topological spaces on which the notion of meagre set is not trivial in particular the entire space is not meagre descriptive set theorists mostly study meagre sets as subsets of the real numbers or more generally any polish space and reserve the term baire space for one particular polish space the complement of a meagre set is a comeagre set or residual set given a topological space x a subset a of x is meagre if it can be expressed as the union of countably many nowhere dense subsets of x dually a comeagre set is one whose complement is meagre or equivalently the intersection of countably many sets with dense interiors a subset b of x is nowhere dense if for each neighbourhood u of x the set formula 1 is not dense in u equivalently b is nowhere dense if its closure contains no nontrivial open set the complement of a nowhere

when relating this mechanism to the pharmaceutical sciences mucoadhesion describes the attractive forces between a biological material and mucus or mucous membrane mucous membranes adhere to epithelial surfaces such as the gastrointestinal tract gi tract the vagina the lung the eye etc they are generally hydrophilic as they contain many hydrogen macromolecules due to the large amount of water approximately 95 within its composition however mucin also contains glycoproteins that enable the formation of a gel like substance understanding the hydrophilic bonding and adhesion mechanisms of mucus to biological material is of utmost importance in order to produce the most efficient applications for example in drug delivery systems the mucus layer must be penetrated in order to effectively transport micro or nanosized drug particles into the body mucoadhesion involves several types of bonding mechanisms and it is the interaction between each process that allows for the adhesive process the major categories are wetting theory adsorption theory diffusion theory electronic theory and fracture theory specific processes include mechanical interlocking electrostatic diffusion interpenetration adsorption and fracture processes wetting theory wetting is the oldest and most prevalent theory of adhesion the adhesive components in a liquid solution anchor themselves in irregularities on the

krylov studied at lomonosov university where he in 1966 under e b dynkin attained a doctoral candidate title similar to a phd and in 1973 a russian doctoral degree somewhat more prestigious than a phd he taught from 1966 to 1990 at the lomonosov university and is since 1990 a professor at the university of minnesota at the beginning of his career starting from 1963 he in collaboration with dynkin worked on nonlinear stochastic control theory making advances in the study of convex nonlinear partial equations of 2nd order i e bellman equations which were examined with stochastic methods this led to the evans krylov theory for which he received with lawrence c evans in 2004 the leroy p steele prize of the american mathematical society for work done simultaneously and independently by both krylov and evans they proved the second order differentiability h lder continuity of the second derivative of the solutions of convex completely nonlinear second order elliptical partial differential equations and thus the existence of classical solutions theorem of evans krylov he was in 1978 at helsinki and in 1986 at berkeley an invited speaker for the icm he received the humboldt research award in 2001 in

it is an axiom of topology that the intersection of any finite family of open sets is open in alexandrov topologies the finite restriction is dropped a set together with an alexandrov topology is known as an alexandrov discrete space or finitely generated space alexandrov topologies are uniquely determined by their specialization preorders indeed given any preorder on a set x there is a unique alexandrov topology on x for which the specialization preorder is the open sets are just the upper sets with respect to thus alexandrov topologies on x are in one to one correspondence with preorders on x alexandrov discrete spaces are also called finitely generated spaces since their topology is uniquely determined by the family of all finite subspaces alexandrov discrete spaces can thus be viewed as a generalization of finite topological spaces due to the fact that inverse images commute with arbitrary unions and intersections the property of being an alexandrov discrete space is preserved under quotients alexandrov discrete spaces are named after the russian topologist pavel alexandrov they should not be confused with the more geometrical alexandrov spaces introduced by the russian mathematician aleksandr danilovich aleksandrov alexandrov topologies have numerous characterizations let x be

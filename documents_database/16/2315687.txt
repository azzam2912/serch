after falling from favour during the reign of antiochus i antiochus entered into the service of ashoka the mauryan king and wrote extensively about his exploration of the indian ocean born in cyprus his family moved to macedonia at some point during the reign of philip ii little else is known about his early years until he is mentioned by arrian 3 35 3 as a minor commander during alexander the great s siege of tyre in 332 since much of the remainder of alexander s campaign was land based there was little opportunity for antiochus to demonstrate his naval talents in battle however he was evidently highly regarded because he is mentioned by arrian 7 1 17 as one of the leading commanders of the fleet led by nearchus in 324 the sources for the early hellenistic period are notoriously problematic and there are large gaps in our knowledge so we cannot establish antiochus exact role in the years immediately after alexander s death in 323 however by 310 he was serving seleucus i diodorus of sicily 18 15 3 and later commanded the seleucid fleet plutarch life of demetrius 37 2 despite serving seleucus with distinction winning victory

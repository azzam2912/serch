it ensures that information is not lost due to dropped packets and that packets are received in the correct order it is the simplest automatic repeat request arq mechanism a stop and wait arq sender sends one frame at a time it is a special case of the general sliding window protocol with transmit and receive window sizes equal to one and greater than one respectively after sending each frame the sender doesn t send any further frames until it receives an acknowledgement ack signal after receiving a valid frame the receiver sends an ack if the ack does not reach the sender before a certain time known as the timeout the sender sends the same frame again the timeout countdown is reset after each frame transmission the above behavior is a basic example of stop and wait however real life implementations vary to address certain issues of design typically the transmitter adds a redundancy check number to the end of each frame the receiver uses the redundancy check number to check for possible damage if the receiver sees that the frame is good it sends an ack if the receiver sees that the frame is damaged the receiver discards

this unmanned orbiter was to map the surface of venus using high resolution imaging systems the spacecraft was identical to venera 16 and based on modifications to the earlier venera space probes venera 15 was launched on june 2 1983 at 02 38 39 utc and reached venus orbit on october 10 1983 the spacecraft was inserted into venus orbit a day apart from venera 16 with its orbital plane shifted by an angle of approximately 4 relative to the other probe this made it possible to reimage an area if necessary the spacecraft was in a nearly polar orbit with a periapsis 1000 km at 62 n latitude and apoapsis 65000 km with an inclination 90 the orbital period being 24 hours together with venera 16 the spacecraft imaged the area from the north pole down to about 30 n latitude i e approx 25 of venus surface over the 8 months of mapping operations the venera 15 and 16 spacecraft were identical and were based on modifications to the orbiter portions of the venera 9 and venera 14 probes each spacecraft consisted of a long cylinder with a diameter tall parabolic dish antenna for the synthetic aperture radar

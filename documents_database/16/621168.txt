drosophila melanogaster is one of the favorite organisms for studying biological phenomena the border cells of the drosophila ovary are a genetically tractable system for studying diverse aspects of moving phenotype after identifying the genes that are important for this phenotype their homologs can be investigated for putative roles in turning non invasive cancerous tumors into metastatic ones the egg chamber of the drosophila ovary contains 16 central germline cells surrounded by a monolayer epithelium of about 1000 follicle cells at stage 9 of drosophila oogenesis these cells perform a stereotypical invasive migration on the intervening nurse cells and reach the oocyte the migration consists of an initial posterior migration followed by another in the dorsal direction it is now known that the transcription factor slbo slow border cells is a master regulator of the migratory phenotype the migratory cluster is initiated by jak stat pathway and is guided by the growth of long cellular extensions the directional cues are provided by receptor tyrosine kinases cells that undergo such a change in fate as migratory border cells have two distinct alternatives reorganize the existing proteins or bring about massive changes in gene expression in our case the latter case seems

these represent the force that a north magnetic pole would experience at any given point denser lines indicate a stronger force plasmas exhibit more complex second order behaviors studied as part of magnetohydrodynamics thus in the closed model of the magnetosphere the magnetopause boundary between the magnetosphere and the solar wind is outlined by field lines not much plasma can cross such a stiff boundary its only weak points are the two polar cusps the points where field lines closing at noon z axis gsm get separated from those closing at midnight z axis gsm at such points the field intensity on the boundary is zero posing no barrier to the entry of plasma this simple definition assumes a noon midnight plane of symmetry but closed fields lacking such symmetry also must have cusps by the fixed point theorem the amount of solar wind energy and plasma entering the actual magnetosphere depends on how far it departs from such a closed configuration i e the extent to which interplanetary magnetic field field lines manage to cross the boundary as discussed further below that extent depends very much on the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field in particular on its southward

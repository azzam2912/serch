thus for the resulting system of eight points and eight planes each point lies on four planes the three planes defining it as a vertex of a tetrahedron and the fourth plane from the other tetrahedron that it lies on and each plane contains four points the three tetrahedron vertices of its face and the vertex from the other tetrahedron that lies on it the configuration is named after august ferdinand m bius who in 1828 proved that if two tetrahedra have the property that seven of their vertices lie on corresponding face planes of the other tetrahedron then the eighth vertex also lies on the plane of its corresponding face forming a configuration of this type this incidence theorem is true more generally in a three dimensional projective space if and only if pappus s theorem holds for that space reidemeister sch nhardt and it is true for a three dimensional space modeled on a division ring if and only if the ring satisfies the commutative law and is therefore a field al dhahir by projective duality m bius result is equivalent to the statement that if seven of the eight face planes of two tetrahedra contain the corresponding

they are used in bioelectrochemical syntheses environmental remediation and electrochemical energy conversion examples of bioelectrochemical reactors include microbial electrolysis cells microbial fuel cells and enzymatic biofuel cells and electrolysis cells microbial electrosynthesis cells and biobatteries this bioreactor is divided in two parts the anode where the oxidation reaction takes place and the cathode where the reduction occurs in 1911 m potter described how microbial conversions could create reducing power and thus electric current twenty years later cohen 1931 investigated the capacity of bacteria to produce an electrical flow and he noted that the main limitation is the small capacity of microorganism to current generation it took until the 60 s since berg and canfield 1964 built the first microbial fuel cell mfc nowadays the investigation on bioelectrochemical reactors is increasing exponentially these devices have real applications in fields like water treatment energy production and storage resources production recycling and recovery electron current is inherent to the microbial metabolism microorganisms transfer electrons from an electron donor lower potential species to an electron acceptor higher potential species if the electron acceptor is an external ion or molecule the process is called respiration if the process is internal electron transfer is called fermentation

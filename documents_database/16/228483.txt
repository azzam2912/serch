to calculate the first class constraint one assumes that there are no second class constraints or that they have been calculated previously and their dirac brackets generated first and second class constraints were introduced by as a way of quantizing mechanical systems such as gauge theories where the symplectic form is degenerate the terminology of first and second class constraints is confusingly similar to that of primary and secondary constraints reflecting the manner in which these are generated these divisions are independent both first and second class constraints can be either primary or secondary so this gives altogether four different classes of constraints consider a symplectic manifold m with a smooth hamiltonian over it for field theories m would be infinite dimensional suppose we have some constraints for n smooth functions these will only be defined chartwise in general suppose that everywhere on the constrained set the n derivatives of the n functions are all linearly independent and also that the poisson brackets and all vanish on the constrained subspace this means we can write for some smooth functions formula 6 there is a theorem showing this and for some smooth functions formula 8 this can be done globally using

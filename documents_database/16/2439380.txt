it is an all trans stereoisomer this white waxy solid is classified as an nonaisoprenoid solanesol is a non cyclic terpene alcohol that consists of nine isoprene units and mainly accumulates in solanaceous plants such as tobacco potato and tomato it is extractable from the stems and leaves of solanaceous species it is notable as the biosynthetic precursor to coenzyme q solanesol is a non cyclic terpene alcohol that consists of nine isoprene units and mainly accumulates in solanaceous plants such as tobacco potato and tomato it is also accumulates in eggplant and pepper plants it is notable as the biosynthetic precursor to coenzyme q the leaf tobacco contains the tobacco specific compound solanesol it is found in tobacco smoke and in the emissions of heat not burn tobacco products tobacco has the highest solanesol content amongst all solanaceous plants it is extractable from tobacco waste solanesol is a secondary metabolite various plants produce numerous highly specific terpenoids that play important roles in plant environment interactions in tobacco solanesol might participate in the immune response towards pathogens in a 2017 study by bajda et al the solanesol content in resistant tobacco varieties increased by more than 7 times one week

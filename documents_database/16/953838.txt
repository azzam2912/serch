it was a redesign of the maschinengewehr 08 machine gun itself an adaptation of the maxim gun system intended for use on aircraft and zeppelins that used a toggle action that broke upwards rather than downwards opposite the mg 08 making for a much more compact receiver the fusee spring was dispensed with for an internal spring design the breech block was completely different and the spent cartridges dropped out the bottom of the receiver rather than being ejected forward through a hole under the breech from the receiver there appears to be no action or receiver parts interchangeable with the mg 08 the mg 08 s belt style ammunition feed was enclosed in a drum the recoil casing was lightened and the cooling jacket was modified for air instead of water cooling the rate of fire was 700 rounds minute the belt was reduced to 30 mm in width the mg 14 and following on mg 14 17 did make one important contribution to the fixed forward firing lmg 08 s and lmg s 08 15 s in that their 30mm wide cloth ammunition belt was compatible with those weapons as the fixed forward firing guns used fixed ammunition

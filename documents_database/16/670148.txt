it is still common to use talairach coordinates in functional brain imaging studies and to target transcranial stimulation of brain regions however alternative methods such as the mni coordinate system originated at the montreal neurological institute and hospital have largely replaced talairach for stereotaxy and other procedures the coordinate system was first created by neurosurgeons jean talairach and gabor szikla in their work on the talairach atlas in 1967 creating a standardized grid for neurosurgery the grid was based on the idea that distances to lesions in the brain are proportional to overall brain size i e the distance between two structures is larger in a larger brain in 1988 a second edition of the talairach atlas came out that was coauthored by tournoux and it is sometimes known as the talairach tournoux system this atlas was based on single post mortem dissection of a human brain the talairach atlas uses brodmann areas as the labels for brain regions the talairach coordinate system is defined by making two anchors the anterior commissure and posterior commissure lie on a straight horizontal line since these two points lie on the midsagittal plane the coordinate system is completely defined by requiring this plane

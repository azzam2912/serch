this rigidity makes the compound bow more energy efficient than other bows as less energy is dissipated in limb movement the higher rigidity higher technology construction also improves accuracy by reducing the bow s sensitivity to changes in temperature and humidity the pulley cam system also confers a benefit called let off as the string is drawn back the cams rotate the cams are eccentric rather than round and so their effective radius changes as they rotate each of a compound bow s two cams features two tracks an inner track which connects to the opposite limb or opposite cam through cables and an outer track through which the bowstring runs as the bow is drawn the ratio of bowstring pay out and cable take up relative to limb weight and leverage of the cams changes by manipulation of the shapes of these cam tracks different draw stroke profiles can be created a compound bow can be soft drawing with a slow build up to peak weight and a gradual let off with a long valley at the end it can also be hard drawing with a very fast build up to peak draw weight a long plateau where weight

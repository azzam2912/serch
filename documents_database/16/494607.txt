the similar term axoplasm refers to the cytoplasm of an axon the axolemma is responsible for maintaining the membrane potential of the axon and contains ion channels through which ions can flow rapidly when this occurs the voltage inside the axon changes and depolarization or hyperpolarization of the membrane can occur adequate depolarization can lead to an action potential which travels down the axon in a self propagating manner as more ion channels open due to stimulation by the influx of positive ions an unmyelinated axolemma has a high capacitance which imposes a restraint on the conduction speed the constricted axon segment is one of the few locations in which there is ten times more schwann cell membrane than axolemma while other portions they have equal distributions if the axolemma is damaged it becomes unable to perform its vital role of maintaining the concentration gradient of ions inside and outside the cell when ions move down their concentration gradient into the cell they can cause a number of different cellular processes that may lead to cell damage or cell death axolemma is involved in preventing the hyperexcitability of gray matter axons

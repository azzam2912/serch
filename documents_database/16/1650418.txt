these occur in the natural language processing subfield of computer science and assign probabilities to given sequences of words by means of a probability distribution statistical language models are key components of speech recognition systems and of many machine translation systems they tell such systems which possible output word sequences are probable and which are improbable the particular characteristic of a cache language model is that it contains a cache component and assigns relatively high probabilities to words or word sequences that occur elsewhere in a given text the primary but by no means sole use of cache language models is in speech recognition systems to understand why it is a good idea for a statistical language model to contain a cache component one might consider someone who is dictating a letter about elephants to a speech recognition system standard non cache n gram language models will assign a very low probability to the word elephant because it is a very rare word in english if the speech recognition system does not contain a cache component the person dictating the letter may be annoyed each time the word elephant is spoken another sequence of words with a higher probability according

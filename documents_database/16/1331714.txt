protochlorophyllide is highly fluorescent mutants that accumulate it glow red if irradiated with blue light in angiosperms the last step conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll is light dependent and such plants are pale chlorotic if grown in the darkness gymnosperms algae and photosynthetic bacteria have another light independent enzyme and grow green in the darkness as well the enzyme that converts protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide is protochlorophyllide reductase ec 1 3 1 33 there are two structurally unrelated proteins with this activity the light dependent and the dark operative the light dependent reductase needs light to operate the dark operative version is a completely different protein consisting of three subunits that exhibit significant sequence similarity to the three subunits of nitrogenase which catalyzes the formation of ammonia from dinitrogen this enzyme might be evolutionary older but being similar to nitrogenase is highly sensitive to free oxygen and does not work if its concentration exceeds about 3 hence the alternative light dependent version needed to evolve most of the photosynthetic bacteria have both light dependent and light independent reductases angiosperms have lost the dark operative form and rely on 3 slightly different copies of light dependent version frequently abbreviated as por a

it consists of a star shaped wheel free to turn suspended over a trough of the liquid metal mercury with the points dipping into the mercury between the poles of a horseshoe magnet a dc electric current passes from the hub of the wheel through the wheel into the mercury and out through an electrical contact dipping into the mercury the lorentz force of the magnetic field on the moving charges in the wheel causes the wheel to rotate the presence of serrations on the wheel is unnecessary and the apparatus will work with a round metal disk usually made of copper it is used as a demonstration of electromagnetism in physics education because mercury is toxic brine is sometimes used in place of mercury in modern recreations of the experiment action of a magnet on current and how rotational motion is produced due to this can be shown by barlow s wheel experiment the apparatus consists of a star shaped copper wheel capable of rotating freely in a vertical plane about a horizontal axis the point of each spoke of the star just dips into a pool of mercury kept in a small groove on the wooden base of

much of the arctic shows little impact from human activities making it one of the few places on earth one can see intact ecosystems arctic plants are adapted to short cold growing seasons they have the ability to withstand extremely cold temperatures in the winter winter hardiness but what is even more important is the ability to be able to function in limiting summer conditions arctic plants have a compressed growing season they initiate growth rapidly in the spring and flower and set seed much sooner than plants that grow in warmer conditions their peak metabolic rate also occurs at a much lower temperature than plants from farther south compact cushions of vegetation keep the plants close to the warm soil and shield the tender central growing shoot the height of arctic plants is also governed by snow depth plants that protrude above the snow are subject to strong winds blowing snow and being eaten by caribou muskox or ptarmigan mosses and lichens are common in the arctic these plants have the ability to stop growth at any time and resume it promptly when conditions improve they can even survive being covered by snow and ice for over a year

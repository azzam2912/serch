genes and culture continually interact in a feedback loop changes in genes can lead to changes in culture which can then influence genetic selection and vice versa one of the theory s central claims is that culture evolves partly through a darwinian selection process which dual inheritance theorists often describe by analogy to genetic evolution culture in this context is defined as socially learned behavior and social learning is defined as copying behaviors observed in others or acquiring behaviors through being taught by others most of the modelling done in the field relies on the first dynamic copying though it can be extended to teaching social learning at its simplest involves blind copying of behaviors from a model someone observed behaving though it is also understood to have many potential biases including success bias copying from those who are perceived to be better off status bias copying from those with higher status homophily copying from those most like ourselves conformist bias disproportionately picking up behaviors that more people are performing etc understanding social learning is a system of pattern replication and understanding that there are different rates of survival for different socially learned cultural variants this sets up by definition

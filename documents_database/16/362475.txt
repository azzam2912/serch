in cell biology it is most commonly described as the region between the inner membrane and the outer membrane of a mitochondrion or a chloroplast it also refers to the space between the inner and outer nuclear membranes of the nuclear envelope but is often called the perinuclear space the ims of mitochondria plays a crucial role in coordinating a variety of cellular activities such as regulation of respiration and metabolic functions unlike the ims of the mitochondria the ims of the chloroplast does not seem to have any obvious function mitochondria are surrounded by two membranes consisting of outer and inner mitochondrial membranes these two membranes allow the formation of two aqueous compartments which are the intermembrane space ims and the matrix channel proteins called porins in the outer membrane allow free diffusion of ions and small proteins about 5000 daltons or less into the ims this makes the ims chemically equivalent to the cytosol regarding the small molecules it contains by contrast specific transport proteins are required to transport ions and other small molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the matrix due to its impermeability the ims also contains many enzymes that use the atp moving out

classical information theory goes back to claude shannon it is a theory of information transmission looking at communication and storage however it has not been considered so far that information comes from different sources and that it is therefore usually combined it has furthermore been neglected in classical information theory that one wants to extract those parts out of a piece of information that are relevant to specific questions a mathematical phrasing of these operations leads to an algebra of information describing basic modes of information processing such an algebra involves several formalisms of computer science which seem to be different on the surface relational databases multiple systems of formal logic or numerical problems of linear algebra it allows the development of generic procedures of information processing and thus a unification of basic methods of computer science in particular of distributed information processing information relates to precise questions comes from different sources must be aggregated and can be focused on questions of interest starting from these considerations information algebras are two sorted algebras formula 1 where formula 2 is a semigroup representing combination or aggregation of information formula 3 is a lattice of domains related to questions whose partial order

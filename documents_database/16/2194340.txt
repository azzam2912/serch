initially the goal is to provide improved file i o performance but the bigger goal is to have some new features which are much easier to develop and maintain inside the kernel and expose the layers fully directions can be attributed to sections where samba is moving to few modules inside the kernel to have features like remote direct memory access rdma to work with actual performance gain the subset of performance related operations belong in kernelspace and the other subset which belong to operations which are not really related with performance in userspace so dce rpc management that has historically resulted into number of buffer overflow issues and dangerous security bugs and winreg and user account management are implemented in user space as cifsd file operations that are related with performance open read write close etc in kernel space kcifsd this also allows for easier integration with vfs interface for all file operations when the server daemon is started it starts up a forker thread kcifsd 0 at initialization time and open a dedicated port 445 for listening to smb requests whenever new clients make request forker thread will accept the client connection and fork a new thread for

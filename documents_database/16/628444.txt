direct digital control takes a centralized network oriented approach all instrumentation is gathered by various analog and digital converters which use the network to transport these signals to the central controller the centralized computer then follows all of its production rules which may incorporate sense points anywhere in the structure and causes actions to be sent via the same network to valves actuators and other heating ventilating and air conditioning components that can be adjusted central controllers and most terminal unit controllers are programmable meaning the direct digital control program code may be customized for the intended use the program features include time schedules setpoints controllers logic timers trend logs and alarms the unit controllers typically have analog and digital inputs that allow measurement of the variable temperature humidity or pressure and analog and digital outputs for control of the medium hot cold water and or steam digital inputs are typically dry contacts from a control device and analog inputs are typically a voltage or current measurement from a variable temperature humidity velocity or pressure sensing device digital outputs are typically relay contacts used to start and stop equipment and analog outputs are typically voltage or current signals to control

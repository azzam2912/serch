the most time consuming operation of the algorithm is the multiplication of matrix formula 1 by a vector so it is effective for a very large sparse matrix with appropriate implementation the power iteration algorithm starts with a vector formula 8 which may be an approximation to the dominant eigenvector or a random vector the method is described by the recurrence relation so at every iteration the vector formula 10 is multiplied by the matrix formula 1 and normalized if we assume formula 1 has an eigenvalue that is strictly greater in magnitude than its other eigenvalues and the starting vector formula 8 has a nonzero component in the direction of an eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue then a subsequence formula 14 converges to an eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue without the two assumptions above the sequence formula 14 does not necessarily converge in this sequence where formula 17 is an eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue and formula 18 the presence of the term formula 19 implies that formula 20 does not converge unless formula 21 under the two assumptions listed above the sequence formula 22 defined by converges to the dominant eigenvalue one may compute this

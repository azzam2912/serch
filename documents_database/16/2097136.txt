chemically it is a series of fused cyclobutane rings a ladderane with all cis all syn geometry that wraps around to join its ends and form a band with cycloalkane edges their chemical formula is ch where n is the number of cyclobutane sides the size of the cycloalkane base and that number also forms the basis for a system of nomenclature within this class the first few chemicals in this class are triprismane tetraprismane and pentaprismane have been synthesized and studied experimentally and many higher members of the series have been studied using computer models the first several members do indeed have the geometry of a regular prism with flat n gon bases as n becomes increasingly large however modeling experiments find that highly symmetric geometry is no longer stable and the molecule distorts into less symmetric forms one series of modelling experiments found that starting with 11 prismane the regular prism form is not a stable geometry for example the structure of 12 prismane would have the cyclobutane chain twisted with the dodecagonal bases non planar and non parallel for large base sizes some of the cyclobutanes can be fused anti to each other giving a non convex

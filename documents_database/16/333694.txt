the name is a portmanteau by elision of gust front tornado as gustnadoes form due to non tornadic straight line wind features in the downdraft outflow specifically within the gust front of strong thunderstorms gustnadoes tend to be noticed when the vortices loft sufficient debris or form condensation cloud to be visible although it is the wind that makes the gustnado similarly to tornadoes as these eddies very rarely connect from the surface to the cloud base they are very rarely considered as tornadoes the gustnado has little in common with tornadoes structurally or dynamically in regard to vertical development intensity longevity or formative process as classic tornadoes are associated with mesocyclones within the inflow updraft of the storm not the outflow the average gustnado lasts a few seconds to a few minutes although there can be several generations and simultaneous swarms most have the winds of an ef 0 or ef 1 tornado up to 110 mph or 177 km h and are commonly mistaken for tornadoes however unlike tornadoes the rotating column of air in a gustnado usually does not extend all the way to the base of the thundercloud gustnadoes actually have more in common with minor

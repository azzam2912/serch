unfortunately the standardization process was too long and regarding to the technology progress in this area once the standard was finally agreed it was obsolete it generally uses 64 kbit s channel as the basic unit of switching it has a circuit switching orientation its major contribution was frame relay it describes telecommunication that carries voice information in a narrow band of frequencies n isdn basic rate is too low so for home as for business today n isdn may be partly saved but by an unexpected application internet access various companies now sell isdn adapters that combine the 2b d channels into a single 144 kbit s digital channel many internet providers also support these adapters so the people can access the internet over a 144 kbit s digital link instead of a 28 8 kbit s analog modem link and for affordable price that may be a niche for n isdn for the next few years n isdn is also known as normal isdn narrowband refers to data communication and telecommunications tools technologies and services that utilize a narrower set or band of frequencies in the communication channel these utilize the channel frequency that is considered flat or

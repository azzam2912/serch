both the trihydrate and tetrahydrate are known it is an orange yellow solid a common precursor to other gold compounds and an intermediate in the purification of gold metal both the trihydrate and tetrahydrate are available commercially chloroauric acid is a strong monoprotic acid the crystalline tetrahydrate is known to contain and two water molecules the anion has square planar molecular geometry the au cl distances are around 2 28 other d complexes adopt similar structures e g ptcl solid chloroauric acid is a hydrophilic ionic protic solute it is soluble not only in water but also in many oxygen containing solvents such as alcohols esters ethers and ketones for example in dry dibutyl ether of diethylene glycol the solubility exceeds 1 mol l saturated solutions in the organic solvents often are the liquid solvates of specific stoichiometry when heated in air solid haucl ho melts in the water of crystallization quickly darkens and becomes dark brown upon treating chloroauric acid with a standard base it converts to metal tetrachloridoaurate and water the related thallium salt is poorly soluble in all nonreacting solvents salts of quaternary ammonium cations are known other complex salts include au bipy cl aucl and co

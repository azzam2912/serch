at the critical point of such functionals the result is the euler equations a set of equations describing the fluid flow note that the mentioned difficulties do not arise when describing the flow through a variational principle in the lagrangian reference frame in case of surface gravity waves the clebsch representation leads to a rotational flow form of luke s variational principle for the clebsch representation to be possible the vector field formula 7 has locally to be bounded continuous and sufficiently smooth for global applicability formula 7 has to decay fast enough towards infinity the clebsch decomposition is not unique and two additional constraints are necessary to uniquely define the clebsch potentials since formula 9 is in general not solenoidal the clebsch representation does not in general satisfy the helmholtz decomposition the vorticity formula 10 is equal to with the last step due to the vector calculus identity formula 12 so the vorticity formula 13 is perpendicular to both formula 14 and formula 15 while further the vorticity does not depend on formula 16

they were the successors to the initial bristol 400 although mechanically the 401 and 402 used an improved version of the bmw m328 hemi head engine and its unusual arrangement of two separate pushrods to operate the exhaust valves necessitated by the hemispherical combustion chambers and opposite facing valves used in the 400 the styling was a huge advance on the pre war bodies of that first bristol model it was inspired by the milanese designer carrozzeria touring and its most notable feature was that the door handles were not exposed and to open the doors the owner pressed a button into a groove in the door the body also was more spacious than the 400 and was a full five seater at the front the 401 and 402 were also quite distinctive with their headlights moved quite a distance into the centre of the body on either side of the narrow grille which resembled bmw a little less than did the 400 they were also deeply curved at the front this along with the then unique door handle arrangement is believed to give the 401 a drag coefficient of less than cd 0 36 competitive even by today s

it is used to quantify the ability of pathogenic bacteria to invade eukaryotic cells the assay is based on several observations made in the 1970s in which the ability of internalized bacteria to avoid killing by antibiotics was reported the assay started to be used in biological research in the early 1980s intracellular bacteria need to enter host cells cells of the infected organism in order to replicate and propagate infection many species of shigella causes bacillary dysentery salmonella typhoid fever mycobacterium leprosy and tuberculosis and listeria listeriosis to name but a few are intracellular several antibiotics cannot penetrate eukaryotic cells therefore these antibiotics cannot hurt intracellular bacteria that are already internalized using such antibiotics enables us to differentiate between bacteria that succeed in penetrating eukaryotic cells and those that do not applying such an antibiotic to a culture of eukaryotic cells infected with bacteria would kill the bacteria that remain outside the cells while sparing the ones that penetrated the antibiotic of choice for this assay is the aminoglycoside gentamicin hela cells are commonly used as eukaryotic cells in the gentamicin protection assay but other cells can be used as well as for bacteria only species susceptible to gentamicin

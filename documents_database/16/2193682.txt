therefore specialists have developed criteria for the selection of proper adequate respirators including the assigned protection factors apf the decrease of the concentration of harmful substances in the inhaled air which is expected to be provided with timely and proper use of a certified respirator of certain types design by taught and trained workers after individual selection with a tight fitting mask and fit testing when the employer performs an effective respiratory protective device programme the imperfection of technological processes machines and other equipment can lead to air contamination with harmful substances in the workplace protecting of the workers health in this situation may be achieved with different ways listed below in order of decreasing of their effectiveness if the use of these methods is impossible or if their use did not reduce the concentration of harmful substances to a safe value workers must use respirators these respirators must be sufficiently effective and they should correspond to known or expected conditions at the workplace however it is the least effective method of protection and the reasons for the decrease of their efficiency often are non usage of the respirators in the contaminated atmosphere leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps

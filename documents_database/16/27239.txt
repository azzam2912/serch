this means it uses light in the visible and adjacent ranges the absorption or reflectance in the visible range directly affects the perceived color of the chemicals involved in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum atoms and molecules undergo electronic transitions absorption spectroscopy is complementary to fluorescence spectroscopy in that fluorescence deals with transitions from the excited state to the ground state while absorption measures transitions from the ground state to the excited state molecules containing bonding and non bonding electrons n electrons can absorb energy in the form of ultraviolet or visible light to excite these electrons to higher anti bonding molecular orbitals the more easily excited the electrons i e lower energy gap between the homo and the lumo the longer the wavelength of light it can absorb there are four possible types of transitions n and n and they can be ordered as follows n n uv vis spectroscopy is routinely used in analytical chemistry for the quantitative determination of different analytes such as transition metal ions highly conjugated organic compounds and biological macromolecules spectroscopic analysis is commonly carried out in solutions but solids and gases may also be studied the beer lambert law states that the

it scans text converts the image into text by means of optical character recognition and uses a speech synthesizer to read out what it has found the first prototype of reading machine called optophone was developed by dr edmund fournier d albe of birmingham university in 1913 five vertically aligned photo detectors were used to scan a line of printed text each cell generated a different tone g c d e g8 when detecting black print so that each character was associated with a specific time varying chords of tones with some practice blind users were able to interpret this audio output as a meaningful message however the reading speed of this device was very slow approximately one word per minute from 1944 until up to the 1970s new prototypes of reading machine were developed at haskins laboratories under contract from the veterans administration the research project was conducted by caryl parker haskins franklin s cooper and alvin liberman their first attempts to improve the optophone all ended in failures and users were still unable to read more than 5 words per minutes in average even after long training sessions this observation led alvin liberman to suppose that the limitation

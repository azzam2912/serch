its statement is as follows let x x be independent identically distributed random variables uniform on 0 1 we observe the x s sequentially and must stop on exactly one of them no recall of preceding observations is permitted what stopping rule minimizes the expected rank of the selected observation and what is its corresponding value the general solution to this full information expected rank problem is unknown the major difficulty is that the problem is fully history dependent that is the optimal rule depends at every stage on all preceding values and not only on simpler sufficient statistics of these only bounds are known for the limiting value v as n goes to infinity namely 1 908 secretary problems would be solved but the major reason is to understand how to cope with full history dependence in a deceptively easy looking problem on the ester s book international conference in israel 2006 robbins problem was accordingly named one of the four most important problems in the field of optimal stopping and sequential analysis herbert robbins presented the above described problem at the international conference on search and selection in real time in amherst 1990 he concluded his address with

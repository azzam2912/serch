in the early years of the office an appointment as serjeant might be temporary and might cover only a part of the country in contrast to england for many years there was only one serjeant at law in ireland who was known as the king s serjeant or simply serjeant in 1627 another office holder was appointed and they were known as the prime serjeant and second serjeant in 1682 a third serjeant was appointed in 1805 the prime serjeant became known as first serjeant until the nineteenth century the need for three serjeants was often questioned especially as the office of third serjeant was often left vacant for years it seems that third serjeant was created simply as a form of consolation prize for sir john lyndon the first holder of the office who had been passed over as both a high court judge and as second serjeant and that no particular duties attached to the office certainly sir richard ryves the recorder of dublin was able to combine that notoriously gruelling office with the position of third serjeant and later second serjeant which suggests that he was not greatly troubled with overwork in his role as serjeant alan

there exist s that is in more formal terms of symbolic logic it is a theorem with a prenex normal form involving the existential quantifier many such theorems will not do so explicitly as usually stated in standard mathematical language for example the statement that the sine function is continuous or any theorem written in big o notation the quantification can be found in the definitions of the concepts used a controversy that goes back to the early twentieth century concerns the issue of purely theoretic existence theorems i e theorems depending on non constructive foundational material such as the axiom of infinity the axiom of choice or the law of excluded middle such theorems provide no indication as to how to exhibit or construct the object whose existence is claimed from a constructivist viewpoint by admitting them mathematics loses its concrete applicability the opposing viewpoint is that abstract methods are far reaching in a way that numerical analysis cannot be an existence theorem is purely theoretical if the proof given of it does not also indicate a construction of the kind of object whose existence is asserted such a proof is non constructive and the point is that the

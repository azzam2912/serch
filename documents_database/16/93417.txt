the momentum delivered to the target however cannot be any more than that due to recoil on the shooter this is because the momentum imparted to the bullet is equal to that imparted to the gun shooter system from a thermodynamic point of view a firearm is a special type of piston engine or in general heat engine where the bullet has a function of a piston the energy conversion efficiency of a firearm strongly depends on its construction especially on its caliber and barrel length however for illustration here is the energy balance of a typical small firearm for 300 hawk ammunition which is comparable with a typical piston engine higher efficiency can be achieved in longer barrel firearms because they have better volume ratio however the efficiency gain is less than corresponding to the volume ratio because the expansion is not truly adiabatic and burnt gas becomes cold faster because of exchange of heat with the barrel large firearms such as cannons achieve smaller barrel heating loss because they have better volume to surface ratio high barrel diameter is also helpful because lower barrel friction is induced by sealing compared to the accelerating force the force is proportional

it was discovered on 9 september 1934 by dutch astronomer hendrik van gent at the union observatory in johannesburg south africa the asteroid was named after a character in the dutch play op hoop van zegen by herman heijermans kniertje is a member of the adeona family a large family of carbonaceous asteroids in the central main belt named after 145 adeona it is also dynamically classified as a member of the eunomia family the largest in the intermediate main belt with more than 5 000 stony asteroids the asteroid orbits the sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2 2 3 2 au once every 4 years and 5 months 1 599 days its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 18 and an inclination of 12 with respect to the ecliptic the body s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at johannesburg in 1934 kniertje s spectral type is unknown although the lcdb assumes an s type due to its dynamical classification to the stony eunomia family a low albedo of 0 0701 is derived see below which is typical for carbonaceous c type asteroids and in agreement with the overall spectral type of

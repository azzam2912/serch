it includes the families coronaviridae arteriviridae roniviridae and mesoniviridae the order nidovirales is named for the latin nidus meaning nest as all viruses in this order produce a 3 co terminal nested set of subgenomic mrna s during infection this group consists of viruses which have positive sense single stranded rna genomes as positive sense genomes the viruses can use some host cell proteins during replication and gene expression which occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell this group of viruses expresses structural proteins separately from the nonstructural ones the structural proteins are encoded at the 3 region of the genome and are expressed from a set of subgenomic mrnas these viruses encode one main proteinase and between one and three accessory proteinases which are mainly involved in expressing the replicase gene these proteinases are also responsible for activating or inactivating specific proteins at the correct time in the virus life cycle ensuring replication occurs at the right time a large number of proteins have been identified on the genomes of nidovirales but their function has not yet been determined other enzymes that may be present in the genome include papain like proteases adp ribose poly adp ribose binding

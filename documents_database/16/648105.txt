the term folk music can not be easily defined in a precise manner it is used with widely varying definitions depending on the author intended audience and context within a work similarly the term traditions in this context does not connote any strictly defined criteria music scholars journalists audiences record industry individuals politicians nationalists and demagogues may often have occasion to address which fields of folk music are distinct traditions based along racial geographic linguistic religious tribal or ethnic lines and all such peoples will likely use different criteria to decide what constitutes a folk music tradition this list uses the same general categories used by mainstream primarily english language scholarly sources as determined by relevant statements of fact and the internal structure of works these traditions may coincide entirely partially or not at all with geographic political linguistic or cultural boundaries very few if any music scholars would claim that there are any folk music traditions that can be considered specific to a distinct group of people and with characteristics undiluted by contact with the music of other peoples thus the folk music traditions described herein overlap in varying degrees with each other

generally the strong lensing effect requires the projected lens mass density greater than the critical density that is formula 1 for point like background sources there will be multiple images for extended background emissions there can be arcs or rings topologically the multiple image production is governed by the odd number theorem the strong lensing was predicted by albert einstein s general theory of relativity and observationally discovered by dennis walsh bob carswell and ray weymann in 1979 they determined that the twin quasar q0957 561a comprises two images of the same object most strong gravitational lenses are detected by large scale galaxy surveys the foreground lens is a galaxy when the background source is a quasar or unresolved jet the strong lensed images are usually point like multiple images when the background source is a galaxy or extended jet emission the strong lensed images can be arcs or rings as of 2017 several hundred galaxy galaxy g g strong lenses have been observed the upcoming large synoptic survey telescope and euclid surveys are expected to discover more than 100 000 such objects the foreground lens is a galaxy cluster in this case the lens is usually powerful enough to

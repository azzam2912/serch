this is especially relevant on workpieces cast or forged where the spotface s smooth flat accurately located surface stands in distinction to the surrounding surface whose roughness flatness and location are subject to wider tolerances and thus not assured with a machining level of precision the most common application of spotfacing spot facing is facing the area around a bolt hole where the bolt s head will sit which is often done by cutting a shallow counterbore just deep enough to clean up that is only enough material is removed to get down past any irregularity and thus make the surface flat other common applications of spotfacing involve facing a pad onto a boss creating planar surfaces in known locations that can orient a casting or forging into position in the assembly allow part marking such as stamping or nameplate riveting or offer machine finish visual appeal in spots without the need for finishing all over fao the cutters most often used to cut spotfaces are counterbore cutters and endmills in manual machining especially the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location established by the bolt hole and its cutting lips are perpendicular to

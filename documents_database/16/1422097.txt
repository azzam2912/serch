the lava cools and breaks up as it encounters the water with the resulting fragments filling in the adjacent seabed topography such that the flow can move further offshore sub aerially lava deltas are generally associated with large scale effusive type basaltic volcanism lava deltas are found mainly associated with volcanic islands particularly those formed at hotspots as they produce the necessary effusive basaltic flows the largest lava delta systems known are associated with formation of volcanic type passive margins just prior to break up along the northern atlantic in the late paleocene massive eruptions occurred along the eventual line of break up this volcanism part of the north atlantic igneous province led to the formation of two extensive lava escarpments interpreted as deltas extending from the faeroes onto the more margin the faeroe shetland escarpment and the v ring escarpment on the v ring margin a combined distance of approximately as these deltas were prograding into water of relatively constant depth they were able to extend as much as from their original vents when a sub aerial lava flow reaches the ocean or other large body of water contact with the water causes both rapid cooling of the lava

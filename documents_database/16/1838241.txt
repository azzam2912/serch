like many crops potatoes are likely to be affected by changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide temperature and precipitation as well as interactions between these factors as well as affecting potatoes directly climate change will also affect the distributions and populations of many potato diseases and pests potato is one of the world s most important food crops potato production must be adapted to climate change to avoid reductions in crop yields potato plants and potato crop yields are predicted to benefit from increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere the major benefit of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide for potatoes and other plants is an increase in their photosynthetic rates which can increase their growth rates potato crop yields are also predicted to benefit because potatoes partition more starch to the edible tubers under elevated carbon dioxide levels higher levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide also results in potatoes having to open their stomata less to take up an equal amount of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis which means less water loss through transpiration from stomata as a result the water use efficiency the amount of carbon assimilated per unit water lost of potato plants is predicted to increase potatoes grow best under

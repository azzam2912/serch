the exercise helps build muscular shoulders with bigger arms and is one of the most difficult compound upper body exercises the overhead press is set up by taking a barbell or other weight and putting it in racking position this can be done by taking the weight from a rack or by cleaning the weight from the floor clean and press the weight is then pressed to overhead until the elbows are fully locked out as the weight clears the head the lifter leans forward slightly or comes directly under in order to keep balance as the weight is lowered back to racking position and clears the head again the lifter leans slightly back the overhead press is a highly effective compound full body exercise the exercise can be done sitting or standing with alternating arms or with a hammer grip in which the palms face each other performing it standing recruits many more muscle groups in order to maintain balance and support the lift rather than performing it seated like the squat and deadlift it can be thought of as a whole body exercise to some extent the overhead press can be performed with any type of weight equipment

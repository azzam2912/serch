mdf is generally denser than plywood it is made up of separated fibres but can be used as a building material similar in application to plywood it is stronger and much denser than particle board the name derives from the distinction in densities of fibreboard large scale production of mdf began in the 1980s in both north america and europe over time the term mdf has become a generic name for any dry process fibre board mdf is typically made up of 82 wood fibre 9 urea formaldehyde resin glue 8 water and 1 paraffin wax and the density is typically between 500 kg m 31 lb ft and 1 000 kg m 62 lb ft the range of density and classification as light standard or high density board is a misnomer and confusing the density of the board when evaluated in relation to the density of the fibre that goes into making the panel is important a thick mdf panel at a density of 700 720 kg m may be considered as high density in the case of softwood fibre panels whereas a panel of the same density made of hard wood fibres is not regarded as so the

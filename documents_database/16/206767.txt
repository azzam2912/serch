it has been continuously updated since then the name originates from pople s use of gaussian orbitals to speed up molecular electronic structure calculations as opposed to using slater type orbitals a choice made to improve performance on the limited computing capacities of then current computer hardware for hartree fock calculations the current version of the program is gaussian 16 originally available through the quantum chemistry program exchange it was later licensed out of carnegie mellon university and since 1987 has been developed and licensed by gaussian inc according to the most recent gaussian manual the package can do gaussian 70 gaussian 76 gaussian 80 gaussian 82 gaussian 86 gaussian 88 gaussian 90 gaussian 92 gaussian 92 dft gaussian 94 gaussian 98 gaussian 03 gaussian 09 and gaussian 16 other programs named gaussian xx were placed among the holdings of the quantum chemistry program exchange these were unofficial unverified ports of the program to other computer platforms in the past gaussian inc has attracted controversy for its licensing terms that stipulate that researchers who develop competing software packages are not permitted to use the software some scientists consider these terms overly restrictive the anonymous group bannedbygaussian org has published a

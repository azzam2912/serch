the result was first proved by bruno courcelle in 1990 and independently rediscovered by it is considered the archetype of algorithmic meta theorems in one variation of monadic second order graph logic known as mso the graph is described by a set of vertices v and a binary adjacency relation adj and the restriction to monadic logic means that the graph property in question may be defined in terms of sets of vertices of the given graph but not in terms of sets of edges or sets of tuples of vertices as an example the property of a graph being colorable with three colors represented by three sets of vertices r g and b may be defined by the monadic second order formula the first part of this formula ensures that the three color classes cover all the vertices of the graph and the second ensures that they each form an independent set it would also be possible to add clauses to the formula to ensure that the three color classes are disjoint but this makes no difference to the result thus by courcelle s theorem 3 colorability of graphs of bounded treewidth may be tested in linear time for

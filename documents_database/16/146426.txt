pyroclastic surge refers to a specific type of pyroclastic current which moves on the ground as a turbulent flow with low particle concentration high ratio of gas to rock with support mainly from the gas phase pyroclastic surges are thus more mobile and less confined compared to dense pyroclastic flows which allows them to override ridges and hills rather than always travel downhill the velocity of the head of pyroclastic density currents has been measured directly via e g photography as for the case of mount st helens reaching estimates for other recent eruptions range from less than 10 m s up to 100 m s pyroclastic flows may generate surges for example the city of saint pierre in martinique was overcome by a pyroclastic surge in 1902 pyroclastic surges can be subdivided into three types base surge ash cloud surge and ground surge first recognized after the taal volcano eruption of 1965 in the philippines where a visiting volcanologist from usgs recognized the phenomenon as comparable to base surge in nuclear explosions very similar to the ground hugging blasts associated with nuclear explosions these surges are expanding rings of turbulent mixture of fragments and gas that surge outward at

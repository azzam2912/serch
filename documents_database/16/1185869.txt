the size of these groups as expressed by the number of people etc in a group such as eight groups of nine people in each one is an important aspect of their social environment group size tend to be highly variable even within the same species thus we often need statistical measures to quantify group size and statistical tests to compare these measures between two or more samples group size measures are notoriously hard to handle statistically since groups sizes typically follow an aggregated right skewed distribution most groups are small few are large and a very few are very large statistical measures of group size roughly fall into two categories as jarman 1974 pointed out average individuals live in groups larger than average therefore when we wish to characterize a typical average individual s social environment we should apply non parametric estimations of group size reiczigel et al 2008 proposed the following measures imagine a sample with three groups where group sizes are one two and six individuals respectively then generally speaking given there are g groups with sizes n n n mean crowding can be calculated as due to the aggregated right skewed distribution of group members among

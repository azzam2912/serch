they are also used for industrial process measurements such as thickness gauging in the paper and steel industries sources can be sealed in a container highly penetrating radiation or deposited on a surface weakly penetrating radiation or they can be in a fluid as an irradiation source they are used in medicine for radiation therapy and in industry for such as industrial radiography food irradiation sterilization vermin disinfestation and irradiation crosslinking of pvc radionuclides are chosen according to the type and character of the radiation they emit intensity of emission and the half life of their decay common source radionuclides include cobalt 60 iridium 192 and strontium 90 the si measurement quantity of source activity is the becquerel though the historical unit curies is still in partial use such as in the usa despite their nist strongly advising the use of the si unit the si unit for health purposes is mandatory in the eu an irradiation source typically lasts for between 5 and 15 years before its activity drops below useful levels however sources with long half life radionuclides when utilised as calibration sources can be used for much longer many radioactive sources are sealed meaning they are permanently

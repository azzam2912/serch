the links of such a manipulator are connected by joints allowing either rotational motion such as in an articulated robot or translational linear displacement the links of the manipulator can be considered to form a kinematic chain the terminus of the kinematic chain of the manipulator is called the end effector and it is analogous to the human hand in space the space shuttle remote manipulator system also known as canadarm or srms and its successor canadarm2 are examples of multi degree of freedom robotic arms these robotic arms have been used to perform a variety of tasks such as inspection of the space shuttle using a specially deployed boom with cameras and sensors attached at the end effector and also satellite deployment and retrieval manoeuvres from the cargo bay of the space shuttle the curiosity rover on the planet mars also uses a robotic arm tagsam is a robotic arm for collecting a sample from a small asteroid in space on the spacecraft osiris rex the 2018 mars lander insight has a robotic arm called the ida it has camera grappler is used to move special instruments in the decade of 2010 the availability of low cost robotic arms

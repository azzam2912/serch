the mass formula is often given for integral quadratic forms though it can be generalized to quadratic forms over any algebraic number field in 0 and 1 dimensions the mass formula is trivial in 2 dimensions it is essentially equivalent to dirichlet s class number formulas for imaginary quadratic fields and in 3 dimensions some partial results were given by gotthold eisenstein the mass formula in higher dimensions was first given by though his results were forgotten for many years it was rediscovered by and an error in minkowski s paper was found and corrected by many published versions of the mass formula have errors in particular the 2 adic densities are difficult to get right and it is sometimes forgotten that the trivial cases of dimensions 0 and 1 are different from the cases of dimension at least 2 for recent proofs of the mass formula see and the smith minkowski siegel mass formula is essentially the constant term of the weil siegel formula if f is an n dimensional positive definite integral quadratic form or lattice then the mass of its genus is defined to be where the sum is over all integrally inequivalent forms in the same

because it has the orbit of a main belt asteroid and showed the tail of a comet it was listed as a main belt comet but within a month of discovery an analysis of images by the hubble telescope suggested that its tail was generated by dust and gravel resulting from a recent head on collision between asteroids rather than from sublimation of cometary ice this was the first time a small body collision had been observed since then minor planet 596 scheila has also been seen to undergo a collision in late 2010 the position of the nucleus was remarkable for being offset from the axis of the tail and outside the dust halo a situation never before seen in a comet the tail is created by millimeter sized particles being pushed back by solar radiation pressure p 2010 a2 was discovered on january 6 2010 by lincoln near earth asteroid research linear using a 1 meter 36 reflecting telescope with a ccd camera it was linear s 193rd comet discovery it has been observed over a 112 day arc of the 3 5 year orbit it appears to have come to perihelion closest approach to the sun around

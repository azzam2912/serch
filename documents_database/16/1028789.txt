steffensen s method also achieves quadratic convergence but without using derivatives as newton s method does the simplest form of the formula for steffensen s method occurs when it is used to find the zeros or roots of a function formula 1 that is to find the value formula 2 that satisfies formula 3 near the solution formula 2 the function formula 1 is supposed to approximately satisfy formula 6 this condition makes formula 1 adequate as a correction function for formula 8 for finding its own solution although it is not required to work efficiently for some functions steffensen s method can work even if this condition is not met but in such a case the starting value formula 9 must be very close to the actual solution formula 2 and convergence to the solution may be slow given an adequate starting value formula 9 a sequence of values formula 12 can be generated using the formula below when it works each value in the sequence is much closer to the solution formula 2 than the prior value the value formula 14 from the current step generates the value formula 15 for the next step via this formula for

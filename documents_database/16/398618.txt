the lower order control points are normally used for engineering construction and navigation the scientific discipline that deals with the establishing of coordinates of points in a high order control network is called geodesy and the technical discipline that does the same for points in a low order control network is called surveying after a cartographer registers key points in a digital map to the real world coordinates of those points on the ground the map is then said to be in control having a base map and other data in geodetic control means that they will overlay correctly when map layers are not in control it requires extra work to adjust them to line up which introduces additional error those real world coordinates are generally in some particular map projection unit and geodetic datum in classical geodesy up to the sixties control networks were established by triangulation using measurements of angles and of some spare distances the precise orientation to the geographic north is achieved through methods of geodetic astronomy the principal instruments used are theodolites and tacheometers which nowadays are equipped with infrared distance measuring data bases communication systems and partly by satellite links electronic distance measurement edm

they were formerly placed in the sylviidae which at that time was a wastebin taxon for the warbler like sylvioidea the range of this genus extends from europe to southeast asia the genus gets its name from the cetti s warbler itself named after the 18th century italian zoologist francesco cetti the cettiid or typical bush warblers share the lifestyle and related adaptations and apomorphies with bradypterus the other genus called bush warblers however bradypterus is related to the grass warblers of locustella and megalurus and is more distant from cettia both bush warbler genera are smallish birds well adapted to climbing among shrubbery they are markedly long tailed birds at first glance somewhat reminiscent of wrens these are quite terrestrial birds which live in densely vegetated habitats such as thick forest and reedbeds they will walk away from disturbance rather than flush the plumage similarities and skulking lifestyle makes these birds hard to see and identify cettid bush warblers tend towards rich or greyish browns above and buffish or light grey tones below they have little patterning apart from the ubiquitous supercilium altogether they appear much like the plainer species among acrocephalus marsh warblers in coloration megalurid bush warblers

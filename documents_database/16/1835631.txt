an avoidable pattern is one for which there are infinitely many words no part of which match the pattern zimin words are an example of unavoidable patterns these are formed by inserting a new letter between two instances of the previous zimin word i e the first zimin word a is used to create the second zimin word aba which in turn creates abacaba and then abacabadabacaba and so on it is unavoidable that any string containing two unique characters that is five or more characters long will contain a pattern of the form aba the second zimin word using three unique characters any string containing 29 or more characters will contain a pattern of the form abacaba let a be an alphabet of letters and e a disjoint alphabet of pattern symbols or variables elements of e are patterns for a pattern p the pattern language is that subset of a containing all words h p where h is a non erasing semigroup morphism from the free monoid e to a a word w in a matches or meets p if it contains some word in the pattern language as a factor otherwise w avoids p a pattern p

longistyles is a valid botanic name for a subseries of banksia it was published by kevin thiele in 1996 but discarded by alex george in 1999 the name came about after a cladistic analysis of banksia by thiele and pauline ladiges yielded a phylogeny somewhat at odds with the accepted taxonomic arrangement prompting them to publish a revised arrangement their cladogram contained clade a consisting of b tricuspis lesueur banksia and all of the taxa in george s b ser abietinae implying that george s b ser abietinae could be rendered monophyletic by transferring b tricuspis into it this clade resolved into four subclades for which thiele published four corresponding subseries b subser longistyles was based upon the second subclade b subser longistyles was formally defined as containing those taxa with very long and slender styles and with smoothly convex perianth limbs without a costal ridge and with thickened margins the epithet longistyles is from the latin longus long and stylus style although the nearest outgroup of b subser longistyles was the clade corresponding to b subser nutantes the subseries was placed after all the other subseries in thiele and ladiges taxonomic arrangement the placement and circumscription of b subser

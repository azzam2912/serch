it is characterized by an extremely elevated blast cell count and symptoms of decreased tissue perfusion the pathophysiology of leukostasis is not well understood but inadequate delivery of oxygen to the body s cells is the end result leukostasis is diagnosed when white cell plugs are seen in the microvasculature the most common symptoms are dyspnea and hypoxia usually accompanied by visual changes headaches dizziness confusion somnolence and coma prompt treatment is indicated since if left untreated it has a very high mortality rate treatments aim to rapidly reduce white blood cell counts while also treating the underlying disorder symptomatic hyperleukocytosis leukostasis is defined by a tremendously high blast cell count along with symptoms of decreased tissue perfusion leukostasis is associated with people who suffer from bone and blood disorders and is very common among people suffering from acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia leukostasis is a pathologic diagnosis that inhibits efficient flow to the microvasculature of the body continued and untreated leukostasis presents respiratory and neurological distress simultaneously and is a medical emergency with untreated patient mortality rates reaching a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 40 percent a leukemia blood cell count greater than 50 x

by synchronizing an oscillator with the colorburst at the back porch beginning of each scan line a television receiver is able to restore the suppressed carrier of the chrominance color signals and in turn decode the color information the most common use of colorburst is to genlock equipment together as a common reference with a vision mixer in a television studio using a multi camera setup in ntsc its frequency is exactly 315 88 3 579 mhz with a phase of 180 pal uses a frequency of exactly 4 43361875 mhz with its phase alternating between 135 and 225 from line to line since the colorburst signal has a known amplitude it is sometimes used as a reference level when compensating for amplitude variations in the overall signal secam is unique in not having a colorburst signal since the chrominance signals are encoded using fm rather than qam thus the signal phase is immaterial and no reference point is needed the original black and white ntsc television standard specified a frame rate of 30 hz and 525 lines per frame or 15750 lines per second the audio was frequency modulated 4 5 mhz above the video signal because this was

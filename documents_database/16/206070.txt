a common use of the sensors is to construct a world model which allows location aware or context aware applications to be constructed one famous research prototype of a sentient computing system was the work at at t laboratories cambridge now defunct it consisted of an ultrasonic indoor location system called the active bats which provided a location accuracy of about 3 cm the world model was managed via the spirit database using corba to access information and spatial indexing to deliver high level events such as alice has entered the kitchen to listening context aware applications the research continues at the digital technology group at the university of cambridge some example applications of the system include a context adaptive system typically enables the user to maintain a certain application in different forms while roaming between different wireless access technologies locations devices and even simultaneously executing everyday tasks like meetings driving a car etc for example a context adaptive and hence ubiquitous navigation system would offer navigation support in the situations at home indoor outdoor and in car this involves making the navigation functionality available for different availability of output devices input devices and location sensors as well as adapting

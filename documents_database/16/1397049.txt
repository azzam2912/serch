atmospheric methane concentrations are of interest because it is one of the most potent greenhouse gases in earth s atmosphere atmospheric methane is rising the 20 year global warming potential of methane is 84 that is over a 20 year period it traps 84 times more heat per mass unit than carbon dioxide and 32 times the effect when accounting for aerosol interactions global methane concentrations rose from 722 parts per billion ppb in pre industrial times to 1866 ppb by 2019 an increase by a factor of 2 5 and the highest value in at least 800 000 years its concentration is higher in the northern hemisphere since most sources both natural and human are located on land and the northern hemisphere has more land mass the concentrations vary seasonally with for example a minimum in the northern tropics during april may mainly due to removal by the hydroxyl radical early in the earth s history carbon dioxide and methane likely produced a greenhouse effect the carbon dioxide would have been produced by volcanoes and the methane by early microbes during this time earth s earliest life appeared these first ancient bacteria added to the methane concentration by converting

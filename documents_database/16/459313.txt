catalytic triads are most commonly found in hydrolase and transferase enzymes e g proteases amidases esterases acylases lipases and lactamases an acid base nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis the residues form a charge relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile which attacks the substrate forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to release the product and regenerate free enzyme the nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid but occasionally threonine or even selenocysteine the 3d structure of the enzyme brings together the triad residues in a precise orientation even though they may be far apart in the sequence primary structure as well as divergent evolution of function and even the triad s nucleophile catalytic triads show some of the best examples of convergent evolution chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry the enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin were first purified in the 1930s a serine in each of trypsin and chymotrypsin was identified as the catalytic nucleophile by diisopropyl fluorophosphate modification in

heat is generated by friction between the rotating tool and the workpiece material which leads to a softened region near the fsw tool while the tool is traversed along the joint line it mechanically intermixes the two pieces of metal and forges the hot and softened metal by the mechanical pressure which is applied by the tool much like joining clay or dough it was primarily used on wrought or extruded aluminium and particularly for structures which need very high weld strength fsw is capable of joining aluminium alloys cooper alloys titanium alloys mild steel stainless steel and magnesium alloys more recently it was successfully used in welding of polymers in addition joining of dissimilar metals such as aluminium to magnesium alloys has been recently achieved by fsw application of fsw can be found in modern shipbuilding trains and aerospace applications it was invented and experimentally proven at the welding institute twi in the uk in december 1991 twi held patents on the process the first being the most descriptive a rotating cylindrical tool with a profiled probe is fed into a butt joint between two clamped workpieces until the shoulder which has a larger diameter than the pin touches

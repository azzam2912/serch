the semantics stabilized as of version 2 5 59 and they are present in the 2 6 x stable kernel series the seqlocks were developed by stephen hemminger and originally called frlocks based on earlier work by andrea arcangeli the first implementation was in the x86 64 time code where it was needed to synchronize with user space where it was not possible to use a real lock it is a reader writer consistent mechanism which avoids the problem of writer starvation a seqlock consists of storage for saving a sequence number in addition to a lock the lock is to support synchronization between two writers and the counter is for indicating consistency in readers in addition to updating the shared data the writer increments the sequence number both after acquiring the lock and before releasing the lock readers read the sequence number before and after reading the shared data if the sequence number is odd on either occasion a writer had taken the lock while the data was being read and it may have changed if the sequence numbers are different a writer has changed the data while it was being read in either case readers simply retry using

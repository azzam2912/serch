williamson hypothesised 1964 that profit maximization would not be the objective of the managers of a joint stock organisation this theory like other managerial theories of the firm assumes that utility maximisation is a manager s sole objective however it is only in a corporate form of business organisation that a self interest seeking manager maximise his her own utility since there exists a separation of ownership and control the managers can use their discretion to frame and execute policies which would maximise their own utilities rather than maximising the shareholders utilities this is essentially the principal agent problem this could however threaten their job security if a minimum level of profit is not attained by the firm to distribute among the shareholders the basic assumptions of the model are the managerial utility function includes variables such as salary job security power status dominance prestige and professional excellence of managers of these salary is the only quantitative variable and thus measurable the other variables are non pecuniary which are non quantifiable the variables expenditure on staff salary management slack discretionary investments can be assigned nominal values thus these will be used as proxy variables to measure the real or unquantifiable

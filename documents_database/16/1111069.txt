methylglyoxal is produced naturally as a byproduct of normal biochemistry but is highly toxic due to its chemical reactions with proteins nucleic acids and other cellular components the second detoxification step in which r s lactoylglutathione is split into glutathione and d lactate is carried out by glyoxalase ii a hydrolase unusually these reactions carried out by the glyoxalase system does not oxidize glutathione which usually acts as a redox coenzyme although aldose reductase can also detoxify methylgloxal the glyoxalase system is more efficient and seems to be the most important of these pathways glyoxalase i is an attractive target for the development of drugs to treat infections by some parasitic protozoa and cancer several inhibitors of glyoxalase i have been identified such as s n hydroxy n methylcarbamoyl glutathione glyoxalase i is classified as a carbon sulfur lyase although strictly speaking the enzyme does not form or break a carbon sulfur bond rather the enzyme shifts two hydrogen atoms from one carbon atom of the methylglyoxal to the adjacent carbon atom in effect the reaction is an intramolecular redox reaction one carbon is oxidized whereas the other is reduced the mechanism proceeds by subtracting and then adding protons forming

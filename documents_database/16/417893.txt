ram air inflation forces the parafoil into a classic wing cross section parafoils are most commonly constructed out of ripstop nylon the device was developed in 1964 by domina jalbert 1904 1991 jalbert had a history of designing kites and was involved in the development of hybrid balloon kite aerial platforms for carrying scientific instruments he envisaged the parafoil would be used to suspend an aerial platform or for the recovery of space equipment a patent was granted in 1966 deployment shock prevented the parafoil s immediate acceptance as a parachute it was not until the addition of a drag canopy on the riser lines known as a slider which slowed their spread that the parafoil became a suitable parachute compared to a simple round canopy a parafoil parachute has greater steerability will glide further and allows greater control of the rate of descent the parachute format is mechanically a hang glider of the free flight kite type and such aspects spawned paraglider use the air flow into the parafoil is coming more from below than the flight path might suggest so the frontmost ropes tow against the airflow when gliding the angle of attack is lowered and the airflow

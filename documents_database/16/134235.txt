the brood of western honey bees develops within a bee hive in man made removable frame hives such as langstroth hives each frame which is mainly occupied by brood is called a brood frame brood frames usually have some pollen and nectar or honey in the upper corners of the frame the rest of the brood frame cells may be empty or occupied by brood in various developmental stages during the brood raising season the bees may reuse the cells from which brood has emerged for additional brood or convert it to honey or pollen storage bees show remarkable flexibility in adapting cells to a use best suited for the hive s survival in modern removable frame hives the nursery area is in the brood chamber which beekeepers prefer to be in the bottom box in the late winter and early spring as the brood cycle begins the queen starts to lay eggs within the winter cluster in proximity to available honey stores honey bees tend to greatly expand the brood chamber as the season progresses the relative location of the brood chamber within the beehive may also change as bee keepers add more boxes or as wild bees build

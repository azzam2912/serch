this vitamin b12 dependent enzyme catalyzes the isomerization of methylmalonyl coa to succinyl coa in humans mutations in mut gene may lead to various types of methylmalonic aciduria mcm was first identified in rat liver and sheep kidney in 1955 in its latent form it is 750 amino acids in length upon entry to the mitochondria the 32 amino acid mitochondrial leader sequence at the n terminus of the protein is cleaved forming the fully processed monomer the monomers then associate into homodimers and bind adocbl one for each monomer active site to form the final active holoenzyme form the mut gene lies on the chromosome location of 6p12 3 and consists of 13 exons spanning over 35kb the mature enzyme is a homodimer with the n terminal coa binding domain and the c terminal cobalamin binding domain methylmalonyl coa mutase is expressed in high concentrations in the kidney in intermediate concentrations in the heart ovaries brain muscle and liver and in low concentrations in the spleen the enzyme can be found all throughout the central nervous system cns mcm resides in the mitochondria where a number of substances including the branched chain amino acids isoleucine and valine as well

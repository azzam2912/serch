it catalyzes formation and degradation of a significant allosteric regulator fructose 2 6 bisphosphate fru 2 6 p from substrate fructose 6 phosphate fru 2 6 p contributes to the rate determining step of glycolysis as it activates enzyme phosphofructokinase 1 in the glycolysis pathway and inhibits fructose 1 6 bisphosphatase 1 in gluconeogenesis since fru 2 6 p differentially regulates glycolysis and gluconeogenesis it can act as a key signal to switch between the opposing pathways because pfk 2 produces fru 2 6 p in response to hormonal signaling metabolism can be more sensitively and efficiently controlled to align with the organism s glycolytic needs pfk 2 is known as the bifunctional enzyme because of its notable structure though both are located on one protein homodimer its two domains act as independently functioning enzymes one terminus serves as a kinase domain for pfk 2 while the other terminus acts as a phosphatase domain fbpase 2 in mammals genetic mechanisms encode different pfk 2 isoforms to accommodate tissue specific needs while general function remains the same isoforms feature slight differences in enzymatic properties and are controlled by different methods of regulation these differences are discussed below the monomers of the

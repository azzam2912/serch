normally there are four main types in glabrous or hairless mammalian skin lamellar corpuscles tactile corpuscles merkel nerve endings and bulbous corpuscles there are also mechanoreceptors in hairy skin and the hair cells in thoreceptors of primates like rhesus monkeys and other mammals are similar to those of humans and also studied even in early 20th century anatomically and neurophysiologically invertebrate mechanoreceptors include campaniform sensilla and slit sensilla among others in somatosensory transduction the afferent neurons transmit messages through synapses in the dorsal column nuclei where second order neurons send the signal to the thalamus and synapse with third order neurons in the ventrobasal complex the third order neurons then send the signal to the somatosensory cortex more recent work has expanded the role of the cutaneous mechanoreceptors for feedback in fine motor control single action potentials from meissner s corpuscle pacinian corpuscle and ruffini ending afferents are directly linked to muscle activation whereas merkel cell neurite complex activation does not trigger muscle activity in glabrous hairless skin there are four principal types of mechanoreceptors each shaped according to its function the tactile corpuscles also known as meissner corpuscles respond to light touch and adapt rapidly to changes in texture

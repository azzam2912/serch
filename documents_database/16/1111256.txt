biotin also known as vitamin b7 is a cofactor used in carboxylation decarboxylation and transcarboxylation reactions in many organisms including humans biotin synthase is an s adenosylmethionine sam dependent enzyme that employs a radical mechanism to thiolate dethiobiotin thus converting it to biotin this radical sam enzyme belongs to the family of transferases specifically the sulfurtransferases which transfer sulfur containing groups the systematic name of this enzyme class is dethiobiotin sulfur sulfurtransferase this enzyme participates in biotin metabolism it employs one cofactor iron sulfur in 2004 the crystal structure of biotin synthase in complex with sam and dethiobiotin was determined to 3 4 angstrom resolution the pdb accession code for this structure is the protein is a homodimer meaning it is composed of two identical amino acid chains that fold together to form biotin synthase each monomer in the structure shown in figure contains a tim barrel with an 4fe 4s cluster sam and an 2fe 2s cluster the 4fe 4s cluster is used as a catalytic cofactor directly coordinating to sam orbital overlap between sam and a unique fe atom on the 4fe 4s cluster has been observed the predicted role of the 4fe 4s cofactor is to transfer

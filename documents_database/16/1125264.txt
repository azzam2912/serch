it is used to add mild corrosion resistance for appearance and to minimize light reflection to achieve maximal corrosion resistance the black oxide must be impregnated with oil or wax one of its advantages over other coatings is its minimal buildup a standard black oxide is magnetite feo which is more mechanically stable on the surface and provides better corrosion protection than red oxide rust feo modern industrial approaches to forming black oxide include the hot and mid temperature processes described below the oxide can also be formed by an electrolytic process in anodizing traditional methods are described in the article on bluing they are of interest historically and are also useful for hobbyists to form black oxide safely with little equipment and without toxic chemicals low temperature oxide also described below is not a conversion coating the low temperature process does not oxidize the iron but deposits a copper selenium compound hot baths of sodium hydroxide nitrates and nitrites at are used to convert the surface of the material into magnetite feo water must be periodically added to the bath with proper controls to prevent a steam explosion hot blackening involves dipping the part into various tanks the workpiece

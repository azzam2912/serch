this branch of the nervous system is not under conscious control and is largely responsible for the regulation of several body compartments at rest vagal activity results in various effects including heart rate reduction vasodilation constriction of vessels glandular activity in the heart lungs and digestive tract as well as control of gastrointestinal sensitivity motility and inflammation in this context tone specifically refers to the continual nature of baseline parasympathetic action that the vagus nerve exerts while baseline vagal input is constant the degree of stimulation it exerts is regulated by a balance of inputs from sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system with parasympathetic activity generally being dominant vagal tone is frequently used to assess heart function and is also useful in assessing emotional regulation and other processes that alter or are altered by changes in parasympathetic activity measurements of vagal tone can be performed by means of either invasive or noninvasive procedures invasive procedures are in the minority and include vagus nerve stimulation by manual or electrical techniques noninvasive techniques mainly rely on the investigation of heart rate and heart rate variability in most cases vagal tone is not measured directly instead the processes affected by

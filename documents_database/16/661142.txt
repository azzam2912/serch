fundamental examples are the holomorphic tangent bundle of a complex manifold and its dual the holomorphic cotangent bundle a holomorphic line bundle is a rank one holomorphic vector bundle by serre s gaga the category of holomorphic vector bundles on a smooth complex projective variety x viewed as a complex manifold is equivalent to the category of algebraic vector bundles i e locally free sheaves of finite rank on x specifically one requires that the trivialization maps are biholomorphic maps this is equivalent to requiring that the transition functions are holomorphic maps the holomorphic structure on the tangent bundle of a complex manifold is guaranteed by the remark that the derivative in the appropriate sense of a vector valued holomorphic function is itself holomorphic let be a holomorphic vector bundle a local section is said to be holomorphic if in a neighborhood of each point of it is holomorphic in some equivalently any trivialization this condition is local meaning that holomorphic sections form a sheaf on this sheaf is sometimes denoted formula 3 such a sheaf is always locally free of the same rank as the rank of the vector bundle if is the trivial line bundle formula 4 then

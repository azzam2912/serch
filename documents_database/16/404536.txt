george harrison who assisted starr with the song commented octopus s garden is ringo s song it s only the second song ringo has ever written mind you and it s lovely he added that the song gets very deep into the listener s consciousness because it s so peaceful i suppose ringo is writing cosmic songs these days without even realising it it was the last song released by the beatles featuring starr on lead vocals the idea for the song came about when starr was on a boat belonging to comedian peter sellers in sardinia in 1968 he ordered fish and chips for lunch but instead of fish he got squid it was the first time he d eaten squid and he said it was ok a bit rubbery tasted like chicken the boat s captain then told starr about how octopuses travel along the sea bed picking up stones and shiny objects with which to build gardens starr s songwriting was further inspired by his desire to escape mounting hostility among the beatles he would later admit that he had just wanted to be under the sea too uncredited assistance in developing the song s chord changes

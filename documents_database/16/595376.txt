cold potato routing is the opposite where the originating autonomous system holds onto the packet until it is as near to the destination as possible hot potato routing is the normal behavior of most settlement free peering agreements hot potato routing has the effect that the network receiving the data bears the cost of carrying it between cities when the traffic ratio the ratio of traffic flowing in one direction to the traffic flowing in the other direction between peers is reasonably even this is considered fair because the networks will share evenly in carrying traffic exchanged by their customers between cities the marginal cost of carrying traffic between cities depends on how the network has purchased those links some networks own dark fiber which can be upgraded by merely replacing the equipment on each end of the fiber and possibly the amplifiers along the path between cities in other cases the network has an agreement with a telco that allows for a specific amount of bandwidth and upgrading involves paying more money to the telco cold potato routing on the other hand is more expensive to do but keeps the traffic under the network administrator s control for longer

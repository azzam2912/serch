alumina is extracted from the ore bauxite by means of the bayer process at an alumina refinery this is an electrolytic process so an aluminium smelter uses huge amounts of electricity smelters tend to be located close to large power stations often hydro electric ones in order to reduce the overall carbon footprint this is an important consideration because large amount of carbon is also used in this process resulting in significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions smelters are often located near ports since many smelters use imported alumina the hall h roult electrolysis process is the major production route for primary aluminium an electrolysis cell is made of a steel shell with a series of insulating linings of refractory materials the cell consists of a brick lined outer steel shell as a container and support inside the shell cathode blocks are cemented together by ramming paste the top lining is in contact with the molten metal and acts as the cathode the molten electrolyte is maintained at high temperature inside the cell the prebaked anode is also made of carbon in the form of large sintered blocks suspended in the electrolyte a single soderberg electrode or a number of

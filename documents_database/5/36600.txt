it is a software binary compatible with the more famous intel 8080 with only two minor instructions added to support its added interrupt and serial input output features however it requires less support circuitry allowing simpler and less expensive microcomputer systems to be built the 5 in the part number highlighted the fact that the 8085 uses a single 5 volt v power supply by using depletion mode transistors rather than requiring the 5 v 5 v and 12 v supplies needed by the 8080 this capability matched that of the competing z80 a popular 8080 derived cpu introduced the year before these processors could be used in computers running the cp m operating system the 8085 is supplied in a 40 pin dip package to maximise the functions on the available pins the 8085 uses a multiplexed address data ad 0 ad 7 bus however an 8085 circuit requires an 8 bit address latch so intel manufactured several support chips with an address latch built in these include the 8755 with an address latch 2 kb of eprom and 16 i o pins and the 8155 with 256 bytes of ram 22 i o pins and a 14 bit

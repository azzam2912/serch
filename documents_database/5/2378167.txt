examples include hypofluorous acid hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid and hypoiodous acid the conjugate base is a hypohalite they can be formed by reacting the corresponding diatomic halogen molecule with water in the reaction this also results in the corresponding hydrogen halide which is also acidic hypohalous acids tend to be unstable only hypofluorous acid has been isolated as a solid and even it is explosive at room temperature hypochlorous acid cannot be prepared in anhydrous form hypobromous acid hypoiodous acid and their conjugate bases bromate and iodate are also unstable undergoing disproportionation reactions like and that result in the corresponding hydrogen halides halide ions and halic acids halates hypochlorous acid and hypobromous acid are each dissolved in water in order to sanitize it hypochlorous acid in swimming pools and hypobromous acid in hot tubs and spas hypohalous acids tend to be weak acids and they tend to get weaker as the halogen progresses farther down the periodic table hypochlorous acid has a p k of 7 53 the p k values of hypobromous acid is higher meaning that it is an even weaker acid at 8 65 the p k of hypoiodous acid is even higher at 10 6

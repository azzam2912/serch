the name cleo is not an acronym it is short for cleopatra and was chosen to go with cesr pronounced caesar cesr was a particle accelerator designed to collide electrons and positrons at a center of mass energy of approximately 10 gev the energy of the accelerator was chosen before the first three bottom quark upsilon resonances were discovered between 9 4 gev and 10 4 gev in 1977 the fourth resonance the 4s was slightly above the threshold for and therefore ideal for the study of b meson production cleo was a hermetic detector that in all of its versions consisted of a tracking system inside a solenoid magnet a calorimeter particle identification systems and a muon detector the detector underwent five major upgrades over the course of its thirty year lifetime both to upgrade the capabilities of the detector and to optimize it for the study of b mesons the cleo i detector began collecting data in october 1979 and cleo c finished collecting data on march 3 2008 cleo initially measured the properties of the 1 3s resonances below the threshold for producing b mesons increasing amounts of accelerator time were spent at the 4s as the

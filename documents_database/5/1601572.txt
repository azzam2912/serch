fermilab states everyone is familiar these days with the blurry and pixelated images or noisy sound transmission associated with poor internet bandwidth the holometer seeks to detect the equivalent blurriness or noise in reality itself associated with the ultimate frequency limit imposed by nature craig hogan a particle astrophysicist at fermilab states about the experiment what we re looking for is when the lasers lose step with each other we re trying to detect the smallest unit in the universe this is really great fun a sort of old fashioned physics experiment where you don t know what the result will be experimental physicist hartmut grote of the max planck institute in germany states that although he is skeptical that the apparatus will successfully detect the holographic fluctuations if the experiment is successful it would be a very strong impact to one of the most open questions in fundamental physics it would be the first proof that space time the fabric of the universe is quantized holometer has started in 2014 collecting data that will help determine whether the universe fits the holographic principle the hypothesis that holographic noise may be observed in this manner has been criticized on the

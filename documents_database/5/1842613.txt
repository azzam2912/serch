the quadratic approximation is the best fitting quadratic in the neighborhood of a point and is frequently used in engineering and science to calculate the quadratic approximation one must first calculate its gradient and hessian matrix let formula 2 for each formula 3 the hessian matrix formula 4 is the second order derivative and is a symmetric matrix for a given formula 5 this method efficiently calculates the hessian vector product formula 6 thus can be used to calculate the entire hessian by calculating formula 7 for formula 8 the method works by first using forward ad to perform formula 9 subsequently the method then calculates the gradient of formula 10 using reverse ad to yield formula 11 both of these two steps come at a time cost proportional to evaluating the function thus the entire hessian can be evaluated at a cost proportional to n evaluations of the function an algorithm that calculates the entire hessian with one forward and one reverse sweep of the computational graph is edge pushing edge pushing is the result of applying the reverse gradient to the computational graph of the gradient naturally this graph has n output nodes thus in a sense one

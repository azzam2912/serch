the new classical economics assumes that in any given market assuming that all buyers and sellers have access to information and that there is not friction impeding price changes prices always adjust up or down to ensure market clearing a market clearing price is the price of a good or service at which quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded also called the equilibrium price the theory claims that markets tend to move toward this price for a one time sale of goods supply is fixed so the market clearing price is simply the price at which all items can be sold but no lower demand can be adjusted by setting the price appropriately perhaps through an auction mechanism in this case the marketplace is literally cleared of all goods for a market where goods are produced and sold on an ongoing basis the theory predicts that the market will move toward a price where the quantity supplied in a broad time period will equal the quantity demanded this might be measured over a period like a week month or year to smooth out irregularities caused by manufacturing in batches and delivery schedules sellers often have a buffer of inventory

it relates to the autocorrelations of the time series and the rate at which these decrease as the lag between pairs of values increases studies involving the hurst exponent were originally developed in hydrology for the practical matter of determining optimum dam sizing for the nile river s volatile rain and drought conditions that had been observed over a long period of time the name hurst exponent or hurst coefficient derives from harold edwin hurst 1880 1978 who was the lead researcher in these studies the use of the standard notation h for the coefficient also relates to his name in fractal geometry the generalized hurst exponent has been denoted by h or h in honor of both harold edwin hurst and ludwig otto h lder 1859 1937 by beno t mandelbrot 1924 2010 h is directly related to fractal dimension d and is a measure of a data series mild or wild randomness the hurst exponent is referred to as the index of dependence or index of long range dependence it quantifies the relative tendency of a time series either to regress strongly to the mean or to cluster in a direction a value h in the range 0

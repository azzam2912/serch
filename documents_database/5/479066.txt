a regular two graph has the property that every pair of vertices lies in the same number of triples of the two graph two graphs have been studied because of their connection with equiangular lines and for regular two graphs strongly regular graphs and also finite groups because many regular two graphs have interesting automorphism groups a two graph is not a graph and should not be confused with other objects called 2 graphs in graph theory such as 2 regular graphs on the set of vertices 1 6 the following collection of unordered triples is a two graph this two graph is a regular two graph since each pair of distinct vertices appears together in exactly two triples given a simple graph g v e the set of triples of the vertex set v whose induced subgraph has an odd number of edges forms a two graph on the set v every two graph can be represented in this way this example is referred to as the standard construction of a two graph from a simple graph as a more complex example let t be a tree with edge set e the set of all triples of e that

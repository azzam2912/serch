however it can be possible to span this ionization threshold energy if the photon energy is resonant with an intermediate electronically excited state while it is often possible to observe the lower rydberg levels in conventional spectroscopy of atoms and small molecules rydberg states are even more important in laser ionization experiments laser spectroscopic experiments often involve ionization through a photon energy resonance at an intermediate level with an unbound final electron state and an ionic core on resonance for phototransitions permitted by selection rules the intensity of the laser in combination with the excited state lifetime makes ionization an expected outcome this ris approach and variations permit sensitive detection of specific species high photon intensity experiments can involve multiphoton processes with the absorption of integer multiples of the photon energy in experiments that involve a multiphoton resonance the intermediate is often a rydberg state and the final state is often an ion the initial state of the system photon energy angular momentum and other selection rules can help in determining the nature of the intermediate state this approach is exploited in resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization spectroscopy rempi an advantage of this spectroscopic technique is that the ions can be

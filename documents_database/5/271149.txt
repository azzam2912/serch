more generally there is a similar weil pairing between points of order n of an abelian variety and its dual it was introduced by andr weil 1940 for jacobians of curves who gave an abstract algebraic definition the corresponding results for elliptic functions were known and can be expressed simply by use of the weierstrass sigma function choose an elliptic curve e defined over a field k and an integer n 0 we require n to be prime to char k if char k 0 such that k contains a primitive nth root of unity then the n torsion on formula 1 is known to be a cartesian product of two cyclic groups of order n the weil pairing produces an n th root of unity by means of kummer theory for any two points formula 3 where formula 4 and formula 5 a down to earth construction of the weil pairing is as follows choose a function f in the function field of e over the algebraic closure of k with divisor so f has a simple zero at each point p kq and a simple pole at each point kq if these points are all distinct then f

this was six times closer to the earth than the moon it was first observed on 5 march 2014 by the catalina sky survey at mount lemmon observatory in arizona united states as of 2017 it has not since been observed has only been observed on two nights for a period of less than 48 hours with a remaining orbital uncertainty of 4 and 6 respectively it orbits the sun at a distance of 0 7 2 2 au once every 21 months 644 days its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 53 and an inclination of 1 with respect to the ecliptic the asteroid has an earth minimum orbital intersection distance of which translates into less than 0 2 lunar distances based on a generic magnitude to diameter conversion measures 7 meters in diameter for a measured absolute magnitude of 28 2 and an assumed albedo of 0 2 which is typical value for stony s type asteroids other sources estimated the body to be approximately 10 meters or 30 feet across it is too small for being a potentially hazardous asteroid which require an absolute magnitude of 22 0 or less

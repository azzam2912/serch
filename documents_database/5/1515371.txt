we call d a division algebra if for any element a in d and any non zero element b in d there exists precisely one element x in d with a bx and precisely one element y in d such that for associative algebras the definition can be simplified as follows a non zero associative algebra over a field is a division algebra if and only if it has a multiplicative identity element 1 and every non zero element a has a multiplicative inverse i e an element x with the best known examples of associative division algebras are the finite dimensional real ones that is algebras over the field r of real numbers which are finite dimensional as a vector space over the reals the frobenius theorem states that up to isomorphism there are three such algebras the reals themselves dimension 1 the field of complex numbers dimension 2 and the quaternions dimension 4 wedderburn s little theorem states that if d is a finite division algebra then d is a finite field over an algebraically closed field k for example the complex numbers c there are no finite dimensional associative division algebras except k itself associative division algebras

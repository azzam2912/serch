then the haj s construction forms a new graph that combines the two graphs by identifying vertices and into a single vertex removing the two edges and and adding a new edge for example let and each be a complete graph on four vertices because of the symmetry of these graphs the choice of which edge to select from each of them is unimportant in this case the result of applying the haj s construction is the moser spindle a seven vertex unit distance graph that requires four colors as another example if and are cycle graphs of length and respectively then the result of applying the haj s construction is itself a cycle graph of length a graph is said to be constructible or haj s constructible when it formed in one of the following three ways it is straightforward to verify that every constructible graph requires at least colors in any proper graph coloring indeed this is clear for the complete graph and the effect of identifying two nonadjacent vertices is to force them to have the same color as each other in any coloring something that does not reduce the number of colors in the haj s

oseen flow is an improved description of these flows as compared to stokes flow with the partial inclusion of convective acceleration oseen s work is based on the experiments of g g stokes who had studied the falling of a sphere through a viscous fluid he developed a correction term which included inertial factors for the flow velocity used in stokes calculations to solve the problem known as stokes paradox his approximation leads to an improvement to stokes calculations the oseen equations are in case of an object moving with a steady flow velocity u through the fluid which is at rest far from the object and in a frame of reference attached to the object where the boundary conditions for the oseen flow around a rigid object are with r the distance from the object s center and p the undisturbed pressure far from the object a fundamental property of oseen s equation is that the general solution can be split into longitudinal and transversal waves a solution formula 3 is a longitudinal wave if the velocity is irrotational and hence the viscous term drops out the equations become in consequence velocity is derived from potential theory and pressure

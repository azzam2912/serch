enzymes that catalyse this reaction are called deaminases in the human body deamination takes place primarily in the liver however glutamate is also deaminated in the kidney in situations of excess protein intake deamination is used to break down amino acids for energy the amine group is removed from the amino acid and converted to ammonia the rest of the amino acid is made up of mostly carbon and hydrogen and is recycled or oxidized for energy ammonia is toxic to the human system and enzymes convert it to urea or uric acid by addition of carbon dioxide molecules which is not considered a deamination process in the urea cycle which also takes place in the liver urea and uric acid can safely diffuse into the blood and then be excreted in urine spontaneous deamination is the hydrolysis reaction of cytosine into uracil releasing ammonia in the process this can occur in vitro through the use of bisulfite which deaminates cytosine but not 5 methylcytosine this property has allowed researchers to sequence methylated dna to distinguish non methylated cytosine shown up as uracil and methylated cytosine unaltered in dna this spontaneous deamination is corrected for by the removal of uracil

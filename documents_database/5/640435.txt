usually one line is the main line and carries traffic through the junction at normal speed while the other track is a branch line that carries traffic through the junction at reduced speed a number of configurations are possible the simplest and oldest arrangement consists of two turnouts and a fixed diamond crossing because the diamond needs to be relatively coarse say 1 in 8 the curve radius is necessarily small leading to a speed of perhaps 25 km h this type of junction is common on street running tramways where speeds are quite low and junction must fit into the available road space because the points are close together the entire junction can be controlled by the mechanical point rodding of a single signal box signal passed at danger spad protection a train from r to p with 12 points reverse is protected from a train from p doing a spad by 11 points also lying reverse a train from p to q is not protected from a train from r doing a spad the fixed diamond can be replaced with a switched diamond which eliminates the gap in rails at the k crossing which allows a higher speed

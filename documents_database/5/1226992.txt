it is recognized as an early type of throttle body fuel injection and was developed to prevent fuel starvation during inverted flight most aircraft of the 1920s and 1930s had a float type carburetor they are adequate for civil aircraft which normally fly upright but present a problem for aircraft which fly upside down or are subject to a negative g force especially military fighters and aerobatic aircraft a float carburetor uses the venturi effect to supply fuel into the engine intake this depends upon a constant level of fuel in the float bowl to maintain the desired fuel air mixture the float operates a valve which keeps the fuel level in the carburetor consistent despite varying demands by means of a linked float valve as the fuel level increases the valve closes slowing or stopping the flow into the bowl however since the float depends on gravity to function it is ineffective when the aircraft is inverted during inversion fuel is delivered to the float bowl as fast as the fuel pump is capable resulting in an extremely rich mixture stopping the engine almost instantly the problem was keenly felt by the raf during the first years of the

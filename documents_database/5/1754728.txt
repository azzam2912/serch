affected individuals may have an unusually small head microcephaly and structural brain abnormalities including underdeveloped or absent tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain agenesis of the corpus callosum genitopatellar syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion the mutation responsible for the syndrome occurs in the kat6b gene the kat6b gene is responsible for making an enzyme called histone acetyltransferase which functions in regulating and making of histone which are proteins that attach to dna and give the chromosomes their shape the function of histone acetyltransferase produced from kat6b is unknown but it is considered as a regulator of early development there is little known about how the mutation in the kat6b causes the syndrome but researchers suspects that the mutations occur near the end of the kat6b gene and causes it to produce shortened acetyltransferase enzyme the shortened enzyme alters the regulation of other genes on the other hand the mutation of kat6b leading to the specific features of genitopatellar syndrome is still not surely proven even though clinical diagnostic criteria have not been 100 percent defined for genitopatellar syndrome the researchers stated that the certain physical features could relate to kat6b mutation and result

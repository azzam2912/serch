the first to draw attention to it was the egyptologist heinrich karl brugsch who published about it in 1876 the papyrus stems from year 6 of the whm mswt or renaissance an era which started in year 19 of king ramesses xi of the twentieth dynasty in his year 19 this king started to count anew with his year 19 either totally or partly coinciding with year 1 of the new era since some of the documents from the whm mswt are implicitly dated i e without reference to the era it is not always directly clear from the dateline whether a document stems from the ordinary year count of ramesses xi or from the whm mswt however with pap ambras there can be no doubt since it explicitly mentions the whm mswt in its dateline pap ambras is inscribed on the recto only and sums up the content of two jars filled with documents it is clear that ambras was meant as an inventory probably to be stored with the jars themselves the papyrus states that these documents had been bought back from the people apparently after they had been stolen during the suppression of the theban high priest

it is usually done in response to an error condition when it is impossible or undesirable for a processing activity to proceed and all error recovery mechanisms fail a computer storage program would normally perform a reset if a command times out and error recovery schemes like retry or abort also fail most computers have a reset line that brings the device into the startup state and is active for a short time after powering on for example in the x86 architecture asserting the reset line halts the cpu this is done after the system is switched on and before the power supply has asserted power good to indicate that it is ready to supply stable voltages at sufficient power levels reset places less stress on the hardware than power cycling as the power is not removed many computers especially older models have user accessible reset buttons that assert the reset line to facilitate a system reboot in a way that cannot be trapped i e prevented by the operating system out of band management also frequently provides the possibility to reset the remote system in this way many memory capable digital circuits flip flops registers counters and so on

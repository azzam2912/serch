for example a system in queueing theory defining the number of customers in a line would have state space 0 1 2 3 state spaces can be either infinite or finite an example of a finite state space is that of the toy problem vacuum world in which there are a limited set of configurations that the vacuum and dirt can be in the states space is a directed graph where each possible state of a dynamical system is represented by a vertex and there is a directed edge from a to b if and only if a b where the function f defines the dynamical system state spaces are useful in computer science as a simple model of machines formally a state space can be defined as a tuple n a s g where a state space has some common properties in many games the effective state space is small compared to all reachable states for instance in chess the effective state space is the set of positions that can be reached by game legal moves this is far smaller than the set of positions that can be achieved by placing combinations of the available chess pieces directly on

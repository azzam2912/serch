augustine desazilly fl mid 19th century was a french engineer in the early 1850s desazilly published a paper postulating the profile of equal resistance a major theoretical advance in the technology of masonry gravity dams based on the hydrostatic force exerted by a given height of water in relation to the weight of masonry used in the dam s construction estimated at 150 pounds per cubic foot desazilly considered two extreme conditions a filled reservoir and an empty reservoir and created a model for equalizing stresses on the masonry across every horizontal cross section he developed a vertical cross section in which the stresses at the upstream face of a masonry gravity dam with the reservoir empty are equal to those at the downstream face with the reservoir filled his hypothesis provided a means of calculating the minimum amount of material that could be used while assuring stability although he himself never carried out the construction of a dam on this profile of equal resistance it was used in 1858 to build the furens dam across the loire river desazilly also developed a process of surface drainage for building on a slope and contributed to the building of railways roads

measurement of asa is usually described in units of square ngstroms a standard unit of measurement in molecular biology asa was first described by lee richards in 1971 and is sometimes called the lee richards molecular surface asa is typically calculated using the rolling ball algorithm developed by shrake rupley in 1973 this algorithm uses a sphere of solvent of a particular radius to probe the surface of the molecule the shrake rupley algorithm is a numerical method that draws a mesh of points equidistant from each atom of the molecule and uses the number of these points that are solvent accessible to determine the surface area the points are drawn at a water molecule s estimated radius beyond the van der waals radius which is effectively similar to rolling a ball along the surface all points are checked against the surface of neighboring atoms to determine whether they are buried or accessible the number of points accessible is multiplied by the portion of surface area each point represents to calculate the asa the choice of the probe radius does have an effect on the observed surface area as using a smaller probe radius detects more surface details and therefore

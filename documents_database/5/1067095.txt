it dissolves in the solution of blood plasma and into red blood cells rbc where carbonic anhydrase catalyzes its hydration to carbonic acid hco carbonic acid then spontaneously dissociates to form bicarbonate ions hco and a hydrogen ion h in response to the decrease in intracellular pco more co passively diffuses into the cell cell membranes are generally impermeable to charged ions i e h hco but rbcs are able to exchange bicarbonate for chloride using the anion exchanger protein band 3 thus the rise in intracellular bicarbonate leads to bicarbonate export and chloride intake the term chloride shift refers to this exchange consequently chloride concentration is lower in systemic venous blood than in systemic arterial blood high venous pco leads to bicarbonate production in rbcs which then leaves the rbc in exchange for chloride coming in the opposite process occurs in the pulmonary capillaries of the lungs when the po rises and pco falls and the haldane effect occurs release of co from hemoglobin during oxygenation this releases hydrogen ions from hemoglobin increases free h concentration within rbcs and shifts the equilibrium towards co and water formation from bicarbonate the subsequent decrease in intracellular bicarbonate concentration reverses chloride bicarbonate

tris trimethylsilyl amine has been for years in the center of scientific interest as a stable intermediate in chemical nitrogen fixation i e the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen n into organic substrates under normal conditions early attempts to prepare tris trimethylsilyl amine from ammonia and trimethylchlorosilane tms cl were unsuccessful even at temperatures of 500 c and in the presence of the base pyridine the reaction of ammonia and trimethylchlorosilane stops at the stage of the doubly silylated product bis dimethylsilyl amine usually referred to as hexamethyldisilazane hmds tris trimethylsilyl amine is obtained by reaction of the sodium salt of hexamethyldisilazane from hexamethyldisilazane and sodium amide or from hexamethyldisilazane sodium and styrene with trimethylchlorosilane in 80 yield the lithium salt of hexamethyldisilazane from hexamethyldisilazane and butyllithium or from hexamethyldisilazane and phenyllithium reacts with trimethylchlorosilane only in yields of 50 60 to tris trimethylsilyl amine the reaction of lithium nitride with trimethylchlorosilane can be carried out as a one pot reaction in thf with 72 yield tris trimethylsilyl amine is a colorless crystalline or waxy solid which is stable to water and bases alcohols or acids though cleave the si n bond under formation of ammonia from antimony trichloride and tris

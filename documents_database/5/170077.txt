flagellum are a broad group of eukaryotes including both the animal and fungus kingdoms the opisthokonts previously called the fungi metazoa group are generally recognized as a clade opisthokonts together with apusomonadida and breviata comprise the larger clade obazoa a common characteristic of opisthokonts is that flagellate cells such as the sperm of most animals and the spores of the chytrid fungi propel themselves with a single posterior flagellum it is this feature that gives the group its name in contrast flagellate cells in other eukaryote groups propel themselves with one or more anterior flagella however in some opisthokont groups including most of the fungi flagellate cells have been lost opisthokont characteristics include synthesis of extracellular chitin in exoskeleton cyst spore wall or cell wall of filamentous growth and hyphae the extracellular digestion of substrates with osmotrophic absorption of nutrients and other cell biosynthetic and metabolic pathways genera at the base of each clade are amoeboid and phagotrophic the close relationship between animals and fungi was suggested by thomas cavalier smith in 1987 who used the informal name opisthokonta the formal name has been used for the chytrids by copeland in 1956 and was supported by later genetic studies early

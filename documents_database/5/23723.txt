the resulting architecture was used in various roles in ibm into the 1980s around 1974 ibm were looking at the possibility of constructing a telephone switch to handle a million calls per hour they estimated that this would require at least a 6 mips processor the group working on this project at the thomas j watson research center including john cocke designed a processor for this purpose the telephone switch project was abandoned in 1975 without the processor having been built but the processor research continued as the 801 project starting in october 1975 the name 801 comes from the building the project was housed in number 801 ibm was looking for ways to improve performance of its existing machines with project team members studying traces of programs running on system 370 mainframes and looking at the compiler code from this project came the idea that it was possible to make a very small and very fast core which could then be used to implement the microcode for any machine the initial proposed architecture was a machine with 24 bit registers and without virtual memory the project subsequently developed the fast core design as a cpu also called the 801

rollovers are not very common but lead to greater rates of severe injury and death some of these are secondary events that occur after a collision with a run off road crash or a collision with another vehicle if several vehicles are involved the term serial crash may be used if many vehicles are involved the term major incident may be used rather than pile up head on collisions often have poor outcomes because of the speed involved when the collision takes place the typical cause of head on collisions is when one vehicle inadvertently strays into the path of an oncoming vehicle however the root cause sometimes lies in a steering overcorrection after veering to the side of the road as opposed to the centre the likelihood of head on collision is at its greatest on roads with narrow lanes sharp curves no separation of lanes of opposing traffic and high volumes of traffic crash severity measured as risk of death and injury and repair costs to vehicles increases as speed increases therefore the roads with the greatest risk of head on collision are busy single carriageway roads outside urban areas where speeds are highest contrast this with motorways

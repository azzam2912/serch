historically the term was synonymized with developmental constraint however the latter has been more recently interpreted as referring solely to the negative role of development in evolution in modern evolutionary biology the idea of developmental bias is embedded into a current of thought called structuralism also internalism or variational structuralism focused on the role of the organism as a causal force of evolutionary change in the structuralist view phenotypic evolution is the result of the action of natural selection on previously filtered variation during the course of ontogeny it contrasts with the functionalist also adaptationist pan selectionist or externalist view in which phenotypic evolution results only from the interaction between the deterministic action of natural selection and variation caused by mutation the rationale behind the role of the organism or more specifically the embryo as a causal force in evolution and for the existence of bias is as follows the traditional neo darwinian approach to explain the process behind evolutionary change is natural selection acting upon heritable variation caused by genetic mutations however natural selection acts on phenotypes and mutation does not in itself produce phenotypic variation thus there is a conceptual gap regarding the connection between a mutation and

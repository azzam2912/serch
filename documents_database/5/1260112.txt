only one such vessel was constructed ernest bazin named for its inventor which was found to be impractical the principle behind the design was similar to that of the slightly later hydrofoil by avoiding as much hull contact with the water as possible the amount of drag could be reduced and in theory the vessel could be made to move much faster for a given amount of power as envisaged by bazin the main hull was lifted out of the water with large hollow discs attached to each side these discs would provide the buoyancy of the ship as well as part of its propulsive power these wheels were independently driven with a separate screw lowered into the water from the hull to propel the boat the discs were lenticular they tapered to a point like the hulls of ships indeed when pushed forwards through the water without any rotational movement they behaved exactly like a conventional hull when rotated however they proved in testing to be much more efficient due to the propulsive force being expended both vertically and horizontally it was found that the overall speed ought to be roughly two thirds the speed of rotation of the

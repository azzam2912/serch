network processors are one means of implementing active networking concepts active networks have also been implemented as overlay networks active networking allows the possibility of highly tailored and rapid real time changes to the underlying network operation this enables such ideas as sending code along with packets of information allowing the data to change its form code to match the channel characteristics the smallest program that can generate a sequence of data can be found in the definition of kolmogorov complexity the use of real time genetic algorithms within the network to compose network services is also enabled by active networking active networking relates to other networking paradigms primarily based upon how computing and communication are partitioned in the architecture active networking is an approach to network architecture with in network programmability the name derives from a comparison with network approaches advocating minimization of in network processing based on design advice such as the end to end argument two major approaches were conceived programmable network elements switches and capsules a programmability approach that places computation within packets traveling through the network treating packets as programs later became known as active packets software defined networking decouples the system that makes decisions

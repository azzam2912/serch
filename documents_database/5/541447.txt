in a stricter sense geometric graph theory studies combinatorial and geometric properties of geometric graphs meaning graphs drawn in the euclidean plane with possibly intersecting straight line edges and topological graphs where the edges are allowed to be arbitrary continuous curves connecting the vertices thus it is the theory of geometric and topological graphs pach 2013 a planar straight line graph is a graph in which the vertices are embedded as points in the euclidean plane and the edges are embedded as non crossing line segments f ry s theorem states that any planar graph may be represented as a planar straight line graph a triangulation is a planar straight line graph to which no more edges may be added so called because every face is necessarily a triangle a special case of this is the delaunay triangulation a graph defined from a set of points in the plane by connecting two points with an edge whenever there exists a circle containing only those two points the 1 skeleton of a polyhedron or polytope is the set of vertices and edges of the polytope the skeleton of any convex polyhedron is a planar graph and the skeleton of any k

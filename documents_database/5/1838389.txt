analog television and video employed interlacing where only half of the image known as a video field was recorded and played back refreshed at once but at twice the rate of what would be allowed for progressive video of the same bandwidth resulting in smoother playback as opposed to progressive video which is more similar to how celluloid works the field rate of analog television and video systems was typically 50 or 60 fields per second usage of frame rates higher than 24 fps for feature motion pictures and higher than 30 fps for other applications are emerging trends in the recent past in early cinema history there was no standard frame rate established thomas edison s early films were shot at 40 fps while the lumi re brothers used 16 fps this had to do with a combination of the use of a hand crank rather than a motor which created variable frame rates because of the inconsistency of the cranking of the film through the camera after the introduction of synch sound recording 24 fps became the industry standard frame rate for capture and projection of motion pictures 24 fps was chosen because it was the minimum frame

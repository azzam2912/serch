it is composed of aggregate cement and water composition of concrete varies to suit for different applications desired even size of the aggregate can influence mechanical properties of concrete to a great extent concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension when tensile loads are applied concrete undergoes fracture easily the reason behind this phenomenon can be explained as follows the aggregates in concrete are capable of taking compressive stresses so that concrete withstands compressive loading but during tensile loading cracks are formed which separates the cement particles which hold the aggregates together this separation of cement particles causes the entire structure to fail as crack propagates this problem in concrete is resolved by the introduction of reinforcing components such as metallic bars ceramic fibres etc these components act as a skeleton of the entire structure and are capable of holding aggregates under tensile loading this is known as reinforcement of concrete concrete may be referred to as a brittle material this is because concrete s behaviour under loading is completely different from that of ductile materials like steel but actually concrete differs from ideal brittle materials in many aspects in modern fracture mechanics concrete is considered as a

this representation completes classical representations provided by principal component analysis pca or multiple correspondence analysis mca namely those of individuals of quantitative variables correlation circle and of the categories of qualitative variables at the centroid of the individuals who possess them it is especially important in factor analysis of mixed data famd and in multiple factor analysis mfa the first interest of the relationship square is to represent the variables themselves not their categories which is all the more valuable as there are many variables for this we calculate for each qualitative variable formula 1 and each factor formula 2 formula 2 rank formula 4 factor is the vector of coordinates of the individuals along the axis of rank formula 5 in pca formula 2 is called principal component of rank formula 4 the square of the correlation ratio between the formula 8 and the variable formula 9 usually denoted thus to each factorial plane we can associate a representation of qualitative variables themselves their coordinates being between 0 and 1 the variables appear in the square having as vertices the points 0 0 0 1 1 0 and 1 1 six individuals formula 11 are described by three variables

above approximately 30gb a correlation dbms may become smaller than the raw data set the vbs model used by a cdbms consists of three primary physical sets of objects that are stored and managed in the vbs model each unique value in the raw data is stored only once therefore the data is always normalized at the level of unique values this eliminates the need to normalize data sets in the logical schema data values are stored together in ordered sets based on data types all integers in one set characters in another etc this optimizes the data handling processes that access the values in addition to typical data values the data value store contains a special type of data for storing relationships between tables this functions similarly to foreign keys in rdbms structures but with a cdbms the relationship is known by the dictionary and stored as a data value making navigation between tables completely automatic the data dictionary contains typical metadata plus additional statistical data about the tables columns and occurrences of values in the logical schema it also maintains information about the relationships between the logical tables the index and linking storage includes all of the data

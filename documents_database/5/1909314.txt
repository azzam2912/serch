archaeosortases recognize and remove carboxyl terminal protein sorting signals about 25 amino acids long from secreted proteins a genome that encodes one archaeosortase may encode over fifty target proteins the best characterized archaeosortase target is the haloferax volcanii s layer glycoprotein an extensively modified protein with o linked glycosylations n linked glycosylations and a large prenyl derived lipid modification toward the c terminus knockout of the archaeosortase a arta gene or permutation of the motif pro gly phe pgf to pro phe gly in the s layer glycoprotein blocks attachment of the lipid moiety as well as blocking removal of the pgf cterm protein sorting domain thus archaeosortase appears to be a transpeptidase like sortase rather than a simple protease archaeosortases are related to exosortases their uncharacterized counterparts in gram negative bacteria the names of both families of proteins reflect roles analogous to sortases in gram positive bacteria with which they share no sequence homology the sequences of archaeosortases and exosortases consists mostly of hydrophobic transmembrane helices which sortases lack archaeosortases fall into a number of distinct subtypes each responsible for recognizing sorting signals with a different signature motif archaeosortase a arta recognizes the pgf cterm signal artb recognizes vpxxxp

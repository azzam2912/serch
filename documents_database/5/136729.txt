it is the finite projective plane with the smallest possible number of points and lines 7 points and 7 lines with 3 points on every line and 3 lines through every point the standard notation for this plane as a member of a family of projective spaces is where stands for projective geometry the first parameter is the geometric dimension and the second parameter is the order the fano plane is an example of a finite incidence structure so many of its properties can be established using combinatorial techniques and other tools used in the study of incidence geometries since it is a projective space algebraic techniques can also be effective tools in its study the fano plane can be constructed via linear algebra as the projective plane over the finite field with two elements one can similarly construct projective planes over any other finite field with the fano plane being the smallest using the standard construction of projective spaces via homogeneous coordinates the seven points of the fano plane may be labeled with the seven non zero ordered triples of binary digits 001 010 011 100 101 110 and 111 this can be done in such a way that

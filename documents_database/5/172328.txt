named after its discoverer the german anatomist friedrich gustav jakob henle the loop of henle s main function is to create a concentration gradient in the medulla of the kidney by means of a countercurrent multiplier system which uses electrolyte pumps the loop of henle creates an area of high urea concentration deep in the medulla near the papillary duct in the collecting duct system water present in the filtrate in the papillary duct flows through aquaporin channels out of the duct moving passively down its concentration gradient this process reabsorbs water and creates a concentrated urine for excretion the loop of henle can be divided into four parts the tissue type of the loop is simple squamous epithelium the thick and thin terminology does not refer to the size of the lumen but to the size of the epithelial cells the loop is also sometimes called the nephron loop the loop of henle is supplied by blood in a series of straight capillaries descending from the cortical efferent arterioles these capillaries called the vasa recta recta is from the latin for straight also have a countercurrent multiplier mechanism that prevents washout of solutes from the medulla thereby maintaining the

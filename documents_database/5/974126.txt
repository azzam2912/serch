despite its name this is not a bacterium but rather a member of the domain archaea it is found in salted fish hides hypersaline lakes and salterns as these salterns reach the minimum salinity limits for extreme halophiles their waters become purple or reddish color due to the high densities of halophilic archaea h salinarum has also been found in high salt food such as salt pork marine fish and sausages the ability of h salinarum to survive at such high salt concentrations has led to its classification as an extremophile halobacteria are single celled rod shaped microorganisms that are among the most ancient forms of life and appeared on earth billions of years ago the membrane consists of a single lipid monolayer surrounded by an s layer the s layer is made of a cell surface glycoprotein which accounts for approximately 50 of the cell surface proteins these proteins form a lattice in the membrane sulfate residues are abundant on the glycan chains of the glycoprotein giving it a negative charge the negative charge is believed to stabilize the lattice in high salt conditions amino acids are the main source of chemical energy for h salinarum particularly arginine and

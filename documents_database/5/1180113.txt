j pettis is a property of a banach space stating that all weakly compact operators from this space into another banach space are completely continuous many standard banach spaces have this property most notably the space c k of continuous functions on a compact space and the space l of the lebesgue integrable functions on a measure space alexander grothendieck introduced the concept in the early 1950s following the work of dunford and pettis who developed earlier results of shizuo kakutani k saku yosida and several others important results were obtained more recently by jean bourgain nevertheless the dunford pettis property is not completely understood a banach space x has the dunford pettis property if every continuous weakly compact operator t x y from x into another banach space y transforms weakly compact sets in x into norm compact sets in y such operators are called completely continuous an important equivalent definition is that for any weakly convergent sequences x of x and f of the dual space x converging weakly to x and f the sequence f x converges to f x

the algorithms can be implemented as software on general purpose machines or as hardware in specialized video processing units many different functionalities can be implemented in vca video motion detection is one of the simpler forms where motion is detected with regard to a fixed background scene more advanced functionalities include video tracking and egomotion estimation based on the internal representation that vca generates in the machine it is possible to build other functionalities such as identification behavior analysis or other forms of situation awareness vca relies on good input video so it is often combined with video enhancement technologies such as video denoising image stabilization unsharp masking and super resolution several articles provide an overview of the modules involved in the development of video analytic applications this is a list of known functionalities and a short description vca is a new technology new applications are frequently found however the track record of different types of vca differs widely functionalities such as motion detection and people counting are believed to be available as commercial off the shelf products with a decent track record even freeware such as dsprobotics flowstone can handle movement and color analysis in many domains vca is

state variables are variables whose values evolve through time in a way that depends on the values they have at any given time and also depends on the externally imposed values of input variables output variables values depend on the values of the state variables the state space is the euclidean space in which the variables on the axes are the state variables the state of the system can be represented as a vector within that space to abstract from the number of inputs outputs and states these variables are expressed as vectors additionally if the dynamical system is linear time invariant and finite dimensional then the differential and algebraic equations may be written in matrix form the state space method is characterized by significant algebraization of general system theory which makes it possible to use kronecker vector matrix structures the capacity of these structures can be efficiently applied to research systems with modulation or without it the state space representation also known as the time domain approach provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs with formula 1 inputs and formula 2 outputs we would otherwise have to write down formula

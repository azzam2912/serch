there are many general applications of the sitf specifically in the field of image analysis it gives a measure of the noise of an imaging system and thus yields one assessment of its performance in evaluating the sitf curve the signal input and signal output are measured differentially meaning the differential of the input signal and differential of the output signal are calculated and plotted against each other an operator using computer software defines an arbitrary area with a given set of data points within the signal and background regions of the output image of the infrared sensor i e of the unit under test uut see half moon image below the average signal and background are calculated by averaging the data of each arbitrarily defined region a second order polynomial curve is fitted to the data of each line then the polynomial is subtracted from the average signal and background data to yield the new signal and background the difference of the new signal and background data is taken to yield the net signal finally the net signal is plotted versus the signal input the signal input of the uut is within its own spectral response e g color

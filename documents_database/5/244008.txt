in one sense it is purely a property of an oriented link diagram and assumes integer values in another sense it is a quantity that describes the amount of coiling of a mathematical knot or any closed simple curve in three dimensional space and assumes real numbers as values in both cases writhe is a geometric quantity meaning that while deforming a curve or diagram in such a way that does not change its topology one may still change its writhe in knot theory the writhe is a property of an oriented link diagram the writhe is the total number of positive crossings minus the total number of negative crossings a direction is assigned to the link at a point in each component and this direction is followed all the way around each component if as you travel along a link component and cross over a crossing the strand underneath goes from right to left the crossing is positive if the lower strand goes from left to right the crossing is negative one way of remembering this is to use a variation of the right hand rule for a knot diagram using the right hand rule with either orientation gives

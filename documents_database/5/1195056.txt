this form of inhibition is termed shunting because of the synaptic conductance short circuit currents that are generated at adjacent excitatory synapses if a shunting inhibitory synapse is activated the input resistance is reduced locally and following ohm s law the amplitude of subsequent excitatory postsynaptic potential epsp is reduced this simple scenario arises if the inhibitory synaptic reversal potential is identical to the resting potential shunting inhibition is theorized to be a type of gain control mechanism regulating the responses of neurons simple inhibition such as hyperpolarization has a subtractive effect on the depolarization caused by concurrent excitation whereas shunting inhibition can in some cases account for a divisive effect some evidence exists that shunting inhibition can have a divisive effect on neuronal responses at least on subthreshold postsynaptic potentials in a 2005 article researchers abbott and chance state that although the importance of gain modulation and multiplicative interaction in general has been appreciated for many years it has proven difficult to uncover a realistic biophysical mechanism by which it can occur it is important to note that despite comments in the literature to the contrary see above divisive inhibition of neuronal responses cannot arise from shunting inhibition this

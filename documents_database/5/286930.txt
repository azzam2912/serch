in such molecules the isomer of the inositol group is assumed to be the myo conformer unless otherwise stated typically phosphatidylinositols form a minor component on the cytosolic side of eukaryotic cell membranes the phosphate group gives the molecules a negative charge at physiological ph the form of phosphatidylinositol comprising the isomer muco inositol acts as a sensory receptor in the taste function of the sensory system in this context it is often referred to as ptdins but that does not imply any molecular difference from phosphatidylinositols comprising the myo conformers of inositol the phosphatidylinositol can be phosphorylated to form phosphatidylinositol phosphate pi 4 p referred to as pip in close context or informally phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate pip and phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate pip all lipids based on phosphatidylinositol are known as inositides or sometimes phosphoinositides the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol in the laboratory is catalyzed by phosphatidylinositol synthase and involves cdp diacylglycerol and l myo inositol pi has a polar and non polar region making the lipid an amphiphile phosphatidylinositol is classified as a glycerophospholipid that contains a glycerol backbone two non polar fatty acid tails a phosphate group substituted with an inositol polar head group the most common fatty acids of phosphoinositides

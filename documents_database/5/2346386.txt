from 1957 to 1964 kaiser worked at bell laboratories in murray hill in 1964 he became a professor for experimental physics at the technische universit t m nchen where he performed research on laser physics kaiser is internationally recognized for his pioneering work on lasers with ultra short pulses which find many applications in biophysical and chemical equipment for example he showed the molecular reactions regarding the photochemistry of bacteriorhodopsin in photosynthesis he was involved in the development of ruby lasers and discovered the two photon absorption with c g b garrett the two photon absorption was postulated by maria goeppert mayer in 1931 and has become an important method for laser spectrometer applications furthermore kaiser and his colleagues looked at and simulated raman scattering brillouin scattering and the duration of existence of phonons in solid state matter using raman spectroscopy other topics kaiser worked on include semi conductors as well as nonlinear optical issues wolfgang kaiser has got multiple honorary doctorates from the purdue university and others and he is a member of the bayerische akademie der wissenschaften bavarian association for science the national academy of sciences and the academia europaea

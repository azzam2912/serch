the ds2 system was notable in that its authors proved that it was possible to perform significant and useful serious computing tasks on a hardware platform with such severely limited resources that even the manufacturer called it only a game machine the commodore 64 was a simple computer based on the mos technology 6502 8 bit microprocessor with 64 kilobytes of ram only 38k of which was available for program code and variables that could be used by the built in basic programming language interpreter nevertheless several different bbs programs were developed including ds2 by various independent programmers mostly hobbyists not affiliated with any large software publisher that enabled a system operator sysop to run a single user multiple member online community supporting threaded topical discussions on line games information reference library live chat mode with the console operator file sharing library and the ability to create a customized user experience in basic thus the developers system title from an engineering standpoint c net ds2 was remarkable in its use of machine language modules early multitasking technology relocatable code and modular program overlays although the user experience was entirely text based and non graphical fast performance could be attained through

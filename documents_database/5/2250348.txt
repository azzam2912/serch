it was first predicted using uspex code and then synthesised in 2016 nahe was predicted to be thermodynamically stable over 160 gpa and dynamically stable over 100 gpa this means it should be possible to form at the higher pressure and then decompress to 100 gpa but below that it would decompose compared with other binary compounds of other elements and helium it was predicted to be stable at the lowest pressure of any such combination so that for example a helium potassium compound is predicted to require much higher pressures of the order of terapascals disodium helide has a cubic crystal structure resembling fluorite at 300 gpa the edge of a unit cell of the crystal has each unit cell contains four helium atoms on the centre of the cube faces and corners and eight sodium atoms at coordinates halfway between the center and each corner double electrons 2e are positioned on each edge and the centre of the unit cell each pair of electrons is spin paired the presence of these isolated electrons makes this an electride the helium atoms do not participate in any bonding however the electron pairs can be considered as an eight centre two

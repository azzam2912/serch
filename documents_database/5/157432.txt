a glycosyl donor is attached to a hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule a glycosyl acceptor in biology glycosylation mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches glycans to proteins or other organic molecules this enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells along with dna rna and proteins glycosylation is a form of co translational and post translational modification glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins the majority of proteins synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum undergo glycosylation it is an enzyme directed site specific process as opposed to the non enzymatic chemical reaction of glycation glycosylation is also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as the o glcnac modification aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation five classes of glycans are produced glycosylation is the process by which a carbohydrate is covalently attached to a target macromolecule typically proteins and lipids this modification serves various functions for instance some proteins do not fold correctly unless they are glycosylated in other cases proteins are not stable unless they contain oligosaccharides linked at the amide nitrogen of certain asparagine residues the influence of

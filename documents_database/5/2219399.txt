he emigrated in 1957 from hungary to canada where he studied at the university of british columbia bachelor 1963 and then at stanford university where he obtained his master degree in 1964 and his phd in 1968 he then moved to the princeton plasma physics laboratory where he worked as a senior research physicist until 1975 during the following year porkolab worked at the max planck institute for plasma physics in garching germany under the auspices of the humboldt foundation as a winner of the us senior scientist award in 1977 he became professor of physics at the massachusetts institute of technology where he later led the plasma science and fusion center psfc for many years whilst at princeton porkolab concentrated on disperive properties of plasma waves and instabilities in magnetized plasmas measurements corroborating the validity of the collisionless boltzmann equation and demonstrating nonlinear scattering of bernstein waves with wavelengths comparable to the electron larmor radius were obtained porkolab s work provided experimental verifications of landau damping nonlinear resonant wave wave scattering and parametric instabilities also predicting upper hybrid solitons from 1977 whilst at the mit physics department porkolab joined the newly established plasma physics and fusion center where he

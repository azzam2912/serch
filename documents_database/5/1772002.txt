most notably intercellular clefts are often found between epithelial cells and the endothelium of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels also helping to form the blood nerve barrier surrounding nerves intercellular clefts are important for allowing the transportation of fluids and small solute matter through the endothelium the dimensions of intercellular clefts vary throughout the body however cleft lengths have been determined for a series of capillaries the average cleft length for capillaries is about 20m cm the depths of the intercellular clefts measured from the luminal to the abluminal openings vary among different types of capillaries but the average is about 0 7 m the width of the intercellular clefts is about 20 nm outside the junctional region i e in the larger part of the clefts in intercellular clefts of capillaries it has been calculated that the fractional area of the capillary wall occupied by the intercellular cleft is 20m cm x 20 nm length x width 0 004 0 4 this is the fractional area of the capillary wall exposed for free diffusion of small hydrophilic solutes and fluids the intercellular cleft is imperative for cell cell communication the cleft contains gap junctions tight junctions desmosomes and adheren

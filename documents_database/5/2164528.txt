it is a component of coal tar cigarette smoke and smog and thought to be a major contributor to its carcinogenic properties the mutagenicity of benzo c fluorene is mainly attributed to formation of metabolites that are reactive and capable of forming dna adducts according to the kegg it is a group 3 carcinogen not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans other names for benzo c fluorene are 7 h benzo c fluorene 3 4 benzofluorene and nsc 89264 the structure of benzo c fluorene is depicted in the infobox on the right it is an aromatic fluorene derived molecule with an extra benzene ring this benzene ring is attached to carbon 3 and 4 of the fluorene derived molecule the 3d structure of benzo c fluorene is depicted in the infobox on the right as well it is mostly flat because it consists of 3 aromatic rings only the 2 hydrogen atoms on the 5 ring are oriented into the 3d plane benzo c fluorene occurs naturally in tar but can also be manually synthesized in a four step process which is depicted in the picture below the starting product is 1 indanone 1 this is brominated in

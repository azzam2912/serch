it gives the functional value true if both functional arguments have the same logical value and false if they are different it is customary practice in various applications if not always technically precise to indicate the operation of logical equality on the logical operands x and y by any of the following forms some logicians however draw a firm distinction between a functional form like those in the left column which they interpret as an application of a function to a pair of arguments and thus a mere indication that the value of the compound expression depends on the values of the component expressions and an equational form like those in the right column which they interpret as an assertion that the arguments have equal values in other words that the functional value of the compound expression is true in mathematics the plus sign almost invariably indicates an operation that satisfies the axioms assigned to addition in the type of algebraic structure that is known as a field for boolean algebra this means that the logical operation signified by is not the same as the inclusive disjunction signified by but is actually equivalent to the logical inequality operator signified by

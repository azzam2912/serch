in humans the optic nerve is derived from optic stalks during the seventh week of development and is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glial cells it extends from the optic disc to the optic chiasma and continues as the optic tract to the lateral geniculate nucleus pretectal nuclei and superior colliculus the optic nerve has been classified as the second of twelve paired cranial nerves but it is technically part of the central nervous system rather than the peripheral nervous system because it is derived from an out pouching of the diencephalon optic stalks during embryonic development as a consequence the fibers of the optic nerve are covered with myelin produced by oligodendrocytes rather than schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system and are encased within the meninges peripheral neuropathies like guillain barr syndrome do not affect the optic nerve however most typically the optic nerve is grouped with the other eleven cranial nerves and is considered to be part of the peripheral nervous system the optic nerve is ensheathed in all three meningeal layers dura arachnoid and pia mater rather than the epineurium perineurium and endoneurium found in peripheral nerves fiber tracts of the mammalian central nervous

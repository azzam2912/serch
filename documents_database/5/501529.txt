it is a highly complex process for growing crystalline layers to create complex semiconductor multilayer structures in contrast to molecular beam epitaxy mbe the growth of crystals is by chemical reaction and not physical deposition this takes place not in vacuum but from the gas phase at moderate pressures 10 to 760 torr as such this technique is preferred for the formation of devices incorporating thermodynamically metastable alloys and it has become a major process in the manufacture of optoelectronics it was invented in 1968 at north american aviation later rockwell international science center by harold m manasevit in mocvd ultrapure precursor gases are injected into a reactor usually with a non reactive carrier gas for a iii v semiconductor a metalorganic could be used as the group iii precursor and a hydride for the group v precursor for example indium phosphide can be grown with trimethylindium ch in and phosphine ph precursors as the precursors approach the semiconductor wafer they undergo pyrolysis and the subspecies absorb onto the semiconductor wafer surface surface reaction of the precursor subspecies results in the incorporation of elements into a new epitaxial layer of the semiconductor crystal lattice in the mass transport limited growth

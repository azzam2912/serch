he served as the notorious dictator luis garc a meza s minister of interior after the departure forced by washington of the equally infamous colonel luis arce the garc a meza regime became internationally known for its extreme brutality some 1 000 people are estimated to have been killed by the bolivian army and security forces between july 1980 and august 1981 in addition the garc a meza government was deeply involved in drug trafficking activities and may have come to power financed directly by the drug cartels this led to the complete isolation of the regime even the new conservative government of u s president ronald reagan kept its distance and seemed to prefer better options eventually the international outcry was sufficiently strong to force garc a meza s resignation on 3 august 1981 the high command of the military of bolivia at that point entrusted general celso torrelio with the presidency although the military s idea was to replace the polarizing garc a meza with a less controversial and more acceptable leader equally as committed to the principles of the anti communist national security doctrine their plan did not come to fruition the regime continued to be shunned

in the small gtpase family it is classified in the ras domain a special group of oncogenes and oncoproteins that take part in the synthesis of molecules related to cell reproduction a feature of rasef is its n terminal ef hand motif and c terminal rab homology domain that enables it to bind calcium lately rasef has been studied for its role as an oncoprotein investigating which mutations affect it and how we could inhibit them could allow us to fight cancers that have an elevated mortality rate such as lung cancer when studying cancer s molecular biology we can identify two types of genes that intervene in its development oncogenes generally code for growth factors and their receptors enzymes related to transduction signal or for dna transcription factors when those genes suffer some kind of mutation or translocation they can change their conformation and cause a catalytic activity in cell reproduction that is normally inactivated which causes abnormal cell proliferation this could provoke a malignant tumor if combined with a separate mutation in a protein s ras group nowadays there is important research in drugs that could eliminate these ras group mutations but this has not been achieved yet

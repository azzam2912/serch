they are part of the group of saxitoxins a large group of neurotoxins along with a molecule that is also referred to as saxitoxin stx neosaxitoxin nstx and decarbamoylsaxitoxin dcstx currently eight molecules are assigned to the group of gonyautoxins known as gonyautoxin 1 gtx 1 to gonyautoxin 8 gtx 8 ingestion of gonyautoxins through consumption of mollusks contaminated by toxic algae can cause a human illness called paralytic shellfish poisoning psp gonyautoxins are naturally produced by several marine dinoflagellates species alexandrium sp gonyaulax sp protogonyaulax sp the paralytic shellfish poisoning caused by these toxins is connected with dinoflagellate blooms known as red tides even though the coloration of the water isn t a necessity the threshold concentration of the organisms that are capable to produce the toxins is lower than the lowest visually detectable concentration subsequently the toxins are taken up by shellfish and undergo bioaccumulation as part of the group of satoxins the gonyautoxins have their structure based on the 2 6 diamino 4 methyl pyrollo 1 2 c purin 10 ol skeleton also known as the saxitoxin gonyautoxin skeleton the different molecules only differ from each other by their substituents some of them only by a mere

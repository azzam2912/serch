translocation ets leukemia virus protein is a transcription factor that in humans is encoded by the etv6 previously known as tel gene the etv6 protein regulates the development and growth of diverse cell types particularly those of hematological tissues however its gene etv6 frequently suffers various mutations that lead to an array of potentially lethal cancers i e etv6 is a clinically significant proto oncogene in that it can fuse with other genes to drive the development and or progression of certain cancers however etv6 is also an anti oncogene or tumor suppressor gene in that mutations in it that encode for a truncated and therefore inactive protein are also associated with certain types of cancers the human etv6 gene is located at position 13 2 on the short i e p arm of chromosome 12 i e its notated position is 12p13 2 the gene has 8 exons and two start codons one located at exon 1 at the start of the gene and an alternative located upstream of exon 3 etv6 codes for a full length protein consisting of 452 amino acids the gene is expressed in virtually all cell types and tissues mice depleted of the etv6

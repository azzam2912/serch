held from 2012 to 2015 it aimed to develop semi autonomous ground robots that could do complex tasks in dangerous degraded human engineered environments the drc followed the darpa grand challenge and darpa urban challenge it began in october 2012 and was to run for about 33 months with three competitions a virtual robotics challenge vrc that took place in june 2013 and two live hardware challenges the drc trials in december 2013 and the drc finals in june 2015 besides spurring development of semi autonomous robots the drc also sought to make robotic software and systems development more accessible beyond the end of the program to that end the drc funded the adaptation of the gazebo robot simulator by the open source robotics foundation osrf for drc purposes and the construction of six boston dynamics atlas robots that were given to the teams that performed best in the vrc dr gill pratt program manager darpa robotics challenge described darpa and its goals with the robotics challenge darpa s role is to spur innovation and we do it by focused short term efforts we pick things that are not impossible but also not very low risk so we take very

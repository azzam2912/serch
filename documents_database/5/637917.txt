the binding motif is associated with a protein s structure and or function atp is a molecule of energy and can be a coenzyme involved in a number of biological reactions atp is proficient at interacting with other molecules through a binding site the atp binding site is the environment in which atp catalytically actives the enzyme and as a result is hydrolyzed to adp the binding of atp causes a conformational change to the enzyme it is interacting with the genetic and functional similarity of such a motif demonstrates micro evolution proteins have co opted the same binding sequence from other enzymes rather than developing them independently atp binding sites which may be representative of an atp binding motif are present in many proteins which require an input of energy from atp such sites as active membrane transporters microtubule subunits flagellum proteins and various hydrolytic and proteolytic enzymes the short motifs involving atp binding are the walker a also known as the p loop walker b signature and switch motif the walker site a has a primary amino acid sequence of gxxgxfks or t the letter x can represent any amino acid the primary amino acid sequence of the

this contrasts with ordinary gas giants such as jupiter and saturn whose atmospheres consist primarily of hydrogen with helium as a secondary component only helium planets might form in a variety of ways gliese 436 b is a possible helium planet there are several hypotheses for how a helium planet might form a helium planet might form via hydrogen evaporation from a gaseous planet orbiting close to a star the star will drive off lighter gases more effectively through evaporation than heavier gasses and over time deplete the hydrogen leaving a greater proportion of helium behind a scenario for forming helium planets from regular giant planets involves an ice giant in an orbit so close to its host star that the hydrogen effectively boils out of the atmosphere evaporating from and escaping the gravitational hold of the planet the planet s atmosphere will experience a large energy input and because light gases are more readily evaporated than heavier gases the proportion of helium will steadily increase in the remaining atmosphere such a process will take some time to stabilize and completely drive out all the hydrogen perhaps on the order of 10 billion years depending on the precise physical conditions

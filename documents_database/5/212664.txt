most often this is used on broadcast satellites to indicate that radio stations are not multiplexed as subcarriers onto a single video carrier but instead independently share a transponder it may also be used on other communications satellites or occasionally on non satellite transmissions in an scpc system satellite bandwidth is dedicated to a single source this makes sense if it is being used for something like satellite radio which broadcasts continuously another very common application is voice where a small amount of fixed bandwidth is required however it does not make sense for burst transmissions like satellite internet access or telemetry since a customer would have to pay for the satellite bandwidth even when they were not using it where multiple access is concerned scpc is essentially fdma some applications use scpc instead of tdma because they require guaranteed unrestricted bandwidth as satellite tdma technology improves however the applications for scpc are becoming more limited with multiple channels per carrier mcpc several subcarriers are combined or multiplexed into a single bitstream before being modulated onto a carrier transmitted from a single location to one or more remote sites this uses time division multiplexing tdm as well as frequency division

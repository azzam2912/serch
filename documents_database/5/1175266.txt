there are two thermodynamic types passive and active the most common sort of passive heat spreader is a plate or block of material having high thermal conductivity such as copper aluminum or diamond an active heat spreader speeds up heat transfer with expenditure of energy as work supplied by an external source a heat pipe uses fluids inside a sealed case the fluids circulate either passively by spontaneous convection triggered when a threshold temperature difference occurs or actively because of an impeller driven by an external source of work without sealed circulation energy can be carried by transfer of fluid matter for example externally supplied colder air driven by an external source of work from a hotter body to another external body though this is not exactly heat transfer as defined in physics exemplifying increase of entropy according to the second law of thermodynamics a passive heat spreader disperses or spreads out heat so that the heat exchanger s may be more fully utilized this has the potential to increase the heat capacity of the total assembly but the additional thermal junctions limit total thermal capacity the high conduction properties of the spreader will make it more effective to function

it is the third processor to bear the name athlon and the immediate successor to the athlon xp the second processor after the opteron to implement amd64 architecture and the first 64 bit processor targeted at the average consumer it was amd s primary consumer microprocessor and competes primarily with intel s pentium 4 especially the prescott and cedar mill core revisions it is amd s first k8 eighth generation processor core for desktop and mobile computers despite being natively 64 bit the amd64 architecture is backward compatible with 32 bit x86 instructions athlon 64s have been produced for socket 754 socket 939 socket 940 and socket am2 the line was succeeded by the dual core athlon 64 x2 and athlon x2 lines the athlon 64 was originally codenamed clawhammer by amd and was referred to as such internally and in press releases the first athlon 64 fx was based on the first opteron core sledgehammer both cores produced on a 130 nanometer process were first introduced on september 23 2003 the models first available were the fx 51 fitting socket 940 and the 3200 fitting socket 754 like the opteron on which it was based the athlon fx 51

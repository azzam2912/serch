the syndrome includes myoclonic seizures and tonic clonic seizures together with progressive neurological decline myoclonic seizures involve brief involuntary muscle twitching and may become frequent enough to be disabling tonic clonic seizures have two phases the tonic phase may last a few seconds and involves the muscles tensing and may lead to the person falling down the clonic phase involves a convulsion of rapidly alternating muscle tensing and relaxing neurological dysfunction includes difficulty coordinating muscle movements ataxia and a decline in cognitive ability dementia in the early stages it can be difficult to distinguish progressive myoclonic epilepsy from benign idiopathic generalised epilepsies such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy with pme the initial effectiveness of anticonvulsant treatment diminishes as seizures become more frequent and neurological decline progresses however these can also be signs of anticonvulsant intoxication the myoclonus in pme is usually severe and is the prominent seizure type several conditions can cause progressive myoclonic epilepsy this disease manifests between six and sixteen years and is most prevalent in scandinavia and the baltic countries myoclonus gradually becomes worse and less susceptible to medication cognitive decline is slow and sometimes mild patients typically do not live beyond middle age but there are exceptions

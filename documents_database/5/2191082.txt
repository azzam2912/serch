it focuses on developing microprocessor ip for embedded systems offers design services for chip manufacturers and has built a chip for iot connectivity cortus is a founding platinum member of the risc v foundation cortus has provided ip for more than 2 6 billion devices with cortus inside a specific feature of the processors from cortus is their low silicon footprint low power consumption and code density to date cortus have released three families of processors their initial 32 bit processors with a mixed 16 32 bit instruction set a later family with 16 24 32 bit instructions and have started offering risc v isa processors this was the first processor released by cortus it has now been superseded by the aps3r these are members of the initial family of processors with mixed 16 32 bit instruction lengths the fps6 offers hardware floating point these are member of the second generation of processors with 16 24 32 bit instruction lengths this gives better code density at the expense of silicon footprint these processors are marginally larger compared to their equivalents in the first family of processors from cortus this is the first risc v isa cpu from cortus it implements

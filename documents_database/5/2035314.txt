one dimensional signals are expressed in terms of a single domain while multidimensional signals are represented in wave vector and frequency spectrum therefore spectral estimation in the case of multidimensional signals gets a bit tricky multidimensional spectral estimation has gained popularity because of its application in fields like medicine aerospace sonar radar bio informatics and geophysics in the recent past a number of methods have been suggested to design models with finite parameters to estimate the power spectrum of multidimensional signals in this article we will be looking into the basics of methods used to estimate the power spectrum of multidimensional signals there are many applications of spectral estimation of multi d signals such as classification of signals as low pass high pass pass band and stop band it is also used in compression and coding of audio and video signals beam forming and direction finding in radars seismic data estimation and processing array of sensors and antennas and vibrational analysis in the field of radio astronomy it is used to synchronize the outputs of an array of telescopes in a single dimensional case a signal is characterized by an amplitude and a time scale the basic concepts involved in

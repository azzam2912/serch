it was discovered on august 15 1992 by the watch all sky monitor aboard granat grs stands for granat source 1915 is the right ascension 19 hours and 15 minutes and 105 reflects the approximate declination 10 degrees and 56 arcminutes the near infrared counterpart was confirmed by spectroscopic observations the binary system lies 11 000 parsecs away in aquila grs 1915 105 is the heaviest of the stellar black holes so far known in the milky way galaxy with 10 to 18 times the mass of the sun it is also a microquasar and it appears that the black hole rotates at close to 1 150 times per second with a spin parameter value between 0 82 and 1 00 maximum possible value in 1994 grs 1915 105 became the first known galactic source that ejects material with apparent faster than light or superluminal velocities observations with high resolution radio telescopes such as vla merlin and vlbi show a bi polar outflow of charged particles which emit synchrotron radiation at radio frequencies these studies have shown that the apparent superluminal motion is due to a relativistic effect known as relativistic aberration where the intrinsic velocity of ejecta is actually

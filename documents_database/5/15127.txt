exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk owl and the gregarious burrowing owl owls hunt mostly small mammals insects and other birds although a few species specialize in hunting fish they are found in all regions of the earth except polar ice caps and some remote islands owls are divided into two families the true or typical owl family strigidae and the barn owl family tytonidae owls possess large forward facing eyes and ear holes a hawk like beak a flat face and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers a facial disc around each eye the feathers making up this disc can be adjusted to sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls asymmetrically placed ear cavities most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads but the stereoscopic nature of the owl s forward facing eyes permits the greater sense of depth perception necessary for low light hunting although owls have binocular vision their large eyes are fixed in their sockets as are those of most other birds so they must turn their entire heads to change views as owls are farsighted they are unable to clearly see anything within a few centimeters of their eyes

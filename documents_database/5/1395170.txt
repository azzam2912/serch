this complex refers to the cells found amongst the midotic placode and somite 3 destined to undergo epithelial mesenchymal transformation and migration to the heart via pharyngeal arches 3 4 and 6 the cardiac neural crest complex plays a vital role in forming connective tissues that aid in outflow septation and modelling of the aortic arch arteries during early development ablation of the complex often leads to impaired myocardial functioning similar to symptoms present in digeorge syndrome consequently the removal of cardiac crest cells that populate in pharyngeal arches has flow on effects on the thymus parathyroid and thyroid gland the cardiac neural crest originates from the region of cells between somite 3 and the midotic placode that migrate towards and into the cardiac outflow tract the cells migrate from the neural tube to populate pharyngeal arches 3 4 and 6 with the largest population of the outflow tract originating from those in pharyngeal arches 4 from here a subpopulation of cells will develop into the endothelium of the aortic arch arteries while others will migrate into the outflow tract to form the aorticopulmonary and truncal septa other ectomesenchymal cells will form the thymus and parathyroid glands prior to migration

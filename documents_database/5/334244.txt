the in car tape player that played the stereo pak cartridges was called the autostereo but it was generally marketed under the common stereo pak trade name the stereo pak cartridge was inspired by the fidelipac 3 track tape cartridge system invented by george eash in 1954 and used by radio broadcasters for commercials and jingles beginning in 1959 the stereo pak was adapted from the basic fidelipac cartridge design by earl madman muntz in 1962 with muntz partnering with eash as a way to play prerecorded tapes in cars the tape is arranged in an infinite loop which traverses a central hub and crosses a tape head usually over a pressure pad to assure proper tape contact the tape moves at 7 5 inches per second as opposed to the 8 track cartridge that moved at 3 75 inches per second pulled by tension but this tension is dampened by a lubricant usually graphite on the back of the tape to prevent a tape s tension from damaging the tape and or player the tape ends in a stereo pak are not connected by a splice made of a conductive material as are the later automatic switching 8 track

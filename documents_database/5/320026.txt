it is defined by iupac as a chemical reaction or reaction sequence in which one or more new elements of chirality are formed in a substrate molecule and which produces the stereoisomeric enantiomeric or diastereoisomeric products in unequal amounts put more simply it is the synthesis of a compound by a method that favors the formation of a specific enantiomer or diastereomer enantiomers are stereoisomers that have opposite configurations at every chiral center diastereomers are stereoisomers that differ at one or more chiral centers enantioselective synthesis is a key process in modern chemistry and is particularly important in the field of pharmaceuticals as the different enantiomers or diastereomers of a molecule often have different biological activity many of the building blocks of biological systems such as sugars and amino acids are produced exclusively as one enantiomer as a result living systems possess a high degree of chemical chirality and will often react differently with the various enantiomers of a given compound examples of this selectivity include as such enantioselective synthesis is of great importance but it can also be difficult to achieve enantiomers possess identical enthalpies and entropies and hence should be produced in equal amounts by an undirected process

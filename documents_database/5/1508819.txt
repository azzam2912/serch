they are used to relate the representation theories of those two groups their use was promoted by the influential monograph of j a green first published in 1980 the name schur algebra is due to green in the modular case over infinite fields of positive characteristic schur algebras were used by gordon james and karin erdmann to show that the still open problems of computing decomposition numbers for general linear groups and symmetric groups are actually equivalent schur algebras were used by friedlander and suslin to prove finite generation of cohomology of finite group schemes the schur algebra formula 1 can be defined for any commutative ring formula 2 and integers formula 3 consider the algebra formula 4 of polynomials with coefficients in formula 2 in formula 6 commuting variables formula 7 1 i j formula 8 denote by formula 9 the homogeneous polynomials of degree formula 10 elements of formula 9 are k linear combinations of monomials formed by multiplying together formula 10 of the generators formula 7 allowing repetition thus now formula 4 has a natural coalgebra structure with comultiplication formula 16 and counit formula 17 the algebra homomorphisms given on generators by since comultiplication is an algebra

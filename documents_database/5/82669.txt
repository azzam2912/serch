it is a version of the motorola 68000 with an 8 bit external data bus as well as a smaller address bus the original 68000 introduced in 1979 has a 24 bit address bus and a 16 bit data bus these relatively large buses made it hard to design a low cost system based on the 68000 they were difficult to lay out on a circuit board and needed a lot of supporting circuitry a 16 bit data bus also required twice as many memory chips as an 8 bit one the 68008 introduced in 1982 was designed to work with low cost 8 bit memory systems because of its smaller data bus it was only about half as fast as a 68000 of the same clock speed however it was still faster than competing 8 bit microprocessors because the 68008 internally was based on 32 bit data registers and a 16 bit data bus except for its smaller data and address buses the 68008 behaved identically to the 68000 and had the same internal organization and microarchitecture the 68008 was an hmos chip with about it came with a speed grade of there were two distinct versions of the

powers of graphs are referred to using terminology similar to that of exponentiation of numbers g is called the square of g g is called the cube of g etc graph powers should be distinguished from the products of a graph with itself which unlike powers generally have many more vertices than the original graph if a graph has diameter d then its d th power is the complete graph if a graph family has bounded clique width then so do its d th powers for any fixed d graph coloring on the square of a graph may be used to assign frequencies to the participants of wireless communication networks so that no two participants interfere with each other at any of their common neighbors and to find graph drawings with high angular resolution both the chromatic number and the degeneracy of the k th power of a planar graph of maximum degree are formula 1 where the degeneracy bound shows that a greedy coloring algorithm may be used to color the graph with this many colors for the special case of a square of a planar graph wegner conjectured in 1977 that the chromatic number of the square of

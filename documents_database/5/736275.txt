designed and manufactured by ibm s electronics systems center in owego n y it was one of the major components of the instrument unit fitted to the s ivb stage of the saturn v and saturn ib rockets the lvdc also supported pre and post launch checkout of the saturn hardware it was used in conjunction with the launch vehicle data adaptor lvda which performed signal conditioning to the sensor inputs to the computer from the launch vehicle the lvdc was capable of executing 12190 instructions per second for comparison a 2012 era microprocessor can execute 4 instructions per cycle at 3 ghz achieving 12 billion instructions per second one million times faster its master clock ran at 2 048 mhz but operations were performed bit serially with 4 cycles required to process each bit 14 bits per phase and 3 phases per instruction for a basic time of 168 cycles 82 s for a simple add a few instructions such as multiply or divide took a few times this value memory was in the form of 13 bit syllables each with a 14th parity bit instructions were one syllable in size while data words were two syllables 26 bits

in 1993 trinity college dublin physicist denis weaire and his student robert phelan found in computer simulations of foam that this structure was a better solution of the kelvin problem than the previous best known solution the kelvin structure in 1887 lord kelvin asked how space could be partitioned into cells of equal volume with the least area of surface between them i e what was the most efficient bubble foam this problem has since been referred to as the kelvin problem he proposed a foam based on the bitruncated cubic honeycomb which is called the kelvin structure this is the convex uniform honeycomb formed by the truncated octahedron which is a 14 faced space filling polyhedron a tetradecahedron with 6 square faces and 8 hexagonal faces to conform to plateau s laws governing the structures of foams the hexagonal faces of kelvin s variant are slightly curved the kelvin conjecture is that this structure solves the kelvin problem that the foam of the bitruncated cubic honeycomb is the most efficient foam the kelvin conjecture was widely believed and no counter example was known for more than 100 years until it was disproved by the discovery of the weaire phelan

crenulations form by recrystallisation of mica minerals during metamorphism micaceous minerals form planar surfaces known as foliations perpendicular to the principal stress fields if a rock is subjected to two separate deformations and the second deformation is at some other angle to the original growth of new micas on the foliation planes will create a new foliation plane perpendicular to the plane of principal stress the angular intersection of the two foliations causes a diagnostic texture called a crenulation which may involve folding of the earlier mica foliations by the later foliation recognising a crenulation in a rock may require inspecting the rock with a hand lens or petrographic microscope in thin section crenulations may be very cryptic and there may be several recorded within a rock and especially entrained within porphyroblasts crenulations may manifest as kinking of previous foliation such that the original foliation appears to be lined or inscribed by a later foliation in more advanced states the later foliation will tend to form distinct foliation planes cross cutting the earlier foliation resulting in breaking warping and micro scale folding of the earlier foliation into the new foliation when the crenulation foliation begins to dominate it may totally

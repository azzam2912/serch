the role of ghs r is thought to be in regulating energy homeostasis and body weight in the brain they are most highly expressed in the hypothalamus specifically the ventromedial nucleus and arcuate nucleus gsh rs are also expressed in other areas of the brain including the ventral tegmental area hippocampus and substantia nigra outside the central nervous system too gsh rs are also found in the liver in skeletal muscle and even in the heart two identified transcript variants are expressed in several tissues and are evolutionary conserved in fish and swine one transcript 1a excises an intron and encodes the functional protein this protein is the receptor for the ghrelin ligand and defines a neuroendocrine pathway for growth hormone release the second transcript 1b retains the intron and does not function as a receptor for ghrelin however it may function to attenuate activity of isoform 1a ghs r1a falls into g protein coupled receptor gpcr family previous studies have shown that gpcrs can form heterodimers or functional receptor pairs with other types of g protein coupled receptors gpcrs various studies suggest that ghs r1a specifically forms dimers with the following hormone and neurotransmitter receptors somatostatin receptor 5 dopamine

cell elimination by apoptosis occurs when uv induced cell damage which cannot be repaired by the intracellular repair system exceeds at it certain limit lethal damage through apoptosis the cells are self disassembled into compartments with their subsequent utilization mainly by neighboring cells the first time sign of the beginning of the apoptosis system is working in a uv damaged cell is the activation of restriction enzymes which divide cell dna into fragments convenient for utilization but too large a dose of uvr can lead to breakdown inactivation of the energy dependent mechanism of apoptosis super lethal damage in this case cell destruction occurs randomly not orderly and during a significantly longer compared with apoptosis time interval uv irradiated cells do not change their appearance for a long time 1 6 as a result of which the researchers may make the erroneous conclusion that revealed an unexpected response to a dose at which a higher dose of uv increased the viability of keratinocytes 2 the fact that uv induced apoptosis at high doses of uvr begins to be replaced by necrosis was established in 2000 3 for keratinocytes the proportion of cells that have elimination by help apoptosis with an

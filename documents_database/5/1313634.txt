pdo is an organic compound with many commercial applications conventionally pdo is produced from crude oil products such as propylene or ethylene oxide in recent years however companies such as dupont are investing in the biological production of pdo using renewable feedstocks such as corn in may 2004 dupont and tate lyle announced that they would start up a joint venture to build a facility that produces polymers from renewable feedstock instead of petrochemicals in particular their goal was to design a fermentation system that converts corn sugar into pdo propanediol manufactured in this way is referred to in the media as biopdo they argue that using such a bioprocess is more energy efficient than conventional petrochemical processes conversion of propylene into propanediol because the bioprocess has four advantages over the conventional process smaller environmental footprint lower operating costs smaller capital investment and greater sustainability due to use of renewable corn feedstock biopdo can be made by the bacterial fermentation of glycerol however dupont has managed to engineer a strain of escherichia coli e coli a common bacterium to allow industrial scale production of 1 3 propanediol by fermentation of glucose after the e coli produce sufficient biopdo product dupont

it arises from electrical activity in the brain and is studied within the field of cognitive neuroscience and psychology it can occur in any sensory system but has most frequently been studied for hearing and for vision in the case of auditory stimuli the mmn occurs after an infrequent change in a repetitive sequence of sounds sometimes the entire sequence is called an oddball sequence for example a rare deviant d sound can be interspersed among a series of frequent standard s sounds e g s s s s s s s s s d s s s s s s d s s s d s s s s the deviant sound can differ from the standards in one or more perceptual features such as pitch duration or loudness the mmn is usually evoked by either a change in frequency intensity duration or real or apparent spatial locus of origin the mmn can be elicited regardless of whether the subject is paying attention to the sequence during auditory sequences a person can be reading or watching a silent subtitled movie yet still show a clear mmn in the case of visual stimuli the mmn occurs after an infrequent change

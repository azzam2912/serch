its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 18 and an inclination of 9 with respect to the ecliptic the first used precovery was taken at palomar observatory in 1951 extending the asteroid s observation arc by 22 years prior to its official discovery while the first unused observation was made ten years earlier at uccle observatory in 1941 bernoulli is an assumed common stony s type asteroid a rotational lightcurve of bernoulli was obtained from photometric observations by michael alkema at the u s elephant head observatory arizona in december 2012 lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0 21 magnitude according to the survey carried out by the neowise mission of nasa s space based wide field infrared survey explorer bernoulli measures 7 8 and 8 5 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0 17 and 0 22 respectively while the collaborative asteroid lightcurve link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0 20 and calculates a diameter of 9 4 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12 5 this minor planet was named in honour of the bernoulli family a dynasty of mathematicians from the city of

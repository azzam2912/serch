it consists of at least eight separate plutons the largest of which is the main donegal granite it was intruded at a late stage in the caledonian orogeny about 400 million years ago ma the donegal batholith extends for about 75 km in a sw ne direction from just west of the small town of ardara to fanad head the nw se extent is more difficult to determine as much of the thorr and fanad plutons lie offshore the donegal batholith was formed during the early devonian towards the end of the caledonian orogeny between about 418 and 397 ma it is interpreted to have been intruded along a major sw ne trending sinistral shear zone the space to allow the intrusion of such large volumes of granitic magma into the crust is thought to be a result of movement along the shear zone combined with the sinistral strike slip reactivation of a major ssw nne trending fault running approximately through the centres of the ardara trawenagh bay rosses and thorr plutons the chemistry and timing of the granites does not suggest that they are subduction related subduction is thought to have ceased by the end of the silurian 419

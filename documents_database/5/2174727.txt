from harvard university with thesis a r f spectrometer with applications to studies of nuclear magnetic resonance absorption in solids from 1952 to 1975 he did research in solid state physics at the general electric research laboratory in schenectady new york during his time at general electric he was also an adjunct professor at rensselaer polytechnic institute from 1962 to 1965 and at the state university of new york albany from 1969 to 1973 from 1975 until his retirement in 1996 he was sherman fairchild professor for physics at lehigh university watkins has done research on the physics of defects in solids radiation damage electronic structure of deep levels in semiconductors nuclear and electron paramagnetic resonance optical spectroscopy optical detection of magnetic resonance and deep level transient capacitance spectroscopy of point defects in solids his research focused on defects in semiconductors including defects caused by radiation and exploration of such defects with magnetic resonance techniques electron spin resonance and electron nuclear double resonance in 1966 67 he was a visiting scientist at the university of oxford clarendon laboratory as a fellow of the national science foundation and in 1983 84 at the max planck institute for solid state research in

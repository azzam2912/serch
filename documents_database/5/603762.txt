it is a gpu based on the nvidia 7800gtx graphics processor and according to nvidia is a g70 g71 previously known as nv47 hybrid architecture with some modifications the rsx has separate vertex and pixel shader pipelines the gpu makes use of 256 mb gddr3 ram clocked at 650 mhz with an effective transmission rate of 1 4 ghz and up to 224 mb of the 3 2 ghz xdr main memory via the cpu 480 mb max although it carries the majority of the graphics processing the cell broadband engine the console s cpu is also used complementarily for some graphics related computational loads of the console unless otherwise noted the following specifications are based on a press release by sony at the e3 2005 conference slides from the same conference and slides from a sony presentation at the 2006 game developer s conference other features support for bilinear trilinear anisotropic quincunx texture filtering quincunx antialiasing up to 4xmsaa ssaa alpha to coverage and alphakill 90nm 65nm 40nm although the rsx has 256mb of gddr3 ram not all of it is usable the last 4mb is reserved for keeping track of the rsx internal state and issued commands the

for instance linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry including for defining basic objects such as lines planes and rotations also functional analysis may be basically viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions linear algebra is also used in most sciences and engineering areas because it allows modeling many natural phenomena and efficiently computing with such models for nonlinear systems which cannot be modeled with linear algebra linear algebra is often used as a first order approximation the procedure for solving simultaneous linear equations now called gaussian elimination appears in the ancient chinese mathematical text chapter eight rectangular arrays of the nine chapters on the mathematical art its use is illustrated in eighteen problems with two to five equations systems of linear equations arose in europe with the introduction in 1637 by ren descartes of coordinates in geometry in fact in this new geometry now called cartesian geometry lines and planes are represented by linear equations and computing their intersections amounts to solving systems of linear equations the first systematic methods for solving linear systems used determinants first considered by leibniz in 1693 in 1750 gabriel cramer used them for giving explicit solutions of

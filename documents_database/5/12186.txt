sequencing results in a symbolic linear depiction known as a sequence which succinctly summarizes much of the atomic level structure of the sequenced molecule dna sequencing is the process of determining the nucleotide order of a given dna fragment so far most dna sequencing has been performed using the chain termination method developed by frederick sanger this technique uses sequence specific termination of a dna synthesis reaction using modified nucleotide substrates however new sequencing technologies such as pyrosequencing are gaining an increasing share of the sequencing market more genome data are now being produced by pyrosequencing than sanger dna sequencing pyrosequencing has enabled rapid genome sequencing bacterial genomes can be sequenced in a single run with several times coverage with this technique this technique was also used to sequence the genome of james watson recently the sequence of dna encodes the necessary information for living things to survive and reproduce determining the sequence is therefore useful in fundamental research into why and how organisms live as well as in applied subjects because of the key importance dna has to living things knowledge of dna sequences is useful in practically any area of biological research for example in medicine it can

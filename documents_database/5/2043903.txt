here the word fulminating has its oldest meaning explosive from latin fulmen lightning from verb fulgeo i shine the material contains no fulminate ions the best approximate description is that it is the product of partial hydrolysis of formula 1 upon combustion it produces a purple vapor the complex has a square planar molecular geometry with a low spin state generally it is best to avoid accidentally creating this substance by mixing gold chloride or hydroxide salts with ammonia gas or ammonium salts as it is prone to explosion with even the slightest touch fulminating gold was the first high explosive known to man and was first noted in western alchemy as early as 1585 sebald schwaerzer was the first to isolate this compound and comment on its characteristics in his book chrysopoeia schwaertzeriana schwaerzer s production required dissolving a sample of gold in aqua regia adding ammonium chloride to the saturated solution and precipitating the solution through lead spheres and drying over oil of tartar chemists of the 16th and 17th centuries were very interested in the novelty of an explosive gold compound so it should be no surprise that many chemists of the era were injured upon its

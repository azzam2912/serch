zoid can refer to either an asexually reproductive spore or a sexually reproductive gamete in sexually reproductive gametes zoids can be either male or female depending on the species for example some brown alga phaeophyceae reproduce by producing multi flagellated male and female gametes that recombine to form the diploid sporangia zoids are primarily found in some protists diatoms green alga brown alga non vascular plants and a few vascular plants ferns cycads and ginkgo biloba the most common classification group that produces zoids is the heterokonts or stramenopiles these include green alga brown alga oomycetes and some protists the term is generally not used to describe motile flagellated sperm found in animals zoid is also commonly confused for zooid which is a single organism that is part of a colonial animal a zoid contains one or more flagella for motility in the various species that produce zoids there is a high level of diversity in the number of flagella produced the heterokonts generally produce zoids with 2 flagella while the ginkgo biloba produce zoids with tens of thousands of flagella the position of the flagella and the arrangement of the microtubules varies among species as well the following sections

the class contains the density functions of all distributions that have characteristic functions that are strictly proper rational functions i e the degree of the numerator is strictly less than the degree of the denominator a 2 ept probability density function is a probability density function on formula 1 with a strictly proper rational characteristic function on either formula 2 or formula 3 these probability density functions are exponential polynomial trigonometric ept functions any ept density function on formula 3 can be represented as where e represents a matrix exponential formula 6 are square matrices formula 7 are column vectors and formula 8 are row vectors similarly the ept density function on formula 9 is expressed as the parameterization formula 11 is the minimal realization of the 2 ept function the general class of probability measures on formula 1 with proper rational characteristic functions are densities corresponding to mixtures of the pointmass at zero delta distribution and 2 ept densities unlike phase type and matrix geometric distributions the 2 ept probability density functions are defined on the whole real line it has been shown that the class of 2 ept densities is closed under many operations and using minimal realizations

the technique s primary inventor daniel j bernstein defines syn cookies as particular choices of initial tcp sequence numbers by tcp servers in particular the use of syn cookies allows a server to avoid dropping connections when the syn queue fills up instead of storing additional connections the syn queue entry is encoded into the sequence number sent in the syn ack response if the server then receives a subsequent ack response from the client with the incremented sequence number the server is able to reconstruct the syn queue entry using information encoded in the tcp sequence number and proceed as usual with the connection in order to initiate a tcp connection the client sends a tcp syn packet to the server in response the server sends a tcp syn ack packet back to the client one of the values in this packet is a sequence number which is used by the tcp to reassemble the data stream according to the tcp specification that first sequence number sent by an endpoint can be any value as decided by that endpoint syn cookies are initial sequence numbers that are carefully constructed according to the following rules the initial tcp sequence number

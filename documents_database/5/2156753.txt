its updated version darkfores2 combines the techniques of its predecessor with monte carlo tree search the mcts effectively takes tree search methods commonly seen in computer chess programs and randomizes them with the update the system is known as darkfmcts3 darkforest is of similar strength to programs like crazystone and zen it has been tested against a professional human player at the 2016 uec cup google s alphago program won against a professional player in october 2015 using a similar combination of techniques darkforest is named after liu cixin s science fiction novel the dark forest competing with top human players in the ancient game of go has been a long term goal of artificial intelligence go s high branching factor makes traditional search techniques ineffective even on cutting edge hardware and go s evaluation function could change drastically with one stone change however by using a deep convolutional neural network designed for long term predictions darkforest has been able to substantially improve the win rate for bots over more traditional monte carlo tree search based approaches against human players darkfores2 achieves a stable 3d ranking on kgs go server which roughly corresponds to an advanced amateur human player however

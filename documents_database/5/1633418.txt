in other words a partial cube can be identified with a subgraph of a hypercube in such a way that the distance between any two vertices in the partial cube is the same as the distance between those vertices in the hypercube equivalently a partial cube is a graph whose vertices can be labeled with bit strings of equal length in such a way that the distance between two vertices in the graph is equal to the hamming distance between their labels such a labeling is called a hamming labeling it represents an isometric embedding of the partial cube into a hypercube was the first to study isometric embeddings of graphs into hypercubes the graphs that admit such embeddings were characterized by and and were later named partial cubes a separate line of research on the same structures in the terminology of families of sets rather than of hypercube labelings of graphs was followed by and among others every tree is a partial cube for suppose that a tree t has m edges and number these edges arbitrarily from 0 to m 1 choose a root vertex r for the tree arbitrarily and label each vertex v with a string

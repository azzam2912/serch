known chemolithotrophs are exclusively microorganisms no known macrofauna possesses the ability to use inorganic compounds as energy sources macrofauna and lithotrophs can form symbiotic relationships in which case the lithotrophs are called prokaryotic symbionts an example of this is chemolithotrophic bacteria in giant tube worms or plastids which are organelles within plant cells that may have evolved from photolithotrophic cyanobacteria like organisms lithotrophs belong to either the domain bacteria or the domain archaea the term lithotroph was created from the greek terms lithos rock and troph consumer meaning eaters of rock many but not all lithoautotrophs are extremophiles different from a lithotroph is an organotroph an organism which obtains its reducing agents from the catabolism of organic compounds the term was suggested in 1946 by lwoff and collaborators lithotrophs consume reduced inorganic compounds rich in electrons a chemolithotroph named after the process of chemolithotrophy is able to use inorganic reduced compounds as a source of energy this process is accomplished through oxidation and atp synthesis the majority of chemolithotrophs are able to fix carbon dioxide co through the calvin cycle a metabolic pathway in which carbon enters as co and leaves as glucose this group of organisms includes sulfur oxidizers

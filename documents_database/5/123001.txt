as k grows one may combine many of the multiplication sub operations thus reducing the overall complexity of the algorithm the multiplication sub operations can then be computed recursively using toom cook multiplication again and so on although the terms toom 3 and toom cook are sometimes incorrectly used interchangeably toom 3 is only a single instance of the toom cook algorithm where k 3 toom 3 reduces 9 multiplications to 5 and runs in n n in general toom k runs in where n is the time spent on sub multiplications and c is the time spent on additions and multiplication by small constants the karatsuba algorithm is a special case of toom cook where the number is split into two smaller ones it reduces 4 multiplications to 3 and so operates at n n ordinary long multiplication is equivalent to toom 1 with complexity n although the exponent e can be set arbitrarily close to 1 by increasing k the function c unfortunately grows very rapidly the growth rate for mixed level toom cook schemes was still an open research problem in 2005 an implementation described by donald knuth achieves the time complexity due to its overhead toom

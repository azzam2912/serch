the tools provided by quantum stochastic calculus are of great use for modeling the random evolution of systems undergoing measurement as in quantum trajectories just as the lindblad master equation provides a quantum generalization to the fokker planck equation quantum stochastic calculus allows for the derivation of quantum stochastic differential equations qsde that are analogous to classical langevin equations for the remainder of this article stochastic calculus will be referred to as classical stochastic calculus in order to clearly distinguish it from quantum stochastic calculus an important physical scenario in which a quantum stochastic calculus is needed is the case of a system interacting with a heat bath it is appropriate in many circumstances to model the heat bath as an assembly of harmonic oscillators one type of interaction between the system and the bath can be modeled after making a canonical transformation by the following hamiltonian where formula 2 is the system hamiltonian formula 3 is a vector containing the system variables corresponding to a finite number of degrees of freedom formula 4 is an index for the different bath modes formula 5 is the frequency of a particular mode formula 6 and formula 7 are bath operators for

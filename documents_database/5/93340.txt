epoxy resins also known as polyepoxides are a class of reactive prepolymers and polymers which contain epoxide groups epoxy resins may be reacted cross linked either with themselves through catalytic homopolymerisation or with a wide range of co reactants including polyfunctional amines acids and acid anhydrides phenols alcohols and thiols usually called mercaptans these co reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives and the cross linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing reaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a thermosetting polymer often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance epoxy has a wide range of applications including metal coatings use in electronics electrical components leds high tension electrical insulators paint brush manufacturing fiber reinforced plastic materials and adhesives for structural and other purposes most of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with acidic hydroxy groups and epichlorohydrin epoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called glycidyl based epoxy resins the hydroxy group may be derived from aliphatic diols polyols polyether polyols phenolic compounds or dicarboxylic acids phenols can be compounds such as bisphenol a and novolak polyols can be compounds such as

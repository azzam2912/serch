it is used in place of the mechanical differential in multi drive systems when cornering the inner and outer wheels rotate at different speeds because the inner wheels describe a smaller turning radius the electronic differential uses the steering wheel command signal and the motor speed signals to control the power to each wheel so that all wheels are supplied with the torque they need the classical automobile drivetrain is composed by a single internal combustion engine providing torque to one or more driving wheels the most common solution is to use a mechanical device to distribute torque to the wheels this mechanical differential allows different wheel speeds when cornering with the emergence of electric vehicles new drive train configurations are possible multi drive systems become easy to implement due to the large power density of electric motors these systems usually with one motor per driving wheel need an additional top level controller which performs the same task as a mechanical differential the ed scheme has several advantages over a mechanical differential several applications of this technology have proven successful and have increased vehicle performance the application range is wide and includes the huge t 282b from liebherr which is

it always occurs in hydrated form sbo n ho it contains antimony in the 5 oxidation state antimony pentoxide has the same structure as the b form of niobium pentoxide and can be derived from the rutile structure with antimony coordinated by six oxygen atoms in a distorted octahedral arrangement the sbo octahedra are corner and edge sharing the hydrated oxide is prepared by hydrolysis of antimony pentachloride or by acidification of potassium hexahydroxoantimonate v it may also be prepared by oxidation of antimony trioxide with nitric acid antimony pentoxide finds use as a flame retardant in abs and other plastics and as a flocculant in the production of titanium dioxide and is sometimes used in the production of glass paint and adhesives it is also used as an ion exchange resin for a number of cations in acidic solution including na especially for their selective retentions and as a polymerization and oxidation catalyst the hydrated oxide is insoluble in nitric acid but dissolves in a concentrated potassium hydroxide solution to give potassium hexahydroxoantimonate v or ksb oh when heated to the yellow hydrated pentoxide converts to an anhydrous white solid with the formula sbo containing both antimony iii and

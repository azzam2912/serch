it is used in image stabilized binoculars still and video cameras astronomical telescopes and also smartphones mainly the high end with still cameras camera shake is a particular problem at slow shutter speeds or with long focal length telephoto or zoom lenses with video cameras camera shake causes visible frame to frame jitter in the recorded video in astronomy the problem of lens shake is amplified by variation in the atmosphere which changes the apparent positions of objects over time in photography image stabilization can facilitate shutter speeds 2 to 4 5 stops slower exposures 4 to times longer and even slower effective speeds have been reported the rule of thumb to determine the slowest shutter speed possible for hand holding without noticeable blur due to camera shake is to take the reciprocal of the 35 mm equivalent focal length of the lens also known as the 1 mm rule for example at a focal length of 125 mm on a 35 mm camera vibration or camera shake could affect sharpness if the shutter speed is slower than second as a result of the 2 to 4 5 stops slower shutter speeds allowed by is an image taken at second

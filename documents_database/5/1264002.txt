released ahead of the album this song was the second big song for the band and is generally regarded as their second biggest song after drugs originally written on the last day of recording after a phone call from the record company to dave johnstone they advised him that there were no hits on the album and could he please write one after a near nervous breakdown dave wrote you re not the only one who feels this way the next morning once the producer had arrived later in the afternoon the song was recorded johnstone proceeded to fax the record company that he had indeed written their fucking single despite this the song remains one of their enduring legacies the song marks the second time ammonia charted in triple j s hottest 100 coming in at no 43 in 1997 the band s only other entry was drugs which came in at no 27 in 1995 in 2018 double j praised a song as simplistic beautiful powerful and just plain genius as you re not the only one who feels this way if you haven t heard it in ages i promise it still absolutely destroys today

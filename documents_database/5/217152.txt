a rarely used common name for the subfamily is the harp beetles the harpalinae contain the most apomorphic ground beetles displaying a wide range of forms and behaviors some are rare among ground beetles omnivores or even herbivores many closely related subfamilies have been treated as subordinate taxa of the harpalinae by various authors among these are the dryptinae lebiinae including cyclosominae mormolycinae odacanthinae perigoninae licininae including chlaeniinae oodinae orthogoniinae panagaeinae platyninae pseudomorphinae pterostichinae including zabrinae here they are considered independent families within the harpaline sensu lato assemblage and this is also tentatively assumed for the enigmatic monotypic genus ginema at least 4 large and several smaller supertribes can be distinguished the former pterostichitae on the other hand seem to be as presently delimited a paraphyletic assemblage but probably also contains a number of tribes closer to each other than to other harpalinae the clade around the type genus pterostichus is thus recognized as subfamily pterostichinae here the harpalinae include the following genera

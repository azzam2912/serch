it only asserts the existence of a subset of a set if that subset can be defined without reference to the entire universe of sets the axiom appears in the systems of constructive set theory cst and czf as well as in the system of kripke platek set theory the name comes from the l vy hierarchy in analogy with the arithmetic hierarchy the formal statement of this is the same as full separation schema but with a restriction on the formulas that may be used for any formula provided as usual that the variable y is not free in but also provided that contains only bounded quantifiers that is all quantifiers in if there are any must appear in the form formula 2 or formula 3 for some sub formula the meaning of this is that given any set x and any predicate there is a set y whose elements are the elements of x which satisfy provided only quantifies over existing sets and never quantifies over all sets this restriction is necessary from a predicative point of view since the universe of all sets contains the set being defined if it were referenced in the definition of the

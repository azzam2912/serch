irving langmuir discovered this phenomenon after observing windrows of seaweed in the sargasso sea in 1927 langmuir circulations circulate within the mixed layer however it is not yet so clear how strongly they can cause mixing at the base of the mixed layer the driving force of these circulations is an interaction of the mean flow with wave averaged flows of the surface waves stokes drift velocity of the waves stretches and tilts the vorticity of the flow near the surface the production of vorticity in the upper ocean is balanced by downward often turbulent diffusion formula 1 for a flow driven by a wind formula 2 characterized by friction velocity formula 3 the ratio of vorticity diffusion and production defines the langmuir number where the first definition is for a monochromatic wave field of amplitude formula 5 frequency formula 6 and wavenumber formula 7 and the second uses a generic inverse length scale formula 8 and stokes velocity scale formula 9 this is exemplified by the craik leibovich equations which are an approximation of the lagrangian mean in the boussinesq approximation the governing equations can be written where formula 11 is the fluid velocity formula 12 is planetary rotation

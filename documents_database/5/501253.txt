it is visible to the naked eye as a faint white hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of 5 37 the radial velocity of this object is poorly constrained at cowley et al 1969 listed a stellar classification of a5 iv for 1 canis minoris matching a a type subgiant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and is evolving into a giant however gray and garrison 1989 catalogued it as an a type main sequence star with a class of a4 v the hipparcos team used a class of a3 vn where the n indicates nebulous lines due to rapid rotation this star is estimated to be 716 million years old and is at or near the end of its main sequence lifetime it has a high rate of spin showing a projected rotational velocity of 159 km s the star has more than double the mass of the sun with about 4 6 times the sun s radius it is radiating 66 times the sun s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 8 374 k

although it is biosynthesized by a variety of organisms this yellowish aromatic oil is usually derived from guaiacum or wood creosote samples darken upon exposure to air and light guaiacol is present in wood smoke resulting from the pyrolysis of lignin the compound contributes to the flavor of many substances such as whisky and roasted coffee guaiacol is produced by methylation of o catechol e g using potash and dimethyl sulfate guaiacol can be prepared by diverse routes in the laboratory o anisidine derived in two steps from anisole can be hydrolyzed via its diazonium derivative guaiacol can be synthesized by the dimethylation of catechol followed by selective mono demethylation guaiacol is a precursor to various flavorants such as eugenol and vanillin an estimated 85 of the world s supply of vanillin comes from guaiacol the route entails condensation of glyoxylic acid with guaiacol to give mandelic acid which is oxidized to produce a phenylglyoxylic acid this acid undergoes a decarboxylation to afford vanillin guaiacol is produced in the gut of desert locusts schistocerca gregaria by the breakdown of plant material this process is undertaken by the gut bacterium pantoea agglomerans enterobacter it is one of the main components of

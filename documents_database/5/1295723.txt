each building block was magnetically attached to a metal plate serving both as a work surface and ground eliminating the need for soldering spring terminals or a breadboard this gave the benefit of safety as well as the ability to rearrange the blocks to determine the effect on the circuit the instruction manual gave instruction on the proper arrangement of the blocks as well as the function of each individual component s contribution to the final circuit experiments began with simple circuits such as a basic electric lamp circuit with switch and worked its way to a three transistor radio with loudspeaker the raytheon models have not been officially sold in the us since 1969 the lectron product is still being manufactured in frankfurt germany and is available for sale with shipping world wide however all the manuals are in german with no plans for translation into english or any other language the lectron electronic blocks system and product was the exclusive and unique invention of georg greger in the early 1960s he applied for a patent of his electronik baukasten electronic building blocks on may 7 1965 he was issued a german patent 1228081 on may 18 1967 and

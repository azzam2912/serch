they are distinct for their characteristically short beaked parrot like skulls with or without bony crests atop the head they ranged in size from caudipteryx which was the size of a turkey to the 8 metre long 1 4 ton gigantoraptor the group along with all maniraptoran dinosaurs is close to the ancestry of birds analyses like those of maryanska et al 2002 and osm lska et al 2004 suggest that they may represent primitive flightless birds the most complete oviraptorosaur specimens have been found in asia the north american oviraptorosaur record is sparse the earliest and most basal primitive known oviraptorosaurs are ningyuansaurus wangi protarchaeopteryx robusta and incisivosaurus gauthieri both from the lower yixian formation of china dating to about 125 million years ago during the aptian age of the early cretaceous period a tiny neck vertebra reported from the wadhurst clay formation of england shares some features in common with oviraptorosaurs and may represent an earlier occurrence of this group at about 140 million years ago oviraptorosaurians have shortened rostrums massive beaklike mandibles and long parietal bones with the exception of the 8 meter long gigantoraptor they are generally medium sized and rarely exceeded 2 meters in length

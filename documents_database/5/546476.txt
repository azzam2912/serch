it was the first significant development in the theory of networks of queues and generalising and applying the ideas of the theorem to search for similar product form solutions in other networks has been the subject of much research including ideas used in the development of the internet the networks were first identified by james r jackson and his paper was re printed in the journal s ten most influential titles of management sciences first fifty years jackson was inspired by the work of burke and reich though jean walrand notes product form results are a much less immediate result of the output theorem than jackson himself appeared to believe in his fundamental paper an earlier product form solution was found by r r p jackson for tandem queues a finite chain of queues where each customer must visit each queue in order and cyclic networks a loop of queues where each customer must visit each queue in order a jackson network consists of a number of nodes where each node represents a queue in which the service rate can be both node dependent different nodes have different service rates and state dependent service rates change depending on queue lengths

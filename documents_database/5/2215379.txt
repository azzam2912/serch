the star was 25 times the mass of the sun and was 20 million light years distant from earth in march through to may 2009 its bolometric luminosity increased to at least a million solar luminosities but by 2015 it had disappeared from optical view in the mid and near infrared an object is still visible however it is fading away with a brightness proportional to t the brightening was insufficient to be a supernova and is called a failed supernova the star s coordinates were at ra and dec the brightness of the star given by its apparent magnitude in different colour bands on 2 july 2005 is given by r 21 v 21 b 22 u 23 prior to the optical outburst the star was about 100 000 times as bright as the sun after the outburst it was invisible in the visual band and has declined to 5000 times as bright as the sun in infrared radiation one hypothesis is that the core of the star collapsed to form a black hole the collapsing matter formed a burst of neutrinos that lowered the total mass of the star by a fraction of a percent this caused a

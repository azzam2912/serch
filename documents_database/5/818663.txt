a manifold is said to be k hler einstein if it admits a k hler einstein metric the most important special case of these are the calabi yau manifolds which are k hler and ricci flat the most important problem for this area is the existence of k hler einstein metrics for compact k hler manifolds in the case in which there is a k hler metric the ricci curvature is proportional to the k hler metric therefore the first chern class is either negative or zero or positive when the first chern class is negative aubin and yau proved that there is always a k hler einstein metric when the first chern class is zero yau proved the calabi conjecture that there is always a k hler einstein metric shing tung yau was awarded with his fields medal because of this work that leads to the name calabi yau manifolds the third case the positive or fano case is the hardest in this case there is a non trivial obstruction to existence in 2012 chen donaldson and sun proved that in this case existence is equivalent to an algebro geometric criterion called k stability their proof appeared in a

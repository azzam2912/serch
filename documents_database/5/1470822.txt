the main advantage of sma is that it uses a bounded memory while the a algorithm might need exponential memory all other characteristics of sma are inherited from a like a it expands the most promising branches according to the heuristic what sets sma apart is that it prunes nodes whose expansion has revealed less promising than expected the approach allows the algorithm to explore branches and backtrack to explore other branches expansion and pruning of nodes is driven by keeping two values of formula 1 for every node node formula 2 stores a value formula 3 which estimates the cost of reaching the goal by taking a path through that node the lower the value the higher the priority as in a this value is initialized to formula 4 but will then be updated to reflect changes to this estimate when its children are expanded a fully expanded node will have an formula 1 value at least as high as that of its successors in addition the node stores the formula 1 value of the best forgotten successor this value is restored if the forgotten successor is revealed to be the most promising successor starting with the first node

it is however very nearly circular the crater is located to the west of the mare undarum and northeast of the similar sized crater apollonius to the north of firmicus are the craters van albada and auzout attached to its northwest rim is the lacus perseverantiae a miniature lunar mare the crater is named after 4th century roman astrologer julius firmicus maternus the most notable aspect of firmicus is the dark flat floor it has a similar albedo to the surface of mare crisium to the north making it stand out somewhat from its surroundings the floor has suffered no significant impacts since it was created although there are undoubtedly many minor impacts across its surface the outer rim of firmicus has undergone some erosion particularly along the northern rim where it is overlain by a pair of small craterlets by convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to firmicus

it was formerly known as mpegplus mpeg or mp development of mpc was initiated in 1997 by andree buschmann and later assumed by frank klemm and as of 2004 is maintained by the musepack development team mdt with assistance from buschmann and klemm encoders and decoders are available for microsoft windows linux and mac os x and plugins for several third party media players available from the musepack website licensed under the gnu lesser general public license lgpl or bsd licenses and an extensive list of programs supporting the format musepack was developed using the mp2 codec as a starting point but many features have since been added including the psychoacoustic model of mpc is based on mpeg iso model 2 but is extended by cvd clear voice detection the quantization algorithm of the mpc encoder performs spectral shaping of the noise called adaptive noise shaping ans in order to overcome the low frequency resolution of the polyphase quadrature filter bands mpc uses the apev2 tag metadata container musepack is mainly optimized for transparent encoding at the standard preset 175 185 kbit s very few optimisations have been made at lower bitrates like 128 kbit s nevertheless various listening tests

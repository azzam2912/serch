asymptomatic carriers play a critical role in the transmission of common infectious diseases such as typhoid c difficile influenzas and hiv while the mechanism of disease carrying is still unknown researchers have made progress towards understanding how certain pathogens can remain dormant in a human for a period of time a better understanding of asymptomatic disease carriers is crucial to the fields of medicine and public health as they work towards mitigating the spread of common infectious diseases asymptomatic carriers can be categorized by their current disease state when an individual transmits pathogens immediately following infection but prior to developing symptoms they are known as an incubatory carrier humans are also capable of spreading disease following a period of illness typically thinking themselves cured of the disease these individuals are known as convalescent carriers viral diseases such as hepatitis and poliomyelitis are frequently transmitted in this manner considered to be the classic asymptomatic carriers healthy carriers never exhibit signs or symptoms of the disease yet are capable of infecting others the limited information on the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers creates a considerable difficulty when planning public health initiatives given that disease surveillance is dependent on estimates for both the asymptomatic

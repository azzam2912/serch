while there are a range of potential services identified corresponding to different types of mission operations information that are exchanged within a system status parameters control actions orbital data mission timelines etc these application level services are implemented in terms of a smaller set of generic interaction patterns that allow current status to be observed operations to be invoked and bulk data transferred this has two key benefits it is inherently extensible as new services can be overlaid on the existing common services and the investment made in mo applications is further isolated from the implementation technology technology adapters allow the underlying communications infrastructure to be changed or bridged with minimal impact on the applications themselves this improves long term maintainability as missions often outlive the ground technology used to deploy them initially the layers of the mission operations service framework are the interface between each layer is defined in the ccsds standards and therefore implementations of the each layer can be replaced without change to other software to provide implementation language and message transport independence all operations of a service must be defined by a language platform encoding agnostic specification the mal defines this set of basic data types

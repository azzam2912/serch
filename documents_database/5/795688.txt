lane is best known for his role in the development of extended technicolor models of physics beyond the standard model lane received his b sc and m sc in physics at the georgia institute of technology and was a student of chung wook kim at johns hopkins university where he received his ph d in 1970 his physics research focuses on the problems of electroweak and flavor symmetry breaking with estia j eichten lane co invented extended technicolor he and eichten also contributed to early work on charmonium with kurt gottfried tom kinoshita and tung mow yan in 1984 he coauthored supercollider physics with eichten ian hinchliffe and chris quigg which has strongly influenced the quest for future discoveries at hadron colliders such as the fermilab tevatron the ssc and the lhc at cern in 2011 dr lane with chris quigg estia eichten and ian hinchliffe won the j j sakurai prize for theoretical particle physics for their work separately and collectively to chart a course of the exploration of tev scale physics using multi tev hadron colliders

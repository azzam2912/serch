few historical records of arthur remain and there are doubts that he ever existed but he achieved a mythological stature that gave rise to a growing literature about his life and deeds one recurrent aspect of arthurian literature was the notion that he would one day return in the role of a messiah to save his people the possibility of arthur s return is first mentioned by william of malmesbury in 1125 but arthur s grave is nowhere seen whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return in the miracles of st mary of laon de miraculis sanctae mariae laudensis written by a french cleric and chronicler named h riman of tournai in c 1145 but referring to events that occurred in 1113 mention is made of the breton and cornish belief that arthur still lived as constance bullock davies demonstrated various non welsh sources indicate that this belief in arthur s eventual messianic return was extremely widespread amongst the britons from the 12th century onwards how much earlier than this it existed is still debated it did in fact remain a powerful aspect of the arthurian legend through the medieval period and beyond so john lydgate in

flexibility and modularity are the project s key design objectives openxpki is mostly written in perl the software is separated into a server process and several client implementations which communicate with the server via unix domain sockets one of these client implementations is a web frontend that allows users to access the openxpki system using a web browser a different client implements a scep server the openxpki server mainly consists of a toolbox that provides the core cryptographic functions and a workflow engine that allows to define workflows implementing the pki processes openxpki supports the configuration of multiple independent logical pkis aka pki realms in one single application instance this allows for configuration e g of a root ca and one or more subordinate cas within one single installation within a logical pki pki realm openxpki provides the possibility to configure multiple issuing cas with overlapping validity once a new issuing ca becomes valid it automatically takes over for issuing new certificates this feature allows for a fully automatic ca rollover where administrators do not have to take down and reconfigure the whole pki installation once a ca certificate is about to expire openxpki utilizes a workflow engine that allows

both names are acceptable as a fibonacci crystal denotes a quasicrystal and a fibonacci quasicrystal is a specific type of quasicrystal fibonacci chains or lattices are closely related terms depending on the dimension of the model while it is used mostly as a theoretical construct physical models are implemented in order to verify the concept empirically most of its applications pertain to various areas of solid state physics the mathematical properties of the fibonacci word and related topics are well researched and readily applied in such studies the elements of a fibonacci crystal structure are arranged in one or more spatial dimensions according to the sequence given by the fibonacci word the fourier transform of such arrangements consists of discrete values which is the defining property for crystals in an algebraic form the sequence is expressed via a matrix whose eigenvalues are pisot vijayaraghavan numbers pv numbers this feature guarantees that its fourier transform is discrete material waves with appropriate length interfere constructively when interacting with a fibonacci structured physical system for instance when submitted to x rays a fibonacci quasicrystal produces bragg peaks other features describing media behaviour such as damping transmitivity etc can be evidenced on fibonacci models

a key fob or software a soft token which is assigned to a computer user and which creates an authentication code at fixed intervals usually 60 seconds using a built in clock and the card s factory encoded almost random key known as the seed the seed is different for each token and is loaded into the corresponding rsa securid server rsa authentication manager formerly ace server as the tokens are purchased on demand tokens are also available which provide a tokencode via email or sms delivery eliminating the need to provision a token to the user the token hardware is designed to be tamper resistant to deter reverse engineering when software implementations of the same algorithm software tokens appeared on the market public code had been developed by the security community allowing a user to emulate rsa securid in software but only if they have access to a current rsa securid code and the original 64 bit rsa securid seed file introduced to the server later the 128 bit rsa securid algorithm was published as part of an open source library in the rsa securid authentication scheme the seed record is the secret key used to generate one time

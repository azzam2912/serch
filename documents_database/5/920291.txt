these materials find use in specialized optical settings such as focusing elements in research spectrophotometers compared to the more common zinc selenide based optics materials such as thallium bromoiodide enable transmission at longer wavelengths in the infrared this allows for measurements as low as 350 cm 28 m whereas zinc selenide is opaque by 21 5 m and znse optics are generally only usable to 650 cm 15 m the monohalides all contain thallium with oxidation state 1 parallels can be drawn between the thallium i halides and their corresponding silver salts for example thallium i chloride and bromide are light sensitive and thallium i fluoride is more soluble in water than the chloride and bromide thallium bromoiodide and thallium bromochloride are mixed salts of thallium i that are used in spectroscopy as an optical material for transmission refraction and focusing of infrared radiation the materials were first grown by r koops in the laboratory of olexander smakula at the carl zeiss optical works jena in 1941 the red bromoiodide was coded krs 5 and the colourless bromochloride krs 6 and this is how they are commonly known the krs prefix is an abbreviation of kristalle aus dem schmelz fluss

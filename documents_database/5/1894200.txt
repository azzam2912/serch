they were studied at the courant institute by harold grad in the late 1950s and early 1960s the magnetic fields in this system were made by electromagnets placed close together this was a theoretical construct used to model how to contain plasma the fields were made by two coils of wire facing one another these electromagnets had poles which faced one another and in the center was a null point in the magnetic field this was also termed a zero point field these devices were explored theoretically by dr harold grad at nyu s courant institute in the late 1950s and early 1960s because the fields were planar symmetric this plasma system was simple to model simulations of these geometries revealed the existence of three classes of particles the first class moved back and forth far away from the null point these particles would be reflected close to the poles of the electromagnets and the plane cusp in the center this reflection was due to the magnetic mirror effect these are very stable particles but their motion changes as they radiate energy over time this radiation loss arose from acceleration or deceleration by the field and can be calculated using

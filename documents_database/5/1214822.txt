it is weaker than isotopy and stronger than homotopy isotopy implies concordance implies homotopy a link is a slice link if it is concordant to the unlink a function of a link that is invariant under concordance is called a concordance invariant the linking number of any two components of a link is one of the most elementary concordance invariants the signature of a knot is also a concordance invariant a subtler concordance invariant are the milnor invariants and in fact all rational finite type concordance invariants are milnor invariants and their products though non finite type concordance invariants exist one can analogously define concordance for any two submanifolds formula 6 in this case one considers two submanifolds concordant if there is a cobordism between them in formula 7 i e if there is a manifold with boundary formula 8 whose boundary consists of formula 9 and formula 10 this higher dimensional concordance is a relative form of cobordism it requires two submanifolds to be not just abstractly cobordant but cobordant in n

this conformational switch is proposed to play a role in rna alternative splicing and may influence the production of m1 and m2 proteins produced by splicing of this pre mrna this structured region was first discovered in a bioinformatics survey of influenza a based on thermodynamic folding free energy and amino acid codon suppression initial models of the secondary structure were based on computational methods for nucleic acid structure prediction the hairpin conformation was predicted using rnaalifold while the pseudoknot was predicted with dotknot segment 7 encodes the m1 protein and the smaller m2 proton channel protein which is produced by rna splicing m2 protein is critical to the virus it forms the ion channels that allow for acidification of the virion that stimulates in un coating the 3 splice site region used to produce m2 was experimentally probed with structure sensitive chemicals and enzymes and was found to adopt both the hairpin and pseudoknot conformations in solution each conformation places important splicing regulatory sites in different structural environments which has implications for the modulation of splicing of the segment 7 transcript for example the splice site polypyrimidine tract branch point and asf sf2 exonic enhancer binding sites are expected

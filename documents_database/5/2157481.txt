several methods for template estimation based on bayesian probability and statistics in the random orbit model of ca have emerged for submanifolds and dense image volumes linear algebra is one of the central tools to modern engineering central to linear algebra is the notion of an orbit of vectors with the matrices forming groups matrices with inverses and identity which act on the vectors in linear algebra the equations describing the orbit elements the vectors are linear in the vectors being acted upon by the matrices in computational anatomy the space of all shapes and forms is modeled as an orbit similar to the vectors in linear algebra however the groups do not act linear as the matrices do and the shapes and forms are not additive in computational anatomy addition is essentially replaced by the law of composition the central group acting ca defined on volumes in formula 1 are the diffeomorphisms formula 2 which are mappings with 3 components formula 3 law of composition of functions formula 4 with inverse formula 5 groups and group are familiar to the engineering community with the universal popularization and standardization of linear algebra as a basic model a popular group action

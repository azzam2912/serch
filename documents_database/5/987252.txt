most scientists in the field now refer to this enzyme as cpa1 and to a related pancreatic carboxypeptidase as cpa2 in addition there are 4 other mammalian enzymes named cpa 3 through cpa 6 and none of these are expressed in the pancreas instead these other cpa like enzymes have diverse functions cpa 1 and cpa 2 and it is presumed all other cpas employ a zinc ion within the protein for hydrolysis of the peptide bond at the c terminal end of an amino acid residue loss of the zinc leads to loss of activity which can be replaced easily by zinc and also by some other divalent metals cobalt nickel carboxypeptidase a is produced in the pancreas and is crucial to many processes in the human body to include digestion post translational modification of proteins blood clotting and reproduction this vast scope of functionality for a single protein makes it the ideal model for research regarding other zinc proteases of unknown structure recent biomedical research on collagenase enkephlinase and angiotensin converting enzyme used carboxypeptidase a for inhibitor synthesis and kinetic testing for example a drug that treats high blood pressure captopril was designed based on a carboxypeptidase a

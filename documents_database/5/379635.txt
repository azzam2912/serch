its center lies on the inner normal line and its curvature defines the curvature of the given curve at that point this circle which is the one among all tangent circles at the given point that approaches the curve most tightly was named circulus osculans latin for kissing circle by leibniz the center and radius of the osculating circle at a given point are called center of curvature and radius of curvature of the curve at that point a geometric construction was described by isaac newton in his principia imagine a car moving along a curved road on a vast flat plane suddenly at one point along the road the steering wheel locks in its present position thereafter the car moves in a circle that kisses the road at the point of locking the curvature of the circle is equal to that of the road at that point that circle is the osculating circle of the road curve at that point let formula 1 s be a regular parametric plane curve where s is the arc length the natural parameter this determines the unit tangent vector t s the unit normal vector n s the signed curvature k s and

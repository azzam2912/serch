because a full rotation equals 2 radians one degree is equivalent to radians the original motivation for choosing the degree as a unit of rotations and angles is unknown one theory states that it is related to the fact that 360 is approximately the number of days in a year ancient astronomers noticed that the sun which follows through the ecliptic path over the course of the year seems to advance in its path by approximately one degree each day some ancient calendars such as the persian calendar used 360 days for a year the use of a calendar with 360 days may be related to the use of sexagesimal numbers another theory is that the babylonians subdivided the circle using the angle of an equilateral triangle as the basic unit and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their sexagesimal numeric system the earliest trigonometry used by the babylonian astronomers and their greek successors was based on chords of a circle a chord of length equal to the radius made a natural base quantity one sixtieth of this using their standard sexagesimal divisions was a degree aristarchus of samos and hipparchus seem to have been among the first

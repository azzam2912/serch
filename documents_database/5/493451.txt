this technology allows animations to be produced much more easily and cheaply than in former years previously traditional animation required specialised labour intensive techniques that were both time consuming and expensive in contrast software is now available that makes it possible for individual educators to author their own animations without the need for specialist expertise teachers are no longer limited to relying on static graphics but can readily convert them into educational animations educators are enthusiastically taking up the opportunities that computer animation offers for depicting dynamic content for example powerpoint now has an easy to use animation facility that in the right hands can produce very effective educational animations because animations can explicitly depict changes over time temporal changes they seem ideally suited to the teaching of processes and procedures when used to present dynamic content animations can mirror both the changes in position translation and the changes in form transformation that are fundamental to learning this type of subject matter in contrast with static pictures animations can show temporal change directly rather than having to indicate it indirectly using auxiliary markings such as arrows and motion lines using animations instead of static graphics removes the need for these

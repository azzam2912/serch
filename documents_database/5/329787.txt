it was developed around 1795 and patented by the french swiss watchmaker abraham louis breguet on june 26 1801 in a tourbillon the escapement and balance wheel are mounted in a rotating cage in order to negate the effects of gravity when the timepiece thus the escapement is stuck in a certain position by continuously rotating the entire balance wheel escapement assembly at a slow rate typically about one revolution per minute the tourbillon averages out positional errors originally an attempt to improve accuracy tourbillons are still included in some expensive modern watches swiss models start at 40 000 as a novelty and demonstration of watchmaking virtuosity the mechanism is usually exposed on the watch s face to showcase it gravity directly affects the most delicate parts of the escapement namely the pallet fork balance wheel and hairspring most important is the hairspring which functions as the timing regulator for the escapement and is thus the part most sensitive to exterior effects such as magnetism shocks temperature as well as inner effects such as pinning positions inner collet terminal curve and heavy points on the balance wheel many inventions have been developed to counteract these problems temperature and magnetism problems

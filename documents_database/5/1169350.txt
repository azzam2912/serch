examples of tension members are bracing for buildings and bridges truss members and cables in suspended roof systems in an axially loaded tension member the stress is given by f p a where p is the magnitude of the load and a is the cross sectional area the stress given by this equation is exact knowing that the cross section is not adjacent to the point of application of the load nor having holes for bolts or other discontinuities for example given an 8 x 11 5 plate that is used as a tension member section a a and is connected to a gusset plate with two 7 8 inch diameter bolts section b b the area at section a a gross area of the member is 8 x 4 in however the area at section b b net area is 8 2 x 7 8 x 3 12 knowing that the higher stress is located at section b b due to its smaller area to design tension members it is important to analyse how the member would fail under both yielding excessive deformation and fracture which are considered the limit states the limit state that produces the smallest design

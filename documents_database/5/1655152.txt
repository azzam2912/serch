thus solid state nmr spectroscopy would be used primarily possibly supplemented by quantum chemistry calculations e g density functional theory powder diffraction etc if suitable crystals can be grown any crystallographic method would generally be preferred to determine the crystal structure comprising in case of organic compounds the molecular structures and molecular packing the main interest in nmr crystallography is in microcrystalline materials which are amenable to this method but not to x ray neutron and electron diffraction this is largely because interactions of comparably short range are measured in nmr crystallography when applied to organic molecules nmr crystallography aims at including structural information not only of a single molecule but also on the molecular packing i e crystal structure contrary to x ray single crystals are not necessary with solid state nmr and structural information can be obtained from high resolution spectra of disordered solids e g polymorphism is an area of interest for nmr crystallography since this is encountered occasionally and may often be previously undiscovered in organic compounds in this case a change in the molecular structure and or in the molecular packing can lead to polymorphism and this can be investigated by nmr crystallography the spin

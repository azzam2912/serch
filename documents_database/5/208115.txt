a counterpart to this device that is used for measuring rotary displacement is called a rotary variable differential transformer rvdt lvdts are robust absolute linear position displacement transducers inherently frictionless they have a virtually infinite cycle life when properly used as ac operated lvdts do not contain any electronics they can be designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures or up to 1200 f 650 c in harsh environments under high vibration and shock levels lvdts have been widely used in applications such as power turbines hydraulics automation aircraft satellites nuclear reactors and many others these transducers have low hysteresis and excellent repeatability the lvdt converts a position or linear displacement from a mechanical reference zero or null position into a proportional electrical signal containing phase for direction and amplitude for distance information the lvdt operation does not require an electrical contact between the moving part probe or core assembly and the coil assembly but instead relies on electromagnetic coupling the linear variable differential transformer has three solenoidal coils placed end to end around a tube the center coil is the primary and the two outer coils are the top and bottom secondaries a cylindrical ferromagnetic core attached to the object

acvr1 has been linked to the 2q23 24 region of the genome this protein is important in the bone morphogenic protein bmp pathway which is responsible for the development and repair of the skeletal system while knock out models with this gene are in progress the acvr1 gene has been connected to fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva a disease characterized by the formation of heterotopic bone throughout the body it is a bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1 activins are dimeric growth and differentiation factors which belong to the transforming growth factor beta tgf beta superfamily of structurally related signaling proteins activins signal through a heteromeric complex of receptor serine kinases which include at least two type i i and ib and two type ii ii and iib receptors these receptors are all transmembrane proteins composed of a ligand binding extracellular domain with cysteine rich region a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain with predicted serine threonine specificity type i receptors are essential for signaling and type ii receptors are required for binding ligands and for expression of type i receptors type i and ii receptors form a stable complex after ligand binding resulting in phosphorylation of type i receptors by type

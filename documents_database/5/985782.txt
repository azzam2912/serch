it allows grouping several physical ethernet links into one logical ethernet link to provide fault tolerance and high speed links between routers switches and servers using this technology allows or enables the use of several links from 2 up to 8 and combined them to create increased bandwidth and several fail over paths this produces server to switch or switch to switch connections that are up to 8 times faster in the past redundant links were unused due to spanning tree s loop protection fault tolerant design is an important aspect of multi link trunking technology should any one or more than one link fail the mlt technology will automatically redistribute traffic across the remaining links this automatic redistribution is accomplished in less than half a second typically less than 100 millisecond so no outage is noticed by end users this high speed recovery is required by many critical networks where outages can cause loss of life or very large monetary losses in critical networks combining mlt technology with distributed split multi link trunking dsmlt split multi link trunking smlt and r smlt technologies create networks that support the most critical applications a general limitation of standard mlt is that

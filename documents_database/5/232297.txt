the two major thromboxanes are thromboxane a2 and thromboxane b2 the distinguishing feature of thromboxanes is a 6 membered ether containing ring thromboxane is named for its role in clot formation thrombosis thromboxane a synthase an enzyme found in platelets converts the arachidonic acid derivative prostaglandin h to thromboxane thromboxane acts by binding to any of the thromboxane receptors g protein coupled receptors coupled to the g protein g thromboxane is a vasoconstrictor and a potent hypertensive agent and it facilitates platelet aggregation it is in homeostatic balance in the circulatory system with prostacyclin a related compound the mechanism of secretion of thromboxanes from platelets is still unclear they act in the formation of blood clots and reduce blood flow to the site of a clot if the cap of a vulnerable plaque erodes or ruptures as in myocardial infarction platelets stick to the damaged lining of the vessel and to each other within seconds and form a plug these sticky platelets secrete several chemicals including thromboxane a2 that stimulate vasoconstriction reducing blood flow at the site thromboxane a txa produced by activated platelets has prothrombotic properties stimulating activation of new platelets as well as increasing platelet aggregation platelet aggregation

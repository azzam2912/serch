in the modern study of linear partial differential equations green s functions are studied largely from the point of view of fundamental solutions instead under many body theory the term is also used in physics specifically in quantum field theory aerodynamics aeroacoustics electrodynamics seismology and statistical field theory to refer to various types of correlation functions even those that do not fit the mathematical definition in quantum field theory green s functions take the roles of propagators a green s function of a linear differential operator formula 1 acting on distributions over a subset of the euclidean space formula 2 at a point is any solution of where is the dirac delta function this property of a green s function can be exploited to solve differential equations of the form if the kernel of is non trivial then the green s function is not unique however in practice some combination of symmetry boundary conditions and or other externally imposed criteria will give a unique green s function green s functions may be categorized by the type of boundary conditions satisfied by a green s function number also green s functions in general are distributions not necessarily functions of a real

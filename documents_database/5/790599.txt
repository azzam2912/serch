they may be thought of as internal scar tissue that connects tissues not normally connected adhesions form as a natural part of the body s healing process after surgery in a similar way that a scar forms the term adhesion is applied when the scar extends from within one tissue across to another usually across a virtual space such as the peritoneal cavity adhesion formation post surgery typically occurs when two injured surfaces are close to one another this often causes inflammation and causes fibrin deposits onto the damaged tissues the fibrin then connects the two adjacent structures where damage of the tissues occurred the fibrin acts like a glue to seal the injury and builds the fledgling adhesion said at this point to be fibrinous in body cavities such as the peritoneal pericardial and synovial cavities a family of fibrinolytic enzymes may act to limit the extent of the initial fibrinous adhesion and may even dissolve it in many cases the production or activity of these enzymes are compromised because of injury however and the fibrinous adhesion persists if this is allowed to happen tissue repair cells such as macrophages fibroblasts and blood vessel cells penetrate into the fibrinous

viss provide physical evidence of vegetation s fundamental role in mediating sediment accumulation and erosion in clastic depositional environments viss can be broken into seven types five being hydrodynamic and two being decay related the simple hydrodynamic viss are categorized by centroclinal cross strata scratch semicircles and upturned beds the complex hydrodynamic viss are categorized by coalesced scour fills and scour and mound beds the decay related viss are categorized by mudstone filled hollows and downturned beds upturned beds are mounds of elongated sediment that are deposited on the lee downflow side of an obstruction containing form concordant stratification these may also be described as tongue shaped these beds are formed where plants were once standing and caused a decrease in bed shear allowing sediment to deposit near their base this commonly occurs with meandering flow that deposits sediment on the lee side of a plant sediment is also accumulated on the front and sides of an obstruction when deposition is high the presence of upturned beds in cross section is consistent with modern vegetation shadows sets of concentric grooves that form in sand or mud by the action of sharp objects anchored at the center of a curvature set

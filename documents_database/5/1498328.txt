the galaxy is located at the distance of about 160 kpc from the sun and moves away from the sun with the velocity of about 130 km s it is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy dsph meaning that it has an approximately round shape with the half light radius of about 130 pc leo iv is one of the smallest and faintest satellites of the milky way its integrated luminosity is about times that of the sun absolute visible magnitude of which is much lower than the luminosity of a typical globular cluster however its mass is about 1 5 million solar masses which means that leo s mass to light ratio is around 150 a high mass to light ratio implies that leo iv is dominated by the dark matter the stellar population of leo iv consists mainly of old stars formed more than 12 billion years ago the metallicity of these old stars is also very low at which means that they contain 400 times less heavy elements than the sun the observed stars were primarily red giants although a number of horizontal branch stars including three rr lyrae variable stars were also discovered the stars of

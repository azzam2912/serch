tsfc may also be thought of as fuel consumption grams second per unit of thrust kilonewtons or kn it is thus thrust specific meaning that the fuel consumption is divided by the thrust tsfc or sfc for thrust engines e g turbojets turbofans ramjets rocket engines etc is the mass of fuel needed to provide the net thrust for a given period e g lb h lbf pounds of fuel per hour pound of thrust or g s kn grams of fuel per second kilonewton mass of fuel is used rather than volume gallons or litres for the fuel measure since it is independent of temperature specific fuel consumption of air breathing jet engines at their maximum efficiency is more or less proportional to speed the fuel consumption per mile or per kilometre is a more appropriate comparison for aircraft that travel at very different speeds there also exists power specific fuel consumption which equals the thrust specific fuel consumption divided by speed it can have units of pounds per hour per horsepower this figure is inversely proportional to specific impulse sfc is dependent on engine design but differences in the sfc between different engines using the same underlying technology

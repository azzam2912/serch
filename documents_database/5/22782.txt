most are pollinators but others simply feed off the plant the non pollinators belong to several groups within the superfamily chalcidoidea while the pollinators are in the family agaonidae while pollinating fig wasps are gall makers the remaining types either make their own galls or usurp the galls of other fig wasps reports of them being parasitoids are considered dubious aristotle recorded in his history of animals that the fruits of the wild fig the caprifig contain psenes fig wasps these begin life as grubs larvae and the adult psen splits its skin pupa and flies out of the fig to find and enter a cultivated fig saving it from dropping he believed that the psen was generated spontaneously he did not recognise that the fig was reproducing sexually and that the psen was assisting in that process the fig wasps are a polyphyletic group including several unrelated lineages whose similarities are based upon their shared association with figs efforts are underway to resolve the matter and remove a number of constituent groups to other families particularly the pteromalidae and torymidae thus the number of genera in the family is in flux the family agaonidae has been recently updated to

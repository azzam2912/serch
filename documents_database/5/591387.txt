polynomial transformations such as tschirnhaus transformations are often used to simplify the solution of algebraic equations let be a polynomial and be its complex roots not necessarily distinct for any constant the polynomial whose roots are is if the coefficients of are integers and the constant formula 5 is a rational number the coefficients of may be not integer but the polynomial has integers coefficients and has the same roots as a special case is when formula 6 the resulting polynomial does not have any term in let be a polynomial the polynomial whose roots are the reciprocals of the roots of as roots is its reciprocal polynomial let be a polynomial and be a non zero constant a polynomial whose roots are the product by of the roots of is the factor appears here because if and the coefficients of are integers or belong to some integral domain the same is true for the coefficients of in the special case where formula 11 all coefficients of are multiple of and formula 12 is a monic polynomial whose coefficients belong to any integral domain containing and the coefficients of this polynomial transformation is often used to reduce questions on algebraic

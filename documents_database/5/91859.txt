ahlquist it is based on dna dna hybridization studies conducted in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s dna dna hybridization is among a class of comparative techniques in molecular biology that produce distance data versus character data and that can be analyzed to produce phylogenetic reconstructions only using phenetic tree building algorithms in dna dna hybridization the percent similarity of dna between two species is estimated by the reduction in hydrogen bonding between nucleotides of imperfectly complemented heteroduplex dna i e double stranded dnas that are experimentally produced from single strands of two different species compared with perfectly matched homoduplex dna both strands of dna from the same species this revolutionary reordering was initially widely accepted by north american ornithologists and the american ornithologists union adopted some of its provisions in other parts of the world its adoption has been more deliberative it has been a major influence on existing classification schemes but hardly any authority adopted it in its entirety the classification appears to be an early example of cladistic classification because it codifies many intermediate levels of taxa the trunk of the family tree is the class aves which branches into subclasses which branch into infraclasses and

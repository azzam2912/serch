here a d dimensional rectangular range is defined to be a cartesian product of d intervals of real numbers which is a subset of r the problem is named after victor klee who gave an algorithm for computing the length of a union of intervals the case d 1 which was later shown to be optimally efficient in the sense of computational complexity theory the computational complexity of computing the area of a union of 2 dimensional rectangular ranges is now also known but the case d 3 remains an open problem in 1977 victor klee considered the following problem given a collection of n intervals in the real line compute the length of their union he then presented an algorithm to solve this problem with computational complexity or running time formula 1 see big o notation for the meaning of this statement this algorithm based on sorting the intervals was later shown by michael fredman and bruce weide 1978 to be optimal later in 1977 jon bentley considered a 2 dimensional analogue of this problem given a collection of n rectangles find the area of their union he also obtained a complexity formula 1 algorithm now known as bentley

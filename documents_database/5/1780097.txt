for example the average monthly residential water and sewer bill in italy is 20 euro compared to 31 euro in france according to the oecd water in italy has been underpriced for a long time with about 240 liter per day per capita water use for residential uses in italy is higher than in spain or in france where it is about 160 liter per day water resources in italy are distributed unevenly with more abundant resources in the north and scarcer resources in the south most water withdrawals are for agriculture and industry with only 18 percent of water withdrawals made for drinking water supply about one third of the water withdrawn for municipal supply is not billed to the customers because of leakage malfunctioning water meters and water theft the relatively low water tariffs had been made possible by government subsidies for investments however because of high debt levels the government has been unable to sustain these subsidies and investments thus have declined to a level that may make it hard to sustain service quality with an ageing infrastructure it also makes it hard to improve service quality where necessary such as in parts of southern italy where

the design was based on that of the earlier g41 w but incorporating an improved short stroke piston gas system similar to that of the soviet tokarev svt 40 and it incorporated innovative mass production techniques germany s quest for a semi automatic infantry rifle resulted in two designs the g41 m and g41 w from mauser and walther arms respectively the mauser design was introduced in 1941 and at least 12 755 were made but it proved unreliable in combat the walther design fared better in combat but still suffered from reliability problems the problems with both designs stemmed from a demand made by the army that the rifles will not use holes drilled into the barrel known as ports to run the automatic loading mechanism meeting this requirement meant the designs had to use uncommon mechanisms that were simply unreliable and highly prone to fouling the german invasion of the soviet union led to small numbers of the svt 40 being captured and returned to germany for examination these used a simple gas mechanism powered from a port cut into the barrel about 1 3 of the way back from the end and replaced the conventional stripper reloads

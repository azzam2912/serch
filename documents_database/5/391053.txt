neutrons and protons both nucleons are affected by the nuclear force almost identically since protons have charge 1 e they experience an electric force that tends to push them apart but at short range the attractive nuclear force is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic force the nuclear force binds nucleons into atomic nuclei the nuclear force is powerfully attractive between nucleons at distances of about 1 femtometre fm or 1 0 10 metres but it rapidly decreases to insignificance at distances beyond about 2 5 fm at distances less than 0 7 fm the nuclear force becomes repulsive this repulsive component is responsible for the physical size of nuclei since the nucleons can come no closer than the force allows by comparison the size of an atom measured in angstroms or 1 0 10 m is five orders of magnitude larger the nuclear force is not simple however since it depends on the nucleon spins has a tensor component and may depend on the relative momentum of the nucleons the nuclear force plays an essential role in storing energy that is used in nuclear power and nuclear weapons work energy is required to bring charged protons together against their

these electrodes detect the small electrical changes that are a consequence of cardiac muscle depolarization followed by repolarization during each cardiac cycle heartbeat changes in the normal ecg pattern occur in numerous cardiac abnormalities including cardiac rhythm disturbances such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia inadequate coronary artery blood flow such as myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction and electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hyperkalemia in a conventional 12 lead ecg ten electrodes are placed on the patient s limbs and on the surface of the chest the overall magnitude of the heart s electrical potential is then measured from twelve different angles leads and is recorded over a period of time usually ten seconds in this way the overall magnitude and direction of the heart s electrical depolarization is captured at each moment throughout the cardiac cycle there are three main components to an ecg the p wave which represents the depolarization of the atria the qrs complex which represents the depolarization of the ventricles and the t wave which represents the repolarization of the ventricles during each heartbeat a healthy heart has an orderly progression of depolarization that starts with pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node spreads throughout

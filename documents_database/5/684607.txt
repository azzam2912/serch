one example is the davis submerged escape apparatus escape sets were also used ashore e g in the mining industry currently language in german as in english tauchen diving only means in water until the middle of the 20th century the german word tauchen to dive also meant to stay in unbreathable atmosphere thus around 1900 a water cooled fire protection hood with air supply for firefighters was called in german a feuertaucher fire diver and still into the 1940s in german a man with a breathing apparatus for use in unbreathable atmosphere was called a gastaucher gas diver but as escape sets were used more for rescue from sunken submarines and as light diving equipment the german word tauchen was restricted to underwater meanings normal breathing air contains about 20 oxygen in normal breathing the body uses about 4 and replaces it with carbon dioxide a certain volume of air can be breathed deeply several times until its oxygen portion is exhausted however each breath becomes heavier since carbon dioxide accumulates and oxygen is used up therefore this accumulating carbon dioxide must be removed from the breathing cycle for the general function of this sort of breathing set see

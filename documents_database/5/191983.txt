the central claim of distributed morphology is that there is no divide between the construction of words and sentences the syntax is the single generative engine that forms sound meaning correspondences both complex phrases and complex words this approach challenges the traditional notion of the lexicon as the unit where derived words are formed and idiosyncratic word meaning correspondences are stored in distributed morphology there is no unified lexicon as in earlier generative treatments of word formation rather the functions that other theories ascribe to the lexicon are distributed among other components of the grammar the basic principle of distributed morphology is that there is a single generative engine for the formation of both complex words and complex phrases there is no division between syntax and morphology and there is no lexicon in the sense it has in traditional generative grammar in fact distributed morphology completely rejects the notion of a lexicon in the way it had been used any operation that would occur in the lexicon according to lexicalist approaches is considered too vague in distributed morphology which instead distributes these operations over various steps and lists in contrast to lexicalist models of morphosyntax distributed morphology posits three steps

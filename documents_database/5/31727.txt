examples of shared physical media are wireless networks bus networks ring networks and point to point links operating in half duplex mode a channel access method is based on multiplexing that allows several data streams or signals to share the same communication channel or transmission medium in this context multiplexing is provided by the physical layer a channel access method is also based on a multiple access protocol and control mechanism also known as medium access control mac medium access control deals with issues such as addressing assigning multiplex channels to different users and avoiding collisions media access control is a sub layer in the data link layer of the osi model and a component of the link layer of the tcp ip model channel access schemes generally fall into the following categories the frequency division multiple access fdma channel access scheme is based on the frequency division multiplexing fdm scheme which provides different frequency bands to different data streams in the fdma case the frequency bands are allocated to different nodes or devices an example of fdma systems were the first generation 1g cell phone systems where each phone call was assigned to a specific uplink frequency channel and

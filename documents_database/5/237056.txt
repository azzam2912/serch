it is a white crystalline compound that is slightly soluble in water and freely soluble in many organic solvents classified as an unsaturated carboxylic acid it occurs naturally in a number of plants it exists as both a cis and a trans isomer although the latter is more common cinnamic acid is a central intermediate in the biosynthesis of myriad natural products include lignols precursors to lignin and lignocellulose flavonoids isoflavonoids coumarins aurones stilbenes catechin and phenylpropanoids its biosynthesis involves the action of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal on phenylalanine it is obtained from oil of cinnamon or from balsams such as storax it is also found in shea butter cinnamic acid has a honey like odor it and its more volatile ethyl ester ethyl cinnamate are flavor components in the essential oil of cinnamon in which related cinnamaldehyde is the major constituent cinnamic acid was first synthesized by the base catalysed condensation of acetyl chloride and benzaldehyde followed by hydrolysis of the acid chloride product in 1890 rainer ludwig claisen described the synthesis of ethyl cinnamate via the reaction of ethyl acetate with benzaldehyde in the presence of sodium as base another way of preparing cinnamic acid is

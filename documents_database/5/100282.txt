other goals of the project are better support for non windows platforms and support for more processors the main goal of the dotgnu project code base was to provide a class library that is 100 common language specification cls compliant dotgnu portable net an implementation of the ecma 335 common language infrastructure cli includes software to compile and run visual basic net c and c applications that use the net base class libraries xml and windows forms portable net claims to support various instruction set architectures including x86 ppc arm and sparc phpgroupware a multi user web based groupware suite which also serves to provide a collection of webservice components that can be accessed through xml rpc so that can easily integrate them into webservice applications dotgnu execution environment dgee is a web service server the libjit just in time compilation library is a library for development of advanced just in time compilation in virtual machine implementations dynamic programming languages and scripting languages it implements an intermediate representation based on three address code in which variables are kept in static single assignment form libjit has also seen some use in other open source projects including gnu emacs ildjit and hornetseye

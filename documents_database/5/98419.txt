the fluid is contained within a flexible tube fitted inside a circular pump casing though linear peristaltic pumps have been made a rotor with a number of rollers shoes wipers or lobes attached to the external circumference of the rotor compresses the flexible tube as the rotor turns the part of the tube under compression is pinched closed or occludes thus forcing the fluid to be pumped to move through the tube additionally as the tube opens to its natural state after the passing of the cam restitution or resilience fluid flow is induced to the pump this process is called peristalsis and is used in many biological systems such as the gastrointestinal tract typically there will be two or more rollers or wipers occluding the tube trapping between them a body of fluid the body of fluid is then transported at ambient pressure toward the pump outlet peristaltic pumps may run continuously or they may be indexed through partial revolutions to deliver smaller amounts of fluid the peristaltic pump was first patented in the united states by rufus porter and j d bradley in 1855 u s patent number 12753 as a well pump and later by eugene allen

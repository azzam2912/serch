it is often used as the input phosphor of an x ray image intensifier tube found in fluoroscopy equipment caesium iodide photocathodes are highly efficient at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths bulk caesium iodide crystals have the cubic cscl crystal structure but the structure type of nanometer thin csi films depends on the substrate material it is cscl for mica and nacl for lif nabr and nacl substrates caesium iodide atomic chains can be grown inside double wall carbon nanotubes in such chains i atoms appear brighter than cs atoms in electron micrographs despite having a smaller mass this difference was explained by the charge difference between cs atoms positive inner nanotube walls negative and i atoms negative as a result cs atoms are attracted to the walls and vibrate more strongly than i atoms which are pushed toward the nanotube axis an important application of caesium iodide crystals which are scintillators is electromagnetic calorimetry in experimental particle physics pure csi is a fast and dense scintillating material with relatively low light yield that increases significantly with cooling it shows two main emission components one in the near ultraviolet region at the wavelength of 310 nm and one at 460 nm the

the ultimate causes and mechanisms of sexual orientation development in humans remain unclear and many theories are speculative and controversial however advances in neuroscience explain and illustrate characteristics linked to sexual orientation studies have explored structural neural correlates functional and or cognitive relationships and developmental theories relating to sexual orientation in humans many theories concerning the development of sexual orientation involve fetal neural development with proposed models illustrating prenatal hormone exposure maternal immunity and developmental instability other proposed factors include genetic control of sexual orientation no conclusive evidence has been shown that environmental or learned effects are responsible for the development of non heterosexual orientation as of 2005 sexual dimorphisms in the brain and behavior among vertebrates were accounted for by the influence of gonadal steroidal androgens as demonstrated in animal models over the prior few decades the prenatal androgen model of homosexuality describes the neuro developmental effects of fetal exposure to these hormones in 1985 geschwind and galaburda proposed that homosexual men are exposed to high androgen levels early in development and proposed that temporal and local variations in androgen exposure to a fetus s developing brain is a factor in the pathways determining homosexuality this led scientists to

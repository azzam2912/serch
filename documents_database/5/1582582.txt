these combine equations describing conservation of water mass and momentum in streams with relations for channel hydraulic geometry width discharge scaling and basin hydrology discharge area scaling and an assumed dependency of erosion rate on either unit stream power or shear stress on the bed to produce a simplified description of erosion rate as a function of power laws of upstream drainage area a and channel slope s where e is erosion rate and k m and n are positive the value of these parameters depends on the assumptions made but all forms of the law can be expressed in this basic form the parameters k m and n are not necessarily constant but rather may vary as functions of the assumed scaling laws erosion process bedrock erodibility climate sediment flux and or erosion threshold however observations of the hydraulic scaling of real rivers believed to be in erosional steady state indicate that the ratio m n should be around 0 5 which provides a basic test of the applicability of each formulation although consisting of the product of two power laws the term stream power law refers to the derivation of the early forms of the equation from assumptions

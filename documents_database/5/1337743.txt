they were introduced to the industry in the 1990s and are important in interconnecting fiber optic cabling based systems with existing copper based structured cabling systems they are also used in metropolitan area network man access and data transport services to enterprise customers fiber media converters support many different data communication protocols including ethernet fast ethernet gigabit ethernet t1 e1 j1 ds3 e3 as well as multiple cabling types such as coax twisted pair multi mode and single mode fiber optics media converter types range from small standalone devices and pc card converters to high port density chassis systems that offer many advanced features for network management on some devices simple network management protocol snmp enables proactive management of link status monitoring chassis environmental statistics and sending traps to network managers in the event of a fiber break or even link loss on the copper port fiber media converters can connect different local area network lan media modifying duplex and speed settings switching media converters can connect different speed network segments for example existing half duplex hubs can be connected to 100base tx fast ethernet network segments over 100base fx fiber when expanding the reach of the lan to span

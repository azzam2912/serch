radiation below 100 kev is classified as x rays and is the subject of x ray astronomy in most known cases gamma rays from solar flares and earth s atmosphere are generated in the mev range but it is now known that gamma rays in the gev range can also be generated by solar flares it had been believed that gamma rays in the gev range do not originate in the solar system as gev gamma rays are important in the study of extra solar and especially extra galactic astronomy new observations may complicate some prior models and findings the mechanisms emitting gamma rays are diverse mostly identical with those emitting x rays but at higher energies including electron positron annihilation the inverse compton effect and in some cases also the decay of radioactive material gamma decay in space reflecting extreme events such as supernovae and hypernovae and the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions as in pulsars and blazars the highest photon energies measured to date are in the tev range the record being held by the crab nebula in 2004 yielding photons with as much as 80 tev observation of gamma rays first became possible in the 1960s

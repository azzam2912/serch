let k be a field and l a finite extension and hence an algebraic extension of k l can be viewed as a vector space over k multiplication by an element of l is a k linear transformation of this vector space into itself the trace tr is defined as the linear algebra trace of this linear transformation for in l let be the roots counted with multiplicity of the minimal polynomial of over k in some extension field of k then if l k is separable then each root appears only once however this does not mean the coefficient above is one for example if is the identity element 1 of k then the trace is l k times 1 more particularly if l k is a galois extension and is in l then the trace of is the sum of all the galois conjugates of i e where gal l k denotes the galois group of l k let formula 4 be a quadratic extension of formula 5 then a basis of formula 6 if formula 7 then the matrix of formula 8 is and so formula 10 the minimal polynomial of is several properties of the trace

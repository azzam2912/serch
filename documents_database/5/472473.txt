the ded domain is found in inactive procaspases cysteine proteases and proteins that regulate caspase activation in the apoptosis cascade such as fas associating death domain containing protein fadd fadd recruits procaspase 8 and procaspase 10 into a death induced signaling complex disc this recruitment is mediated by a homotypic interaction between the procaspase ded and a second ded that is death effector domain in an adaptor protein that is directly associated with activated tnf receptors complex formation allows proteolytic activation of procaspase into the active caspase form which results in the initiation of apoptosis cell death structurally the ded domain are a subclass of protein motif known as the death fold and contains 6 alpha helices that closely resemble the structure of the death domain dd ded is a subfamily of the dd superfamily other recogniazable domains in this superfamily are caspase recruitment domain card pyrin domain pyd and death domain dd the subfamilies resemble structurally one another all of them and ded in particular are composed of a bundle of 6 alpha helices but they diverge in the surface features the complete primary structure of this proteic domain has not been consensually defined some studies described residues 2

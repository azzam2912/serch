the races were managed under the auspices of the scca sports car club of america as were most races from that day to this the route was originally long but was lengthened from 1951 onwards to the search for an appropriate route for the race began at the famous 17 mile drive but that later proved unsuitable after evaluating several alternatives a collection of roads near the lodge at pebble beach was chosen partly for its location and partly because it was short enough and tight enough that it wouldn t overtax some of the small cars of the day not all of the track was paved the original 1950 route consisted of both paved two lane roads and sections of dirt or loose gravel races started along portola road near the present day equestrian center cars then turned right onto sombria lane then right again onto drake road in 1950 drivers would turn right once again onto forest lake road in 1951 and later years they turned left onto alvarado lane now stevenson drive then sharp right onto forest lake the final corner was a sharp right hander at ondulado back onto portola and past the start finish line

ring chromosomes were first discovered by lilian vaughan morgan in 1926 a ring chromosome is denoted by the symbol r in human genetics and r in drosophila genetics ring chromosomes may form in cells following genetic damage by mutagens like radiation but they may also arise spontaneously during development in order for a chromosome to form a ring both ends of the chromosome are usually missing enabling the broken ends to fuse together in rare cases the telomeres at the ends of a chromosome fuse without any loss of genetic material which results in a normal phenotype complex rearrangements including segmental microdeletions and microduplications have been seen in numerous ring chromosomes providing important clues regarding the mechanisms of their formation small supernumary rings can also form resulting in a partial trisomy ring chromosomes are unstable during cell division and can form interlocking or fused rings human genetic disorders can be caused by ring chromosome formation although ring chromosomes are very rare they have been found in all human chromosomes symptoms seen in patients carrying ring chromosomes are more likely to be caused by the deletion of genes in the telomeric regions of affected chromosomes rather than by the formation of

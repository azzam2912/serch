it represents a software architecture for distributed computing and is a special variant of the more general client server model wherein any application may behave as server or client esb promotes agility and flexibility with regard to high level protocol communication between applications its primary use is in enterprise application integration eai of heterogeneous and complex service landscapes the concept of the enterprise service bus is analogous to the bus concept found in computer hardware architecture combined with the modular and concurrent design of high performance computer operating systems the motivation for the development of the architecture was to find a standard structured and general purpose concept for describing implementation of loosely coupled software components called services that are expected to be independently deployed running heterogeneous and disparate within a network esb is also a common implementation pattern for service oriented architecture including the intrinsically adopted network design of the world wide web no global standards exist for enterprise service bus concepts or implementations most providers of message oriented middleware have adopted the enterprise service bus concept as de facto standard for a service oriented architecture the implementations of esb use event driven and standards based message oriented middleware in

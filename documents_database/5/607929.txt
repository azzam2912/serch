it is the most famous and well studied member of the general class of cycloaromatization reactions it is named for the american chemist robert g bergman b 1942 the reaction product is a derivative of benzene the reaction proceeds by a thermal reaction or pyrolysis above 200 c forming a short lived and very reactive para benzyne biradical species it will react with any hydrogen donor such as 1 4 cyclohexadiene which converts to benzene when quenched by tetrachloromethane the reaction product is a 1 4 dichlorobenzene and with methanol the reaction product is benzyl alcohol when the enyne moiety is incorporated into a 10 membered hydrocarbon ring e g cyclodeca 3 ene 1 5 diyne in scheme 2 the reaction taking advantage of increased ring strain in the reactant is possible at the much lower temperature of 37 c naturally occurring compounds such as calicheamicin contain the same 10 membered ring and are found to be cytotoxic these compounds generate the diradical intermediate described above which can cause single and double stranded dna cuts there are novel drugs which attempt to make use of this property including monoclonal antibodies such as mylotarg a biradical mechanism is also proposed for

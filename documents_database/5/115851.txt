in 1958 all in the field of mathematics kahan is now emeritus professor of mathematics and of electrical engineering and computer sciences eecs at the university of california berkeley kahan was the primary architect behind the ieee 754 1985 standard for floating point computation and its radix independent follow on ieee 854 he has been called the father of floating point since he was instrumental in creating the original ieee 754 specification kahan continued his contributions to the ieee 754 revision that led to the current ieee 754 standard in the 1980s he developed the program paranoia a benchmark that tests for a wide range of potential floating point bugs it would go on to detect the infamous pentium division bug and continues to have important uses to this day he also developed the kahan summation algorithm an important algorithm for minimizing error introduced when adding a sequence of finite precision floating point numbers he coined the term table maker s dilemma for the unknown cost of correctly rounding transcendental functions to some preassigned number of digits the davis kahan weinberger dilation theorem is one of the landmark results in the dilation theory of hilbert space operators and has found

because of the involvement of the uii system in multiple biological systems such as the cardiovascular nervous endocrine and renal it represents a promising target for the development of new drugs in humans urotensin 2 is encoded by the uts2 gene u ii was initially isolated from the neurosecretory system of the goby fish gillichthys mirabilis for many years it was thought that u ii does not exhibit significant effects in mammalian systems a view quickly overturned when it was demonstrated that goby u ii produces slow relaxation of mouse anococcygeus muscle in addition to contraction of rat artery segments in 1998 the genes for pre pro u ii were found in mammals proving that the peptide u ii did exist in mammals the u ii gene is located on chromosome 1p36 u ii peptide length varies between species due to the specific cleaving sites located at different spots depending on the species in humans u ii length is 11 amino acids the peptide sequence that is needed for biological function for both u ii and urotensin ii related peptide urp is known as the core it is hexapeptide cys tyr lys trp phe cys and is connected at the

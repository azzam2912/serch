reason emulates a rack of hardware synthesizers samplers signal processors sequencers and mixers all of which can be freely interconnected in an arbitrary manner reason can be used either as a complete virtual music studio or as a set of virtual instruments to be used with other sequencing software in a fashion that mimics live performance reason 1 0 was released on november 22 2000 the program s design mimics a studio rack into which users can insert virtual devices such as instruments effects processors and mixers these modules can be controlled from reason s built in midi sequencer or from other sequencing applications such as pro tools logic fl studio reaper digital performer cubase sonar and garageband via propellerhead s rewire protocol in the 32 bit versions of these programs since the release of version 6 reason supports rewire with 64 bit hosts as of version 7 0 1 devices available include sounds from these devices can be routed via either of two mixing devices or simple merging and splitting utilities effects include distortion reverb chorus a vocoder and mastering effects the combinator device introduced in reason 3 0 allows users to combine multiple modules into one another device

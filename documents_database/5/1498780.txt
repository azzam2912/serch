it provides advantages both of classical cellular automaton and discrete element methods important advantage of the method is a possibility of direct simulation of materials fracture including damage generation crack propagation fragmentation and mass mixing it is difficult to simulate these processes by means of continuum mechanics methods for example finite element method finite difference method etc so some new concepts like peridynamics are required discrete element method is very effective to simulate granular materials but mutual forces among movable cellular automata provides simulating solids behavior if size of automaton will be close to zero then mca behavior becomes like classical continuum mechanics methods in framework of the mca approach an object under modeling is considered as a set of interacting elements automata the dynamics of the set of automata are defined by their mutual forces and rules for their relationships this system exists and operates in time and space its evolution in time and space is governed by the equations of motion the mutual forces and rules for inter elements relationships are defined by the function of the automaton response this function has to be specified for each automaton due to mobility of automata the following new parameters of

in the aftermath the reactor experienced hydrogen gas explosions and suffered a partial meltdown along with the other two reactors in operation at the time the tsunami struck unit 1 and unit 2 efforts to remove debris and coolant water contaminated with radiation are ongoing and expected to last several decades the was a series of equipment failures nuclear meltdowns and releases of radioactive materials at the fukushima i nuclear power plant following the t hoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 march 2011 it is the largest nuclear disaster since the chernobyl disaster of 1986 the plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by general electric ge and maintained by the tokyo electric power company tepco at the time of the quake reactor 4 had been de fueled while 5 and 6 were in the cold shutdown for planned maintenance immediately after the earthquake the remaining reactors 1 3 shut down automatically and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems however the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed the flooded generators failed cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water

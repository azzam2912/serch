in these logics the set of theorems of a deviant logic can differ in any possible way from classical logic s set of theorems as a proper subset superset or fully exclusive set a notable example of this is the trivalent logic developed by polish logician and mathematician jan ukasiewicz under this system any theorem necessarily dependent on classical logic s principle of bivalence would fail to be valid the term first appears in chapter 6 of willard van orman quine s philosophy of logic new jersey prentice hall 1970 which is cited by haack on p 15 of her book haack also described what she calls a quasi deviant logic these logics are different from pure deviant logics in that finally haack defined a class of merely extended logics in these some systems of modal logic meet this definition in such systems any novel theorem would not parse in classical logic due to modal operators while deviant and quasi deviant logics are typically proposed as rivals to classical logic the impetus behind extended logics is normally only to provide a supplement to it achille varzi in his review of the 1996 edition of haack s book writes that the

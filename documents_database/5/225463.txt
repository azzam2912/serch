questions about a hyperplane arrangement a generally concern geometrical topological or other properties of the complement m a which is the set that remains when the hyperplanes are removed from the whole space one may ask how these properties are related to the arrangement and its intersection semilattice the intersection semilattice of a written l a is the set of all subspaces that are obtained by intersecting some of the hyperplanes among these subspaces are s itself all the individual hyperplanes all intersections of pairs of hyperplanes etc excluding in the affine case the empty set these subspaces are called the flats of a the intersection semilattice l a is partially ordered by reverse inclusion if the whole space s is 2 dimensional the hyperplanes are lines such an arrangement is often called an arrangement of lines historically real arrangements of lines were the first arrangements investigated if s is 3 dimensional one has an arrangement of planes the intersection semilattice l a is a meet semilattice and more specifically is a geometric semilattice if the arrangement is linear or projective or if the intersection of all hyperplanes is nonempty the intersection lattice is a geometric lattice when l a

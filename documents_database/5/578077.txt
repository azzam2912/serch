operational use began in the united states on february 1 2007 followed by canada on april 1 2013 it has also been proposed for use in france the scale has the same basic design as the original fujita scale six categories from zero to five representing increasing degrees of damage it was revised to reflect better examinations of tornado damage surveys in order to align wind speeds more closely with associated storm damage better standardizing and elucidating what was previously subjective and ambiguous it also adds more types of structures and vegetation expands degrees of damage and better accounts for variables such as differences in construction quality the newer scale was publicly unveiled by the national weather service at a conference of the american meteorological society in atlanta on february 2 2006 it was developed from 2000 to 2004 by the fujita scale enhancement project of the wind science and engineering research center at texas tech university which brought together dozens of expert meteorologists and civil engineers in addition to its own resources as with the fujita scale the enhanced fujita scale remains a damage scale and only a proxy for actual wind speeds while the wind speeds associated with

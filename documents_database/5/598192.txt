one of them relates to creating a single value which can be treated as if it had arisen from a standard zero mean unit variance normal distribution the second relates to assigning alternative values to data points within a dataset with the broad intention of creating data values than can be interpreted as being approximations for values that might have been observed had the data arisen from a standard normal distribution the first meaning is as an alternative name for the standard score or z score where values are standardised by subtracting the sample or estimated mean and dividing by the sample or other estimate of the standard deviation particularly in applications where the name normal score is used there is usually a presumption that the value can be referred to a table of standard normal probabilities as a means of providing a significance test of some hypothesis such as a difference in means the second meaning of normal score is associated with data values derived from the ranks of the observations within the dataset a given data point is assigned a value which is either exactly or an approximation to the expectation of the order statistic of the same

the software is maintained and developed by the helmholtz zentrum berlin f r materialien und energie hzb the former hahn meitner institur hmi and available for windows linux and macintosh on the vitess homepage it is widely used for simulation of existing neutron scattering instruments as well as for the development of new instruments vitess was initiated by f mezei in 1998 closely followed by the first release of vitess in 1999 and version 2 in 2001 the current version 3 including an x3d visualization interface has been released in november 2012 although it was initially developed to aid the design of neutron scattering instruments for the european spallation source ess as the name implies vitess serves as a generic simulation tool for a large variety of neutron scattering instruments at all major pulsed or continuous neutron sources it comprises all established instrument hardware such as neutron optics e g guides apertures lenses wavelength selectors e g disc choppers velocity selectors and a growing variety of samples allowing to perform virtual experiments including sophisticated setups like polarized neutrons in magnetic fields parameters specifying the instrument components can be given by means of a graphical user interface which makes vitess comparably

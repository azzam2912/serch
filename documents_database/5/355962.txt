developed by donald black as an alternative to individualistic and social psychological theories pure sociology was initially used to explain variation in legal behavior since then black and other pure sociologists have used the strategy to explain terrorism genocide lynching and other forms of conflict management as well as science art and religion pure sociology explains social life with its social geometry social life refers to any instance of human behavior such as law suicide gossip or art while the social geometry of a behavior also called its social structure refers to the social characteristics of those involved such as their degree of past interaction or their level of wealth to some extent this approach draws from aspects of earlier sociological work ranging from durkheim s emphasis on social explanations for individual behavior to later work in the variation of police and other legal behavior virtually all sociology explains the behavior of people whether groups or individuals with some reference to their mental constructs psychology or the purposes of their action teleology but pure sociology reconceptualizes human behavior as social life something that does not exist in the mind is not explainable by the aims of actions and is supraindividual

distillation is the separation or partial separation of a liquid feed mixture into components or fractions by selective boiling or evaporation and condensation the process produces at least two output fractions these fractions include at least one volatile distillate fraction which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor condensed to a liquid and practically always a bottoms or residuum fraction which is the least volatile residue that has not been separately captured as a condensed vapor an alternative to continuous distillation is batch distillation where the mixture is added to the unit at the start of the distillation distillate fractions are taken out sequentially in time one after another during the distillation and the remaining bottoms fraction is removed at the end because each of the distillate fractions are taken out at different times only one distillate exit point location is needed for a batch distillation and the distillate can just be switched to a different receiver a fraction collecting container batch distillation is often used when smaller quantities are distilled in a continuous distillation each of the fraction streams is taken simultaneously throughout operation therefore a separate exit point is needed for each fraction in practice when

in conjunction with tinctorial strength or the depth of a caramel coloring s color it describes the spectra which a solution of the coloring may produce at different dilutions and thicknesses it also has applications in brewing in his presentation at the society of soft drink technologists annual meeting in 1970 robert t linner mentioned that most caramel colors had log absorbance spectra which were essentially linear in the visible range this means that such a spectrum could be characterized by a point a log absorbance at some particular wavelength and its slope because caramel colors have warm hues i e greater absorbance for shorter wavelengths the slopes of their log absorbance spectra will be negative formula 1 is the negative of this slope multiplied by a convenient factor the linner hue index is defined as this is simply the negative of the slope of the log absorbance spectrum between 510 and 610 nm wavelength for materials that obey linner s hypothesis of linear log absorbance spectra linner hue indices typically range from 3 a greenish yellow or olive hue depending on the depth of color to 7 5 yellow for caramel colors and beers

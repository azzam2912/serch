in a nash equilibrium no player has an incentive to change his behavior in an approximate nash equilibrium this requirement is weakened to allow the possibility that a player may have a small incentive to do something different this may still be considered an adequate solution concept assuming for example status quo bias this solution concept may be preferred to nash equilibrium due to being easier to compute or alternatively due to the possibility that in games of more than 2 players the probabilities involved in an exact nash equilibrium need not be rational numbers there is more than one alternative definition given a game and a real non negative parameter formula 1 a strategy profile is said to be an formula 1 equilibrium if it is not possible for any player to gain more than formula 1 in expected payoff by unilaterally deviating from his strategy every nash equilibrium is equivalent to an formula 1 equilibrium where formula 5 formally let formula 6 be an formula 7 player game with action sets formula 8 for each player formula 9 and utility function formula 10 let formula 11 denote the payoff to player formula 9 when strategy profile formula 13

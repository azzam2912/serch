the 21264 implemented the alpha instruction set architecture isa the alpha 21264 or alpha 7 for short is a four issue superscalar microprocessor with out of order execution and speculative execution it has a peak execution rate of six instructions per cycle and could sustain four instructions per cycle it has a seven stage instruction pipeline at any given stage the microprocessor could have up to 80 instructions in various stages of execution surpassing any other contemporary microprocessor decoded instructions are held in instruction queues and are issued when their operands are available the integer queue contained 20 entries and the floating point queue 15 each queue could issue as many instructions as there were pipelines the ebox executes integer load and store instructions it has two integer units two load store units and two integer register files each integer register file contained 80 entries of which 32 are architectural registers 40 are rename registers and 8 are pal shadow registers there was no entry for register r31 because in the alpha architecture r31 is hardwired to zero and is read only each register file served an integer unit and a load store unit and the register file and its

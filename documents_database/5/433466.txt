de sitter showed that ritz s theory predicted that the orbits of binary stars would appear more eccentric than consistent with experiment and with the laws of mechanics however the experimental result was negative this was confirmed by brecher in 1977 by observing the x rays spectrum for other experiments related to special relativity see tests of special relativity according to simple emission theory light thrown off by an object should move at a speed of formula 1 with respect to the emitting object if there are no complicating dragging effects the light would then be expected to move at this same speed until it eventually reached an observer for an object moving directly towards or away from the observer at formula 2 metres per second this light would then be expected to still be travelling at formula 3 or formula 4 metres per second at the time it reached us in 1913 willem de sitter argued that if this was true a star orbiting in a double star system would usually with regard to us alternate between moving towards us and away from us light emitted from different parts of the orbital path would travel towards us at different

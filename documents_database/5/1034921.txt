it can be an oogonium an oocyte or an ootid an oocyte in turn can be either primary or secondary depending on how far it has come in its process of meiosis oogonia are the cells that turn into primary oocytes in oogenesis they are diploid i e oogonia are created in early embryonic life all have turned into primary oocytes at late fetal age the primary oocyte is defined by its process of ootidogenesis which is meiosis it has duplicated its dna so that each chromosome has two chromatids i e 92 chromatids all in all 4c when meiosis i is completed one secondary oocyte and one polar body is created primary oocytes have been created in late fetal life this is the stage where immature ova spend most of their lifetime more specifically in diplotene of prophase i of meiosis the halt is called dictyate most degenerate by atresia but a few go through ovulation and that s the trigger to the next step thus an immature ovum can spend up to 55 years as a primary oocyte the last ovulation before menopause the secondary oocyte is the cell that is formed by meiosis i in oogenesis thus

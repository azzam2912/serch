the 3 factors are not completely independent but they are very close and can be treated as such so what does this mean it means that to increase resolution of two peaks on a chromatogram one of the three terms of the equation need to be modified 1 n can be increased by lengthening the column least effective as doubling the column will get a 2 or 1 44x increase in resolution 2 increasing k also helps this can be done by lowering the column temperature in g c or by choosing a weaker mobile phase in l c moderately effective 3 changing is the most effective way of increasing resolution this can be done by choosing a stationary phase that has a greater difference between k and k it can also be done in l c by using ph to invoke secondary equilibria if applicable the fundamental resolution equation is derived as follows for two closely spaced peaks and so r t t t t 4 where t and t are the retention times of two separate peaks since n t then t n using substitution r n t t 4t n 4 1 t t now using the

based on the system s electromagnetic spectrum it is located around 351 light years 107 9 parsecs away the total apparent magnitude is 7 07 but because of interstellar dust between it and the earth it appears 0 22 0 09 magnitudes dimmer than it should be the brightest star is a young a type main sequence star and further out are two lower mass stars a jupiter mass planet or a low mass brown dwarf was once thought to be orbiting the central star but this has been ruled out the brightest star in the hd 131399 system is designated hd 131399 a its spectral type is a1v and it is 2 08 times as massive as the sun the two lower mass stars are designated hd 131399 b and c respectively b is a g type main sequence star while hd 131399 c is a k type main sequence star both stars are less massive than the sun hd 131399 b and c are located very close to each other and the two orbit each other in turn the b c pair orbits the central star a at a distance of 349 astronomical units au this orbit takes

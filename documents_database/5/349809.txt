the internal energy of a molecule consists of all the energy stored within it a strained molecule has an additional amount of internal energy which an unstrained molecule does not this extra internal energy or strain energy can be likened to a compressed spring much like a compressed spring must be held in place to prevent release of its potential energy a molecule can be held in an energetically unfavorable conformation by the bonds within that molecule without the bonds holding the conformation in place the strain energy would be released the equilibrium of two molecular conformations is determined by the difference in gibbs free energy of the two conformations from this energy difference the equilibrium constant for the two conformations can be determined if there is a decrease in gibbs free energy from one state to another this transformation is spontaneous and the lower energy state is more stable a highly strained higher energy molecular conformation will spontaneously convert to the lower energy molecular conformation enthalpy and entropy are related to gibbs free energy through the equation at a constant temperature enthalpy is typically the more important thermodynamic function for determining a more stable molecular conformation while there are

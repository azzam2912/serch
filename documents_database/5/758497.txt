common departure functions include those for enthalpy entropy and internal energy departure functions are used to calculate real fluid extensive properties i e properties which are computed as a difference between two states a departure function gives the difference between the real state at a finite volume or non zero pressure and temperature and the ideal state usually at zero pressure or infinite volume and temperature for example to evaluate enthalpy change between two points h v t and h v t we first compute the enthalpy departure function between volume v and infinite volume at t t then add to that the ideal gas enthalpy change due to the temperature change from t to t then subtract the departure function value between v and infinite volume departure functions are computed by integrating a function which depends on an equation of state and its derivative general expressions for the enthalpy h entropy s and gibbs free energy g are given by the peng robinson equation of state relates the three interdependent state properties pressure p temperature t and molar volume v from the state properties p v t one may compute the departure function for enthalpy per mole denoted h

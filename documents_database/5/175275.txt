under intense pressure but limited temperature the crystalline structure of quartz is deformed along planes inside the crystal these planes which show up as lines under a microscope are called planar deformation features pdfs or shock lamellae shocked quartz was discovered following underground nuclear bomb testing which generated the intense pressures required to alter the quartz lattice eugene shoemaker showed that shocked quartz is also found inside craters created by meteor impact such as the barringer crater and chicxulub crater the presence of shocked quartz supports that such craters were formed by impact because a volcanic eruption would not generate the required pressure lightning is now known to contribute to the surface record of shocked quartz grains complicating identification of hypervelocity impact features shocked quartz is usually associated in nature with two high pressure polymorphs of silicon dioxide coesite and stishovite these polymorphs have a crystal structure different from standard quartz this structure can be formed only by intense pressure more than 2 gigapascals but at moderate temperatures coesite and stishovite are usually viewed as indicative of impact events eclogite facies metamorphism or thermonuclear explosion but are also found in sediments prone to lightning strikes and in fulgurites shocked quartz

the basic idea is to approximately represent a signal formula 2 from hilbert space formula 3 as a weighted sum of finitely many functions formula 4 called atoms taken from formula 1 an approximation with formula 6 atoms has the form where formula 4 is the formula 9th column of the matrix formula 1 and formula 11 is the scalar weighting factor amplitude for the atom formula 4 normally not every atom in formula 1 will be used in this sum instead matching pursuit chooses the atoms one at a time in order to maximally greedily reduce the approximation error this is achieved by finding the atom that has the highest inner product with the signal assuming the atoms are normalized subtracting from the signal an approximation that uses only that one atom and repeating the process until the signal is satisfactorily decomposed i e the norm of the residual is small where the residual after calculating formula 14 and formula 15 is denoted by if formula 17 converges quickly to zero then only a few atoms are needed to get a good approximation to formula 2 such sparse representations are desirable for signal coding and compression more precisely the

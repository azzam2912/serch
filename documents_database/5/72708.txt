wreath products are used in the classification of permutation groups and also provide a way of constructing interesting examples of groups given two groups a and h there exist two variations of the wreath product the unrestricted wreath product a wr h also written a h and the restricted wreath product a wr h given a set with an h action there exists a generalization of the wreath product which is denoted by a wr h or a wr h respectively the notion generalizes to semigroups and is a central construction in the krohn rhodes structure theory of finite semigroups let a and h be groups and a set with h acting on it let k be the direct product of copies of a a indexed by the set the elements of k can be seen as arbitrary sequences a of elements of a indexed by with component wise multiplication then the action of h on extends in a natural way to an action of h on the group k by then the unrestricted wreath product a wr h of a by h is the semidirect product k h the subgroup k of a wr h is called the base

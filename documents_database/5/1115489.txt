unlike say lebesgue measure which measures a set s volume or physical extent capacity is a mathematical analogue of a set s ability to hold electrical charge more precisely it is the capacitance of the set the total charge a set can hold while maintaining a given potential energy the potential energy is computed with respect to an idealized ground at infinity for the harmonic or newtonian capacity and with respect to a surface for the condenser capacity the notion of capacity of a set and of capacitable set was introduced by gustave choquet in 1950 for a detailed account see reference let be a closed smooth n 1 dimensional hypersurface in n dimensional euclidean space n 3 k will denote the n dimensional compact i e closed and bounded set of which is the boundary let s be another n 1 dimensional hypersurface that encloses in reference to its origins in electromagnetism the pair s is known as a condenser the condenser capacity of relative to s denoted c s or cap s is given by the surface integral where c s can be equivalently defined by the volume integral the condenser capacity also has a variational characterization c

other names for this are the systematic name 2 3 aziridinedione or oxalimide the chemical formula is chno its core is a three member heterocycle aziridine in 1886 ost and mente claimed to produce oximide by the reaction of oxamic acid with phosphorus pentachloride pcl however a product with a six member ring tetraketopiperazine may have been produced instead later attempts to reproduce the production of oximide by this method were a failure however the first successful manufacture of oximide was by hiromu aoyama masami sakamoto and yoshimori omote in 1980 aziridine 2 3 dione has an infrared absorption band at 1954 cm the term oximide has also been used for oximes derivatives of oximide exist where the hydrogen atom is substituted by other organic groups such as methyl or phenyl when 4 methyl 1 2 4 triazolinedione is irradiated by ultraviolet light with wavelength 335 nm in a noble gas matrix some methylaziridine 2 3 dione is made along with isocyanates carbon monoxide and dinitrogen similarly 4 phenyl 1 2 4 triazolinedione irradiated by ultraviolet light with wavelength 310 nm makes some phenylaziridine 2 3 dione shorter wavelength ultraviolet light decomposes these compounds to isocyanates nco another method to

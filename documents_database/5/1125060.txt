typically a monad transformer is created by generalising an existing monad applying the resulting monad transformer to the identity monad yields a monad which is equivalent to the original monad ignoring any necessary boxing and unboxing a monad transformer consists of given any monad formula 1 the option monad transformer formula 2 where formula 3 denotes the option type is defined by given any monad formula 1 the exception monad transformer formula 6 where is the type of exceptions is defined by given any monad formula 1 the reader monad transformer formula 9 where is the environment type is defined by given any monad formula 1 the state monad transformer formula 12 where is the state type is defined by given any monad formula 1 the writer monad transformer formula 15 where is endowed with a monoid operation with identity element formula 16 is defined by given any monad formula 1 the continuation monad transformer maps an arbitrary type into functions of type formula 19 where is the result type of the continuation it is defined by note that monad transformations are usually not commutative for instance applying the state transformer to the option monad yields a type formula 21

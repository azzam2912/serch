while krazy enjoys himself and even sings i ve been working on the railroad the passengers are disoriented by the coaches tilting back and forth when the train stops at a station the passengers exit express their dislike of the ride before boarding a more modern train at the place as krazy continues to run his train a villainous mutt some miles ahead ties a man and a woman who are a couple onto the track krazy however notices the restrained couple on time krazy dives his train into the ground going under them before getting back to the surface krazy comes out of the train to untie the couple the man gives krazy a sack of cash as a sign of gratitude krazy uses the money he received from the man to purchase one of the modern trains the man and the woman are onboard as passengers but troubles are not over as the mutt returns in an airplane to drop bombs on the train the couple however is not defenseless as the man uses a trumpet to summon an army tank to the scene after firing several rounds the airplane is eventually shot down

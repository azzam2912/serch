the probe is completely non metallic the fiber optical sensor is completely non conductive and offers complete immunity to rfi emi nmr and microwave radiation with high temperature operating capability intrinsic safety and non invasive use the principle of operation is based on the temperature dependence of the band gap of gaas the gaas crystal fixed on the tip of the fiber will be transparent at a wavelength above 850nm the position of the band edge is temperature dependent and is shifted about 0 4nm k the light is directed via the optical fiber to the crystal where it is absorbed and partially reflected back into the fiber a miniature spectrometer provides a spectrum with the position of the band edge from which the temperature is calculated fiber optic sensors offer complete immunity to rf and microwave radiation with high temperature operating capability so they can be used for measurement on patients and materials in magnetic resonance scanner mri in strong magnetic fields there is a small offset in the temperature reading approximately proportional to the strength of the magnetic field squared the magnitude of the offset is also affected by the orientation of the gaas crystal within the magnetic

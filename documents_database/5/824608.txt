electromechanical components known as vibrators were used in a circuit similar to modern solid state inverter circuits to provide a pulsating dc which could be converted to a higher voltage with a transformer rectified and filtered to create higher voltage dc this vibrator is essentially a relay using normally closed contacts to supply power to the relay coil thus immediately breaking the connection only to be reconnected very quickly through the normally closed contacts it happens so rapidly it vibrates and sounds like a buzzer this same rapidly pulsing contact applies the rising and falling dc voltage to the transformer which can step it up to a higher voltage the primary use for this type of circuit was to operate vacuum tube radios in vehicles but it also saw use with other mobile electronic devices with a 6 or 12 v accumulator especially in places with no mains electricity supply such as farms these vibrator power supplies became popular in the 1940s replacing more bulky motor generator systems for the generation of ac voltages for such applications vacuum tubes require plate voltages ranging from about 45 volts to 250 volts in electronic devices such as radios for portable radios hearing

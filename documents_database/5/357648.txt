atom economy is an important concept of green chemistry philosophy and one of the most widely used metrics for measuring the greenness of a process or synthesis atom economy can be written as for a multi step process where the intermediates are formed in one step and consumed during a later step formula 2 formula 3 formula 4 formula 5 atom economy is a different concern than chemical yield because a high yielding process can still result in substantial byproducts examples include the cannizzaro reaction in which approximately 50 of the reactant aldehyde becomes the other oxidation state of the target the wittig reaction which uses high mass phosphorus reagents that ultimately become waste and the gabriel synthesis which produces a stoichiometric quantity of phthalic acid if the desired product has an enantiomer the reaction needs to be sufficiently stereoselective even when atom economy is 100 a diels alder reaction is an example of a potentially very atom efficient reaction that also can be chemo regio diastereo and enantioselective catalytic hydrogenation comes the closest to being an ideal reaction that is extensively practiced both industrially and academically atom economy can also be adjusted if a pendant group is recoverable for

that is if p always maps distinct arguments to distinct values then the values of p cover all of c the full theorem generalizes to any algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field grothendieck s proof of the theorem is based on proving the analogous theorem for finite fields and their algebraic closures that is for any field f that is itself finite or that is the closure of a finite field if a polynomial p from f to itself is injective then it is bijective if f is a finite field then f is finite in this case the theorem is true for trivial reasons having nothing to do with the representation of the function as a polynomial any injection of a finite set to itself is a bijection when f is the algebraic closure of a finite field the result follows from hilbert s nullstellensatz the ax grothendieck theorem for complex numbers can therefore be proven by showing that a counterexample over c would translate into a counterexample in some algebraic extension of a finite field this method of proof is noteworthy in that it is an example of the idea that finitistic algebraic relations in fields of

each combustion unit was launched on the nose of a terrier orion mk70 sounding rocket on a high ballistic trajectory reaching altitudes of approximately 330 km the rocket was rotated to face the ground and the combustion unit ignited for a period of 6 10 seconds while falling between 35 km and 23 km at around mach 7 6 the system is not designed to produce thrust the carrier rocket for the hyshot experiments was composed of a rim 2 terrier first stage 6 second burn 4000 km h and an orion second stage 26 second burn 8600 km h 56 km altitude a fairing over the payload was then jettisoned the package then coasted to an altitude of around 300 km cold gas nitrogen attitude control thrusters were used to re orient the payload for atmospheric reentry the experiments each lasted for some 5 seconds as the payload descended between approximately 35 and 23 kilometers altitude when liquid hydrogen fuel was fed to the scramjet telemetry reported results to receivers on the ground for later analysis the payload landed about 400 km down range from the launch site at which time its temperature was still expected to be about

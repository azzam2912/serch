all other isotopes have half lives under a day most under an hour there are also numerous isomers the most stable of which other than ta is ta with a half life of 2 36 hours tantalum has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons cobalt is another better known salting material a jacket of ta irradiated by the intense high energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon would transmute into the radioactive isotope with a half life of 114 43 days and produce approximately 1 12 mev of gamma radiation significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon s fallout for several months such a weapon is not known to have ever been built tested or used the nuclide m denotes a metastable state has sufficient energy to decay in three ways isomeric transition to the ground state of beta decay to and electron capture to however no radioactivity from any decay mode of this nuclear isomer has ever been observed only a lower limit on its half life of over 10 years has been set by observation the very slow decay of is attributed to its high spin 9 units and the low spin of lower

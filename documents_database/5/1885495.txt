areas of research in socio hydrology include the historical study of the interplay between hydrological and social processes comparative analysis of the co evolution and self organization of human and water systems in different cultures and process based modelling of coupled human water systems furthermore socio hydrology has been presented as one of the most relevant challenges for the anthropocene in relationship with its aims at unraveling dynamic cross scale interactions and feedbacks between natural and human processes that give rise to many water sustainability challenges socio hydrology is also predicted to be an important license for modellers in traditional hydrology human activities are typically described as boundary conditions or external forcings to the water systems scenario based approach this traditional approach tends to make long term predictions unrealistic as interactions and bi directional feedbacks between human and water systems cannot be captured following the increased hydrological challenges due to human induced changes hydrologists started to overcome the limitation of traditional hydrology by accounting for the mutual interactions between water and society and by advocating for greater connection between social science and hydrology socio hydrologists argue that water and human systems change interdependently as well as in connection with each

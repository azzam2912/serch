it occurs as the second stage of the proton proton chain reaction in which a deuterium nucleus formed from two protons fuses with another proton but can also proceed from primordial deuterium deuterium is the most easily fused nucleus available to accreting protostars and such fusion in the center of protostars can proceed when temperatures exceed 10 k the reaction rate is so sensitive to temperature that the temperature does not rise very much above this the energy generated by fusion drives convection which carries the heat generated to the surface if there were no deuterium fusion there would be no stars with masses more than about two or three times the mass of the sun in the pre main sequence phase as the more intense hydrogen fusion would occur and prevent the object from accreting matter deuterium fusion allows further accretion of mass by acting as a thermostat that temporarily stops the central temperature from rising above about one million degrees a temperature not hot enough for hydrogen fusion but allowing time for the accumulation of more mass when the energy transport mechanism switches from convective to radiative energy transport slows allowing the temperature to rise and hydrogen fusion

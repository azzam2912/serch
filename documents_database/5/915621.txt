it is also expressed in small groups of neurons in the human brain pnmt is a protein whose encoding gene is found on chromosome 17 in humans it consists of 4 exons and is a 30kda protein it shares many properties found among the other methyltransferases it is closest in sequence to glycine n methyl transferase gnmt it also shares many structural properties like the shape of the folding lip with catechol o methyl transferase comt though it shares less sequence identity several features of the structure like this folding lip suggest that pnmt is a recent adaptation to the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme family evolving later than comt but before other methyltransferases like gnmt s adenosyl l methionine sam is a required cofactor the active site binding region for the cofactor sam contains a rich number of pi bonds from phenylalanine and tyrosine residues in the active site help to keep it in its binding pocket through pi stacking among all known pnmt variants in nature there are 7 crucial aromatic residues conserved in the active site the residue glutamine 185 is necessary in binding the catecholamine substrate the replacement of this residue another reduces the catalytic efficiency of pnmt

it is a generalization of the oblique mercator projection that incorporates the time evolution of a given satellite ground track to optimize its representation on the map the oblique mercator projection on the other hand optimizes for a given geodesic the space oblique mercator projection som was developed by john p snyder alden partridge colvocoresses and john l junkins in 1976 snyder had an interest in maps originating back to his childhood and he regularly attended cartography conferences while on vacation in 1972 the united states geological survey usgs needed to develop a system for reducing the amount of distortion caused when satellite pictures of the ellipsoidal earth were printed on a flat page colvocoresses the head of the usgs s national mapping program asked attendees of a geodetic sciences conferences for help solving the projection problem in 1976 snyder attended the conference and became motivated to work on the problem armed with his newly purchased pocket calculator and devised the mathematical formulas needed to solve the problem after submitting his calculations to waldo tobler for review snyder submitted these to the usgs at no charge impressed with his work usgs officials offered snyder a job with the organization which

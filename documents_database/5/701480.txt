vldlr shows considerable homology with the members of this lineage discovered in 1992 by t yamamoto vldlr is widely distributed throughout the tissues of the body including the heart skeletal muscle adipose tissue and the brain but is absent from the liver this receptor has an important role in cholesterol uptake metabolism of apoprotein e containing triacylglycerol rich lipoproteins and neuronal migration in the developing brain in humans vldlr is encoded by the vldlr gene mutations of this gene may lead to a variety of symptoms and diseases which include type i lissencephaly cerebellar hypoplasia and atherosclerosis vldlr is a member of the low density lipoprotein ldl receptor family which is entirely composed of type i transmembrane lipoprotein receptors all members of this family share five highly conserved structural domains an extracellular n terminal ligand binding domain with cysteine rich repeats also called ligand binding repeats an epidermal growth factor egf an o linked glycosylation sugar domain a single transmembrane sequence and a cytoplasmic domain which contains an npxy sequence the npxy motif functions in signal transduction and the targeting of receptors to coated pits and consists of the sequence asparagine proline x tyrosine where x can be any amino

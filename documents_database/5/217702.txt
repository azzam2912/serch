faulkner had led the majority of the uup into a power sharing coalition but in january 1974 he was deposed as leader as the anti sunningdale faction of the party won control in the february 1974 general election a number of faulkner s followers including several sitting mps stood as pro assembly unionists against a coalition of the ulster unionist party the vanguard progressive unionist party and the democratic unionist party they failed to win a single seat at westminster and this defeat contributed to the downfall of the power sharing executive established by sunningdale however they remained active and in september constituted themselves as the unionist party of northern ireland committed to a return to power sharing as a settlement for northern ireland the party did not prosper in the october 1974 general election they again failed to make much ground the weakness of faulkner s position within unionism was reflected in the fact that only about a dozen of the approximately 250 local councillors elected for the uup in 1973 chose to join the new party the 1975 elections to the northern ireland constitutional convention were another blow to the party of 13 upni candidates elected as uup

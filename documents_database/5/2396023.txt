collins studied sculpture at the leeds school of art before enrolling in the royal college of art rca in london where she was taught by henry moore at the rca she met and in 1931 married her fellow student cecil collins both artists worked in similar styles and often featured elements of folklore or fantasy in their paintings which led to elisabeth collins work being somewhat overshadowed by that of her husband elisabeth also frequently modelled for her husband and worked to support and encourage his work for a time she exhibited under the name belmoat to distinguish her work from his from 1937 to 1945 the couple lived near the artistic community at dartington hall the then home of leonard elmhirst and dorothy elmhirst and this was perhaps elisabeth collins most productive period as an artist working in gouache ink and watercolour collins produced dream like images of mystical figures that recalled the work of the surrealists she had previously met in paris in the early 1930s from 1948 the collinses lived in cambridge where they were among the founders of the cambridge society of painters and sculptors at other times the couple lived in london yorkshire and oxford

briefly the mapping class group is a certain discrete group corresponding to symmetries of the space consider a topological space that is a space with some notion of closeness between points in the space we can consider the set of homeomorphisms from the space into itself that is continuous functions with continuous inverses functions which stretch and deform the space continuously without breaking or glueing the space this set of homeomorphisms can be thought of as a space itself it forms a group under functional composition we can also define a topology on this new space of homeomorphisms the open sets of this new function space will be made up of sets of functions that map compact subsets k into open subsets u as k and u range throughout our original topological space completed with their finite intersections which must be open by definition of topology and arbitrary unions again which must be open this gives a notion of continuity on the space of functions so that we can consider continuous deformation of the homeomorphisms themselves called homotopies we define the mapping class group by taking homotopy classes of homeomorphisms and inducing the group structure from the functional composition group

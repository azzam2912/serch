experiments provide insight into cause and effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated experiments vary greatly in goal and scale but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results there also exists natural experimental studies a child may carry out basic experiments to understand gravity while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to advance their understanding of a phenomenon experiments and other types of hands on activities are very important to student learning in the science classroom experiments can raise test scores and help a student become more engaged and interested in the material they are learning especially when used over time experiments can vary from personal and informal natural comparisons e g tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite to highly controlled e g tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists that hope to discover information about subatomic particles uses of experiments vary considerably between the natural and human sciences experiments typically include controls which are designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable this increases the reliability of the results often through a comparison between control measurements and the

the term buffer stop is of british origin since railways in great britain principally use buffer and screw couplings between vehicles several different types of buffer stop have been developed they differ depending on the type of coupler used and on the intended application if there is extra room behind the bumper block there is usually a sand or ballast drag that is designed to further retard a runaway train one such accident occurred when a northern city line train powered past the bumper block at moorgate station in 1975 on the london underground system largely because of its mass a train transfers an enormous amount of kinetic energy in a collision with a buffer stop rigid buffers can safely cope only with very low speed impacts i e nearly stationary to improve stopping performance a way of dissipating this energy is needed through compression or friction following a buffer stop accident at frankfurt am main in 1902 the rawie company developed a large range of energy absorbing buffer stops similar hydraulic buffer stops were developed by ransomes rapier in the uk when it is desired to slow or stop moving trains without erecting a solid buffer stop dowty retarders

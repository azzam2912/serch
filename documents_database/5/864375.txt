different isoforms of saa are expressed constitutively constitutive saas at different levels or in response to inflammatory stimuli acute phase saas these proteins are produced predominantly by the liver acute phase serum amyloid a proteins a saas are secreted during the acute phase of inflammation these proteins have several roles including the transport of cholesterol to the liver for secretion into the bile the recruitment of immune cells to inflammatory sites and the induction of enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix a saas are implicated in several chronic inflammatory diseases such as amyloidosis atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis three acute phase saa isoforms have been reported in mice called saa1 saa2 and saa3 during inflammation saa1 and saa2 are expressed and induced principally in the liver whereas saa3 is induced in many distinct tissues saa1 and saa2 genes are regulated in liver cells by the proinflammatory cytokines il 1 il 6 and tnf both saa1 and saa2 are induced up to a 1000 fold in mice under acute inflammatory conditions following exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide lps three a saa genes have also been identified in humans although the third gene saa3 is believed to represent a pseudogene that does not generate messenger

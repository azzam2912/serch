unlike normal naloxone naloxone has no significant affinity for opioid receptors but instead has been discovered to act as a selective antagonist of toll like receptor 4 this receptor is involved in immune system responses and activation of tlr4 induces glial activation and release of inflammatory mediators such as tnf and interleukin 1 both normal and unnatural enantiomers of various opioid analgesic drugs including morphine meperidine fentanyl methadone and buprenorphine as well as some otherwise inactive metabolites like morphine 3 glucuronide have been found to act as agonists of tlr4 and chronic use of these drugs consequently causes constant low level release of tnf and il 1 as well as other downstream effects this is thought to be involved in various adverse properties of opioid analgesic drugs such as loss of efficacy with extended use and the associated development of tolerance and dependence as well as the development of side effects such as hyperalgesia and allodynia which can cause long term use of opioid analgesics to not only fail to treat neuropathic pain but ultimately exacerbate it several opioid antagonist drugs were found to act as antagonists for tlr4 including naloxone and naltrexone however it was found that not only

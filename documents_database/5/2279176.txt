in computer simulations of giant impacts of rotating objects a synestia can form if the total angular momentum is greater than the co rotational limit beyond the co rotational limit the velocity at the equator of a body would exceed the orbital velocity in a synestia this results in an inner region rotating at a single rate with a loosely connected torus orbiting beyond it according to studies synestia was an early stage process for the formation of the earth and moon within the giant impact hypothesis in this model a synestia formed following a collision with an object of high energy and high angular momentum the synestia s surface temperatures are constrained by the boiling point of rock around 2 300 kelvins approximately as the resulting synestia cooled by radiating heat to space magma droplets formed in its outer layers and then rained inward over a period of tens of years causing the synestia to contract mass remaining outside the roche limit of the inner region accreted to form moonlets and subsequently combined to form our moon the earth re formed later once the synestia had cooled sufficiently to fall within the co rotational limit by this model the

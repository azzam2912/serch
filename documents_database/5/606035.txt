another popular application is the rsync program which uses a checksum based on mark adler s adler 32 as its rolling hash low bandwidth network filesystem lbfs uses a rabin fingerprint as its rolling hash at best rolling hash values are pairwise independent or strongly universal they cannot be 3 wise independent for example the rabin karp string search algorithm is often explained using a very simple rolling hash function that only uses multiplications and additions where formula 2 is a constant and formula 3 are the input characters but this function is not a rabin fingerprint see below in order to avoid manipulating huge formula 4 values all math is done modulo formula 5 the choice of formula 2 and formula 5 is critical to get good hashing see linear congruential generator for more discussion removing and adding characters simply involves adding or subtracting the first or last term shifting all characters by one position to the left requires multiplying the entire sum formula 4 by formula 2 shifting all characters by one position to the right requires dividing the entire sum formula 4 by formula 2 note that in modulo arithmetic formula 2 can be chosen to have

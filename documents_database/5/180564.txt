it is often described as a great comet it was discovered photographically by richard m west of the european southern observatory on august 10 1975 the comet came to perihelion closest approach to the sun on february 25 1976 during perihelion the comet had a minimum solar elongation of 6 4 and as a result of forward scattering reached a peak apparent magnitude of 3 from february 25 through the 27th observers reported that the comet was bright enough to study during full daylight despite its brightness comet west went largely unreported in the popular media this was partly due to the relatively disappointing display of comet kohoutek in 1973 which had been widely predicted to become extremely prominent scientists were wary of making predictions that might raise public expectations with a nearly parabolic trajectory estimates for the orbital period of this comet have varied from 254 000 to 558 000 years and even as high as 6 5 million years computing the best fit orbit for this long period comet is made more difficult since it underwent a splitting event which may have caused a non gravitational perturbation of the orbit the 2008 sao catalog of cometary orbits shows

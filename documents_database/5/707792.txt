it is a transmembrane receptor that is activated by a hormone called insulin like growth factor 1 igf 1 and by a related hormone called igf 2 it belongs to the large class of tyrosine kinase receptors this receptor mediates the effects of igf 1 which is a polypeptide protein hormone similar in molecular structure to insulin igf 1 plays an important role in growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults meaning that it can induce hypertrophy of skeletal muscle and other target tissues mice lacking the igf 1 receptor die late in development and show a dramatic reduction in body mass testifying to the strong growth promoting effect of this receptor two alpha subunits and two beta subunits make up the igf 1 receptor both the and subunits are synthesized from a single mrna precursor the precursor is then glycosylated proteolytically cleaved and crosslinked by cysteine bonds to form a functional transmembrane chain the chains are located extracellularly while the subunit spans the membrane and is responsible for intracellular signal transduction upon ligand stimulation the mature igf 1r has a molecular weight of approximately 320 kda the receptor is a member of a family which consists of

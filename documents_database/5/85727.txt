chlamydomonadales can form planar or spherical colonies these vary from gonium four to 32 cells up to volvox 500 cells or more each cell has two flagella and is similar in appearance to chlamydomonas with the flagella throughout the colony moving in coordination both asexual and sexual reproduction occur in the former cells divide until they form new colonies which are then released in the smaller forms typically all cells are involved but larger forms have anterior vegetative and posterior reproductive cells sexual reproduction varies from isogamy both genders produce flagellated gametes of equal size to oogamy one gender produces a much larger nonmotile gamete the classification of the chlamydomonadales varies very often they are taken to include the orders volvocales and dunallielales which contain closely related unicellular flagellates as suborders colony inversion is believed to have arisen twice in this order spheroidal colony formation differs between the two lineages rotation of daughter protoplasts during successive cell divisions in astrephomene and inversion after cell divisions in the volvocaceae

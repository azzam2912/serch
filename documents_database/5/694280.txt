a single nucleotide polymorphism snp a variation at a single site in dna is the most frequent type of variation in the genome around 335 million snps have been identified in the human genome 15 million of which are present at frequencies of 1 or higher across different populations worldwide the basic principles of snp array are the same as the dna microarray these are the convergence of dna hybridization fluorescence microscopy and solid surface dna capture the three mandatory components of the snp arrays are the aso probes are often chosen based on sequencing of a representative panel of individuals positions found to vary in the panel at a specified frequency are used as the basis for probes snp chips are generally described by the number of snp positions they assay two probes must be used for each snp position to detect both alleles if only one probe were used experimental failure would be indistinguishable from homozygosity of the non probed allele an snp array is a useful tool for studying slight variations between whole genomes the most important clinical applications of snp arrays are for determining disease susceptibility and for measuring the efficacy of drug therapies designed specifically

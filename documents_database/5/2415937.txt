her early work at oxford university with dorothy hodgkin used x ray crystallography to confirm the molecular structure of penicillin which at the time was the largest molecule whose structure has been determined using that method later graduate work saw her study with linus pauling and edwin cohn before becoming a professor in her own right low s laboratory would accomplish the discovery of the pi helix investigate the structure of insulin and conduct research into neurotoxins low was born on march 23 1920 in lancaster england to her parents matthew low and mary jane wharton she undertook her tertiary education at somerville college oxford graduating with a bachelor s degree in 1943 the same year she began work under the biochemist dorothy hodgkin due to hodgkin s focus on protein crystallography for which she was later awarded a nobel prize low and her academic colleagues were engaged in researching the use of x rays to determine the structure of crystallized proteins low obtained master s and doctoral degrees in chemistry from oxford university in 1946 and 1948 respectively before moving on to a research associate position at the california institute of technology caltech to do so she obtained a

the original conjecture was proposed in a paper by strominger yau and zaslow entitled mirror symmetry is t duality along with the homological mirror symmetry conjecture it is one of the most explored tools applied to understand mirror symmetry in mathematical terms while the homological mirror symmetry is based on homological algebra the syz conjecture is a geometrical realization of mirror symmetry in string theory mirror symmetry relates type iia and type iib theories it predicts that the effective field theory of type iia and type iib should be the same if the two theories are compactified on mirror pair manifolds the syz conjecture uses this fact to realize mirror symmetry it starts from considering bps states of type iia theories compactified on x especially 0 branes that have moduli space x it is known that all of the bps states of type iib theories compactified on y are 3 branes therefore mirror symmetry will map 0 branes of type iia theories into a subset of 3 branes of type iib theories by considering supersymmetric conditions it has been shown that these 3 branes should be special lagrangian submanifolds on the other hand t duality does the same transformation in

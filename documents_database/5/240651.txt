the tube was invented by the german physicist and glassblower heinrich geissler in 1857 it consists of a sealed partially evacuated glass cylinder of various shapes with a metal electrode at each end containing rarefied gasses such as neon argon or air mercury vapor or other conductive fluids or ionizable minerals or metals such as sodium when a high voltage is applied between the electrodes an electrical current flows through the tube the current dissociates electrons from the gas molecules creating ions and when the electrons recombine with the ions the gas emits light by fluorescence the color of light emitted is characteristic of the material within the tube and many different colors and lighting effects can be achieved the first gas discharge lamps geissler tubes were novelty items made in many artistic shapes and colors to demonstrate the new science of electricity in the early 20th century the technology was commercialized and evolved into neon lighting geissler tubes were mass produced from the 1880s as novelty and entertainment devices with various spherical chambers and decorative serpentine paths formed into the glass tube some tubes were very elaborate and complex in shape and would contain chambers within an outer casing

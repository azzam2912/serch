informally it measures how far a set of random numbers are spread out from their average value variance has a central role in statistics where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics statistical inference hypothesis testing goodness of fit and monte carlo sampling variance is an important tool in the sciences where statistical analysis of data is common the variance is the square of the standard deviation the second central moment of a distribution and the covariance of the random variable with itself and it is often represented by formula 1 formula 2 or formula 3 the variance of a random variable formula 4 is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean of formula 4 formula 6 this definition encompasses random variables that are generated by processes that are discrete continuous neither or mixed the variance can also be thought of as the covariance of a random variable with itself the variance is also equivalent to the second cumulant of a probability distribution that generates formula 4 the variance is typically designated as formula 3 formula 11 or simply formula 1 pronounced sigma squared the expression for the variance can be expanded in other words the

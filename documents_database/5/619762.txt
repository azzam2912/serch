habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species including 140 species of mammals identified by the world conservation union iucn as threatened and 15 identified as critically endangered including the sumatran orangutan for centuries the geographical resources of the indonesian archipelago have been exploited in ways that fall into consistent social and historical patterns one cultural pattern consists of the formerly indianized rice growing peasants in the valleys and plains of sumatra java and bali another cultural complex is composed of the largely islamic coastal commercial sector a third more marginal sector consists of the upland forest farming communities which exist by means of subsistence swidden agriculture to some degree these patterns can be linked to the geographical resources themselves with abundant shoreline generally calm seas and steady winds favouring the use of sailing vessels and fertile valleys and plains at least in the greater sunda islands permitting irrigated rice farming the heavily forested mountainous interior hinders overland communication by road or river but fosters slash and burn agriculture each of these patterns of ecological and economic adaptation experienced tremendous pressures during the 1970s and 1980s with rising population density soil erosion river bed siltation and water pollution

it states that any orthomodular form that has an infinite orthonormal sequence is a hilbert space over the real numbers complex numbers or quaternions originally proved by maria pia sol r the result is significant for quantum logic and the foundations of quantum mechanics in particular sol r s theorem helps to fill a gap in the effort to use gleason s theorem to rederive quantum mechanics from information theoretic postulates physicist john c baez notes nothing in the assumptions mentions the continuum the hypotheses are purely algebraic it therefore seems quite magical that the division ring over which the hilbert space is defined is forced to be the real numbers complex numbers or quaternions writing a decade after sol r s original publication pitowsky calls her theorem celebrated let formula 1 be a division ring that means it is a ring in which one can add subtract multiply and divide but in which the multiplication need not be commutative suppose this ring has a conjugation i e an operation formula 2 for which consider a vector space v with scalars in formula 1 and a mapping which is formula 6 linear in left or in the right entry satisfying

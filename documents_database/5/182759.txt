the skies of venus mars and titan have been observed by space probes designed to land on the surface and transmit images back to earth characteristics of extraterrestrial skies appear to vary substantially due to a number of factors an extraterrestrial atmosphere if present has a large bearing on visible characteristics the atmosphere s density and chemical composition can contribute to differences in colour opacity including haze and the presence of clouds astronomical objects may also be visible and can include natural satellites rings star systems and nebulas and other planetary system bodies the sun s apparent magnitude changes according to the inverse square law therefore the difference in magnitude as a result of greater or lesser distances from different celestial bodies can be predicted by the following formula where distance can be in km au or any other appropriate unit to illustrate since pluto is 40 au away from the sun on average it follows that the parent star would appear to be 1 600 times dimmer than it is on earth though a terrestrial observer would find a dramatic decrease in available sunlight in these environments the sun would still be bright enough to cast shadows even as

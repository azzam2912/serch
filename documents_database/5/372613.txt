about 25 of the world s electrical energy is consumed by electric motors in industrial applications which can be more efficient when using vfds in centrifugal load service however the global market penetration for all applications of vfds is relatively small over the last four decades power electronics technology has reduced vfd cost and size and has improved performance through advances in semiconductor switching devices drive topologies simulation and control techniques and control hardware and software vfds are made in a number of different low and medium voltage ac ac and dc ac topologies a variable frequency drive is a device used in a drive system consisting of the following three main sub systems ac motor main drive controller assembly and drive operator interface the ac electric motor used in a vfd system is usually three phase induction motor some types of single phase motors or synchronous motors can be advantageous in some situations but generally three phase induction motors are preferred as the most economical motors that are designed for fixed speed operation are often used elevated voltage stresses imposed on induction motors that are supplied by vfds require that such motors be designed for definite purpose inverter fed

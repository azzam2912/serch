while at the interface of physics and chemistry chemical physics is distinct from physical chemistry in that it focuses more on the characteristic elements and theories of physics meanwhile physical chemistry studies the physical nature of chemistry nonetheless the distinction between the two fields is vague and workers often practice in both fields during the course of their research the united states department of education defines chemical physics as a program that focuses on the scientific study of structural phenomena combining the disciplines of physical chemistry and atomic molecular physics includes instruction in heterogeneous structures alignment and surface phenomena quantum theory mathematical physics statistical and classical mechanics chemical kinetics and laser physics chemical physicists commonly probe the structure and dynamics of ions free radicals polymers clusters and molecules areas of study include the quantum mechanical behavior of chemical reactions the process of solvation inter and intra molecular energy flow and single entities such as quantum dots experimental chemical physicists use a variety of spectroscopic techniques to better understand hydrogen bonding electron transfer the formation and dissolution of chemical bonds chemical reactions and the formation of nanoparticles theoretical chemical physicists create simulations of the molecular processes probed in these experiments to

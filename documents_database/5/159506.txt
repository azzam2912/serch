it is one of the essential stages in the process of starting a program as it places programs into memory and prepares them for execution loading a program involves reading the contents of the executable file containing the program instructions into memory and then carrying out other required preparatory tasks to prepare the executable for running once loading is complete the operating system starts the program by passing control to the loaded program code all operating systems that support program loading have loaders apart from highly specialized computer systems that only have a fixed set of specialized programs embedded systems typically do not have loaders and instead the code executes directly from rom in order to load the operating system itself as part of booting a specialized boot loader is used in many operating systems the loader resides permanently in memory though some operating systems that support virtual memory may allow the loader to be located in a region of memory that is pageable in the case of operating systems that support virtual memory the loader may not actually copy the contents of executable files into memory but rather may simply declare to the virtual memory subsystem that there is

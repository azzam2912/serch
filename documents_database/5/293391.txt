the use of multiple video cards in one computer or large numbers of graphics chips further parallelizes the already parallel nature of graphics processing in addition even a single gpu cpu framework provides advantages that multiple cpus on their own do not offer due to the specialization in each chip essentially a gpgpu pipeline is a kind of parallel processing between one or more gpus and cpus that analyzes data as if it were in image or other graphic form while gpus operate at lower frequencies they typically have many times the number of cores thus gpus can process far more pictures and graphical data per second than a traditional cpu migrating data into graphical form and then using the gpu to scan and analyze it can create a large speedup gpgpu pipelines were developed at the beginning of the 21st century for graphics processing e g for better shaders these pipelines were found to fit scientific computing needs well and have since been developed in this direction in principle any arbitrary boolean function including those of addition multiplication and other mathematical functions can be built up from a functionally complete set of logic operators in 1987 conway s game

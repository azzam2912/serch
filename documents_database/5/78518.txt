it is based on intuition of stuart davidson but the mathematics behind it goes back to wac aw sierpi ski let formula 2 denote the set of all functions from formula 3 to countable subsets of formula 3 the axiom formula 1 states a theorem of sierpi ski says that under the assumptions of zfc set theory formula 1 is equivalent to the negation of the continuum hypothesis ch sierpi ski s theorem answered a question of hugo steinhaus and was proved long before the independence of ch had been established by kurt g del and paul cohen freiling claims that probabilistic intuition strongly supports this proposition while others disagree there are several versions of the axiom some of which are discussed below fix a function f in a we will consider a thought experiment that involves throwing two darts at the unit interval we aren t able to physically determine with infinite accuracy the actual values of the numbers x and y that are hit likewise the question of whether y is in f x cannot actually be physically computed nevertheless if f really is a function then this question is a meaningful one and will have a definite

the name is derived from shotgun sequencing of dna which is itself named after the rapidly expanding quasi random firing pattern of a shotgun the most common method of shotgun proteomics starts with the proteins in the mixture being digested and the resulting peptides are separated by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry is then used to identify the peptides targeted proteomics using srm and data independent acquisition methods are often considered alternatives to shotgun proteomics in the field of bottom up proteomics while shotgun proteomics uses data dependent selection of precursor ions to generate fragment ion scans the aforementioned methods use a deterministic method for acquisition of fragment ion scans shotgun proteomics arose from the difficulties of using previous technologies to separate complex mixtures in 1975 two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 2d page was described by o farrell and klose with the ability to resolve complex protein mixtures the development of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization maldi electrospray ionization esi and database searching continued to grow the field of proteomics however these methods still had difficulty identifying and separating low abundance proteins aberrant proteins and membrane proteins shotgun proteomics emerged as a method that could resolve even these proteins shotgun

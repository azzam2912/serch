when and if the saddle is navigable even if only on foot the saddle of a optimal pass between the two massifs is the area generally found around the lowest route on which one could pass between the two summits which includes that point which is a mathematically when graphed a relative high along one axis and a relative low in the perpendicular axis simultaneously that point being by definition the col of the saddle a saddle is the lowest area between two highlands prominences or peaks but has two wings which span the divide the line between the two prominences by crossing the divide at an angle so is concurrently the local highpoint of the land surface which falls off in the down direction that is the drainage divide is a ridge along the high point of the saddle as well as between the two peaks so defines the major reference axis a saddle can vary from a sharp narrow gap to a broad comfortable sway backed shallow valley so long as it is both the high point in the sloping faces descending to lower elevations and the low area between the two or three or four flanking summits

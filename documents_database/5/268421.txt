it is a multivariate generalization of the beta distribution hence its alternative name of multivariate beta distribution mbd dirichlet distributions are commonly used as prior distributions in bayesian statistics and in fact the dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution and multinomial distribution the infinite dimensional generalization of the dirichlet distribution is the dirichlet process edit required the figure on the right contains an error support is only for r coordinates which sum to less than one as formula 3 see the animation figure below the entropy equation which identifies the correct regions of support the dirichlet distribution of order k 2 with parameters 0 has a probability density function with respect to lebesgue measure on the euclidean space r given by the normalizing constant is the multivariate beta function which can be expressed in terms of the gamma function the support of the dirichlet distribution is the set of k dimensional vectors formula 9 whose entries are real numbers in the interval 0 1 furthermore formula 10 i e the sum of the coordinates is 1 these can be viewed as the probabilities of a k way categorical event another way to express this is that

the album subtitle psychotic sounds for freaks and weirdos was created by a fan from the official horrors forum the album consists mostly of previously released material although several of these tracks were re recorded or remixed strange house was released on 5 march 2007 by loog records it reached no 37 in the uk albums chart a special edition including a dvd in a gatefold digipak was also released which contained three music videos sheena is a parasite count in fives and gloves three live performances one full length and two short sets an interview and a photo gallery a review in popmatters said the horrors bring a dose of dark glamour to an increasingly anodyne british alternative music scene they blend their twin influences of early 80s gothic rock and 60s garage to startling effect no doubt some will fail to see past the cartoonish fancy dress of cobweb strewn edwardian undertakers and write them off as a joke or novelty act this would be a shame as there are half a dozen brilliant tunes on offer here

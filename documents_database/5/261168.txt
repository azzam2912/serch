this article uses software as the context but the safety life cycle applies to other areas such as construction of buildings for example in software development a process is used software life cycle and this process consists of a few phases typically covering initiation analysis design programming testing and implementation the focus is to build the software some software have safety concerns while others do not for example a leave application system does not have safety requirements but we are concerned about safety if a software that is used to control the components in a plane fails so for the latter the question is how safety being so important should be managed within the software life cycle the basic concept in building software safety i e safety features in software is that safety characteristics and behaviour of the software and system must be specified and designed into the system the problem for any systems designer lies in reducing the risk to an acceptable level and of course the risk tolerated will vary between applications when a software application is to be used in a safety related system then this must be borne in mind at all stages in the software

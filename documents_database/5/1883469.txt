containing only phosphorus and nitrogen this material is classified as a binary nitride few applications have been developed for this material which remains predominantly a topic of research it is a white solid although samples often appear colored owing to impurities triphosphorus pentanitride can be produced by reactions between various phosphorus v and nitrogen compounds such as ammonia and sodium azide including a reaction between the elements similar methods are used to prepared boron nitride bn and silicon nitride sin however the products are generally impure and amorphous crystalline samples have been produced by the reaction of ammonium chloride and hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene or phosphorus pentachloride pn has also been prepared at room temperature by a reaction between phosphorus trichloride and sodium amide pn is thermally less stable than either bn or sin with decomposition to the elements occurring at temperatures above 850 c it is resistant to weak acids and bases and insoluble in water at room temperature however it hydrolyzes upon heating to form the ammonium phosphate salts nh hpo and nhhpo triphosphorus pentanitride reacts with lithium nitride and calcium nitride to form the corresponding salts of pn and pn heterogenous ammonolyses of triphosphorus pentanitride gives imides such as hpn

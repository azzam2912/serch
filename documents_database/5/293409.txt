spin labels are normally used as tools for probing proteins or biological membrane local dynamics using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy the site directed spin labeling sdsl technique allows one to monitor a specific region within a protein in protein structure examinations amino acid specific sls can be used the goal of spin labeling is somewhat similar to that of isotopic substitution in nmr spectroscopy there one replaces an atom lacking a nuclear spin and so is nmr silent with an isotope having a spin i formula 1 0 and so is nmr active this technique is useful for tracking the chemical environment around an atom when full substitution with an nmr active isotope is not feasible recently spin labelling has also been used to probe chemical local environment in nmr itself in a technique known as paramagnetic relaxation enhancement pre recent developments in the theory and experimental measurement of pres have enabled the detection characterization and visualization of sparsely populated states of proteins and their complexes such states which are invisible to conventional biophysical and structural techniques play a key role in many biological processes including molecular recognition allostery macromolecular assembly and aggregation spin labelled fatty acids have been extensively

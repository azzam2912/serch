it is notably often the first type of bipolar transistor hobbyists encounter and is often featured in designs in hobby electronics magazines where a general purpose transistor is required the bc548 is low in cost and widely available the bc548 is a part of a family of npn and pnp epitaxial silicon transistors that originated with the metal cased bc108 family of transistors the bc548 is the modern plastic packaged bc108 the bc548 article at the radiomuseum website describes the bc548 as a successor to the bc238 and differing from the bc108 in only the shape of the package datasheets for the bc548 give specifications that are identical to or exceed those of the bc108 bc148 and bc238 predecessors thus the bc548 or bc546 to 550 is a valid substitute in any circuit designed for the older bc108 or bc148 which includes many mullard and philips published designs as of 2016 the bc548 is principally produced by on semiconductor and fairchild semiconductor the bc548 is supplied in a standard to 92 3 pin package the assignment of transistor elements b c e to leads i e the pinout uses the same convention used by some but not all other to

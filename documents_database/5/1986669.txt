such inks render visible the activity of photocatalytic coatings applied to various self cleaning products the inks contain a dyestuff that reacts to ultraviolet radiation in the presence of the photocatalytic agent in the coating they are applied to the coated product using a pen or brush and show a color change or disappearance when exposed to ultraviolet a photocatalyst activity indicator ink quickly and easily identifies the presence of an underlying heterogeneous photocatalyst and provides a measure of its activity a heterogeneous photocatalyst is a material that uses absorbed light energy usually uv to drive desired reactions that would not otherwise proceed under ambient conditions commercial photocatalytic products which include architectural glass tiles concrete paint and fabrics are marketed on their ability to clean their own surfaces i e are self cleaning and the ambient air paiis address the industry need for a rapid simple inexpensive method to demonstrate and assess the activities of the usually thin invisible to the eye photocatalytic coatings present on self cleaning products a paii coated onto the surface of a photocatalyst material under test works via a photoreductive mechanism in which light absorbed by the photocatalyst drives the reduction of the dye in

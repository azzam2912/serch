the hard water forming cations ca or mg n 2 carboxyethyl iminodiacetic acid should not be confused with alaninediacetic acid also known as methylglycinediacetic acid mgda or ada alkaline earth and heavy metal complexes of both ada and ada are biodegradable in contrast to chelate complexes with conventional complexing agents such as edta the first synthesis of n 2 carboxyethyl iminodiacetic acid from alanine and monochloroacetic acid was reported by gerold schwarzenbach in 1949 the double cyanomethylation of alanine as starting material provides with methanal and alkali cyanides and subsequent hydrolysis of the intermediately formed bis methyl cyanides followed by acidification with mineral acids ada n 2 carboxyethyl iminodiacetic acid in yields of only 80 but very high purity of 99 8 the cyanoethylation of iminodiacetic acid with 2 propenenitrile by a michael addition provides the ethyl cyano compound which produces after alkaline hydrolysis and acidification ada with a total yield of 93 6 and purity of 99 9 in the analogue reaction with acrylic acid esters 99 9 ada are obtained after acidification in a total yield of 97 6 the most direct route is via the michael addition of acrylic acid to iminodiacetic acid which produces the trisodium

the radian per second is also the unit of angular frequency the radian per second is defined as the change in the orientation of an object in radians every second since the radian is a dimensionless unit the radian per second is dimensionally equivalent to the hertz both are defined as s this may lead to confusion between the quantities angular frequency and frequency a use of the unit radian per second is in calculation of the power transmitted by a shaft in the international system of units widely used in physics and engineering the power p is equal to the rotational speed in radians per second multiplied by the torque applied to the shaft in newton meters thus and the unit is the watt with no numerical coefficient needed in other systems an additional factor may be necessary for example if one multiplies angular velocity in revolutions per minute rpm by the torque in pound feet then a factor is needed to convert the result in horsepower an angular frequency corresponds to an ordinary frequency which corresponds to a frequency of rotation of in other words 6 radians is about 360 degrees

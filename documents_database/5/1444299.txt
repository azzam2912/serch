gonyaulax belongs to red dinoflagellates and commonly causes red tides gonyaulax is a genus of dinoflagellates that are aquatic organisms with two separate flagella one extends backward and the other wraps around the cell in a lateral groove helping to keep the organism afloat by rotational motility the plate formula in the genus gonyaulax diesing was redefined as po 3 2a 6 6c 4 8s 5 1p 1 all species are marine except for one freshwater species gonyaulax apiculata it previously included several species which are now considered to belong to a separate genus e g gonyaulax dinoflagellates have evolved a type of resting spore or resting cyst to enable it to survive harsh weather conditions resting cysts can be formed when temperature or salinity changes in the surrounding water these cysts are round mucous covered bodies that appear reddish in color gonyaulax catenella has been recorded forming vegetative cysts in response to cold water gonyaulax are protists that may grow in long chains especially when faced with turbulent water conditions these chains allow for clustering of organisms for increased mating and protection of weakly swimming organisms that could otherwise be washed away although gonyaulax is predominantly found in seawater

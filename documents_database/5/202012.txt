it is an icelandic term that has been adopted in glaciological terminology in many languages it originally referred to the well known subglacial outburst floods from vatnaj kull iceland which are triggered by geothermal heating and occasionally by a volcanic subglacial eruption but it is now used to describe any large and abrupt release of water from a subglacial or proglacial lake reservoir since j kulhlaups emerge from hydrostatically sealed lakes with floating levels far above the threshold their peak discharge can be much larger than that of a marginal or extra marginal lake burst the hydrograph of a j kulhlaup from vatnaj kull typically either climbs over a period of weeks with the largest flow near the end or it climbs much faster during the course of some hours these patterns are suggested to reflect channel melting and sheet flow under the front respectively similar processes on a very large scale occurred during the deglaciation of north america and europe after the last ice age e g lake agassiz and the english channel and presumably at earlier times although the geological record is not well preserved subglacial meltwater generation is one key to the understanding of subglacial meltwater flow

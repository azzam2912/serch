it was developed by viggo brun in 1915 in terms of sieve theory the brun sieve is of combinatorial type that is it derives from a careful use of the inclusion exclusion principle let a be a set of positive integers x and let p be a set of primes for each p in p let a denote the set of elements of a divisible by p and extend this to let a the intersection of the a for p dividing d when d is a product of distinct primes from p further let a denote a itself let z be a positive real number and p z denote the primes in p z the object of the sieve is to estimate we assume that a may be estimated by where w is a multiplicative function and x a let this formulation is from cojocaru murty theorem 6 1 2 with the notation as above assume that where c d e are constants then where b is any positive integer in particular if log z chen s theorem and the second by goldbach s weak conjecture c 3

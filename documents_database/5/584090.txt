it is the most general formulation of measurements in quantum physics since projective measurements on a large system i e measurements that are performed mathematically by a projection valued measure pvm will act on a subsystem in ways that cannot be described by a pvm on the subsystem alone the povm formalism becomes necessary povms are used in the field of quantum information in rough analogy a povm is to a pvm what a density matrix is to a pure state density matrices are needed to specify the state of a subsystem of a larger system even when the latter is in a pure state see purification of quantum state analogously povms on a physical system are used to describe the effect of a projective measurement performed on a larger system historically the term probability operator measure pom has been used as a synonym for povm although this usage is now rare povms can be generalized to quantum field theory in the simplest case a povm is a set of hermitian positive semidefinite operators formula 1 on a hilbert space formula 2 that sum to the identity operator this formula is a generalization of the decomposition of a finite dimensional

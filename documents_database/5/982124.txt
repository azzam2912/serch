similar to electron capture dissociation etd induces fragmentation of large multiply charged cations by transferring electrons to them etd is used extensively with polymers and biological molecules such as proteins and peptides for sequence analysis transferring an electron causes peptide backbone cleavage into c and z ions while leaving labile post translational modifications ptm intact the technique only works well for higher charge state peptide or polymer ions z 2 however relative to collision induced dissociation cid etd is advantageous for the fragmentation of longer peptides or even entire proteins this makes the technique important for top down proteomics the method was developed by hunt and coworkers at the university of virginia electron capture dissociation ecd was developed in 1998 to fragment large proteins for mass spectrometric analysis because ecd requires a large amount of near thermal electrons fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr the most expensive form of ms instrumentation less costly options such as quadrupole time of flight q tof quadrupole ion trap qit and linear quadrupole ion trap qlt instruments used the more energy intensive collision induced dissociation method cid resulting in random fragmentation of peptides and proteins in 2004 syka et al announced the

infantry tanks were designed to support infantrymen in an attack to achieve this the vehicles were generally heavily armoured to allow them to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy fire the extra armour came at the expense of speed which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow moving foot soldiers once an attack supported by infantry tanks had broken through heavily defended areas in the enemy lines faster tanks such as cruiser or light tanks were expected to use their higher speed and longer range to operate far behind the front and cut lines of supply and communications the infantry tank was superseded by the universal tank concept which could adequately perform the roles of both infantry and cruiser tank as represented by the centurion which replaced both the churchill and any mediums or cruisers then in service the experimental armoured formations of the british army were mostly equipped with the vickers medium tank mk i and medium mk ii which were judged obsolete by the 1930s most of the vehicles were at the end of their mechanical life it was impractical to build more because their road speed of only was too slow for manoeuvre

the theorem was proved independently by f ry in 1949 and milnor in 1950 it was later shown to follow from the existence of quadrisecants if k is any closed curve in euclidean space that is sufficiently smooth to define the curvature at each of its points and if the total absolute curvature is less than or equal to 4 then k is an unknot i e the contrapositive tells us that if k is not an unknot i e k is not isotopic to the circle then the total curvature will be strictly greater than 4 notice that having the total curvature less than or equal to 4 is merely a sufficient condition for k to be an unknot it is not a necessary condition in other words although all knots with total curvature less than or equal to 4 are the unknot there exist unknots with curvature strictly greater than 4 for closed polygonal chains the same result holds with the integral of curvature replaced by the sum of angles between adjacent segments of the chain by approximating arbitrary curves by polygonal chains one may extend the definition of total curvature to larger classes of curves within which

while the teams first met in the rivalry did not develop until when the seahawks were placed with the 49ers in the nfc west allowing for two annual meetings between the teams the seahawks lead the overall series 25 16 the teams met once in the playoffs a 23 17 seahawks win in the 2013 nfc championship game prior to 2002 the 49ers led the all time series 4 2 but since they became nfc west division rivals in 2002 the seahawks lead the series 23 12 the rivalry was once considered not very significant due to the two teams having little history against each other and with both suffering significant stretches of mediocrity for example while the seahawks won four straight division titles from 2004 2007 the 49ers finished in third or fourth place each season and did not have a winning season from 2003 2010 likewise the seahawks suffered four straight losing seasons from 2008 2011 despite their stretch of mediocrity the seahawks have remained competitive in games against the 49ers in those years especially games at centurylink field where their worst loss to the 49ers there was by only ten points in the rivalry intensified in 2011

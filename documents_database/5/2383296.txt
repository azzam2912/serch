these rocks experienced numerous deformations during mountain building events and much of the region was flooded by shallow seas depositing thick sequences of sedimentary rock during the paleozoic fewer rocks have deposited since the mesozoic as several kilometers of rock have eroded into the continental shelf and atlantic coastal plain although volcanic and sedimentary rocks in the newark basin are a prominent fossil bearing feature near new york city from the mesozoic rifting of the supercontinent pangea the igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock of new york formed in the precambrian and are coterminous with the canadian shield the adirondack mountains thousand islands hudson highlands and fordham gneiss along with outcrops in the berkshires just over the state line in massachusetts are part of the grenville province a large piece of continental crust which accreted to the canadian shield and underlies much of quebec ontario as far west as lake huron and as far east as labrador these rocks date to 1 3 to 1 1 billion years ago in the proterozoic and formed from lime mud sand and clay on coastal barrier islands as well as evaporites in intervening lagoons the avalonian mountain building event 575 million years ago

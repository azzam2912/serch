there are 5 exons totaling a length of 1068 base pairs c16orf78 is 265 amino acids long with a predicted molecular weight of 30 8 kdal and pi of 9 8 it is rich in both methionine and lysine composed of 6 4 methionine and 13 6 lysine this methionine richness has been hypothesized to serve as a mitochondrial antioxidant there are four verified ubiquitination sites and three verified phosphorylation sites predictions of c16orf78 s secondary structure consist primarily of alpha helices and coiled coils phyre2 also predicted c16orf78 is primarily helical but 253 of 265 amino acids were modeled ab initio so the confidence of the model is low c16orf78 is predicted to be localized to the cell nucleus there is also a predicted bipartite nuclear localization signal c16orf78 has restricted expression toward the testis with much lower expression in other tissues c16orf78 has a physical association with dna rna binding protein kin17 np 036443 1 suggesting c16orf78 may also play a role in dna repair c16orf78 was found to be phosphorylated by srpk1 np 003128 3 and sprk2 aah68547 1 deletion of the c16orf78 gene has been identified as a determinant of prostate cancer a snp in c16orf78

it is an example of software brittleness this problem is more often called the fragile base class problem or fbc however that term has a wider sense the problem occurs due to a shortcut used with compilers for many common object oriented oo languages a design feature that was kept when oo languages were evolving from earlier non oo structured programming languages such as c and pascal in these languages there were no objects in the modern sense but there was a similar construct known as a record or struct in c that held a variety of related information in one piece of memory the parts within a particular record were accessed by keeping track of the starting location of the record and knowing the offset from that starting point to the part in question for instance a person record might have a first name last name and middle initial to access the initial the programmer writes codice 1 which the compiler turns into something like codice 2 modern cpus typically include instructions for this common sort of access when object oriented language compilers were first being developed much of the existing compiler technology was used and objects were built

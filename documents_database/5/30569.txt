the objectives were to place a highly instrumented probe in lunar orbit to investigate the environment between the earth and moon and to develop technology for controlling and maneuvering spacecraft from earth it was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television like system estimate the moon s mass and topography of the poles record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites and study radiation magnetic fields and low frequency electromagnetic waves in space a midcourse propulsion system and injection rocket would have been the first united states self contained propulsion system capable of operation many months after launch at great distances from earth and the first u s tests of maneuvering a satellite in space the spacecraft was launched on atlas vehicle 91d coupled to thor able upper stages including an able solid propellant third stage on december 15 1960 the launch was uneventful until t 66 seconds when a severe axial disturbance was recorded followed by rapid loss of lox tank pressure and changes in the atlas s engine exhaust indicative of oxidizer starvation at t 73 seconds the atlas experienced total structural breakup and loss of telemetry the upper stages continued transmitting data until impact

the density generally is 4500 kg m they are predominantly stratiform accumulations of sulfide minerals that precipitate from hydrothermal fluids on or below the seafloor in a wide range of ancient and modern geological settings in modern oceans they are synonymous with sulfurous plumes called black smokers they occur within environments dominated by volcanic or volcanic derived e g volcano sedimentary rocks and the deposits are coeval and coincident with the formation of said volcanic rocks as a class they represent a significant source of the world s copper zinc lead gold and silver ores with cobalt tin barium sulfur selenium manganese cadmium indium bismuth tellurium gallium and germanium as co or by products volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits are forming today on the seafloor around undersea volcanoes along many mid ocean ridges and within back arc basins and forearc rifts mineral exploration companies are exploring for seafloor massive sulfide deposits however most exploration is concentrated in the search for land based equivalents of these deposits the close association with volcanic rocks and eruptive centers sets vms deposits apart from similar ore deposit types which share similar source transport and trap processes volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits are distinctive in that ore

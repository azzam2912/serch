the drug is a 2 o methyl phosphorothioate oligonucleotide that alters the splicing of the dystrophin rna transcript eliminating exon 51 from the mature dystrophin mrna duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd is caused when a mutation in the dystrophin gene changes the rna so that it no longer codes for functional dystrophin protein this usually happens due to a mutation that alters the reading frame of the rna downstream of the mutation so called frameshift mutation if an exon with an appropriate number of bases lies near the mutation removing that exon can correct the downstream reading frame restoring the production of partially functional dystrophin this is the general strategy used in the design of exon skipping oligonucleotides for dmd as there are 79 exons in the longest splice form of the dystrophin transcript many different oligonucleotides are needed to address the range of mutations present in the population of people with dmd the compound has completed phase iii trials and did not meet its primary endpoint in january 2016 the fda rejected drisapersen kyndrisa largely on the basis of toxicity which limits dosing and so efficacy this effectively shifted focus of exon skipping therapy to a competing drug eteplirsen eteplirsen

although geologists describe the entire time period as an ice age in popular culture the term ice age is usually associated with just the most recent glacial period since earth still has ice sheets geologists consider the quaternary glaciation to be ongoing with earth now experiencing an interglacial period during the quaternary glaciation ice sheets appeared during glacial periods they expanded and during interglacial periods they contracted since the end of the last glacial period the only surviving ice sheets are the antarctic and greenland ice sheets other ice sheets such as the laurentide ice sheet formed during glacial periods and completely disappeared during interglacials the major effects of the quaternary glaciation have been the erosion of land and the deposition of material both over large parts of the continents the modification of river systems the creation of millions of lakes including the development of pluvial lakes far from the ice margins changes in sea level the isostatic adjustment of the earth s crust flooding and abnormal winds the ice sheets themselves by raising the albedo the extent to which the radiant energy of the sun is reflected from earth created significant feedback to further cool the climate these effects

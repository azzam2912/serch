its probability density function see the box is given in terms of denoted by formula 4 it was introduced by ole barndorff nielsen who studied it in the context of physics of wind blown sand this class is closed under affine transformations barndorff nielsen and halgreen proved that the gig distribution is infinitely divisible and since the gh distribution can be obtained as a normal variance mean mixture where the mixing distribution is the generalized inverse gaussian distribution barndorff nielsen and halgreen showed the gh distribution is infinitely divisible as well an important point about infinitely divisible distributions is their connection to l vy processes i e at any point in time a l vy process is infinitely divisible distributed many families of well known infinitely divisible distributions are so called convolution closed i e if the distribution of a l vy process at one point in time belongs to one of these families then the distribution of the l vy process at all points in time belong to the same family of distributions for example a possion process will be possion distributed at all points in time or a brownian motion will be normal distributed at all points in

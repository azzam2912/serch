the book argues that stalin planned to use nazi germany as a proxy the icebreaker against the west it received a mixed reception with its thesis being rejected by many scholars in the book suvorov tells that stalin provided significant material and political support to adolf hitler while at the same time preparing the red army to liberate the whole of europe from nazi occupation suvorov argued that hitler had lost world war ii from the very moment he attacked poland he going to war with the powerful allies and it was only a matter of time before the soviet union would seize the opportune moment to attack him from the rear that left hitler with no choice but to direct a pre emptive strike at the soviet union while stalin s forces were redeploying from a defensive to an offensive posture in june 1941 providing hitler with an important initial tactical advantage however that was strategically hopeless because the nazis then had to fight on two fronts a mistake that hitler himself had identified as germany s undoing in the previous war at the end of the war stalin was able to achieve only some of his initial objectives

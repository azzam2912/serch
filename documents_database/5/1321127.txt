without modifier iodane is the systematic name for the parent hydride of iodine hi thus any organoiodine compound with general formula ri e g chi or chi is a substituted iodane however as used in the context of organic synthesis the term iodane more specifically refers to organoiodine compounds with nonstandard bond number i e bond number greater than one making this term a synonym for hypervalent iodine these iodine compounds are hypervalent because the iodine atom formally contains more than the 8 electrons in the valence shell required for the octet rule when iodine is ligated to an organic residue and electronegative ligands e g halides or carboxylates hypervalent iodine compounds occur with a 3 oxidation number as iodine iii or iodanes or as a 5 oxidation number as iodine v or iodanes here lambda convention is used to give the nonstandard bond number using neutral electron counting iodine itself contains 7 valence electrons in an normal valent iodane such as iodobenzene chi the ligand donates one additional electron to give a completed octet in a iodane three electrons are donated by the x type ligands making it a decet structure similarly iodanes are dodecet molecules as with other

it can be found in stars as a gas formed when calcium atoms are present with hydrogen atoms calcium monohydride was first discovered when its spectrum was observed in alpha herculis and ceti by alfred fowler in 1907 it was observed in sunspots the following year by c m olmsted next it was made in a laboratory in 1909 by a eagle and with early research by hulth n and watson and weber in 1935 it was further observed in m dwarfs by y hman in 1934 hman proposed its use as a proxy for stellar luminosity similar to magnesium monohydride mgh in being more apparent in the spectra of compact cool high surface gravity stars such as m dwarfs than in cool low surface gravity stars such as m giants of non negligible or even comparable metallicity calcium monohydride is the first molecular gas that was cooled by a cold buffer gas and then trapped by a magnetic field this extends the study of trapped cold atoms such as rubidium to molecules calcium monohydride can be formed by exposing metallic calcium to an electric discharge in a hydrogen atmosphere above 750 c below this temperature the hydrogen is absorbed

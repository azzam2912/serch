while most logic probes are powered by the circuit under test some devices use batteries they can be used on either ttl transistor transistor logic or cmos complementary metal oxide semiconductor logic integrated circuit devices such as 7400 series 4000 series and newer logic families that support similar voltages most modern logic probes typically have one or more leds on the body of the probe a control on the logic probe allows either the capture and storage of a single event or continuous running when the logic probe is either connected to an invalid logic level a fault condition or a tri stated output or not connected at all none of the leds light up another control on the logic probe allow selection of either ttl or cmos family logic this is required as these families have different thresholds for the logic high v and logic low v circuit voltages some logic probes have a audible tone of which vary across models a model may 1 emit a tone for high logic state otherwise no tone or 2 emit a higher frequency tone for a high logic state lower frequency tone for a low logic state and no tone for

it is made up of two equally important components a network of sensors to detect tsunamis and a communications infrastructure to issue timely alarms to permit evacuation of the coastal areas there are two distinct types of tsunami warning systems international and regional when operating seismic alerts are used to instigate the watches and warnings then data from observed sea level height either shore based tide gauges or dart buoys are used to verify the existence of a tsunami other systems have been proposed to augment the warning procedures for example it has been suggested that the duration and frequency content of t wave energy which is earthquake energy trapped in the ocean sofar channel is indicative of an earthquake s tsunami potential the first rudimentary system to alert communities of an impending tsunami was attempted in hawaii in the 1920s more advanced systems were developed in the wake of the april 1 1946 caused by the 1946 aleutian islands earthquake and may 23 1960 caused by the 1960 valdivia earthquake tsunamis which caused massive devastation in hilo hawaii while tsunamis travel at between 500 and 1 000 km h around 0 14 and 0 28 km s in open

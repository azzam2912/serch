geometric algebraic and arithmetic objects are assigned objects called k groups these are groups in the sense of abstract algebra they contain detailed information about the original object but are notoriously difficult to compute for example an important outstanding problem is to compute the k groups of the integers k theory was invented in the late 1950s by alexander grothendieck in his study of intersection theory on algebraic varieties in the modern language grothendieck defined only k the zeroth k group but even this single group has plenty of applications such as the grothendieck riemann roch theorem intersection theory is still a motivating force in the development of higher algebraic k theory through its links with motivic cohomology and specifically chow groups the subject also includes classical number theoretic topics like quadratic reciprocity and embeddings of number fields into the real numbers and complex numbers as well as more modern concerns like the construction of higher regulators and special values of l functions the lower k groups were discovered first in the sense that adequate descriptions of these groups in terms of other algebraic structures were found for example if f is a field then is isomorphic to the integers

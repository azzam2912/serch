the mode is dependent on the phase of flight usually on approach to land the autopilot will be set to approach mode therefore if the to ga switch is pressed it will activate the go around mode of the autothrottle conversely when take off is set on the autopilot the switch activates take off mode of the autothrottle on boeing aircraft to ga modes are selected by a separate switch near the throttle levers but on airbus aircraft it is activated by pushing the thrust levers fully forward to the to ga detent once an aircraft has lined up the pilots increase the engine power the level reached is 40 60 rpm of low pressure turbine on boeings and 50 on airbuses this is done to prevent flame out on takeoff due to compressor stall the pilots then press the to ga switch by pushing the thrust levers to to ga on boeings or to to ga or flex detent on airbuses and the engines then increase to their computed take off power modern aircraft flight management computers will determine the power needed by the engines to take off based on a number of factors such as runway length wind

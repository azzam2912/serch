bus coupler is a breaker used to couple two busbars in order to perform maintenance on other circuit breakers associated with that busbar it is achieved with the help of a circuit breaker and isolators mil std 1553b specifies the transformer characteristics and turns ratio of 1 4 1 with the higher turns on the isolation resistor side of the stub the mil std 1553b also specifies the isolation resistors that are placed in series with each connection to the bus normally bus couplers are available with 1 4 1 transformer ratios and 59 ohm 2 watt 1 resistors for special applications couplers can be supplied with different transformer ratios e g 1 1 and other resistance values e g 54 9 ohms bus coupler configurations are available as non terminated or internally terminated if two or more non terminated couplers are used on a bus then the couplers at each end of the bus must be terminated externally with 78 ohm terminators on the unused bus connections of the end couplers alternately internally single terminated couplers with or without the non functional bus connectors can be supplied even if only one non terminated coupler acts as the bus because

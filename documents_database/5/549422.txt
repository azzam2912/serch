typically a scholarly article has a section in which the authors acknowledge entities such as funding technical staff colleagues etc that have contributed materials or knowledge or have influenced or inspired their work like a citation index it measures influences on scientific work but in a different sense it measures institutional and economic influences as well as informal influences of individual people ideas and artifacts unlike the impact factor it does not produce a single overall metric but analyses the components separately however the total number of acknowledgements to an acknowledged entity can be measured and so can the number of citations to the papers in which the acknowledgement appears the ratio of this total number of citations to the total number of papers in which the acknowledge entity appears can be construed as the impact of that acknowledged entity the first automated acknowledgement indexing was created in the search engine and digital library citeseer however that feature is no longer supported another acknowledgement extraction and indexing system for acknowledgement was ackseer however that indexing system is not available today as well

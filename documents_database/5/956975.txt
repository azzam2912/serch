creating a channel between the pay zone and the wellbore to cause oil and gas to flow to the wellbore easily in cased hole completions the well will be drilled down past the section of the formation desired for production and will have casing or a liner run in separating the formation from the well bore the final stage of the completion will involve running in perforating guns a string of shaped charges down to the desired depth and firing them to perforate the casing or liner a typical perforating gun can carry many dozens of explosive charges commonly perforation guns are run on e line as it is traditional to use electrical signals from the surface to fire the guns in more highly deviated wells coiled tubing may be used newer technologies allow the guns to be run on slickline modern slickline technology embeds fiber optic lines that can transmit two way data on real time temperature pressure and seismic responses along the length of the slickline this information allows very precise operations of various down hole tools including perforation guns the benefit of this strategy is greater control of the well casing the bottom of the hole allows

individuals cause ghg emissions from a variety of direct and indirect activities including transportation use electrical use and home heating and cooling verifiable reductions in ghg emissions are aggregated into 1 metric ton increments and they become personal carbon credits traditional carbon credits are purchased by ghg emitters to offset the difference between their actual emissions and their allowable limit under a cap and trade type ghg reduction program or to reduce their total ghg emissions under a voluntary limit these same credits are created when specific ghg reduction projects produce real additional and verifiable ghg reductions these carbon projects are typically large in scale and include reforestation fuel switching and biogas projects personal carbon credits follow the same concept as traditional carbon credits but these projects are small in scale developed by individuals and encourage actual reduction in energy demand at the use point they are applicable globally wherever the verification requirements can be satisfied personal carbon credits differ from personal carbon trading which imposes a cap or allowance on individual ghg emissions personal carbon credits are a voluntary method for individuals to directly reduce energy consumption and the resulting ghg emissions successful individual reductions are rewarded through lower

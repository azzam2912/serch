however many fungi reproduce only asexually and cannot easily be classified based on sexual characteristics some produce both asexual and sexual states these problematic species are often members of the ascomycota but a few of them belong to the basidiomycota even among fungi that reproduce both sexually and asexually often only one method of reproduction can be observed at a specific point in time or under specific conditions additionally fungi typically grow in mixed colonies and sporulate amongst each other these facts have made it very difficult to link the various states of the same fungus fungi that are not known to produce a teleomorph were historically placed into an artificial phylum the deuteromycota also known as fungi imperfecti simply for convenience some workers hold that this is an obsolete concept and that molecular phylogeny allows accurate placement of species which are known from only part of their life cycle others retain the term deuteromycetes but give it a lowercase d and no taxonomic rank historically article 59 of the international code of botanical nomenclature permitted mycologists to give asexually reproducing fungi anamorphs separate names from their sexual states teleomorphs but this practice was discontinued as of 1 january 2013

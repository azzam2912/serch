the name was coined by ross and co workers it provides conditions under which dualization can be commuted with discretization in the case of computational optimal control an application of pontryagin s minimum principle to problem formula 1 a given optimal control problem generates a boundary value problem according to ross this boundary value problem is a pontryagin lift and is represented as problem formula 2 now suppose one discretizes problem formula 2 this generates problemformula 4 where formula 5 represents the number of discrete points for convergence it is necessary to prove that as in the 1960s kalman and others showed that solving problem formula 7 is extremely difficult this difficulty known as the curse of complexity is complementary to the curse of dimensionality in a series of papers starting in the late 1990s ross and fahroo showed that one could arrive at a solution to problem formula 8 and hence problem formula 1 more easily by discretizing first problem formula 10 and dualizing afterwards problem formula 11 the sequence of operations must be done carefully to ensure consistency and convergence the covector mapping principle asserts that a covector mapping theorem can be discovered to map the solutions of

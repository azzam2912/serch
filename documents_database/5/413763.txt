it consists of a rotating ground antenna and transponders in aircraft the ground antenna sweeps a narrow vertical beam of microwaves around the airspace when the beam strikes an aircraft the transponder transmits a return signal back giving information such as altitude and the squawk code a four digit code assigned to each aircraft that enters a region information about this aircraft is then entered into the system and subsequently added to the controller s screen to display this information when queried this information can include flight number designation and altitude of the aircraft atcrbs assists air traffic control atc surveillance radars by acquiring information about the aircraft being monitored and providing this information to the radar controllers the controllers can use the information to identify radar returns from aircraft known as targets and to distinguish those returns from ground clutter the system consists of transponders installed in aircraft and secondary surveillance radars ssrs installed at air traffic control facilities the ssr is sometimes co located with the primary surveillance radar or psr these two radar systems work in conjunction to produce a synchronized surveillance picture the ssr transmits interrogations and listens for any replies transponders that receive an interrogation

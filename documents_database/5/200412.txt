it has been established to provide a common reference for temperature and pressure and consists of tables of values at various altitudes plus some formulas by which those values were derived the international organization for standardization iso publishes the isa as an international standard iso 2533 1975 other standards organizations such as the international civil aviation organization icao and the united states government publish extensions or subsets of the same atmospheric model under their own standards making authority the isa mathematical model divides the atmosphere into layers with an assumed linear distribution of absolute temperature t against geopotential altitude h the other two values pressure p and density are computed by simultaneously solving the equations resulting from at each geopotential altitude where g is the standard acceleration of gravity and r is the specific gas constant for dry air air density must be calculated in order to solve for the pressure and is used in calculating dynamic pressure for moving vehicles dynamic viscosity is an empirical function of temperature and kinematic viscosity is calculated by dividing dynamic viscosity by the density thus the standard consists of a tabulation of values at various altitudes plus some formulas by which those values

since the 15th century it has when granted usually been given to the second son of english later british monarchs the equivalent title in the scottish peerage was duke of albany however king george i and queen victoria granted the second sons of their eldest sons the titles duke of york and albany and duke of york respectively initially granted in the 14th century in the peerage of england the title duke of york has been created eight times the title duke of york and albany has been created three times these occurred during the 18th century following the 1707 unification of the kingdom of england and kingdom of scotland into a single united realm the double naming was done so that a territorial designation from each of the previously separate realms could be included the current duke of york is prince andrew the second son of queen elizabeth ii the present duke s marriage produced two daughters only and he has remained unmarried since his 1996 divorce it therefore seems likely that the eighth creation of the title will be only the second after richard of shrewsbury not to become merged into the crown upon the holder s accession

this shows that the camassa holm equation is a model for shallow water waves with non hydrostatic pressure and a water layer on a horizontal bed the linear dispersion characteristics of the camassa holm equation are with the angular frequency and k the wavenumber not surprisingly this is of similar form as the one for the korteweg de vries equation provided is non zero for equal to zero the camassa holm equation has no frequency dispersion moreover the linear phase speed is zero for this case as a result is the phase speed for the long wave limit of k approaching zero and the camassa holm equation is if is non zero a model for one directional wave propagation like the korteweg de vries equation introducing the momentum m as then two compatible hamiltonian descriptions of the camassa holm equation are the camassa holm equation is an integrable system integrability means that there is a change of variables action angle variables such that the evolution equation in the new variables is equivalent to a linear flow at constant speed this change of variables is achieved by studying an associated isospectral scattering problem and is reminiscent of the fact that integrable

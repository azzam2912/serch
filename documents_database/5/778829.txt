the molecule is a derivative of ammonia with trimethylsilyl groups in place of two hydrogen atoms an electron diffraction study shows that silicon nitrogen bond length 173 5 pm and si n si bond angle 125 5 to be similar to disilazane in which methyl groups are replaced by hydrogen atoms suggesting that steric factors are not decision in regulating angles this colorless liquid is a reagent and a precursor to bases that are popular in organic synthesis and organometallic chemistry additionally hmds is also increasingly used as molecular precursor in chemical vapor deposition techniques to deposite silicon carbonitride thin films or coatings bis trimethylsilyl amine is synthesized by treatment of trimethylsilyl chloride with ammonia ammonium nitrate together with triethylamine can be used instead this method is also useful for n isotopic enrichment of hmds alkali metal bis trimethylsilyl amides result from the deprotonation of bis trimethylsilyl amine for example lithium bis trimethylsilyl amide lihmds is prepared using n butyllithium lihmds and other similar derivatives sodium bis trimethylsilyl amide nahmds and potassium bis trimethylsilyl amide khmds are used as a non nucleophilic bases in synthetic organic chemistry hexamethyldisilazane is employed as a reagent in many organic reactions 1 hmds is

fibrotic cardiac muscle is stiffer and less compliant and is seen in the progression to heart failure the description below focuses on a specific mechanism of valvular pathology but there are other causes of valve pathology and fibrosis of the cardiac muscle fibrocyte cells normally secrete collagen and function to provide structural support for the heart when over activated this process causes thickening and fibrosis of the valve with white tissue building up primarily on the tricuspid valve but also occurring on the pulmonary valve the thickening and loss of flexibility eventually may lead to valvular dysfunction and right sided heart failure certain diseases such as gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors of the mid gut which sometimes release large amounts of 5 hydroxytryptamine commonly known as 5 ht or serotonin into the blood may produce a characteristic pattern of mostly right sided cardiac fibrosis which can be identified at autopsy this pathology has also been seen in certain east african tribes who eat foods matoke a green banana containing excess amounts of serotonin elevated prevalence of cardiac fibrosis and related valvopathies was found to be associated with use of a number of unrelated drugs following long term statistical analysis once the drugs

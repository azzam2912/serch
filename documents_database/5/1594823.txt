the theoretical studies are of practical use because they predict the fundamental limits of a solar cell and give guidance on the phenomena that contribute to losses and solar cell efficiency when a photon hits a piece of silicon one of three things can happen when a photon is absorbed its energy is given to an electron in the crystal lattice usually this electron is in the valence band the energy given to the electron by the photon excites it into the conduction band where it is free to move around within the semiconductor the network of covalent bonds that the electron was previously a part of now has one fewer electron this is known as a hole the presence of a missing covalent bond allows the bonded electrons of neighboring atoms to move into the hole leaving another hole behind thus propagating holes throughout the lattice it can be said that photons absorbed in the semiconductor create electron hole pairs a photon only needs to have energy greater than that of the band gap in order to excite an electron from the valence band into the conduction band however the solar frequency spectrum approximates a black body spectrum at

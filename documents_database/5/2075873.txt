both types of pads in insects make use of liquid secretions and are considered wet dry adhesive mechanisms primarily rely on van der waals forces and are also used by organisms other than insects the fluid provides capillary and viscous adhesion and appears to be present in all insect adhesive pads little is known about the chemical properties of the adhesive fluids and the ultrastructure of the fluid producing cells is currently not extensively studied additionally both hairy and smooth types of adhesion have evolved separately numerous times in insects few comparative studies between the two types of adhesion mechanisms have been done and there is a lack of information regarding the forces that can be supported by these systems in insects additionally tree frogs and some mammals such as the arboreal possum and bats also make use of smooth adhesive pads the use of adhesive pads for locomotion across non horizontal surfaces is a trait that evolved separately in different species making it an example of convergent evolution the power of adhesion allows these organisms to be able to climb on almost any substance the exact mechanisms of arthropod adhesion are still unknown for some species but this topic

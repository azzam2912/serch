it is a complex regulatory and transport system involving many proteins and protein complexes mbp has an approximate molecular mass of 42 5 kilodaltons mbp is encoded by the male gene of escherichia coli the male gene codes for a precursor polypeptide 396 amino acid residues which yields the mature mbp 370 residues upon cleavage of the nh terminal extension 26 residues the precursor and mature forms of mbp do not contain any cysteine residue mbp is a monomeric protein crystal structures have shown that mbp is divided into two distinct globular domains that are connected by three short polypeptide segments the two domains are separated by a deep groove that contains the maltose maltodextrins binding site comparison of the structures of the liganded and unliganded forms of mbp has shown that the binding of maltose induces a major conformational change that closes the groove by a rigid motion of the two domains around the linking polypeptide hinge both precursor and mature forms of mbp are functional for the binding of maltose the nh terminal extension decreases the folding rate of the precursor form of mbp relative to its mature form by at least 5 fold but it has no

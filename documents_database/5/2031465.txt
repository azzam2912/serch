as well as a routing api over http it runs on the server desktop android ios or raspberry pi by default openstreetmap data for the road network and elevation data from the shuttle radar topography mission is used graphhopper can be configured to use different algorithms such as dijkstra a and its bidirectional versions to make routing fast enough for long paths continental size and avoid heuristical approaches graphhopper uses contraction hierarchies by default in the java magazine from oracle the author peter karich describes the techniques necessary to make the system memory efficient and fast furthermore graphhopper is built on a large test suite including unit integration and load tests the apache license allows everyone to customize and integrate graphhopper in free or commercial products and together with the query speed and openstreetmap data this makes graphhopper a possible alternative to existing routing services and gps navigation software besides point to point routing for different vehicles graphhopper can be used to calculate distance matrices which are then used as an input for vehicle routing problems other use cases are notable users of graphhopper are rome2rio komoot gnome and since february 2015 graphhopper has been one of the apis powering

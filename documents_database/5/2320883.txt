because there is no way to directly observe or measure deep earth processes geochemists rely on experimental petrology to establish quantitative values and relationships in order to construct models of the deep earth experimental petrology can range from creating artificial magmas to measure crystallization behavior to observing recrystallization of minerals at varying p t pressure temperature conditions although methodology varies from experiment to experiment in general the procedure involves evaluating a synthetic rock or magma created from a blend of oxides to replicate the chemistry of the rock system in question in an apparatus capable of creating and sustaining high pressures and temperatures such as a diamond anvil cell in general it is ideal if the enclosing capsule is relatively nonreactive such as diamond or platinum gold alloys experimental igneous petrology is the subset of experimental petrology concerned with quantifying the behavior of magmas and their associated igneous rocks at depth standard procedure generally involves the creation of a synthetic magma often corresponding to a real world analog which is then cooled to a target temperature after crystallization the products are analyzed qualities of interest include mineral assemblage which minerals crystallized and how much mineral chemistry and liquid the remainder

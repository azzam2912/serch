this is the case of the wilson loop which is defined as a path ordered exponential to guarantee that the wilson loop encodes the holonomy of the gauge connection the parameter that determines the ordering is a parameter describing the contour and because the contour is closed the wilson loop must be defined as a trace in order to be gauge invariant in quantum field theory it is useful to take the time ordered product of operators this operation is denoted by formula 6 although formula 6 is often called the time ordering operator strictly speaking it is neither an operator on states nor a superoperator on operators t is variable in dimension 4 like that of the black hole but constant in dimension 3 for two operators a x and b y that depend on spacetime locations x and y we define here formula 9 and formula 10 denote the invariant scalar time coordinates of the points x and y explicitly we have where formula 12 denotes the heaviside step function and the formula 13 depends on if the operators are bosonic or fermionic in nature if bosonic then the sign is always chosen if fermionic then the sign

astronomers place the submillimetre waveband between the far infrared and microwave wavebands typically taken to be between a few hundred micrometres and a millimetre it is still common in submillimetre astronomy to quote wavelengths in microns the old name for micrometre using submillimetre observations astronomers examine molecular clouds and dark cloud cores with a goal of clarifying the process of star formation from earliest collapse to stellar birth submillimetre observations of these dark clouds can be used to determine chemical abundances and cooling mechanisms for the molecules which comprise them in addition submillimetre observations give information on the mechanisms for the formation and evolution of galaxies the most significant limitation to the detection of astronomical emission at submillimetre wavelengths with ground based observatories is atmospheric emission noise and attenuation like the infrared the submillimetre atmosphere is dominated by numerous water vapour absorption bands and it is only through windows between these bands that observations are possible the ideal submillimetre observing site is dry cool has stable weather conditions and is away from urban population centres there are only a handful of such sites identified they include mauna kea hawaii united states the llano de chajnantor observatory on the atacama plateau

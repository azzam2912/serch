various operating systems including os 8 rt 11 rsx 11 and rsts e implemented odt as did the firmware console of all of the lsi 11 family processors including the 11 03 11 23 24 11 53 11 73 and 11 83 84 the debugger allowed access to memory using octal addresses and data within the software systems the debugger accessed the process s address space dec s line of pdp 11 processors did not implement virtual memory from an operating system perspective but instead worked off of a fixed address space which was mapped into a unified view of the program s address space using an active page register apr an apr could map the program s ram in increments of 4k 16 bit words to a maximum of 32k in other words an apr could map 8 segments of ram each limited to 4k because of this structure the maximum ram an apr was able to map was 32k 16 bit words in the case of rsts e this usually meant that a runtime system or rts mapped to the upper portion of the address space and a user program resided in the lower portion of the address

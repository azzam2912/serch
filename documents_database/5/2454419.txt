it belongs to the small gtpase superfamily specifically to the rab protein family small gtpases are a type of hydrolase enzymes that can attach to a gtp to form a gdp this process makes small gtpases active when bonded to a gtp and inactive when bonded to a gdp inside this small gtpase superfamily we can find the ras subfamily this family is divided into 5 groups ras rho ran rab and arf gtpases rab2b s main function is regulating vesicle transport and membrane fusion rab2b is a human protein whose gene is located in the fourteenth chromosome it has a core made of basic elements such as oxygen carbon nitrogen and phosphorus its secondary structure contains eight alpha helix and six beta strands moreover it has attached a magnesium ion and a gdp mature rab2b contains three post translational modifications a phosphoserine is found in the location 202 instead of a normal serine and two lipidations can be found in locations 215 216 it has a motif domain between the amino acids 35 and 43 due to the alternative splicing two isoforms of this same protein exist isoform 1 is the canonical sequence meaning it is the most common

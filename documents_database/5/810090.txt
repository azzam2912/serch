it was first done by the finnish geodesist v is l in 1959 who made astrometric photographs of the sky at two stations together with a balloon probe between them even this first step showed the potential of the method because v is l got the azimuth between helsinki and turku a distance of 150 km with an accuracy of 1 soon the method was successfully tested by ballistic rockets and for some special satellites adequate computer programs were written for the advantage of stellar triangulation is the possibility to cross far distances terrestrial observations are restricted to approx 30 km and even in high mountains to 60 km and the independency of the earth s gravity field the results are azimuths between the stations in the stellar inertial navigation system despite of no direct line of sight in 1960 the first appropriate space probe was launched project echo a 30 m diameter balloon satellite by then the whole of western europe could be linked together geodetically with accuracies 2 10 times better than by classical triangulation during the late 1960s a global project was begun by h h schmid switzerland to connect 45 stations all over the continents with

keratin 19 is a type i keratin keratin 19 is a member of the keratin family the keratins are intermediate filament proteins responsible for the structural integrity of epithelial cells and are subdivided into cytokeratins and hair keratins keratin 19 is a type i keratin the type i cytokeratins consist of acidic proteins which are arranged in pairs of heterotypic keratin chains unlike its related family members this smallest known acidic cytokeratin is not paired with a basic cytokeratin in epithelial cells it is specifically found in the periderm the transiently superficial layer that envelops the developing epidermis the type i cytokeratins are clustered in a region of chromosome 17q12 q21 krt19 is also known as cyfra 21 1 due to its high sensitivity krt19 is the most used marker for the rt pcr mediated detection of tumor cells disseminated in lymph nodes peripheral blood and bone marrow of breast cancer patients depending on the assays krt19 has been shown to be both a specific and a non specific marker false positivity in such krt19 rt pcr studies include illegitimate transcription expression of small amounts of krt19 mrna by tissues in which it has no real physiological role haematological disorders

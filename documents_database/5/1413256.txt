it has been developed by lynne m reder at carnegie mellon university it shares many commonalities with act r sac specifies a memory representation consisting of a network of both semantic concept and perceptual nodes such as font and associated episodic context nodes similar to her husband s john anderson model act r the node activations are governed by a set of common computational principles such as spreading activation and the strengthening and decay of activation however a unique feature of the sac model are episode nodes which are newly formed memory traces that binds the concepts involved with the current experiential context a recent addition to sac are assumptions governing the probability of forming an association during encoding these bindings are affected by working memory resources available sac is considered among a class of dual process models of memory since recognition involves two processes a general familiarity process based on the activation of semantic concept nodes and a more specific recollection process based on the activation of episodic context nodes this feature has allowed sac to model a variety of memory phenomena such as meta cognitive rapid feeling of knowing judgments remember know judgments the word frequency mirror effect

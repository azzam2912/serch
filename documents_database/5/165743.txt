by changing the voltage waveform applied to the lamp it is possible to lower the intensity of the light output although variable voltage devices are used for various purposes the term dimmer is generally reserved for those intended to control light output from resistive incandescent halogen and more recently compact fluorescent lights cfls and light emitting diodes leds more specialized equipment is needed to dim fluorescent mercury vapor solid state and other arc lighting dimmers range in size from small units the size of domestic light switches to high power units used in large theatrical or architectural lighting installations small domestic dimmers are generally directly controlled although remote control systems such as x10 are available modern professional dimmers are generally controlled by a digital control system like dmx or dali in newer systems these protocols are often used in conjunction with ethernet in the professional lighting industry changes in intensity are called fades and can be fade up or fade down dimmers with direct manual control had a limit on the speed they could be varied at but this problem has been largely eliminated with modern digital units although very fast changes in brightness may still be avoided for other

it is used in some ferroelectric materials as a component of optical materials and is a feedstock for certain catalysts among other uses lanthanum oxide is an odorless white solid that is insoluble in water but soluble in dilute acid depending on the ph of the compound different crystal structures can be obtained lao is hygroscopic under atmosphere it absorbs moisture over time and converts to lanthanum hydroxide lanthanum oxide has p type semiconducting properties and a band gap of approximately 5 8 ev its average room temperature resistivity is 10 k cm which decreases with an increase in temperature lao has the lowest lattice energy of the rare earth oxides with very high dielectric constant 27 at low temperatures lao has an a mo hexagonal crystal structure the la metal atoms are surrounded by a 7 coordinate group of oatoms the oxygen ions are in an octahedral shape around the metal atom and there is one oxygen ion above one of the octahedral faces on the other hand at high temperatures lanthanum oxide converts to a c mo cubic crystal structure the la ion is surrounded by six o ions in a hexagonal configuration several elements were discovered as

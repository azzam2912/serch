a version known as the best of john denver with the same track listing was released in some countries the collection included material from his earlier days as a songwriter going back to 1965 on for bobbie to his later hit rocky mountain high indeed many of these tracks were not hits per se but as stephen thomas erlewine wrote for allmusic the se were the songs that defined him moreover greatest hits is important historically because it contained new revisionist recordings of several songs notable new versions included leaving on a jet plane starwood in aspen follow me rhymes and reasons the eagle and the hawk sunshine on my shoulders and poems prayers and promises denver explained this himself in the liner notes by saying that he had picked the numbers most requested in his concerts but that i felt that some of these songs had grown a bit that i am singing better than i was four or five years ago and that i would like to treat some of the songs a little differently than i had in the original recordings after its release these versions were used for airplay despite differing in subtle but important ways

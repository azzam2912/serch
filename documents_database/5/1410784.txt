created by a community of australians living in paris it is mainly composed of french and australian players they were responsible for the organization of the first coupe de france of australian football on 28 june 2008 the club was founded in 1998 with the help of james blanchard of the embassy of australia in paris who at the time was responsible for sports at the embassy back then the club was only made up from expatriate australians living in france it was also at this time that the first 100 french team was created the tasmania montivilliers in normandie the two teams thus benefited from the organisation of the first australian football game on the french territory since the first world war the score has since been forgotten but it is more than probable that the parisian club won due to the experience of their australian players unfortunately this encounter will never be repeated as the normands would fold the following year there would be a long wait before the cockerels would be able to return in 2004 to the european footy scene that year would see two confrontations organised against the brussels saints the first one taking place

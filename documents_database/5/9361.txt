it is a hard brittle bluish white transition metal in the platinum group that is found as a trace element in alloys mostly in platinum ores osmium is the densest naturally occurring element with an experimentally measured using x ray crystallography density of manufacturers use its alloys with platinum iridium and other platinum group metals to make fountain pen nib tipping electrical contacts and in other applications that require extreme durability and hardness the element s abundance in the earth s crust is among the rarest osmium has a blue gray tint and is the densest stable element it is approximately twice as dense as lead and slightly denser than iridium calculations of density from the x ray diffraction data may produce the most reliable data for these elements giving a value of for osmium slightly denser than the of iridium both metals are nearly 23 times as dense as water osmium is a hard but brittle metal that remains lustrous even at high temperatures it has a very low compressibility correspondingly its bulk modulus is extremely high reported between and which rivals that of diamond the hardness of osmium is moderately high at because of its hardness brittleness low

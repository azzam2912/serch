it functions as histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription of genes via chromatin remodeling by allowing histone proteins to wrap dna more tightly this enzyme plays an essential role in regulating cell growth and division prompting cells to mature and assume specialized functions differentiate and preventing the growth of cancerous tumors the p300 protein appears to be critical for normal development before and after birth the ep300 gene is located on the long q arm of the human chromosome 22 at position 13 2 this gene encodes the adenovirus e1a associated cellular p300 transcriptional co activator protein ep300 is closely related to another gene creb binding protein which is found on human chromosome 16 p300 hat functions as histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription via chromatin remodeling and is important in the processes of cell proliferation and differentiation it mediates camp gene regulation by binding specifically to phosphorylated creb protein p300 hat contains a bromodomain which is involved in il6 signaling this gene has also been identified as a co activator of hif1a hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha and thus plays a role in the stimulation of hypoxia induced genes such as vegf the p300 protein carries out its function of activating

the fault extends westward from a junction with the east anatolian fault at the karliova triple junction in eastern turkey across northern turkey and into the aegean sea for a length of 1500 kilometers it runs about 20 km south of istanbul the north anatolian fault is similar in many ways to the san andreas fault in california both are continental transforms with similar lengths and slip rates the sea of marmara near istanbul is an extensional basin similar to the salton trough in california where a releasing bend in the strike slip system creates a pull apart basin since the disastrous 1939 erzincan earthquake there have been seven earthquakes measuring over 7 0 in magnitude each happening at a point progressively further west seismologists studying this pattern believe that each earthquake may trigger the next by analyzing the stresses along the fault caused by each large earthquake they were able to predict the shock that hit the town of zmit with devastating effect in august 1999 it is thought that the chain is not complete and that an earthquake will soon strike further west along the fault perhaps near the heavily populated city of istanbul

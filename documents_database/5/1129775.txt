clec7a is a member of the c type lectin c type lectin like domain ctl ctld superfamily the encoded glycoprotein is a small type ii membrane receptor with an extracellular c type lectin like domain fold and a cytoplasmic domain with a partial immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif it functions as a pattern recognition receptor for a variety of 1 3 linked and 1 6 linked glucans from fungi and plants and in this way plays a role in innate immune response expression is found on myeloid dendritic cells monocytes macrophages and b cells alternate transcriptional splice variants encoding different isoforms have been characterized this gene is closely linked to other ctl ctld superfamily members on chromosome 12p13 in the natural killer gene complex region dectin 1 is a transmembrane protein containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation itam like motif in its intracellular tail which is involved in cellular activation and one c type lectin like domain carbohydrate recognition domain crd in the extracellular region which recognizes glucans and endogenous ligands on t cells the crd is separated from the membrane by a stalk region clec7a contains putative n linked sites of glycosylation in the stalk region clec7a is expressed

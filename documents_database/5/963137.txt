these genera were previously included in the family capparaceae but were raised to a distinct family when dna evidence suggested the genera included in it are more closely related to the brassicaceae than they are to the capparaceae the apg ii system allows for cleomaceae to be included in brassicaceae in 1994 a group of scientists including walter stephen judd suggested to merge the capparaceae which at that time included the cleomaceae with the brassicaceae early dna analysis showed that the capparaceae as defined at that moment were paraphyletic and others suggested to assign the genera closest to the brassicaceae to the cleomaceae the cleomaceae and brassicaceae diverged approximately 41 million years ago all three families have consistently been placed in one order variably called capparales or brassicales the apg ii system merged cleomaceae and brassicaceae other classifications have continued to recognise the capparaceae but with a more restricted circumscription either including cleome and its relatives in the brassicaceae or recognizing them in the segregate family cleomaceae the apg iii system has recently adopted this last solution but this may change as a consensus arises on this point current insights in the relationships of the brassicaceae based on a 2012

water by its very nature is dynamic features associated with water are thus ever changing to be able to keep up with these changes technological advancements have given scientists methods to enhance all aspects of scientific investigation from satellite tracking of wildlife to computer mapping of habitats agencies like the us geological survey us fish and wildlife service as well as other federal and state agencies are utilizing gis to aid in their conservation efforts gis is being used in multiple fields of aquatic science from limnology hydrology aquatic botany stream ecology oceanography and marine biology applications include using satellite imagery to identify monitor and mitigate habitat loss imagery can also show the condition of inaccessible areas scientists can track movements and develop a strategy to locate locations of concern gis can be used to track invasive species endangered species and population changes one of the advantages of the system is the availability for the information to be shared and updated at any time through the use of web based data collection in the past gis was not a practical source of analysis due to the difficulty in obtaining spatial data on habitats or organisms in underwater environments with the

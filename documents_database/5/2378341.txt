it uses many of the principles of software engineering but it is specific to the development of distributed systems when the first experimental and commercial computer networks were developed in the 1970s the concept of protocols was not yet well developed these were the first distributed systems in the context of the newly adopted layered protocol architecture see osi model the definition of the protocol of a specific layer should be such that any entity implementing that specification in one computer would be compatible with any other computer containing an entity implementing the same specification and their interactions should be such that the desired communication service would be obtained on the other hand the protocol specification should be abstract enough to allow different choices for the implementation on different computers it was recognized that a precise specification of the expected service provided by the given layer was important it is important for the verification of the protocol which should demonstrate that the communication service is provided if both protocol entities implement the protocol specification correctly this principle was later followed during the standardization of the osi protocol stack in particular for the transport layer it was also recognized that some

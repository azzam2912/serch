before molecular phylogenetics became an important part of plant taxonomy urticales was recognized in many perhaps even most systems of plant classification with some variations in circumscription among these is the cronquist system 1981 which placed the order in the subclass hamamelidae as comprising in the apg iii system 2009 the plants belonging to this order along with four other families constitute the order rosales cecropiaceae is no longer recognized as separate from urticaceae the families ulmaceae cannabaceae moraceae and urticaceae form a clade that has strong statistical support in phylogenetic analyses of dna sequences this clade has been informally called the urticalean rosids urticaleean rosids refers to the relationships amongst several families of angiosperms and now includes more than 2 500 species the families are the relationships within the urticalean lineage are now considered to be within the rosales the moraceae and urticaceae account for approximately 90 of the diversity within the clade analysis of dna samples in rbcl trnl f and ndhf plastid regions suggests that urticalean rosids are derived out of a lineage including barbeyaceae dirachmaceae elaegnaceae and rhamnaceae with rosaceae less closely related the morphological and molecular characters which define urticalean rosins are urticalean families span

equivalently a topological space x is a moore space if the following conditions hold moore spaces are generally interesting in mathematics because they may be applied to prove interesting metrization theorems the concept of a moore space was formulated by r l moore in the earlier part of the 20th century for a long time topologists were trying to prove the so called normal moore space conjecture every normal moore space is metrizable this was inspired by the fact that all known moore spaces that were not metrizable were also not normal this would have been a nice metrization theorem there were some nice partial results at first namely properties 7 8 and 9 as given in the previous section here we see that we drop metacompactness from traylor s theorem but at the cost of a set theoretic assumption another example of this is fleissner s theorem that the axiom of constructibility implies that locally compact normal moore spaces are metrizable on the other hand under the continuum hypothesis ch and also under martin s axiom and not ch there are several examples of non metrizable normal moore spaces nyikos proved that under the so called pmea product measure

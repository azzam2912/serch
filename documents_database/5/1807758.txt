the ascoceratidae are divided into two unequal subfamilies ascoceratinae have an exogastric ascoceroid stage characterized by the development of a protruding neck ending at the aperture both ocular and hyponomic sinuses which form when fully grown and camerae that are mostly confined to the dorsal half of the shell the siphuncle is close to the venter and found only in the adapical portion siphuncle segments nummuloidal beaded in appearance septal necks cyrtochoanitic flared outwardly generally with recumbent bent back on themselves brims the deciduous stage which is the juvenile or immature is orthoconic to cytroconic with long but variable camerae siphuncle with orthochoanitic septal necks and tubular segments and generally straight sutures ascoceratinae includes the following genera ascoceras aphragmites billingsites glossoceras lindtroemoceras parascoceras suchertoceras with the exception of billingsites and suchertoceras which are from the ordovician these genera are all silurian probillingsitinae ascoceratidae in which the mature breviconic portion is globose with only a short indistinct apertural neck obliquely oriented septa and oblique sinuous sutures the immature deciduous portion is unknown probliingsitinae which is known only from the middle and upper ordovician was named by rousseau flower 1941 to contain the following two genera probillingstites and what is probably its

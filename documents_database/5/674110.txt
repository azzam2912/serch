in the case of a fixed wing aircraft in normal flight the entire wing travels forward through the air at the same speed in the case of helicopter rotor blades the tips of the blade travel very fast through the air while the parts near the rotor hub travel much more slowly because lift increases with speed the outermost sections of the rotor blades generate more lift than those parts closer to the rotor hub so a rotor blade is said to be an aysmmetric generator of lift because of the difference in lift generated along its length helicopter manufacturers try to reduce this differential effect that is aim for more equality of lift along the blade length this has two main aspects when the helicopter is travelling forwards with respect to the atmosphere a further phenomenon comes into play dissymmetry of lift

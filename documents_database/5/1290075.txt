the degree to which these factors change the reaction rate is described by the elasticity coefficient this coefficient is defined as follows formula 1 where formula 2 denotes the reaction rate and formula 3 denotes the substrate concentration the partial derivative in the definition indicates that the elasticity is measured with respect to changes in a factor s while keeping all other factors constant the most common factors include substrates products and effectors the scaling of the coefficient ensures that it is dimensionless and independent of the units used to measure the reaction rate and magnitude of the factor the elasticity coefficient is an integral part of metabolic control analysis and was introduced in the early 1970s and possibly earlier by henrik kacser and burns in edinburgh and heinrich and rapoport in berlin the elasticity concept has also been described by other authors most notably savageau in michigan and clarke at edmonton in the late 1960s michael savageau developed an innovative approach called biochemical systems theory that uses power law expansions to approximate the nonlinearities in biochemical kinetics the theory is very similar to metabolic control analysis and has been very successfully and extensively used to study the properties of

a classification system for glycoside hydrolases based on sequence similarity has led to the definition of 100 different families this classification is available on the cazy web site and also discussed at cazypedia an online encyclopedia of carbohydrate active enzymes glycoside hydrolase family 27 together with family 31 and the family 36 alpha galactosidases form the glycosyl hydrolase clan gh d a superfamily of alpha galactosidases alpha n acetylgalactosaminidases and isomaltodextranases which are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism and structural topology alpha galactosidase melibiase catalyzes the hydrolysis of melibiose into galactose and glucose in man the deficiency of this enzyme is the cause of fabry s disease x linked sphingolipidosis alpha galactosidase is present in a variety of organisms there is a considerable degree of similarity in the sequence of alpha galactosidase from various eukaryotic species escherichia coli alpha galactosidase gene mela which requires nad and magnesium as cofactors is not structurally related to the eukaryotic enzymes by contrast an escherichia coli plasmid encoded alpha galactosidase gene rafa contains a region of about 50 amino acids which is similar to a domain of the eukaryotic alpha galactosidases alpha n acetylgalactosaminidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal non reducing n

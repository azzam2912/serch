svg is an open standard xml format for two dimensional vector graphics as defined by the world wide web consortium w3c a filter effect consists of a series of graphics operations that are applied to a given source vector graphic to produce a modified bitmapped result filter effects are defined by filter elements the property is set on a container element or on a graphics element to apply a filter effect to it each element contains a set of filter primitives as its children each filter primitive performs a single fundamental graphical operation e g a gaussian blur or a lighting effect on one or more inputs producing a graphical result because most of the filter primitives represent some form of image processing in most cases the output from a filter primitive is a single rgba bitmap image however it will be regenerated if a higher resolution is called on the original source graphic or the result from a filter primitive can be used as input into one or more other filter primitives a common application is to use the source graphic multiple times for example a simple filter could replace one graphic for two by adding a black copy

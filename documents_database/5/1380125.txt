take a graph g and let m and m be two matchings in g let g be the resultant graph from taking the symmetric difference of m and m i e m m m m g will consist of connected components that are one of the following the lemma can be proven by observing that each vertex in g can be incident to at most 2 edges one from m and one from m graphs where every vertex has degree less than or equal to 2 must consist of either isolated vertices cycles and paths furthermore each path and cycle in g must alternate between m and m in order for a cycle to do this it must have an equal number of edges from m and m and therefore be of even length let us now prove the contrapositive of berge s lemma g has a matching larger than m if and only if g has an augmenting path clearly an augmenting path p of g can be used to produce a matching m that is larger than m just take m to be the symmetric difference of p and m m contains exactly those edges of g that

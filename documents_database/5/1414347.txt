the company s powerbuoy technology is theoretically scalable to hundreds of megawatts and the generated energy from wave power can be supplied to the grid via submarine cables several projects were undertaken around the world but the economic viability of the theoretical concept has been problematic ocean power was involved in several large power buoy projects including a very large australian project with lockheed martin from 2012 2014 when they determined that the project wasn t commercially viable and the company changed its strategy it s still pursuing the technology but is now seeking to power remote sites such as offshore oil rigs ocean power technologies australasia pty ltd opta is an australian owned subsidiary of ocean power technologies inc opt previously engaged in wave power projects in australia ocean power technologies limited is the uk based wholly owned subsidiary the company s primary product is the powerbuoy wave generation system it uses a smart oceangoing buoy to capture and convert wave energy into low cost clean electricity the usp is an electrical power aggregator from up to ten offshore power generation devices be they wind wave power or other into one common interconnection point for transmission to the onshore

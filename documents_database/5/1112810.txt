two isomers are possible for this class of organosulfur compounds 1 2 dithietanes 4 membered rings where the two sulfur atoms are adjacent are very rare the first stable 1 2 dithietane to be reported was the so called dithiatopazine formed by intramolecular photodimerization of a dithiocarbonyl compound 1 2 dithietanes are to be distinguished from 1 2 dithietes containing two adjacent sulfur atoms and two sp hybridized carbon centers a stable 1 2 dithietane derivative is trans 3 4 diethyl 1 2 dithietane 1 1 dioxide formed by the spontaneous dimerization of the lachrymatory agent syn propanethial s oxide found in onion 1 3 dithietanes where the sulfur atoms are non adjacent 1 3 dithietane itself a colorless easily sublimed crystalline unpleasant smelling solid with mp 105 106 c was first prepared in 1976 by reaction of bis chloromethyl sulfoxide with sodium sulfide followed by thf borane reduction of the first formed 1 3 dithietane 1 oxide as shown in the scheme below carbon substituted 1 3 dithietanes are well known with the first examples being described as early as 1872 examples include 2 2 4 4 tetrachloro 1 3 dithietane the photochemically formed dimer of thiophosgene and tetrakis

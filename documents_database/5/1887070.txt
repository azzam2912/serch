passive addition implies that in steady state operation at a constant depth addition of fresh feed gas is a response to low volume of gas in the loop the gas is injected when the top of the counterlung activates a demand type addition valve which provides feed gas as long as the diver continues to inhale the mechanism discharges gas to the environment in proportion to breathing volume to induce this gas feed in the pvr basc the discharged gas volume is a function of depth and breath volume the passive addition occurs during each inhalation as the loop volume is deficient by the amount discharged the volumetric ratio of discharged gas to exhaled gas volume varies with depth and decreases as the pressure increases at the surface one quarter of the volume of an exhaled breath is discharged as the ambient pressure increases with depth the volume of the inner counterlumg is reduced and the reduced discharge both provides an oxygen addition more closely matched to usage and saves a considerable amount of gas gas is added to the loop after the scrubber and this means that the fresh gas is immediately available for breathing it also means that

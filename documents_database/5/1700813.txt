it has 62 faces 20 triangles 12 pentagrams and 30 squares 120 doubled edges and 20 vertices all edges are doubled making it degenerate sharing 4 faces but are considered as two overlapping edges as a topological polyhedron it can be constructed from the vertex figure 3 4 3 4 thus making it also a cantellated great icosahedron the 3 in front of this vertex figure indicates that each vertex in this degenerate polyhedron is in fact three coincident vertices it may also be given the schl fli symbol rr 5 2 3 or t 5 2 3 it can be seen as a compound of the small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron u and the compound of five cubes it is also a facetting of the dodecahedron it can also be seen as a cantellation of the great icosahedron or equivalently of the great stellated dodecahedron two other degenerate uniform polyhedra are also facettings of the dodecahedron they are the complex rhombidodecadodecahedron a compound of the ditrigonal dodecadodecahedron and the compound of five cubes with vertex figure 5 3 4 5 4 3 and the great complex rhombicosidodecahedron a compound of the great ditrigonal icosidodecahedron and the compound of five cubes with

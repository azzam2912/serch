proton pumps catalyze the following reaction mechanisms are based on energy induced conformational changes of the protein structure or on the q cycle during evolution proton pumps have arisen independently on multiple occasions thus not only throughout nature but also within single cells different proton pumps that are evolutionarily unrelated can be found proton pumps are divided into different major classes of pumps that utilize different sources of energy have different polypeptide compositions and evolutionary origins transport of the positively charged proton is typically electrogenic i e it generates an electrical field across the membrane also called the membrane potential proton transport becomes electrogenic if not neutralized electrically by transport of either a corresponding negative charge in the same direction or a corresponding positive charge in the opposite direction an example of a proton pump that is not electrogenic is the proton potassium pump of the gastric mucosa which catalyzes a balanced exchange of protons and potassium ions the combined transmembrane gradient of protons and charges created by proton pumps is called an electrochemical gradient an electrochemical gradient represents a store of energy potential energy that can be used to drive a multitude of biological processes such as atp synthesis

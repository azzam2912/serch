as a member of the russian academy of sciences he laid the foundation of the modern science of colloids and surfaces an epoch in the development of the physical chemistry of colloids and surfaces is associated with his name derjaguin became famous in scientific circles for his work on the stability of colloids and thin films of liquids which is now known as the dlvo theory after the initials of its authors derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek it is universally included in text books on colloid chemistry and is still widely applied in modern studies of interparticle forces in colloids in particular the derjaguin approximation is widely used in order to approximate the interaction between curved surfaces from a knowledge of the interaction for planar ones derjaguin was also briefly involved in polywater research during the 1960s and early 1970s this field claimed that if water was heated then cooled in quartz capillaries it took on astonishing new properties eventually the scientists who were involved in polywater admitted it did not exist claiming they were misled by poorly designed experiments derjaguin rejected polywater in 1973 he is also known for having hotly rejected some of the then new ideas of

a luxury tax may be modeled after a sales tax or vat charged as a percentage on all items of particular classes except that it mainly affects the wealthy because the wealthy are the most likely to buy luxuries such as expensive cars jewelry etc it may also be applied only to purchases over a certain amount for instance some u s states charge luxury tax on real estate transactions over a limit a luxury good may be a veblen good which is a type of good for which demand increases as price increases therefore the effect of a luxury tax may be to increase demand for certain luxury goods in general however since a luxury good has a high income elasticity of demand by definition both the income effect and substitution effect will decrease demand sharply as the tax rises luxury tax is based on the concept of positional goods which are scarce goods whose value arises as status symbols largely from their ranking against other positional goods this creates a zero sum game in which the absolute amount of goods purchased is less relevant than the absolute amount of money spent on them and their relative positions agents

the full title of the painting is the alchymist in search of the philosopher s stone discovers phosphorus and prays for the successful conclusion of his operation as was the custom of the ancient chymical astrologers it has been suggested that the alchymist refers to the discovery of phosphorus by the hamburg alchemist hennig brand in 1669 this story was often printed in popular chemical books in wright s lifetime and was widely known the picture shows the alchemist trying to produce the elusive philosopher s stone which could turn ordinary metal into gold but instead to his amazement he discovers phosphorus however wright does not picture the alchemist in a 17th century background but he romanticises the room by imagining medieval gothic arches and high pointed windows as if he is in a church he also gave a very favourable impression of the actual process which involves the reduction by boiling of urine a 1730 description of the manufacture of phosphorus described the need for 50 or 60 pails of urine that was both putrid and bred worms wright also gives religious connotations to the painting the alchemist kneels in front of a shining vessel stretching out his hands

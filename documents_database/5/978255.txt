it is produced by micromonospora rhodorangea g418 blocks polypeptide synthesis by inhibiting the elongation step in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells resistance to g418 is conferred by the neo gene from tn5 encoding an aminoglycoside 3 phosphotransferase apt 3 ii g418 is an analog of neomycin sulfate and has similar mechanism as neomycin g418 is commonly used in laboratory research to select genetically engineered cells typically using the kanmx selectable marker in general for bacteria and algae concentrations of 5 g ml or less are used for mammalian cells concentrations of approximately 400 g ml are used for selection and 200 g ml for maintenance however optimal concentration for resistant clones selection in mammalian cells depends on the cell line used as well as on the plasmid carrying the resistance gene therefore antibiotic titration should be done to find the best condition for every experimental system titration should be done using antibiotic concentrations ranging from 100 g ml up to 1400 g ml resistant clones selection could require from 1 to up to 3 weeks g418 is produced by fermentation and isolation processes and the g418 producing strain micromonospora rhodorangea produces many other gentamicins while producing g418 the common impurities

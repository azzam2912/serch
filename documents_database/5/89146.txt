rna silencing is often a function of these molecules with the most common and well studied example being rna interference rnai in which endogenously expressed microrna mirna or exogenously derived small interfering rna sirna induces the degradation of complementary messenger rna other classes of small rna have been identified including piwi interacting rna pirna and its subspecies repeat associated small interfering rna rasirna small rna is unable to induce rnai alone and to accomplish the task it must form the core of the rna protein complex termed the rna induced silencing complex risc specifically with argonaute protein also mrna is used in transcription small rna can be selected by microrna sequencing a technique that selects small rna molecules then sequences those of 21 25 bp size the first analysis of small rnas using mirna seq methods examined approximately 1 4 million small rnas from the model plant arabidopsis thaliana using lynx therapeutics massively parallel signature sequencing mpss sequencing platform this study demonstrated the potential of novel high throughput sequencing technologies for the study of small rnas and it showed that genomes generate large numbers of small rnas with plants as particularly rich sources of small rnas later studies used other

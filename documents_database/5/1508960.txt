the term has different meanings in different contexts in chemistry the term is largely obsolete but it often means iron cobalt and nickel also called the iron triad or sometimes other elements that resemble iron in some chemical aspects in astrophysics and nuclear physics the term is still quite common and it typically means those three plus chromium and manganese five elements that are exceptionally abundant both on earth and elsewhere in the universe compared to their neighbors in the periodic table in chemistry iron group used to refer to iron and the next two elements in the periodic table namely cobalt and nickel also called the iron triad those are the top elements of groups 8 9 and 10 of the periodic table or the top row of group viii in the old pre 1990 iupac system or of group viiib in the cas system these three metals and the three of the platinum group immediately below them were set aside from the other elements because they have obvious similarities in their chemistry but are not obviously related to any of the other groups the similarities in chemistry were noted by adolph strecker in 1859 indeed newlands octaves 1865

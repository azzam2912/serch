these approaches have attracted significant interest and investigation recently in the context of speech enhancement speech modeling and speech classification research the signal subspace is also used in radio direction finding using the music algorithm essentially the methods represent the application of a principal components analysis pca approach to ensembles of observed time series obtained by sampling for example sampling an audio signal such samples can be viewed as vectors in a high dimensional vector space over the real numbers pca is used to identify a set of orthogonal basis vectors basis signals which capture as much as possible of the energy in the ensemble of observed samples the vector space spanned by the basis vectors identified by the analysis is then the signal subspace the underlying assumption is that information in speech signals is almost completely contained in a small linear subspace of the overall space of possible sample vectors whereas additive noise is typically distributed through the larger space isotropically for example when it is white noise by projecting a sample on a signal subspace that is keeping only the component of the sample that is in the signal subspace defined by linear combinations of the first few

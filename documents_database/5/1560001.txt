the goal of creative playthings was to provide simple and beautifully designed toys to promote a child s creativity and imagination the original creative playthings store was located at 102 west 95th street in new york city which they eventually moved to madison avenue and 72nd street initially frank caplan made hardwood building blocks himself to sell in their store often cutting and sanding the sets while parents waited in the shop he then added animals people vehicles and other toys caplan believed that providing unpainted abstract forms that emphasized shape color and texture as opposed to lifelike details would stimulate a child s imagination in collaboration with martha new caplan also designed sets of large plain maple cubes that young children could rearrange into various forms and furniture known as hollow blocks these and other designs exemplified notions of unstructured play in which creative usage could be shaped by the individual child instead of determined by the manufacturer as caplan wrote in the first creative playthings catalogue in 1949 play has a basic role in the drama of a child s development it is a serious business for the child his true means of learning and growing every child

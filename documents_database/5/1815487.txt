it uses the same 8p8c modular connector used by conventional ethernet over twisted pair the physical layers used for ethernet over copper are 2base tl and 10pass ts while the connection on an ethernet over copper cable is similar to that of a conventional ethernet cable the physical layers used for ethernet over copper are different from the physical layers used for conventional ethernet so special adapters are required for ethernet over copper the ethernet over copper connection cannot be plugged into a conventional ethernet port on a switch router or computer eoc is usually delivered as an internet facing service eoc can also be delivered other ways it can interface with private networking i e an existing wan mpls or vpn network can also support sip pri analog and hosted pbx voice services as well as ethernet over copper cabling is made up of twisted telephone wire it is affordable this consistency of ethernet between the service provider core and the customer network reduces overhead increasing performance providing a more consistent connection to the user as with dsl distance is a factor the further you are from the central office the less speed you can receive additionally central offices

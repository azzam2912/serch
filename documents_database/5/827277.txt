the target for the reaction was 50 57 tonnes of liquid gallium metal stored deep 2100 meters underground at the baksan neutrino observatory in the caucasus mountains in russia the laboratory containing the sage experiment is called gallium germanium neutrino telescope ggnt laboratory ggnt being the name of the sage experimental apparatus about once a month the neutrino induced ge is extracted from the ga ge is unstable with respect to electron capture formula 2 days and therefore the amount of extracted germanium can be determined from its activity as measured in small proportional counters the experiment had begun to measure the solar neutrino capture rate with a target of gallium metal in december 1989 and continued to run in august 2011 with only a few brief interruptions in the timespan as of 2013 is the experiment was described as being continued with the latest published data from august 2011 as of 2014 it was stated that the sage experiment continues the once a month extractions the sage experiment continued in 2016 as of 2017 the sage experiment continues the experiment has measured the solar neutrino flux in 168 extractions between january 1990 and december 2007 the result of the

he left high school to join the united states air force as a musician for their military band he was stationed in texas and then montana where the long winters left him ample time to practice when the band s usual string bass player was unavailable for a gig in 1951 the bandmaster asked lamb if he could play the bass lamb immediately said yes and before long became the band s new string bassist he credited his tuba experience for giving him the feel to pick up string bass quickly without any prior experience lamb joined duke ellington s orchestra in 1964 and toured with them for three years lamb was more of a fan of miles davis and red garland when he was with ellington later saying i was very young and very cocky i thought i knew more than duke at that time i have more time today to reflect on the things that were accomplished back then and the places we traveled to and all the wonderful people that we met so one has to be careful what one does in his young years because if they re fortunate to live long it all comes back

there are two common types of motor capacitors run capacitors and start capacitors the units of capacitance are labeled in microfarads f older capacitors may be labeled with the obsolete terms mfd or mfd which can be ambiguous but are especially in this context used for microfarad as well a millifarad is 1000 microfarad and not usually seen on motors motor capacitors are used with air conditioners hot tub jacuzzi spa pumps powered gates large fans or forced air heat furnaces for example a dual run capacitor is used in some air conditioner compressor units to boost both the fan and compressor motors start capacitors briefly increase motor starting torque and allow a motor to be cycled on and off rapidly a start capacitor stays in the circuit long enough to rapidly bring the motor up to a predetermined speed which is usually about 75 of the full speed and is then taken out of the circuit often by a centrifugal switch that releases at that speed afterward the motor works more efficiently with a run capacitor start capacitors have ratings above 70 f with four major voltage classifications 125 v 165 v 250 v and 330 v examples of

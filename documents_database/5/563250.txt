such models cannot simulate the heat take up that occurs in the real ocean and were thus unable to run transient simulations instead the response to equilibrium change was investigated there are problems with this approach which were well appreciated at the time the deep ocean has a very long time constant and in some areas most notably the southern ocean the transient and equilibrium responses are very different in an equilibrium simulation time is merely a label and a given year or decade does not represent the simulation of a calendar year or decade if the simulation is partly of the past observed levels may be used and perhaps solar variation and volcanic forcing the transient simulation is intended to be a physically plausible path for the climate system to follow although given natural variability even a perfect model would not simulate the year to year variations seen in the real world in an ideal model the variation from decade to decade would track that of the real world related websites

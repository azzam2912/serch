upon activation by il 4 th2 cells subsequently produce additional il 4 in a positive feedback loop the cell that initially produces il 4 thus inducing th2 differentiation has not been identified but recent studies suggest that basophils may be the effector cell it is closely related and has functions similar to interleukin 13 interleukin 4 has many biological roles including the stimulation of activated b cell and t cell proliferation and the differentiation of b cells into plasma cells it is a key regulator in humoral and adaptive immunity il 4 induces b cell class switching to ige and up regulates mhc class ii production il 4 decreases the production of th1 cells macrophages ifn gamma and dendritic cell il 12 overproduction of il 4 is associated with allergies tissue macrophages play an important role in chronic inflammation and wound repair the presence of il 4 in extravascular tissues promotes alternative activation of macrophages into m2 cells and inhibits classical activation of macrophages into m1 cells an increase in repair macrophages m2 is coupled with secretion of il 10 and tgf that result in a diminution of pathological inflammation release of arginase proline polyaminases and tgf by the activated

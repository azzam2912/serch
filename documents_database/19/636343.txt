according to epics all the rishis paid homage to both shiva and parvati consort of shiva but bhringi would not worship parvati and dedicated himself solely to shiva the story goes that bhringi one day came to mount kailash the abode of shiva and expressed his desire to go around shiva as he was going around shiva s consort shakti said you cannot just go around him you have to go around me too we are two halves of the same truth bhringi however was so focussed on shiva that he had no desire to go around shakti seeing this shakti sat on shiva s lap making it difficult for bhringi to go around shiva alone bhringi determined to go around shiva took the form of a bhring black bee and tried to slip in between the two amused by this shiva made shakti one half of his body the famous ardhanarishvara form of shiva this was god whose one half is the goddess but bhringi was adamant he would go around shiva alone so he took the form of a rat some say a bee and tried to gnaw his way between the two this annoyed the goddess so

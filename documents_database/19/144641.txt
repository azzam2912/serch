the problem is to find the hamiltonian cycle in a weighted graph which minimizes the weight of the most weighty edge of the cycle it was first formulated by with some additional constraints and in its full generality by the problem is known to be np hard the decision problem version of this for a given length is there a hamiltonian cycle in a graph with no edge longer than is np complete np completeness follows immediately by a reduction from the problem of finding a hamiltonian cycle another reduction from the bottleneck tsp to the usual tsp where the goal is to minimize the sum of edge lengths allows any algorithm for the usual tsp to also be used to solve the bottleneck tsp if the edge weights of the bottleneck tsp are replaced by any other numbers that have the same relative order then the bottleneck solution remains unchanged if in addition each number in the sequence exceeds the sum of all smaller numbers then the bottleneck solution will also equal the usual tsp solution for instance such a result may be attained by resetting each weight to where is the number of vertices in the graph and

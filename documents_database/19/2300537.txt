it extends across cascadia abyssal plain through the blanco fracture zone and into tufts abyssal plain notably cascadia channel has tributaries akin to river tributaries cascadia channel has two contributing tributaries juan de fuca channel from the north and the outflow of quinault and willapa channels in the south headed north south cascadia channel initially formed on the eastern flank of the juan de fuca ridge which was actively spreading in the late cenozoic the volcanic basement was covered by transparent pelagic and hemipelagic sediment which horizontally deposited turbidites covered during late pleistocene glaciation and the lowering of sea level much sand and gravel from the shore deposited on either the upper slope or the outer shelf which initiated turbidity currents converting the lower and middle portions of the channel into erosional features this led to the initiation of downcutting at this time apparently the channel built up by turbidity current that proceeded south along the western part of the cascadia abyssal plain also from the west of the astoria fan during the holocene turbidity current from the columbia river sediment continued to flow both down the cascade channel and the blanco fracture zone the channel is believed to be

fam46c was initially sequenced as part of the full length long japan genomic sequencing project fam46c is found on chromosome 1 at the locus 1p12 fam46c contains one domain of unknown function duf1693 and as such has been placed in the duf1693 protein family this protein family has been established as a part of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily and contains 4 nematode prion like proteins fam46c was placed into group xxv of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily along with 3 other homo sapiens fam46 proteins a b d it has been suggested that fam46c may be functionally involved with the type 1 interferon response deletion and or mutation of fam46c has been associated with impaired overall survival in myeloma patients homo sapiens fam46c spans 22 456 bases on chromosome 1 microarray data suggests that human fam46c displays elevated expression levels in bone marrow cd71 early erythroid various b cells t cells and lymphocytes as well as all tissues associated with testes homo sapiens fam46c is highly conserved in close orthologs with only small changes in protein aa sequence when comparing to other mammals fam46c and specifically the duf1693 is traceable throughout the known metazoans with a distant homolog found in trichoplax adhaerens a

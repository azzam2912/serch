it is a two port electronic circuit that uses electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude of a signal applied to its input terminals producing a proportionally greater amplitude signal at its output the amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by its gain the ratio of output voltage current or power to input an amplifier is a circuit that has a power gain greater than one an amplifier can either be a separate piece of equipment or an electrical circuit contained within another device amplification is fundamental to modern electronics and amplifiers are widely used in almost all electronic equipment amplifiers can be categorized in different ways one is by the frequency of the electronic signal being amplified for example audio amplifiers amplify signals in the audio sound range of less than 20 khz rf amplifiers amplify frequencies in the radio frequency range between 20 khz and 300 ghz and servo amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers may work with very low frequencies down to direct current amplifiers can also be categorized by their physical placement in the signal chain a preamplifier may precede other signal processing stages for example the first practical electrical device which

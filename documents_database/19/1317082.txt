it was first marketed by sch rfe system gmbh in 1987 under the name casy1 the first systems were sold with an atari computer and a rectangular chassis in the 1990s the atari computer got replaced by a common pc and the chassis changed into cylinders in 2006 sch rfe system was acquired by innovatis ag a company focused on cell culture analysis casy utilizes the techniques of electric current exclusion and pulse area analysis the cells can be analyzed and counted in an efficient and precise manner this technology can be applied for cell counting cell culture analysis at a certain time interval or even a period of time cell viability can be assessed based on the integrity of plasma membrane the living cells have intact plasma membranes whereas membranes of dead cells are broken when a cell is exposed to a low voltage field the electric current cannot go through the intact membrane which is an electric insulator if it is viable otherwise as the cellular membrane is broken electric field can go through the injured cell as there are pores on their membrane for a normal cell its size cannot be smaller than its nuclear size which

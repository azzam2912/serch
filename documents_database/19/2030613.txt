this is a fairly new phenomenon after 2013 as all early orbital launch vehicle stages were expended with booster stages returning through the atmosphere to certain destruction on contact with either land or sea since that time two private companies are developing reusable launch vehicle technology and using or planning to use floating landing platforms after attempts to land orbital rocket booster stages by parachute failed in the late 2000s spacex began to develop reusable technology in the early 2010s by mid decade blue origin was following with a commitment to land the booster of a large launch vehicle on a moving ship in the 2010s space exploration technologies spacex contracted with a louisiana shipyard to build a floating landing platform for reusable orbital launch vehicles the platform had an approximately landing pad surface and was capable of precision positioning with diesel powered azimuth thrusters so the platform can hold its position for launch vehicle landing this platform was first deployed in january 2015 when spacex attempted a controlled descent flight test to land the first stage of falcon 9 flight 14 on a solid surface after it was used to loft a contracted payload toward earth orbit the platform

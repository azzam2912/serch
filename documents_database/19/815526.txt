by withdrawing a small diameter core of rock from the orebody geologists can analyse the core by chemical assay and conduct petrologic structural and mineralogical studies of the rock rodolphe leschot is often cited as being the inventor of the first core bit in 1863 early diamond drilling opened up many new areas for mineral mining and was related to a boom in mineral exploration in remote locations before the invention of the portable diamond drill most mineral prospecting was limited to finding outcrops at the surface and hand digging in the late 1970s general electric pioneered the technology of polycrystalline diamond compacts pdcs as a replacement for natural diamonds in drill bits exploration diamond drilling differs from other geological drilling see drilling rig in that a solid core is extracted from depth for examination on the surface the key technology of the diamond drill is the actual diamond bit itself it is composed of industrial diamonds set into a soft metallic matrix as shown in the figure the diamonds are scattered throughout the matrix and the action relies on the matrix to slowly wear during the drilling so as to expose more diamonds the bit is mounted onto a

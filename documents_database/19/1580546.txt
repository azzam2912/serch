it is the time reversed counterpart of a laser the concept was first published in the july 26 2010 issue of physical review letters by a team at yale university led by theorist douglas stone in the september 9 2010 issue of physical review a stefano longhi of polytechnic university of milan showed how to combine a laser and an anti laser in a single device in february 2011 the team at yale built the first working anti laser it is a two channel cpa device which absorbs the output of two lasers but only when the beams have the correct phases and amplitudes the initial device absorbed 99 4 percent of all incoming light but the team behind the invention believe it will be possible to achieve 99 999 percent originally with the fp cavity the optical cpa operates to a specific frequency and the wavelength thick material in january 2012 thin film cpa has been proposed by utilizing the achromatic dispersion of metal exhibiting the unparalleled bandwidth and thin profile advantages this theoretical evaluation was experimentally demonstrated in 2014 identical lasers are fired into a cavity containing a silicon wafer a light absorbing material that acts as a

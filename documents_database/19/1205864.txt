it is a colourless liquid that is used as a specialty solvent a base and as a precursor to some ionic liquids it is a fundamental nitrogen heterocycle and as such mimics for various nucleoside bases as well as histidine and histamine with the n methyl group this particular derivative of imidazole cannot tautomerize it is slightly more basic than imidazole as indicated by the pka s of the conjugate acids of 7 0 and 7 4 methylation also provides a significantly lower melting point which makes 1 methylimidazole a useful solvent 1 methylimidazole is prepared mainly by two routes industrially the main one is acid catalysed methylation of imidazole by methanol the second method involves the radziszewski reaction from glyoxal formaldehyde and a mixture of ammonia and methylamine the compound can be synthesized on a laboratory scale by methylation of imidazole at the pyridine like nitrogen and subsequent deprotonation similarly 1 methylimidazole may be synthesized by first deprotonating imidazole to form a sodium salt followed by methylation in the research laboratory 1 methylimidazole and related derivatives have been used as mimic aspects of diverse imidazole based biomolecules 1 methylimidazole is also the precursor for the synthesis of the methylimidazole

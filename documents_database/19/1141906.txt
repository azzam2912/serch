the name is used for a variety of different groups of nematodes some of which also have other common names what they have in common is that they migrate to their hosts lungs or respiratory tracts and cause bronchitis or pneumonia the lungworm will gradually damage the airways or lung tissue by inciting an inflammatory reaction inside the tissue ultimately the parasites survive and reproduce in the respiratory tissues the category is thus more a descriptive than a precisely taxonomic one the most common lungworms belong to one of two groups the superfamily trichostrongyloidea or the superfamily metastrongyloidea but not all the species in these superfamilies are lungworms the lungworms in the superfamily trichostrongyloidea include several species in the genus dictyocaulus which infest hoofed animals including most common domestic species different species are found in cattle and deer d viviparus donkeys and horses d arnfeldi and sheep and goats d filaria these animals have direct life cycles the lungworms in the superfamily metastrongyloidea include species that infest a wider range of mammals including sheep goats and pigs but also cats and dogs these include metastrongylus elongatus apri found in pigs oslerus osleri found in dogs and aelurostrongylus abstrusus found in

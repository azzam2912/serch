quadratic variation is just one kind of variation of a process suppose that x is a real valued stochastic process defined on a probability space formula 1 and with time index t ranging over the non negative real numbers its quadratic variation is the process written as x defined as where p ranges over partitions of the interval 0 t and the norm of the partition p is the mesh this limit if it exists is defined using convergence in probability note that a process may be of finite quadratic variation in the sense of the definition given here and its paths be nonetheless almost surely of infinite 2 variation for every t 0 in the classical sense of taking the supremum of the sum over all partitions this is in particular the case for brownian motion more generally the covariation or cross variance of two processes x and y is the covariation may be written in terms of the quadratic variation by the polarization identity a process x is said to have finite variation if it has bounded variation over every finite time interval with probability 1 such processes are very common including in particular all continuously differentiable functions

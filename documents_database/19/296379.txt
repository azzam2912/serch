in plan the blocks look like two hollow squares joined at one corner of each square each block comprises two towers of different heights although their shapes are the same the flat sizes in these 20 to 23 storey towers range from 36 to 46 m the units in twin tower blocks are self contained flats each with a kitchen toilet and balcony the first twin tower blocks appeared at wah fu estate they were suited to the steeply sloping site as one of the two towers within each block is offset by three storeys from the other providing ground level entrances at multiple points along the slope the two central atria in each block measure 50 by 50 feet reportedly the square shape of the twin tower design provided the structural stability necessary to build more floors than the earlier narrower slab blocks the twin tower blocks at wah fu make use of load bearing partition walls which make construction faster through standardisation obviate the need for interior columns within flats and improve structural wind resistance after their introduction at wah fu estate the twin tower design appeared at oi man estate and then many other public estates across

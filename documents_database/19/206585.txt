they are white solids with the formula chs for the parent pt the rings are linked through the 2 and 5 positions poly alkylthiophene s have substituents at the 3 or 4 position they are also white solids but tend to be soluble in organic solvents pts become conductive when oxidized the electrical conductivity results from the delocalization of electrons along the polymer backbone conductivity however is not the only interesting property resulting from electron delocalization the optical properties of these materials respond to environmental stimuli with dramatic color shifts in response to changes in solvent temperature applied potential and binding to other molecules changes in both color and conductivity are induced by the same mechanism twisting of the polymer backbone and disrupting conjugation making conjugated polymers attractive as sensors that can provide a range of optical and electronic responses the development of polythiophenes and related conductive organic polymers was recognized by the awarding of the 2000 nobel prize in chemistry to alan j heeger alan macdiarmid and hideki shirakawa for the discovery and development of conductive polymers pt is an ordinary organic polymer being a white solid that is poorly soluble in most solvents upon treatment with oxidizing agents

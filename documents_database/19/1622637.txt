liquids and amorphous solids do however possess a rich and varied array of short to medium range order which originates from chemical bonding and related interactions metallic glasses for example are typically well described by the dense random packing of hard spheres whereas covalent systems such as silicate glasses have sparsely packed strongly bound tetrahedral network structures these very different structures result in materials with very different physical properties and applications the study of liquid and glass structure aims to gain insight into their behavior and physical properties so that they can be understood predicted and tailored for specific applications since the structure and resulting behavior of liquids and glasses is a complex many body problem historically it has been too computationally intensive to solve using quantum mechanics directly instead a variety of diffraction nmr molecular dynamics and monte carlo simulation techniques are most commonly used the pair distribution function or pair correlation function of a material describes the probability of finding an atom at a separation r from another atom a typical plot of g versus r of a liquid or glass shows a number of key features the static structure factor s q which can be measured with

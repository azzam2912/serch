heng shan in shanxi province is sometimes known as the northern heng shan and the one in hunan province as southern heng shan both mountains have the same pronunciation in chinese and the southern heng shan is also one of the five sacred mountains like the other mountains in china with strong taoist presence heng shan has been considered a sacred mountain since the zhou dynasty due to its northerly location often under control of non chinese nations the mountain has a weaker history of pilgrimage than its four fellows indeed to this day it is the least visited and least developed of the five also the smallest in area because of this hengshan is not nearly as religiously important in china as the other taoist mountains but as a further consequence it is also less commercialized there are no hotels on the mountain for instance the main peak is a lovely hike of around three hours round trip from the parking lot a few miles up the mountain from where you buy the ticket with the summit covered in fragrant lilac blossoms in june and temples set into the cliffs the slopes are largely covered with hemlocks pines elm

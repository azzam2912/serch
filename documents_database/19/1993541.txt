it is a static version of volumetric display volumetric prints are auto stereoscopic full parallax in both horizontal and vertical viewing arrangements and can be viewed by multiple viewers in regular room lighting a volumetric print can be thought of as a reconstructed light field based on the scattering of light by distributed pigments in volume any three dimensional scene can be volumetrically printed although biological specimens and volumetrically x rayed objects i e ct scans are thought to be particularly well suited to this type of imaging there are several methods for producing a volumetric print the most common being an index matched stack of hundreds of sheets of thin clear material most often pmma also known as lucite or acrylic each sheet in the volumetric stack is printed with a color slice of a digital 3d model placed in a vacuum chamber and then injected with a fluid matching the index of refraction of the sheet material volumetric printing has been called hologram 2 0 by a company marketing the technology volumetric prints however are not produced in the same manner as holograms in that there is no interference pattern generated or used in basic volumetric prints

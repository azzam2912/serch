erosion has played a major role in yemen s geologic history and eliminated many rock units over time schist formations cut by intrusions of precambrian granite outcrop in the center north and northwest these formations show evidence of intense folding and regional metamorphism much of yemen was converted to a peneplain during a long period of erosion in the precambrian dark shales show some signs of folding and the presence of marine rocks indicates a marine transgression in the cambrian through the silurian however little is known about the paleozoic due to widespread erosion which eliminated almost all rocks from the time leached quartz soil developed the wajid sandstone is the redeposited remains of the peneplain ground surface which formed a delta and dunes in the permian basins formed in yemen during a warm period in the mesozoic depositing dark gray and gray black shales of the kohlan series at the bottom of large lakes gypsum lenses formed in isolated bays around the same period during the malm a major marine transgression flooded much of the region depositing the calcareous amran series northwest of san a bathonian and callovian carbonates lie atop the kohlan series in a depression to the

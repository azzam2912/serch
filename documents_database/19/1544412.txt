although the exchange energy becomes elusive at large internuclear systems it is of prominent importance in theories of molecular binding and magnetism this splitting results from the symmetry under exchange of identical nuclei pauli exclusion principle the basic idea pioneered by holstein and herring approach can be illustrated for the hydrogen molecular ion or more generally atom ion systems or one active electron systems as follows we consider states that are represented by even or odd functions with respect to behavior under space inversion this is denoted with the suffixes g and u from the german gerade and ungerade and are standard practice for the designation of electronic states of diatomic molecules whereas for atomic states the terms even and odd are used the electronic time independent schr dinger equation can be written as where e is the electronic energy of a given quantum mechanical state eigenstate with the electronic state function formula 2 depending on the spatial coordinates of the electron and where formula 3 is the electron nuclear coulomb potential energy function for the hydrogen molecular ion this is for any gerade or even state the electronic schr dinger wave equation can be written in atomic units formula

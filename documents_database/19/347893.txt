the hadwiger number is also known as the contraction clique number of g or the homomorphism degree of g it is named after hugo hadwiger who introduced it in 1943 in conjunction with the hadwiger conjecture which states that the hadwiger number is always at least as large as the chromatic number of g the graphs that have hadwiger number at most four have been characterized by the graphs with any finite bound on the hadwiger number are sparse and have small chromatic number determining the hadwiger number of a graph is np hard but fixed parameter tractable a graph g has hadwiger number at most two if and only if it is a forest for a three vertex complete minor can only be formed by contracting a cycle in g a graph has hadwiger number at most three if and only if its treewidth is at most two which is true if and only if each of its biconnected components is a series parallel graph wagner s theorem which characterizes the planar graphs by their forbidden minors implies that the planar graphs have hadwiger number at most four in the same paper that proved this theorem also characterized the

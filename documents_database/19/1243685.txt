it is named in analogy with bpp which is similar but has no logarithmic space restriction the probabilistic turing machines in the definition of bpl may only accept or reject incorrectly less than 1 3 of the time this is called two sided error the constant 1 3 is arbitrary any x with 0 x rl and its complement co rl are contained in bpl bpl is also contained in pl which is similar except that the error bound is 1 2 instead of a constant less than 1 2 like the class pp the class pl is less practical because it may require a large number of rounds to reduce the error probability to a small constant bpl is contained in nc and in dspace log n and in l poly

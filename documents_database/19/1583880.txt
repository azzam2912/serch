the incumbent state government at that time was a spd majority government led by johannes rau that tried to defend its majority after 15 years in power the main opposition was the cdu led by helmut linssen since 1990 the election took place several months after helmut kohl was sworn in as chancellor of germany for the fifth time after his cdu csu fdp coalition government defended its majority in the 1994 federal election thus this state election had the potential to result in possible alternative coalitions which could be a useful model for the forming of the next federal government as a result of this state election the spd government lost its majority in the landtag so that it had to form a coalition with the greens who doubled their share of votes and seats compared to 1990 despite maintaining its share of votes the cdu was far away of forming a government as its most probable coalition partner the fdp failed to surpass the 5 threshold needed to gain seats in the landtag beside the influence of national politics where people s support for the kohl government slowly began to drop as a result of growing economic problems

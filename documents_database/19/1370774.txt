the s variants are identical except they had triple the frame rate and a larger buffer its unique optical system bundles the light of the full frame lenses to the small 2 3 inch ccd sensor that gives approximately 4 stops more light at the small sensor therefore delivering an exceptional for that time minimum sensitivity of 800 and maximum 3200 iso which remains usable for press and news use the nikon e2 e2s and e2n e2ns use a nikon f4 subsystem the e3 e3s uses a nikon f100 subsystem the e series uses a unique additional optical system that enables the small sensor to capture the field of view of a 35mm film with a crop factor of 1 this comes not at the expense of the lightness of the lenses because the light is bundled to the inch ccd sensor with approximately smaller area the result is approximately 4 stops 2 16 more light at the small sensor compared to a full frame sensor therefore the camera has a minimum full frame sensitivity of iso 800 which is equivalent to iso 50 at inch as a result the noise of the camera at iso 800 full frame is

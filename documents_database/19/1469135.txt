it can be used to study topics such as ozone depletion and tropospheric pollution and was one of the models used the ipcc report on aviation and the global atmosphere it incorporates a choice of detailed chemistry schemes for the troposphere or stratosphere and an optional chemical data assimilation scheme the original model code called the toulouse off line model of chemistry and transport tomcat was written by martyn chipperfield at m t o france off line in this sense describes the fact that although the meteorological data wind components and other fields which are used as input to the ctm typically derive from a general circulation model gcm the ctm is run as a separate program outside of a gcm this is as distinct from a chemistry simulation scheme which runs within a gcm in which the simulated chemical distributions e g of ozone can provide feedback on the meteorology via the gcm s radiation scheme a version called the single layer isentropic model of chemistry and transport slimcat was developed in 1995 this used a level of constant potential temperature or equivalently of constant specific entropy hence isentropic exploiting the fact that due to approximate conservation of energy

microbesonline was developed by the virtual institute for microbial stress and survival which is based at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in berkeley california the site was launched in 2005 with regular updates until 2011 the main aim of microbesonline is to provide an easy to use resource that integrates a wealth of data from multiple sources this integrated platform facilitates studies in comparative genomics metabolic pathway analysis genome composition functional genomics as well as in protein domain and family data it also provides tools to search or browse the database with genes species sequences orthologous groups gene ontology go terms or pathway keywords etc another one of its main features is the gene cart which allows users to keep a record of their genes of interest one of the highlights of the database is the overall navigation accessibility and interconnection between the tools the development of high throughput methods for genome sequencing has brought about a wealth of data that requires sophisticated bioinformatics tools for their analysis and interpretation nowadays numerous tools exist to study genomics sequence data and extract information from different perspectives however the lack of unification of nomenclature and standardised protocols between tools makes direct comparison

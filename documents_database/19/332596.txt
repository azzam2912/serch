this overlap leads to the formation of a bonding molecular orbital with two nodal planes which contain the internuclear axis and go through both atoms the greek letter in their name refers to d orbitals since the orbital symmetry of the bond is the same as that of the usual 4 lobed type of d orbital when seen down the bond axis this type of bonding is observed in atoms that have occupied d orbitals with low enough energy to participate in covalent bonding for example in organometallic species of transition metals some rhenium molybdenum and chromium compounds contain a quadruple bond consisting of one bond two bonds and one bond the orbital symmetry of the bonding orbital is different from that of a antibonding orbital which has one nodal plane containing the internuclear axis and a second nodal plane perpendicular to this axis between the atoms the notation was introduced by robert mulliken in 1931 the first compound identified as having a bond was potassium octachlorodirhenate iii in 1965 f a cotton reported that there was bonding as part of the rhenium rhenium quadruple bond in the recl ion another interesting example of a bond is proposed in cyclobutadieneiron

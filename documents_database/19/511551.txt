hydathodes occur in the leaves of submerged aquatic plants such as ranunculus fluitans as well as herbaceous plants of drier habitats such as campanula rotundifolia they are connected to the plant vascular system by a vascular bundle hydathodes are commonly seen in water lettuce water hyacinth rose balsam and many other species hydathodes are made of a group of living cells with numerous intercellular spaces filled with water but few or no chloroplasts and represent modified bundle ends these cells called epithem cells open out into one or more sub epidermal chambers these in turn communicate with the exterior through an open water stoma or open pore the water stoma structurally resembles an ordinary stoma but is usually larger and has lost the power of movement hydathodes are involved in the process of guttation in which positive xylem pressure due to root pressure causes liquid to exude from the pores some halophytes possess glandular trichomes that actively secrete salt in order to reduce the concentration of cytotoxic inorganic ions in their cytoplasm this may lead to the formation of a white powdery substance on the surface of the leaf hydathodes are of two types

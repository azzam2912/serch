teitelbaum was one of the original programmers for the eniac computer teitelbaum graduated from hunter college with a b sc in mathematics she was hired by the moore school of electrical engineering at the university of pennsylvania to compute ballistics trajectories the moore school was funded by the us army during the second world war here a group of about 80 women worked manually calculating ballistic trajectories complex differential calculations these women were called computers in june 1943 the army decided to fund an experimental project the first all electronic digital computer and six of the women computers were selected to be its first programmers teitelbaum was among these six teitelbaum was selected as one of a group of seven women to be the first programmers of the eniac which was the first all electronic programmable computer the computer was a huge machine with 40 black 8 foot panels the programmers had to physically program it using 3000 switches and telephone switching cords in a dozen trays to route the data and the program through the machine along with marlyn meltzer teitelbaum was part of a special area of the eniac project using analog technology they calculated ballistic trajectory equations

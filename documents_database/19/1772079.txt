related regions are found also in archaeal and eukaryotic proteins they have sizes that vary considerably from 311 residues for the methanococcus thermoautotrophicum protein 463 residues for a synechocystis homologue and 513 residues for the human homologue slc41a1 these proteins are capable of transporting mg and co but not ni multiple alignments contain two highly conserved aspartates that may be involved in cation binding human transporters from this family are slc41a1 slc41a2 and slc41a3 the bacillus firmus transporter and several homologues examined have strongly charged hydrophilic n terminal domains cytoplasmic followed by a hydrophobic c terminal domain with 5 putative transmembrane helical spanners a central 100 residues resembles archaeal inositol monophosphate dehydrogenases kehres and maguire suggest that the mgte proteins are secondary carriers with inwardly directed polarity hattori et al have considered mgte to function by a channel mechanism providing evidence that the mgte cytosolic domain acts as a mg sensor to regulate gating of the pore in response to the intracellular mg concentration this produces a mechanism for the maintenance of homeostasis conditions the cytosolic domain of mgte undergoes a mg dependent structural change which may gate the ion conducting pore passing through the transmembrane domain maruyama et al

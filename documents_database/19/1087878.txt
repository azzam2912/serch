some users also report the drug is extremely painful to insufflate ethylphenidate metabolizes into methylphenidate and ritalinic acid tiny amounts of ethylphenidate can be formed in vivo when alcohol also known formally as ethanol and methylphenidate are coingested via hepatic transesterification ethylphenidate formation appears to be more common when large quantities of methylphenidate and alcohol are consumed at the same time such as in non medical use or overdose scenarios however the transesterfication process of methylphenidate to ethylphenidate as tested in mice liver was dominant in the inactive enantiomer but showed a prolonged and increased maximal plasma concentration of the active enantiomer of methylphenidate additionally only a few percent of the consumed methylphenidate is converted to ethylphenidate this carboxylesterase dependent transesterification process is also known to occur when cocaine and alcohol are consumed together forming cocaethylene all available data on ethylphenidate s pharmacokinetics are drawn from studies conducted on rodents ethylphenidate is more selective to the dopamine transporter dat than methylphenidate having approximately the same efficacy as the parent compound but has significantly less activity on the norepinephrine transporter net its dopaminergic pharmacodynamic profile is nearly identical to methylphenidate and is primarily responsible for its euphoric and reinforcing effects the

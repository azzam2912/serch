it is the intersection of a sphere with a cylinder that is tangent to the sphere and passes through the center of the sphere see diagram before viviani this curve was studied by simon de la loub re and gilles de roberval the projection of viviani s curve onto a plane perpendicular to the line through the crossing point and the sphere center is the lemniscate of gerono in 1692 viviani tackled the task cut out of a half sphere radius formula 1 two windows such that the remaining surface of the half sphere can be squared i e a square with the same area can be constructed using only compasses and ruler his solution has an area of formula 2 see below in order to keep the proof for squaring simple and the cylinder has radius formula 5 and is tangent to the sphere at point formula 6 elimination of formula 7 formula 8 formula 9 respectively yields the orthogonal projection of the intersection curve onto the representing the sphere by and setting formula 20 yields the curve one easily checks that the spherical curve fulfills the equation of the cylinder but the boundaries allow only the red part

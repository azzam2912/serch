there are two stable isotopes cl 75 77 and cl 24 23 giving chlorine a standard atomic weight of 35 45 the longest lived radioactive isotope is cl which has a half life of 301 000 years all other isotopes have half lives under 1 hour many less than one second the shortest lived are cl and cl with half lives less than 10 picoseconds and 30 nanoseconds respectively the half life of cl is unknown trace amounts of radioactive cl exist in the environment in a ratio of about 7 10 to 1 with stable isotopes cl is produced in the atmosphere by spallation of ar by interactions with cosmic ray protons in the subsurface environment cl is generated primarily as a result of neutron capture by cl or muon capture by ca cl decays to either s 1 9 or to ar 98 1 with a combined half life of 308 000 years the half life of this hydrophilic nonreactive isotope makes it suitable for geologic dating in the range of 60 000 to 1 million years additionally large amounts of cl were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of nuclear weapons between 1952 and 1958

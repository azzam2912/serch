an internal set h of internal cardinality g n the hypernaturals is hyperfinite if and only if there exists an internal bijection between g 1 2 3 g and h hyperfinite sets share the properties of finite sets a hyperfinite set has minimal and maximal elements and a hyperfinite union of a hyperfinite collection of hyperfinite sets may be derived the sum of the elements of any hyperfinite subset of r always exists leading to the possibility of well defined integration hyperfinite sets can be used to approximate other sets if a hyperfinite set approximates an interval it is called a near interval with respect to that interval consider a hyperfinite set formula 1 with a hypernatural n k is a near interval for a b if k a and k b and if the difference between successive elements of k is infinitesimal phrased otherwise the requirement is that for every r a b there is a k k such that k r this for example allows for an approximation to the unit circle considered as the set formula 2 for in the interval 0 2 in general subsets of hyperfinite sets are not hyperfinite often because they do not

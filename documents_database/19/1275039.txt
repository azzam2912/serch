it is a drug used to treat symptomatic hypercalcemia secondary to cancer it works by preventing the breakdown of bone through the inhibition of osteoclast activity thus lowering the amount of free calcium in the blood gallium nitrate is also used to synthesize other gallium compounds gallium ga was discovered in 1875 by p lecoq de boisbaudran in most of its compounds gallium is found with an oxidation number of 3 gallium chemically behaves similarly to iron 3 when forming a coordination complex that means gallium iii and iron iii are similar in similar coordination number electrical charge ion diameter and electron configuration gallium atoms are bound to the phosphates of dna at low gallium concentrations forming a stable complex gallium competes with magnesium in dna binding since its dna affinity is 100 times higher than that of magnesium no interactions have been found between the metal and dna bases according to hedley et al gallium inhibits replicative dna synthesis the major gallium specific target probably being ribonucleotide reductase in addition to that it was reported by chitambar that gallium binds to transferrin more strongly than iron the transferrin gallium complex inhibits dna synthesis by acting on the m2 subunit

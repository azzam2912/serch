the generalized wiener filter generalizes the same idea beyond the domain of one dimensional time ordered signal processing with two dimensional image processing being the most common application consider a data vector formula 1 which is the sum of independent signal and noise vectors formula 2 with zero mean and covariances formula 3 and formula 4 the generalized wiener filter is the linear operator formula 5 which minimizes the expected residual between the estimated signal and the true signal formula 6 the formula 5 that minimizes this is formula 8 resulting in the wiener estimator formula 9 in the case of gaussian distributed signal and noise this estimator is also the maximum a posteriori estimator the generalized wiener filter approaches 1 for signal dominated parts of the data and s n for noise dominated parts an often seen variant expresses the filter in terms of inverse covariances this is mathematically equivalent but avoids excessive loss of numerical precision in the presence of high variance modes in this formulation the generalized wiener filter becomes formula 10 using the identity formula 11 the cosmic microwave background cmb is a homogeneous and isotropic random field and its covariance is therefore diagonal in a

this type of linkate is generally very difficult to make and specific methods like the crich mannosylation are used to overcome these issues the development of facile chemical glycosylation protocols is essential to synthesizing complex oligosaccharides among many diverse type of glycosidic linkages the 1 2 cis glycoside which exists in many biologically relevant glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides is arguably one of the most difficult to synthesize the challenges in constructing mannose linkage have been well documented in several reviews to date a few laboratories have devised efficient methodologies to overcome these synthetic hurdles and achieved varying degrees of success of those elegant approaches a highly stereoselective mannosylation protocol developed by crich and co workers was realized as a breakthrough in mannoside synthesis this strategy is based on the initial activation of mannosyl sulfoxides 1 with triflic anhydride tfo using dtbmp 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylpyridine as a base followed by nucleophilic substitution of glycosyl acceptors hor to provide the 1 2 cis glycoside 2 in good yield and selectivity scheme 1 the mechanistic details of this reaction have been extensively explored by crich s laboratories low temperature h c and f nmr spectroscopic investigations revealed that anomeric triflate

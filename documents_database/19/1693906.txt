leaves are twice compound arranged in a spiral on the stems the leaf blades which can be up to long consist of 15 to 20 paired leaflets long flowers are small with purple petals long becoming greenish towards their tips inflorescences are racemes despite producing about 200 flowers per inflorescence each one produces only a few fruit the species ranges from nicaragua to the amazon basin and exists in three distinct populations one population ranges from the amazon through venezuela and the guianas to trinidad and tobago the second population occurs in western colombia and darien province in panama the third is found in western panama costa rica and nicaragua it grows in lowland forest from sea level to 600 m above sea level and is especially abundant in wetter areas seeds are mechanically dispersed when mature pods split submerged seeds developed air pockets that allowed them to float this has been interpreted as evidence that the species has adaptions for dispersal by water hydrochory like many leguminous plants p macroloba is a nitrogen fixer which forms a symbiotic relationship with rhizobium which grows in specialised root nodules while root nodules are typically found on buried roots p macroloba individuals

these may be found on a range of substrates including steroids carbohydrates and proteins sulfate esters may be formed from various alcohols and amines in the latter case the resultant n sulfates can also be termed sulfamates sulfatases play important roles in the cycling of sulfur in the environment in the degradation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids in the lysosome and in remodelling sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular space together with sulfotransferases sulfatases form the major catalytic machinery for the synthesis and breakage of sulfate esters sulfatases are found in lower and higher organisms in higher organisms they are found in intracellular and extracellular spaces steroid sulfatase is distributed in a wide range of tissues throughout the body enabling sulfated steroids synthesized in the adrenals and gonads to be desulfated following distribution through the circulation system many sulfatases are localized in the lysosome an acidic digestive organelle found within the cell lysosomal sulfatases cleave a range of sulfated carbohydrates including sulfated glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids genetic defects in sulfatase activity can arise through mutations in individual sulfatases and result in certain lysosomal storage disorders with a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from defects in physical and intellectual development the following sulfatases have

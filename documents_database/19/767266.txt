it is the second step of a convergent approach first smaller peptides containing 30 50 amino acids are prepared by conventional chemical peptide synthesis then they are completely deprotected chemical ligation is the technique of coupling these peptides by chemoselective reaction to give a unique reaction product usually in aqueous solution with several coupling steps proteins of up to 200 300 amino acids can be produced there are various techniques described in literature the most practical and robust method for the chemoselective reaction of unprotected peptides is native chemical ligation native chemical ligation has overcome the limitations of the classical synthetic organic chemistry approach to the total synthesis of proteins and enables the routine total or semi synthesis of protein molecules the original chemical ligation methods involved the formation of a non native bond at the ligation site subsequently native chemical ligation was developed in native chemical ligation an unprotected peptide thioester reacts with a cys peptide to give a ligation product with a native amide peptide bond at the ligation site in this method the initial thioester linked ligation product intermediate rearranges to form an amide bond native chemical ligation relies on the presence of a cysteine residue at

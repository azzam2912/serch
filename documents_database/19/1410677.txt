it is known alternatively as the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 4 hent4 unlike other members of the ent family it is impermeable to most nucleosides with the exception of the inhibitory neurotransmitter and ribonucleoside adenosine which it is permeable to in a highly ph dependent manner this protein is an integral membrane protein that transports the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin dopamine norepinephrine as well as adenosine from synaptic spaces into presynaptic neurons or neighboring glial cells it is abundantly expressed in the human brain heart tissue and skeletal muscle as well as in the kidneys it is relatively insensitive to the high affinity inhibitors such as ssris of the slc6a monoamine transporters sert dat net as well being only weakly sensitive to the adenosine transport inhibitor dipyridamole its transport of monoamines unlike for adenosine is ph insensitive at low ph 5 5 6 5 range as occurs under ischemic conditions however its transport efficiency for adenosine becomes greater than for serotonin it has 530 amino acid residues with 10 12 transmembrane segments and is not homologous to other known monoamine transporters such as the high affinity sert dat and net or the low affinity slc22a oct family it was initially identified

the design can in theory produce very high specific impulse while still being well within the abilities of current technologies in traditional nuclear thermal rocket and related designs the nuclear energy is generated in some form of reactor and used to heat a working fluid to generate thrust this limits the designs to temperatures that allow the reactor to remain whole although clever design can increase this critical temperature into the tens of thousands of degrees a rocket engine s efficiency is strongly related to the temperature of the exhausted working fluid and in the case of the most advanced gas core engines it corresponds to a specific impulse of about 7000 s i the temperature of a conventional reactor design is the average temperature of the fuel the vast majority of which is not reacting at any given instant the atoms undergoing fission are at a temperature of millions of degrees which is then spread out into the surrounding fuel resulting in an overall temperature of a few thousand by physically arranging the fuel into very thin layers or particles the fragments of a nuclear reaction can boil off the surface since they will be ionized due to the

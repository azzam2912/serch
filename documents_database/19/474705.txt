it is a permitted variety in the appellation d origine contr l e wine of cassis in provence as well as in the ajaccio region of corsica while it is sometimes known under the synonym barbarossa dna profiling has shown the barbaroux grown in provence is distinct from the barbarossa vines grown in liguria and piedmont and is likely unrelated to all italian barbaross vines there is also debate among ampelographers about whether the barbaroux vines in provence and corsica are the same grape or separate vitis vinifera varieties the oldest potential mention of barbaroux grape under the synonym barbarons dates to 1667 when it was described as being used as both wine and table grape in toulon in the provence region of southern france here the vine is described as having massive clusters of large violet colored berries however despite the synonyms use there is some doubt among ampelographers about this reference since the modern barbaroux vine of provence has more pink ish colored skins though the violet description could be referring to the color of the wine particularly after a long period of extended maceration the name barbaroux itself comes from the term barbarous which means reddish berries

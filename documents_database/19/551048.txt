it can simulate the rainfall runoff runoff evaporation infiltration and groundwater connection for roots streets grassed areas rain gardens and ditches and pipes for example the hydrology component of swmm operates on a collection of subcatchment areas divided into impervious and pervious areas with and without depression storage to predict runoff and pollutant loads from precipitation evaporation and infiltration losses from each of the subcatchment besides low impact development lid and best management practice areas on the subcatchment can be modeled to reduce the impervious and pervious runoff the routing or hydraulics section of swmm transports this water and possible associated water quality constituents through a system of closed pipes open channels storage treatment devices ponds storages pumps orifices weirs outlets outfalls and other regulators swmm tracks the quantity and quality of the flow generated within each subcatchment and the flow rate flow depth and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period composed of multiple fixed or variable time steps the water quality constituents such as water quality constituents can be simulated from buildup on the subcatchments through washoff to a hydraulic network with optional first order decay and linked pollutant removal best management practice

the hopf algebra nsymm was introduced by it is noncommutative but cocommutative graded hopf algebra it has the hopf algebra of symmetric functions as a quotient and is a subalgebra of the hopf algebra of permutations and is the graded dual of the hopf algebra of quasisymmetric function over the rational numbers it is isomorphic as a hopf algebra to the universal enveloping algebra of the free lie algebra on countably many variables the underlying algebra of the hopf algebra of noncommutative symmetric functions is the free ring z z z generated by non commuting variables z z the coproduct takes z to z z where z 1 is the identity the counit takes z to 0 for i 0 and takes z 1 to 1 shows that a hasse schmidt derivation on a ring a is equivalent to an action of nsymm on a the part formula 2 of d which picks the coefficient of formula 3 is the action of the indeterminate z the element z t is a group like element of the hopf algebra of formal power series over nsymm so over the rationals its logarithm is primitive the coefficients of its logarithm generate the free

the process is a part of the nutrient cycle and is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the biosphere bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death animals such as worms also help decompose the organic materials organisms that do this are known as decomposers although no two organisms decompose in the same way they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition the science which studies decomposition is generally referred to as taphonomy from the greek word taphos meaning tomb one can differentiate abiotic from biotic substance biodegradation the former means degradation of a substance by chemical or physical processes e g hydrolysis the latter means the metabolic breakdown of materials into simpler components by living organisms typically by microorganisms see also the decomposition of human remains decomposition begins at the moment of death caused by two factors 1 autolysis the breaking down of tissues by the body s own internal chemicals and enzymes and 2 putrefaction the breakdown of tissues by bacteria these processes release compounds such as cadaverine and putrescine that are the chief source of the unmistakably putrid odor of decaying animal tissue prime decomposers are bacteria or fungi

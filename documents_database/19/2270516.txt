they are united by having simpler genitalia than other araneomorph spiders lacking a cribellum and sharing an evolutionary history of synspermia a particular way in which spermatozoa are grouped together when transferred to the female spermatozoa are produced in a multi step process a primary spermatocyte with the full diploid number of chromosomes divides to form two secondary spermatocytes which are haploid i e each has half the diploid number of chromosomes each secondary spermatocyte then divides to produce two spermatids which undergo further development to form spermatozoa in synspermia two or more spermatids from the same spermatocyte fuse together and are enclosed in an envelope forming a capsule this contrasts with cleistospermia where the capsules enclose individual spermatozoa after transfer to the female in either form decapsulation and activation are necessary before the resulting spermatozoa can fertilize eggs in 2014 peter michalik and mart n ram rez published a study of the morphology of the reproductive system of male spiders including their spermatozoa they found a clade within haplogyne spiders synspermatia characterized by the absence of a cribellum and the synapomorphy shared derived character of synspermia not all members of the clade exhibit synspermia since it has evolved into

the term surface plasmon polariton explains that the wave involves both charge motion in the metal surface plasmon and electromagnetic waves in the air or dielectric polariton they are a type of surface wave guided along the interface in much the same way that light can be guided by an optical fiber spps are shorter in wavelength than the incident light photons hence spps can have tighter spatial confinement and higher local field intensity perpendicular to the interface they have subwavelength scale confinement an spp will propagate along the interface until its energy is lost either to absorption in the metal or scattering into other directions such as into free space application of spps enables subwavelength optics in microscopy and lithography beyond the diffraction limit it also enables the first steady state micro mechanical measurement of a fundamental property of light itself the momentum of a photon in a dielectric medium other applications are photonic data storage light generation and bio photonics spps can be excited by both electrons and photons excitation by electrons is created by firing electrons into the bulk of a metal as the electrons scatter energy is transferred into the bulk plasma the component of the

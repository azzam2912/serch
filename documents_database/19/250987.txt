the implementation in the subclass overrides replaces the implementation in the superclass by providing a method that has same name same parameters or signature and same return type as the method in the parent class the version of a method that is executed will be determined by the object that is used to invoke it if an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method then the version in the parent class will be executed but if an object of the subclass is used to invoke the method then the version in the child class will be executed some languages allow a programmer to prevent a method from being overridden ada provides method overriding by default to favor early error detection e g a misspelling it is possible to specify when a method is expected to be actually overriding or not that will be checked by the compiler c does support method overriding but only if explicitly requested using the modifiers and or when overriding one method with another the signatures of the two methods must be identical and with same visibility in c class methods indexers properties and events can all be overridden non virtual or

the sample comprises 124 spectroscopically confirmed clusters at 0 3 rosat all sky survey data one of the galaxy clusters macs j0647 7015 was found to have gravitationally lensed the most distant galaxy macs0647 jd then ever imaged in 2012 by clash the first statistical study of x ray cavities in distant clusters of galaxies was performed by analyzing the chandra x ray observations of macs out of 76 clusters representing a sample of the most luminous x ray clusters observers found 13 cut and clear cavities and 7 possible cavities a new radio halo as well as a relic applicant were found in macs with the help of the giant meterwave radio telescope and the karoo array telescope 7 the discovered radio halo has a largest linear scale of about 0 9mpc x ray chosen clusters are almost free of projection effects because they are composed of intrinsically massive gravitationally collapsed systems the macs team consists of objects are labelled as jhhmm m ddmm where hhmm ddmm are the coordinates in the j2000 system here h d and m refer to hours degrees and minutes respectively and m refers to tenths of minutes of time i am going to

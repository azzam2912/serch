it was conceived in 1993 by avshalom elitzur and lev vaidman since their publication real world experiments have confirmed that their theoretical method works as predicted the bomb tester takes advantage of two characteristics of elementary particles such as photons or electrons nonlocality and wave particle duality by placing the particle in a quantum superposition it is possible for the experiment to verify that the bomb works without triggering its detonation although there is still a 50 chance that the bomb will detonate in the effort the bomb test is an interaction free measurement the idea of getting information about an object without interacting with it is not a new one for example there are two boxes one of which contains something the other of which contains nothing if you open one box and see nothing you know that the other contains something without ever opening it this experiment has its roots in the double slit experiment and other more complex concepts which inspired it including schr dinger s cat and wheeler s delayed choice experiment the behavior of elementary particles is very different from what we experience in our macroscopic world their observed behavior can be that of a

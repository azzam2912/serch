it is a geometry stabilized craft deriving its stability from its wide beam rather than from a ballasted keel as with a monohull sailboat catamaran is from a tamil word kattumaram which means logs tied together catamarans typically have less hull volume smaller displacement and shallower draft draught than monohulls of comparable length the two hulls combined also often have a smaller hydrodynamic resistance than comparable monohulls requiring less propulsive power from either sails or motors the catamaran s wider stance on the water can reduce both heeling and wave induced motion as compared with a monohull and can give reduced wakes catamarans range in size from small sailing or rowing vessels to large naval ships and car ferries the structure connecting a catamaran s two hulls ranges from a simple frame strung with webbing to support the crew to a bridging superstructure incorporating extensive cabin and or cargo space catamarans from oceania and maritime southeast asia became the inspiration for modern catamarans catamaran type vessels were an early technology of the austronesian peoples early researchers like heine geldern 1932 and hornell 1943 once believed that catamarans evolved from outrigger canoes but modern authors specializing in austronesian cultures like doran

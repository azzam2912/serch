the concept originates in fiction the term was coined by e e smith an update of his earlier attractor beam in his novel spacehounds of ipc 1931 since the 1990s technology and research has laboured to make it a reality and have had some success on a microscopic level less commonly a similar beam that repels is called a pressor beam or repulsor beam gravity impulse and gravity propulsion beams are traditionally areas of research from fringe physics that coincide with the concepts of tractor and repulsor beams a force field confined to a collimated beam with clean borders is one of the principal characteristics of tractor and repulsor beams several theories that have predicted repulsive effects do not fall within the category of tractor and repulsor beams because of the absence of field collimation for example robert l forward hughes research laboratories malibu california showed that general relativity theory allowed the generation of a very brief impulse of a gravity like repulsive force along the axis of a helical torus containing accelerated condensed matter the mainstream scientific community has accepted forward s work a variant of burkhard heim s theory by walter dr scher institut f r grenzgebiete der

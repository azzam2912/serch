with the advent of genetic profiling placing these fungi in proper taxa has now become possible most turn out to be the asexual forms anamorphs of fungi in the phylum ascomycota including metacordyceps spp before molecular techniques were introduced at the end of the 20th century metarhizium species were identified on morphological notably conidial characteristics the original species included m anisopliae with m a var major m brunneum m cicadinum m cylindrosporum m flavoviride m taii m truncatum and m viridicolumnare in 2009 nine former varieties of the type species m anisopliae were assigned species status new species have continued to be identified with original names sometimes re instated notably m brunneum the index fungorum currently july 2018 lists the teleomorphs of metarhizium species appear to be members of the genus metacordyceps metacordyceps taii as cordyceps taii has been described as the teleomorph of metarhizium taii whether the other varieties of m anisopliae have their own teleomorphs is not yet clear some if not most strains of m anisopliae possibly have lost the capability of reproducing sexually in the 1990s the lubilosa research programme proved that m acridum in its spore form was effective in killing locusts and other members

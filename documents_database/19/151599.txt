the project was run by the united states government from 1962 to 1983 the hypothesis was that the silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane and this led to seeding several atlantic hurricanes however it was later shown that this hypothesis was incorrect it was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective additionally researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes this finding called stormfury s successes into question as the changes reported now had a natural explanation the last experimental flight was flown in 1971 due to a lack of candidate storms and a changeover in noaa s fleet project stormfury was officially canceled more than a decade after the last modification experiment project stormfury failed to reach its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes but it was not without merit the project s observational data and storm lifecycle research helped improve meteorologists ability to forecast the movement and intensity of hurricanes cloud seeding was first attempted by vincent schaefer and irving langmuir after witnessing the artificial creation of

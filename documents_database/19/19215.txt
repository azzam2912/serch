it attempts to distinguish between the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the everett many worlds interpretation by means of a variation of the schr dinger s cat thought experiment from the cat s point of view quantum immortality refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide regardless of the odds keith lynch recalls that hugh everett took great delight in paradoxes such as the unexpected hanging everett did not mention quantum suicide or quantum immortality in writing but his work was intended as a solution to the paradoxes of quantum mechanics lynch said everett firmly believed that his many worlds theory guaranteed him immortality his consciousness he argued is bound at each branching to follow whatever path does not lead to death tegmark explains however that life and death situations do not normally hinge upon a sequence of binary quantum events like those in the thought experiment the quantum suicide thought experiment involves the same apparatus as schr dinger s cat a box which kills the occupant in a given time frame with probability one half due to quantum uncertainty the only difference is to have the experimenter recording observations be the one inside the box the significance

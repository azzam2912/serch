the two muscles are either the male or female external urethral sphincter and the internal urethral sphincter when either of these muscles contracts the urethra is sealed shut the external urethral sphincter originates at the ischiopubic ramus and inserts into the intermeshing muscle fibers from the other side it is controlled by the deep perineal branch of the pudendal nerve activity in the nerve fibers constricts the urethra in males and females both internal and external urethral sphincters function to inhibit the release of urine in males the internal sphincter muscle of urethra functions to prevent reflux of seminal fluids into the male bladder during ejaculation females do have a more elaborate external sphincter muscle than males as it is made up of three parts the sphincter urethrae urethrovaginal muscle and the compressor urethrae the urethrovaginal muscle fibers wrap around the vagina and urethra and contraction leads to constriction of both the vagina and the urethra the origin of the compressor urethrae muscle is the right and left inferior pubic ramus and it wraps anteriorly around the urethra so when it contracts it squeezes the urethra against the vagina the external urethrae like in males wraps solely around the urethra

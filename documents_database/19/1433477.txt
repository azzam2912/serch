the hypothesis suggests that endurance running played an important role for early hominins in obtaining food researchers have proposed that endurance running began as an adaptation for scavenging and later for persistence hunting much research has been geared towards the mechanics of how bipedal walking has evolved in the genus homo however little research has been conducted to examine how the specific adaptations for running emerged and how they influenced human evolution the bit of research that has focused on human running provides much evidence for bodily function and structures that improve running only and are not used in walking this suggests that running was an adaptation not that it came about as a byproduct of walking running and walking incorporated different biomechanisms walking requires an inverted pendulum where the body s center of mass is shifted over the extended leg to exchange potential and kinetic energy with each step running involves a mass spring mechanism to exchange potential and kinetic energy with the use of tendons and ligaments tendons and ligaments are elastic tissues that store energy they are stretched and then release energy as they recoil this mass spring mechanism becomes less energetically costly at faster speeds and

the release of heat can result in the production of light in the form of either glowing or a flame fuels of interest often include organic compounds especially hydrocarbons in the gas liquid or solid phase the major problem of micro combustion is the high surface to volume ratio as the surface to volume ratio increases heat loss to walls of combustor increases which leads to flame quenching the development of miniaturized products such as microrobots notebook computers micro aerial vehicles and other small scale devices is becoming increasingly important in our daily life there is a growing interest in developing small scale combustors to power these micro devices due to their inherent advantages of higher energy density higher heat and mass transfer coefficients and shorter recharge times compared to electrochemical batteries the energy density of hydrocarbon fuels is 20 50 times higher than the most advanced li ion concept based electrochemical batteries the concept of the micro heat engine was proposed by epstein and senturia in 1997 since then substantial amount of work has been done towards the development and application of such small scale devices to generate power through the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels micro combustors are an

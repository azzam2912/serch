examples of discrete structures are finite graphs permutations trees and so on each of these has an associated generating function which counts how many structures there are of a certain size one goal of species theory is to be able to analyse complicated structures by describing them in terms of transformations and combinations of simpler structures these operations correspond to equivalent manipulations of generating functions so producing such functions for complicated structures is much easier than with other methods the theory was introduced carefully elaborated and applied by the canadian group of people around andr joyal the power of the theory comes from its level of abstraction the description format of a structure such as adjacency list versus adjacency matrix for graphs is irrelevant because species are purely algebraic category theory provides a useful language for the concepts that arise here but it is not necessary to understand categories before being able to work with species the category of species is equivalent to the category of symmetric sequences in finite sets any structure an instance of a particular species is associated with some set and there are often many possible structures for the same set for example it is possible

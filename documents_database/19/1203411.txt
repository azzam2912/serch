in the cisco ios they are used in several places for example at a simplistic level a wildcard mask can be thought of as an inverted subnet mask for example a subnet mask of 255 255 255 0 binary equivalent 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000 inverts to a wildcard mask of 0 0 0 255 binary equivalent 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111 a wild card mask is a matching rule the rule for a wildcard mask is any wildcard bit pattern can be masked for examination for example a wildcard mask of 0 0 0 254 binary equivalent 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111110 applied to ip address 10 10 10 2 00001010 00001010 00001010 00000010 will match even numbered ip addresses 10 10 10 0 10 10 10 2 10 10 10 4 10 10 10 6 etc same mask applied to 10 10 10 1 00001010 00001010 00001010 00000001 will match odd numbered ip addresses 10 10 10 1 10 10 10 3 10 10 10 5 etc a network and wildcard mask combination of 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 would match an interface configured exactly with 1 1 1 1 only and nothing else this is really useful

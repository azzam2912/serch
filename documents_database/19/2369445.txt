ndufaf7 is a methyltransferase mitochondrial assembly enzyme involved in the assembly and stabilization of nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone also known as complex i which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain mutations in ndufaf7 have been associated with pathologic myopia and complex i deficiency ndufaf7 is located on the p arm of chromosome 2 in position 22 2 and has 14 exons the ndufaf7 gene produces a 49 2 kda protein composed of 441 amino acids ndufaf7 is believed to be a part of the s adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferase family this family has a characteristic seven strand protein fold ndufaf7 is a type ii arginine methyltransferase meaning that its enzymatic activity produces a symmetrical n n dimethylarginine it has a methyltransferase domain and an n terminal sequence that corresponds to the recognized mitochondrial targeting peptide ndufaf7 s stoichometry is disputed with some findings indicating that it is a homodimer while others denote it to be monomeric the ndufaf7 gene encodes an assembly factor protein that is localized in the mitochondria and which helps in the assembly and stabilization of complex i a large multi subunit enzyme in the

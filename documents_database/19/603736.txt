in motorcycles delta tricycles and bicycles the steering ratio is always 1 1 because the steering wheel is fixed to the front wheel a steering ratio of x y means that a turn of the steering wheel x degree s causes the wheel s to turn y degree s in most passenger cars the ratio is between 12 1 and 20 1 for example if one complete turn of the steering wheel 360 degrees causes the wheels to turn 24 degrees the ratio is then 360 24 15 1 a higher steering ratio means that the steering wheel is turned more to get the wheels turning but it will be easier to turn the steering wheel a lower steering ratio means that the steering wheel is turned less to get the wheels turning but it will be harder to turn the steering wheel larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher steering ratio which will make the steering wheel easier to turn if a truck had a low steering ratio it would be very hard to turn the steering wheel in normal and lighter cars the wheels are easier to turn so the steering ratio doesn t have to

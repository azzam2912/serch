approximating the lov sz number of the complement and then rounding the approximation to an integer would not necessarily produce a monotone function however to make the result monotone tardos approximates the lov sz number of the complement to within an additive error of formula 1 adds formula 2 to the approximation and then rounds the result to the nearest integer here formula 3 denotes the number of edges in the given graph and formula 4 denotes the number of vertices tardos used her function to prove an exponential separation between the capabilities of monotone boolean logic circuits and arbitrary circuits a result of alexander razborov previously used to show that the clique number required exponentially large monotone circuits also shows that the tardos function requires exponentially large monotone circuits despite being computable by a non monotone circuit of polynomial size later the same function was used to provide a counterexample to a purported proof of p np by norbert blum

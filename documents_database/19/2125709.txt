bowie in rhodesia it is of moderate hardness occurring occasionally in aggregates of hexagonal crystals occasionally but more commonly in microgranular cryptocrystalline masses due to its thorium content grayite displays some radioactivity although it is only moderate and the mineral displays powder xrd peaks without any metamict like effects the color of grayite is most commonly observed as a light to dark reddish brown but has also been observed as lighter yellows with grayish tints it has a low to moderate hardness with a mohs hardness of 3 4 and has a specific gravity of 3 7 4 3 it has been found in both intrusive igneous and sedimentary environments formations including grayite were originally documented in rhodesia now zimbabwe in 1957 and subsequently around the globe some of these locales include the states of wyoming and colorado as well as madagascar grayite has often been found in pegmatitic environments amongst other thorium minerals particularly monazite ce la po recent work has shown widespread occurrences in wisconsin pegmatitic environments other notable finds of pegmatitic grayite occur in bulgaria grayite has also been found in sedimentary environments with an observation of high concentrations in cracks raising the possibility of the mineral

cw can be also considered as a specific case of intermolecular chain transfer analogous to radical ethene polymerization this reaction gives rise to branched and hyperbranched dendritic hydrocarbon polymers this process is also characterized by accurate control of polymer architecture and topology the extent of cw displayed in the number of branches formed and positions of branches on the polymers are controlled by the choice of a catalyst the potential applications of polymers formed by this reaction are diverse from drug delivery to phase transfer agents nanomaterials and catalysis catalysts that promote chain walking were discovered in the 1980 1990s nickel ii and palladium ii complexes of diimine ligands were known to efficiently catalyze polymerization of alkenes they are also referred as brookhart s catalysts after being used for making of high molar mass polyolefins for the first time at university of north carolina at chapel hill in 1995 currently nickel and palladium complexes bearing diimine ligands such as the two examples shown are the most thoroughly described chain walking catalysts in scientific literature ligand design influences not only cw extent but also regio and stereoselectivity and also the sensitivity of the catalyst to undergo chain breaking reactions mainly h

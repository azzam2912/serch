typical instances are relatively easy this approach to complexity originated in combinatorial group theory which has a computational tradition going back to the beginning of the last century the notion of generic complexity was introduced in a 2003 paper where authors showed that for a large class of finitely generated groups the generic time complexity of some classical decision problems from combinatorial group theory namely the word problem conjugacy problem and membership problem are linear a detailed introduction of generic case complexity can be found in the surveys let i be an infinite set of inputs for a computational problem definition 1 a size function on i is a map formula 1 with infinite range the ball of radius n is formula 2 if the inputs are coded as strings over a finite alphabet size might be the string length let formula 3 be an ensemble of probability distributions where formula 4 is a probability distribution on formula 5 if the balls formula 5 are finite then each formula 4 can be taken to be the equiprobable distribution which is the most common case notice that only finitely many formula 5 s can be empty or have formula 9 we

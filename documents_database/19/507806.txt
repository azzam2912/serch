ion pairing is one of the most important noncovalent forces in chemistry in biological systems in different materials and in many applications such as ion pair chromatography it is a most commonly observed contribution to the stability to the entropically unfavorable folded conformation of proteins although noncovalent interactions are known to be relatively weak interactions small stabilizing interactions can add up to make an important contribution to the overall stability of a conformer not only are salt bridges found in proteins but they can also be found in supramolecular chemistry the thermodynamics of each are explored through experimental procedures to assess the free energy contribution of the salt bridge to the overall free energy of the state in water formation of salt bridges or ion pairs is mostly driven by entropy usually accompanied by unfavorable h contributions on account of desolvation of the interacting ions upon association hydrogen bonds contribute to the stability of ion pairs with e g protonated ammonium ions and with anions is formed by deprotonation as in the case of carboxylate phosphate etc then the association constants depend on the ph entropic driving forces for ion pairing in absence of significant h bonding contributions are also

note that formula 2 is the decadic logarithm the equation can be used to fit regress discrete values of the shift factor a vs temperature here values of shift factor a are obtained by horizontal shift log a of creep compliance data plotted vs time or frequency in double logarithmic scale so that a data set obtained experimentally at temperature t superposes with the data set at temperature t a minimum of three values of a are needed to obtain c c and typically more than three are used once constructed the wlf equation allows for the estimation of the temperature shift factor for temperatures other than those for which the material was tested in this way the master curve can be applied to other temperatures however when the constants are obtained with data at temperatures above the glass transition temperature t the wlf equation is applicable to temperatures at or above t only the constants are positive and represent arrhenius behavior extrapolation to temperatures below t is erroneous when the constants are obtained with data at temperatures below t negative values of c c are obtained which are not applicable above t and do not represent arrhenius behavior therefore

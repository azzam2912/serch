chess960 fischer random chess is similar but has fewer starting positions in transcendental chess the beginning positions of the pieces on the back row are randomly determined with the one restriction that the bishops be on opposite colored squares there are 8 294 400 such positions in total in chess960 there are 960 possible starting positions but that is because the king must be located between the rooks and both sides must have the same starting position in transcendental chess there is no such rule so the position of one side can be any of 4 6 2 2 880 there is no castling on the first turn a player instead of making a move can transpose any of two pieces on the back row in chess960 the back rows are mirror images but in transcendental chess the setup of black and white is different 2 879 out of every 2 880 times there being a 1 in 2 880 chance that both sides will draw the same setup this can create inequalities in the position one way to equalize these inequalities is to play a couplet the players play two games with the same setup one each as white

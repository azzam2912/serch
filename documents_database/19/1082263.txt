they are usually named by adding the suffix onium to the name of the constituting particle except for muonium which despite its name is not a bound muon antimuon onium but an electron antimuon bound state and whose name was assigned by iupac a muon antimuon onium is called true muonium positronium is an onium which consists of an electron and a positron bound together as a long lived metastable state positronium has been studied since the 1950s to understand bound states in quantum field theory a recent development called non relativistic quantum electrodynamics nrqed used this system as a proving ground pionium a bound state of two oppositely charged pions is interesting for exploring the strong interaction this should also be true of protonium the true analogs of positronium in the theory of strong interactions are the quarkonium states they are mesons made of a heavy quark and antiquark namely charmonium and bottomonium exploration of these states through non relativistic quantum chromodynamics nrqcd and lattice qcd are increasingly important tests of quantum chromodynamics understanding bound states of hadrons such as pionium and protonium is also important in order to clarify notions related to exotic hadrons such as mesonic molecules

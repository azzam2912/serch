diethyl oxomalonate reacts because of its highly polarized keto group as electrophile in addition reactions and is a highly active reactant in pericyclic reactions such as the diels alder reactions cycloadditions or ene reactions at humid air mesoxalic acid diethyl ester reacts with water to give diethyl mesoxalate hydrate and the green yellow oil are spontaneously converted to white crystals in 1892 richard ansch tz and co workers synthesized for the first time diethyl oxomalonate oxomalons ure thylester in pure form starting from decomposition of the barium salt of alloxan to oxomalonic acid followed by esterification with ethanol in the presence of hydrogen chloride louis bouveault and co workers obtained by the nitrosation of diethyl malonate its isonitrosoester which was oxidized to diethyl oxomalonate with dinitrogen tetroxide no peroxyde d azote the keto compound obtained as oil reacts with water to give the crystalline dihydrate in a modified variant of the synthesis with no diethyl oxomalonate was obtained in 90 crude yield instead of dinitrogen tetroxide dinitrogen trioxide no obtained from arsenic iii oxide with nitric acid can also be used as the oxidant the overall yield is 74 76 however the synthetic route is complex in terms of apparatus

nature already has some of the most efficient and powerful kinds of nanomotors some of these natural biological nanomotors have been re engineered to serve desired purposes however such biological nanomotors are designed to work in specific environmental conditions ph liquid medium sources of energy etc laboratory made nanotube nanomotors on the other hand are significantly more robust and can operate in diverse environments including varied frequency temperature mediums and chemical environments the vast differences in the dominant forces and criteria between macroscale and micro nanoscale offer new avenues to construct tailor made nanomotors the various beneficial properties of carbon nanotubes makes them the most attractive material to base such nanomotors on just fifteen years after making the world s first micrometer sized motor dr alex zettl led his group at university of california at berkeley to construct the first nanotube nanomotor in 2003 a few concepts and models have been spun off ever since including the nanoactuator driven by a thermal gradient as well as the conceptual electron windmill both of which were revealed in 2008 coulomb s law states that the electrostatic force between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of their distance hence as the

it was developed during the 1980s and specified in ieee 802 3b 1985 the standard supports 10 mbit s ethernet signals over standard 75 ohm cable television catv cable over a 3600 meter range 10broad36 modulates its data onto a higher frequency carrier signal much as an audio signal would modulate a carrier signal to be transmitted in a radio station in telecommunications engineering this is a broadband signaling technique broadband provides several advantages over the baseband signal used for instance in 10base5 range is greatly extended 3600 meters versus 500 meters for 10base5 and multiple signals can be carried on the same cable 10broad36 can even share a cable with standard television channels the institute of electrical and electronics engineers standards committee ieee 802 published the standard that was ratified in 1985 as an additional section 11 to the base ethernet standard it was also issued as iso iec 8802 3 in 1989 10broad36 was less successful than its contemporaries because of the high equipment complexity and cost associated with it the individual stations are much more expensive due to the extra radio frequency circuitry involved however the primary extra complexity comes from the fact that 10broad36 is unidirectional

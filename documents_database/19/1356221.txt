lqr allows peers at either end of the ppp link to assess the state and quality of the ppp link lqr only transmits counts of packets sent received and rejected with errors it does not report on signal noise or attenuation in order to produce link quality reports a ppp peer has to implement link quality monitoring link quality monitoring consists of maintaining a number of counters these counters include the use of lqrs are negotiated when the ppp link is first established any peer that wants to receive lqr packets signals this by sending a ppp configuration option with the following data an lqr is one packet containing the counters above as well as in addition the receiving peer will add the following fields to the lqr packet when it arrives these numbers come from the mib database that the ppp receive logic maintains they are saved for use in the next lqr packet that the peer sends a number of ppp implementations cause errors with lqr generation other implementations negotiate correctly for lqrs but then fail to send them this leads to the local peer determining that the ppp link has failed this has led to most users

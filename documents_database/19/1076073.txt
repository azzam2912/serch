the honey frames are typically harvested in the late summer when they will be most filled with honey on a completely filled frame the cells will be capped over by the bees for storage that is each cell containing honey will be sealed with a capping made of beeswax the first step in the extraction process is to break or remove all of the cappings this may be accomplished using an automated uncapper machine or with a manually operated uncapping knife usually these tools are used together along with a pronged cappings fork to facilitate cutting off these wax cappings the knife is often heated the removed bits of wax called cappings are rich in honey which can be slowly drained off with the help of some heating this cappings wax is very valuable and often used to make candles or other products automated uncapping machines normally work by abrading the surface of the wax with moving chains or bristles or hot knives this while messy makes the process easier than doing this task manually some beekeepers will also harvest before uncapping the honey the propolis a resinous material bees gather to glue the frames together propolis is used for

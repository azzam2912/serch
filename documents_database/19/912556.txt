it contains a single species p purdoni named initially as a species of the related rhamphorhynchid scaphognathus in 1888 but moved to its own genus in 1919 on account of a unique combination of characteristics in particular the top surface of the skull of parapsicephalus is convex which is otherwise only seen in dimorphodontians this has been the basis of its referral to the dimorphodontia by some researchers but it is generally agreed upon that parapsicephalus probably represents a rhamphorhynchid within the rhamphorhynchidae parapsicephalus has been synonymized with the roughly contemporary dorygnathus this however is not likely given the many differences between the two taxa including the aforementioned convex top surface of the skull parapsicephalus has been tentatively referred to the rhamphorhynchinae subgrouping of rhamphorhynchids but it may represent a basal member of the group instead the type skull of parapsicephalus which is long as preserved suggests that it was of medium size comparisons with the related pterosaurs scaphognathus dorygnathus and jianchangnathus indicates that the full skull would have been long wellnhofer estimated its wingspan at more recently a referred humerus which is long has produced wingspan estimates of when viewed from the side the convex top of the skull

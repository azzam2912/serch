the frequency of an oscillator is altered in accordance with the amplitude of a modulating signal fm synthesis can create both harmonic and inharmonic sounds for synthesizing harmonic sounds the modulating signal must have a harmonic relationship to the original carrier signal as the amount of frequency modulation increases the sound grows progressively more complex through the use of modulators with frequencies that are non integer multiples of the carrier signal i e inharmonic inharmonic bell like and percussive spectra can be created fm synthesis using analog oscillators may result in pitch instability however fm synthesis can also be implemented digitally the latter proving to be more stable and is currently seen as standard practice digital fm synthesis implemented as phase modulation was the basis of several musical instruments beginning as early as 1974 yamaha built the first prototype digital synthesizer in 1974 based on fm synthesis before commercially releasing the yamaha gs 1 in 1980 the synclavier i manufactured by new england digital corporation beginning in 1978 included a digital fm synthesizer using an fm synthesis algorithm licensed from yamaha yamaha s groundbreaking dx7 released in 1983 brought fm to the forefront of synthesis in the mid 1980s fm

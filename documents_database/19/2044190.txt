they are economically important plant parasites and virus vectors the first trichodorid was described in 1880 de man as dorylaimus primitivus and the type genus trichodorus described in 1913 by cobb based on trichodorus obtusus historically up to 1973 trichodorus was the only genus in this family originally it was the only genus in a subfamily the trichodorinae thorne 1935 within the family diphtherophoridae to distinguish it from the other subfamily diphtherophorinae however diphtherophoridae was elevated to superfamily rank and the subfamily trichodorinae became a full fledged family the genus trichodorus was split into two genera in 1974 by siddiqi trichodorus and paratrichodorus this was based on the position of the gland nuclei and the type of pharyngo intestinal junction siddiqi also used these criteria to divide paratrichodirus into three subgenera paratrichodorus atlantadorus and nanidorus rodriguez montessorosoon proposed further separating these genera into two subfamilies resurrecting the name trichodorinae with siddiqi s subgenera not accepted by all authorities his elevation of these subgenera to genus level in 1980 was followed by even fewer but now is finding supports in molecular systematics in the case of nanidorus phylogenetic analysis has supported its recognition as a separate genus although clustering with trichodorus

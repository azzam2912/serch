under these conditions assuming gravity and spacetime are quantized there arises a repulsive force derived from heisenberg s uncertainty principle the accumulation of mass energy inside the planck star cannot collapse beyond this limit because it violates the uncertainty principle for spacetime itself the key feature of this theoretical object is that this repulsion arises from the energy density not the planck length and starts taking effect far earlier than might be expected this repulsive force is strong enough to stop the collapse of the star well before a singularity is formed and indeed well before the planck scale for distance since a planck star is calculated to be considerably larger than the planck scale this means there is adequate room for all the information captured inside of a black hole to be encoded in the star thus avoiding information loss while it might be expected that such a repulsion would act very quickly to reverse the collapse of a star it turns out that the relativistic effects of the extreme gravity such an object generates slow down time for the planck star to a similarly extreme degree seen from outside the star s schwartzschild radius the rebound from a

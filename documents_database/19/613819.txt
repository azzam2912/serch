often these are tall structures such as towers where the hyperboloid geometry s structural strength is used to support an object high off the ground but hyperboloid geometry is also often used for decorative effect as well as structural economy the first hyperboloid structures were built by russian engineer vladimir shukhov 1853 1939 the world s first hyperboloid tower is located in polibino dankovsky district lipetsk oblast russia hyperbolic structures have a negative gaussian curvature meaning they curve inward rather than curving outward or being straight as doubly ruled surfaces they can be made with a lattice of straight beams hence are easier to build than curved surfaces that do not have a ruling and must instead be built with curved beams hyperboloid structures are superior in stability towards outside forces compared with straight buildings but have shapes often creating large amounts of unusable volume low space efficiency and therefore are more commonly used in purpose driven structures such as water towers to support a large mass cooling towers and aesthetic features with cooling towers a hyperbolic structure is preferred at the bottom the widening of the tower provides a large area for installation of fill to promote thin film

it has an apparent visual magnitude of 5 95 which according to the bortle scale can be seen with the naked eye from suburban locations based upon an annual parallax shift of 0 05755 arc seconds as measured by the hipparcos satellite this system is from earth the stellar classification of 10 canum venaticorum is g0 v indicating that it is a main sequence star that is fusing hydrogen into helium at its core to generate energy it is older than the sun with an estimated age of six billion years the star has around 96 of the sun s radius and 87 of the solar mass it rotates about the axis an average of once every 13 days with a projected rotational velocity along the equator of 8 km s the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium is lower than in the sun the effective temperature of the stellar atmosphere is 5 789 k giving it the yellow hue of a g type star an excess of infrared emission at a wavelength of 70 m suggests the presence of a debris disk the best fit disk model suggest a broad dust annulus with a peak brightness at

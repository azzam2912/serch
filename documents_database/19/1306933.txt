coastal biogeomorphology looks at the interaction between marine organisms and coastal geomorphic processes biogeomorphology is a subdisclipline of geomorphology this can include not only microorganisms and plants but animals as well these interactions are important factors in the development of certain environments like salt marsh mangrove and other types of coastal wetlands as well as influencing coastal and shoreline stability there are three main processes related to biogeomorphology bioerosion bioprotection and bioconstruction bioerosion is the erosion of ocean substrates by living organisms bioprotection refers to the protection of substrate from various forms erosion by the presence of organisms and the structures they create i e coral reefs finally bioconstruction refers to the physical construction of biological structures on ocean substrate marine biota interact with landform processes by building structures accumulating carbonate sediments accelerating erosion by boring or bioturbation and marine plant life contribute to shoreline stability especially in marsh and wetland environments the interaction between marine biota and geologic processes is important to shoreline stability especially in soft sedimentary environments where sediments are more likely to erode away benthic and planktonic organisms as well as shellfish filter package and even bind fine sediments together in tidal regions this action reduces

these differences involve not only what is counted as being a relevant solution but even the basic statement of the context being considered let x x and y y be i i d samples from two populations which both come from the same location scale family of distributions the scale parameters are assumed to be unknown and not necessarily equal and the problem is to assess whether the location parameters can reasonably be treated as equal lehmann states that the behrens fisher problem is used both for this general form of model when the family of distributions is arbitrary and for when the restriction to a normal distribution is made while lehmann discusses a number of approaches to the more general problem mainly based on nonparametrics most other sources appear to use the behrens fisher problem to refer only to the case where the distribution is assumed to be normal most of this article makes this assumption solutions to the behrens fisher problem have been presented that make use of either a classical or a bayesian inference point of view and either solution would be notionally invalid judged from the other point of view if consideration is restricted to classical

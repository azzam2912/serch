in addition to providing information about various devices and kernel subsystems exported virtual files are also used for their configuration sysfs provides functionality similar to the sysctl mechanism found in bsd operating systems with the difference that sysfs is implemented as a virtual file system instead of being a purpose built kernel mechanism and that in linux sysctl configuration parameters are made available at proc sys as part of procfs not sysfs which is mounted at sys during the 2 5 development cycle the linux driver model was introduced to fix several shortcomings of version 2 4 sysfs was designed to export the information present in the device tree which would then no longer clutter up procfs it was written by patrick mochel maneesh soni later wrote the sysfs backing store patch to reduce memory usage on large systems during the next year of 2 5 development the infrastructural capabilities of the driver model and driverfs formerly called ddfs began to prove useful to other subsystems kobjects were developed to provide a central object management mechanism and driverfs was renamed to sysfs to represent its subsystem agnosticism sysfs is mounted under the sys mount point if it is not mounted

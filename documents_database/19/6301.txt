introduced in 1989 the 80486 improved on the performance of the 80386dx thanks to on die l1 cache and floating point unit as well as an improved five stage tightly coupled pipelined design it was the first x86 chip to use more than a million transistors it represents the fourth generation of binary compatible cpus since the original 8086 of 1978 the initial model the 80486dx was introduced with 25 and 33 mhz models later a 50 mhz part was added then clock doubled dx2 50 and dx2 66 parts and later still clock tripled dx4 75 and dx4 100 ones the 486dx was later supplemented with the cheaper 80486sx which was also available in 16 and 20 mhz variants the sx and dx designations matched those of the 80386dx and 80386sx but had different meanings for the 486 the sx designation indicated no on chip fpu in early 486sx units the fpu was present but disabled later models removed it entirely a supplementary 80487dx upgrade chip was also offered but this was not an fpu it was an entire replacement processor that disabled the original sx part a 50 mhz 80486 executes around 40 million instructions per second on

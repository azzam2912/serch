for example distributed systems such as peer to peer networks and client server applications are overlay networks because their nodes run on top of the internet the internet was originally built as an overlay upon the telephone network while today through the advent of voip the telephone network is increasingly turning into an overlay network built on top of the internet overlay networks are used in telecommunication because of the availability of digital circuit switching equipment and optical fiber telecommunication transport networks and ip networks which combined make up the broader internet are all overlaid with at least an optical fiber layer a transport layer and an ip or circuit switching layers in the case of the pstn enterprise private networks were first overlaid on telecommunication networks such as frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode packet switching infrastructures but migration from these now legacy infrastructures to ip based mpls networks and virtual private networks started 2001 2002 from a physical standpoint overlay networks are quite complex see figure 1 as they combine various logical layers that are operated and built by various entities businesses universities government etc but they allow separation of concerns that over time permitted the buildup of

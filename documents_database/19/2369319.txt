this instrument is currently mapping hydrogen levels to a maximum depth of beneath the martian surface thus revealing shallow water ice distribution this instrument has an improved resolution of 7 5 times over the one russia contributed to nasa s 2001 mars odyssey orbiter frend can provide information while orbiting mars on the presence of hydrogen in the form of water or hydrated minerals in the top of the martian surface locations where hydrogen is found may indicate water ice deposits which is one of the key ingredients for life mapping ground ice could also be useful for future resource utilization isru and crewed missions frend also features a dosimeter to monitor the radiation environment along its orbit around mars the main science objective of the instrument is to carry out high spatial resolution mapping of epithermal and fast neutron fluxes from the martian surface frend will work in synergy and complement orbital and ground data as measured the dynamic albedo of neutrons dan instrument on the curiosity rover the adron rm instrument on the exomars rover and the adron em on the kazachok the second goal of frend is to use its dosimeter to measure the radiation dose at

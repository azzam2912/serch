given a target of arbitrary geometry one seeks to calculate its scattering and absorption properties exact solutions to maxwell s equations are known only for special geometries such as spheres spheroids or cylinders so approximate methods are in general required however the dda employs no physical approximations and can produce accurate enough results given sufficient computer power the basic idea of the dda was introduced in 1964 by devoe who applied it to study the optical properties of molecular aggregates retardation effects were not included so devoe s treatment was limited to aggregates that were small compared with the wavelength the dda including retardation effects was proposed in 1973 by purcell and pennypacker who used it to study interstellar dust grains simply stated the dda is an approximation of the continuum target by a finite array of polarizable points the points acquire dipole moments in response to the local electric field the dipoles of course interact with one another via their electric fields so the dda is also sometimes referred to as the coupled dipole approximation nature provides the physical inspiration for the dda in 1909 lorentz showed that the dielectric properties of a substance could be directly related to

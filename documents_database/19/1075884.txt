the seamount chain extends to the southeast on the pacific plate beginning at the aleutian trench and terminating at axial seamount located on the juan de fuca ridge the seamount chain is spread over a vast length of approximately 1800 km the location of the cobb hotspot that gives rise to these seamounts is 46 n 130 w the pacific plate is moving to the northwest over the hotspot causing the seamounts in the chain to decrease in age to the southeast axial is the youngest seamount and is located approximately 480 km west of cannon beach oregon the most studied seamounts that make up this chain are axial brown bear cobb and patton seamounts there are many other seamounts in this chain which have not been explored seamounts are created at hot spots these are isolated areas within tectonic plates where plumes of magma rise through the crust and erupt at the surface this creates a chain of submarine volcanoes and seamounts the cobb hot spot is located at the juan de fuca ridge in the pacific ocean the pacific plate is moving north westward direction at a speed of 5 5 cm per year periodic volcanic events have

these structures include schools houses bridges commercial centers tall buildings warehouses aircraft ships and stadiums the design and use of steel frames are commonly employed in the design of steel structures more advanced structures include steel plates and shells in structural engineering a structure is a body or combination of pieces of rigid bodies in space that form a fitness system for supporting loads and resisting moments the effects of loads and moments on structures are determined through structural analysis a steel structure is composed of structural members that are made of steel usually with standard cross sectional profiles and standards of chemical composition and mechanical properties the depth of steel beams used in the construction of bridges is usually governed by the maximum moment and the cross section is then verified for shear strength near supports and lateral torsional buckling by determining the distance between transverse members connecting adjacent beams steel column members must be verified as adequate to prevent buckling after axial and moment requirements are met there are currently two common methods of steel design the first method is the allowable strength design asd method the second is the load and resistance factor design lrfd method both

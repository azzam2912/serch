typical colonies have 4 to 16 cells all the same size arranged in a flat plate with no anterior posterior differentiation in a colony of 16 cells four are in the center and the other 12 are on the four sides three each a description by g m smith 1920 p 94 gonium mueller 1773 colonies of 4 8 16 cells arranged in a flat quadrangular plate and embedded in a common gelatinous matrix or connected by broad gelatinous strands cells ovoid to pyriform with a single cup shaped chloroplast containing one pyrenoid each cell with two cilia of equal length contractile vacuoles at the base of the cilia and an eyespot four and eight celled colonies with the cilia on the same side sixteen celled colonies with the four central cells having their cilia on the same side and the twelve marginal cells with radially arranged cilia asexual reproduction by simultaneous division of all cells in the colony to form autocolonies or by a formation of 2 4 zoospores in each cell sexual reproduction isogamous by a fusion of biciliate zoogametes the genus gonium represents species closely related to single celled chlamydomonas and multicellular differentiated volvox the order volvocales

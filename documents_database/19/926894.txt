landslides can be triggered by many sometimes concomitant causes in addition to shallow erosion or reduction of shear strength caused by seasonal rainfall landslides may be triggered by anthropic activities such as adding excessive weight above the slope digging at mid slope or at the foot of the slope often individual phenomenon join together to generate instability over time which often does not allow a reconstruction of the evolution of a particular landslide therefore landslide hazard mitigation measures are not generally classified according to the phenomenon that might cause a landslide instead they are classified by the sort of slope stabilization method used each of these methods varies somewhat with the type of material that makes up the slope reinforcement measures generally consist of the introduction of metal elements which increase the shear strength of the rock and to reduce the stress release created when the rock is cut reinforcement measures are made up of metal rock nails or anchors anchorage subjected to pretensioning is classified as active anchorage passive anchorage not subjected to pretensioning can be used both to nail single unstable blocks and to reinforce large portions of rock anchorage can also be used as pre reinforcement elements

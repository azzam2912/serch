doxycycline tetracycline controlled gene expression is based upon the mechanism of resistance to tetracycline antibiotic treatment found in gram negative bacteria in nature the p promoter expresses tetr the repressor and teta the protein that pumps tetracycline antibiotic out of the cell the difference between tet on and tet off is not whether the transactivator turns a gene on or off as the name might suggest rather both proteins activate expression the difference relates to their respective response to tetracycline or doxycycline dox a more stable tetracycline analogue tet off activates expression in the absence of dox whereas tet on activates in the presence of dox the two most commonly used inducible expression systems for research of eukaryote cell biology are named tet off and tet on the tet off system for controlling expression of genes of interest in mammalian cells was developed by professors hermann bujard and manfred gossen at the university of heidelberg and first published in 1992 the tet off system makes use of the tetracycline transactivator tta protein which is created by fusing one protein tetr tetracycline repressor found in escherichia coli bacteria with the activation domain of another protein vp16 found in the herpes simplex

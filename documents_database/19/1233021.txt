desanders are installed on top of the mud tank following the shale shaker and the degasser but before the desilter desander removes the abrasive solids from the drilling fluids which cannot be removed by shakers normally the solids diameter for desander to be separated would be 45 74 m and 15 44 m for desilter a centrifugal pump is used to pump the drilling fluids from mud tank into the set of hydrocyclones desanders have no moving parts the larger the internal diameter of the desander is the greater the amount of drilling fluids it is able to process and the larger the size of the solids removed a desander with a cone is able to remove 50 of solids within the 40 50 m micrometre range at a flow rate of whilea desilter cone is able to remove 50 of solids within the 15 20 m range at a flow rate of micro fine separators are able to remove 50 of solids within the 10 15 m range at a flow rate of a desander is typically positioned next to last in the arrangement of solids control equipment with a desander centrifuge as the subsequent processing unit desanders are

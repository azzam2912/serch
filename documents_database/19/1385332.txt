bellman independently considered by anatole beck an immobile hider is located on the real line according to a known probability distribution a searcher whose maximal velocity is one starts from the origin and wishes to discover the hider in minimal expected time it is assumed that the searcher can change the direction of his motion without any loss of time it is also assumed that the searcher cannot see the hider until he actually reaches the point at which the hider is located and the time elapsed until this moment is the duration of the game in order to find the hider the searcher has to go a distance x in one direction return to the origin and go distance x in the other direction etc the length of the n th step being denoted by x and to do it in an optimal way however an optimal solution need not have a first step and could start with an infinite number of small oscillations this problem is usually called the linear search problem and a search plan is called a trajectory it has attracted much research some of it quite recent the linear search problem for a general probability

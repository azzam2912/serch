ngc 3309 was discovered by astronomer john herschel on march 24 1835 the galaxy forms a pair with ngc 3311 which lies about away both galaxies dominate the center of the hydra cluster ngc 3309 has a radio jet emerging out of its center the jet is two sided and the northeastern part of the jet appears to end in a spur the southwestern part of the jet lies along a straight line at a projected distance of about from the nucleus the jet appears to narrow into a nozzle like structure before it expands into a lobe extending away from the galaxy the predominant part of the radio emission in the hydra cluster comes from ngc 3309 the radio emission in ngc 3309 may have been triggered by a resent perturbation with the giant spiral galaxy ngc 3312 ngc 3309 has an estimated population of about globular clusters due to the influence of the nearby galaxy ngc 3311 ngc 3309 may have been stripped of part of its original globular cluster system with some of the galaxy s globular clusters becoming members of ngc 3311 s population

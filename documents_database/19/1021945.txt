the resulting quantization noise may produce a warmer sound impression or a harsh one depending on the amount of reduction a typical bitcrusher uses two methods to reduce audio fidelity sample rate reduction and resolution reduction digital audio is composed of a rapid series of numeric samples that encode the changing amplitude of an audio waveform to accurately represent a wideband waveform of substantial duration digital audio requires a large number of samples at a high sample rate the higher the rate the more accurate the waveform a lower rate requires the source analog signal to be low pass filtered to limit the maximum frequency component in the signal or else high frequency components of the signal will be aliased specifically the frequency of sampling a k a the sample rate must be at least twice the maximum frequency component in the signal this maximum signal frequency of one half the sampling frequency is called the nyquist limit though it is a common misconception that the sample rate affects the smoothness of the digitally represented waveform this is not true sampling theory guarantees that up to the maximum signal frequency supported by the sample rate i e the nyquist limit

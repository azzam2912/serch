they are active hunters which prey on insects fry and possibly young snails multiple species and subspecies of these darters can coexist where substrate is varied so this must be carefully preserved to accommodate many similar species with the warming of spring e basilare enters its breeding cycle and males develop their dimorphic coloration like most darters it hugs the stream bed using its body shape and fin posture to maintain its position this lifestyle which is so dependent upon the benthic architecture of the stream is highly impacted by disturbance which can be the result of increased or decreased flow from dams introduction of polluted debris or particulate size change due to erosion dams in particular pose a large threat to this species due to the effects of siltation which can over time fill in streambed substrate gaps destroying nesting sites and suffocating any eggs already laid in addition different species and subspecies of darter are highly adapted to a given substrate size which insinuates that this habitat homogenization could result in a negative impact on the existent e basilare subspecies diversity and on the darter ecological balance as a whole the corrugated darter is endemic to the upper

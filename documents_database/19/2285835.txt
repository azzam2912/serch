in 1985 he was appointed a lecturer at imperial college london in 2007 following two years with the methodist church he was jointly appointed at the clarendon laboratory and the central laser facility bell s research investigates plasma physics he wrote one of four independent papers proposing the theory of cosmic ray acceleration by shocks he showed how strong magnetic field is generated during particle acceleration and how it enables cosmic ray acceleration to high energy he initiated the theory of non local transport for heat flow in inertial confinement fusion explained the collimation of laser produced energetic electrons by resistively generated magnetic field and with demonstrated the possibility of electron positron pair production in ultra high intensity laser plasma interactions bell was awarded the 2014 hoyle medal and prize of the institute of physics for elucidating the origin and impact of cosmic rays and for his seminal contributions to electron energy transport in laboratory plasmas in 2016 he was awarded the eddington medal of the royal astronomical society for his development of the theory of the acceleration of charged particles in astrophysics known as diffusive shock acceleration he was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 2017

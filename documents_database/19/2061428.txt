bacteria serve as natural hosts with transmission achieved through passive diffusion there are currently three species in this genus including the type species salmonella phage felixo1 group dsdna viruses in felixounalikevirus are non enveloped with head tail geometries the diameter is around 73 nm the tail is around 17 nm wide 113 nm long with six long straight terminal fibers and a baseplate the tail sheath presents a criss cross pattern with no transverse striations genomes are linear around 86kb in length the genome codes for 131 proteins all three species have been fully sequenced and are available from ictv including two strains of erwinia phage phiea21 4 they range between 84k and 89k nucleotides with 118 to 140 proteins the complete genomes are available from here the virus attaches to the host cell using its terminal fibers and ejects the viral dna into the host cytoplasm via contraction of its tail sheath viral replication is cytoplasmic dna templated transcription is the method of transcription once the viral genes have been replicated the procapsid is assembled and packed the tail is then assembled and the mature virions are released via lysis according to the ictv s 2010 11 report the

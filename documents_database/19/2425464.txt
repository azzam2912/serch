magnitude 24 8 is about 30 times fainter than the more common magnitude 21 detected by automated near earth object surveys during opposition the uncertainty in the asteroid s sky position will cover about 3 8 degrees of the sky around 1 september 2020 7 days the asteroid is expected to pass about from earth but the asteroid could pass as far away as which could make the asteroid much fainter and more difficult to recover there is no risk of a 2020 impact because the line of variation lov does not pass through where earth will be jpl horizons predicts that the asteroid may be hidden in the suns glare until hours before closest approach neodys does not expect the asteroid to be more than 50 degrees from the sun until 21 august or to become brighter than magnitude 24 until 31 august with closest approach occurring on 5 september 2020 with a short 4 day observation arc the sentry risk table shows an estimated 1 in 71000 chance of the asteroid impacting earth on 2 september 2055 the nominal jpl horizons 2 september 2055 earth distance is with a 3 sigma uncertainty of 3 trillion km due to

typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of the inner ring that may be misaligned in respect to the outer ring the misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape of the outer ring and spherical rollers despite what their name may imply spherical roller bearings are not truly spherical in shape the rolling elements of spherical roller bearings are mainly cylindrical in shape but have a profile that makes them appear like cylinders that have been slightly over inflated spherical roller bearings consist of an inner ring with two raceways inclined at an angle to the bearing axis an outer ring with a common spherical raceway spherical rollers cages and in certain designs also internal guide rings or center rings the bearings can also be sealed the spherical roller bearing was invented by engineer arvid palmgren and was introduced on the market 1919 by skf the design of the bearing that arvid palmgren invented is similar to the design that is still in use in modern machines most spherical roller bearings are designed with two rows of rollers allowing them to take very heavy radial loads and heavy axial loads there are also designs with

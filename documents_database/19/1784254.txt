the first host used by cod worm is a flatfish or lumpsucker which it captures with grasping hooks at the front of its body it penetrates the lumpsucker with a thin filament which it uses to suck the host s blood the nourished cod worm then mates with another one on the lumpsucker the female worm with her now fertilized eggs then finds a cod or a cod like fish such as a haddock or whiting there the worm clings to the gills while it metamorphoses into a plump sinusoidal worm like body with a coiled mass of egg strings at the rear the front part of the worm s body penetrates the body of the cod until it enters the rear bulb of the host s heart there firmly rooted in the cod s circulatory system the front part of the parasite develops like the branches of a tree reaching into the main artery in this way the worm extracts nutrients from the cod s blood remaining safely tucked beneath the cod s gill cover until it releases a new generation of offspring into the water atlantic cod act as intermediate paratenic or definitive hosts to a large number

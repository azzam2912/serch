it is a relatively simple method of construction that exploits low grade timber not normally suitable for use in construction to form load bearing solid timber wall floor and roof panels brettstapel works by using hardwood dowels with a moisture content lower than that of softwood posts over time the dowels expand to achieve moisture equilibrium thus locking the posts together and creating a structural load bearing system it is one of a few construction methods that can be entirely fabricated from timber although some variations do still use glue and nails these are not necessary and avoiding these means a healthier indoor air quality can be achieved the timber itself locks in vast amounts of carbon dioxide without emitting harmful toxins found in other materials benefiting both the user and the environment brettstapel was invented in the 1970s by the german engineer julius natterer it is now commonly used across austria switzerland and germany whilst slowly emerging in the uk originally it consisted of low grade timber posts continuously nailed together to form panels strong enough to support mines and railways in 1999 a german company developed a doweled system which relied on the varying moisture content to form

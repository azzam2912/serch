left ventricular pv loops are considered to be the gold standard for hemodynamic assessment and are widely used in research to evaluate cardiac performance while it has long been possible to measure pressure in real time from the left ventricle measuring the volume was technically more difficult the use of ultrasonic sonomicrometry and the development of the conductance catheter triggered renewed interest in pv loops studies in sonomicrometry small ultrasonic transducers usually referred to as crystals transmit signals to each other and the distance between them is accurately determined based on the transit time of the signals by knowing the long and short axis lengths of the ventricle ventricular volume is easily and accurately determined conductance cathethers measure instantaneous conductance in the left ventricle which is then converted to blood volume using complex formulas and usually after determining and applying various correction factors typically only one method is used to perform pv studies in research settings the miniaturization of sonomicrometer crystals and pressure catheters have made mice pv loop studies feasible and more common a sonomicrometer system is composed of an electronic signal processing unit that is connected to small ultrasonic transducers crystals a computer acting as a data acquisition

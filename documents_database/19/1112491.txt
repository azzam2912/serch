together with malate synthase it bypasses the two decarboxylation steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle and is used by bacteria fungi and plants the systematic name of this enzyme class is isocitrate glyoxylate lyase succinate forming other names in common use include isocitrase isocitritase isocitratase threo ds isocitrate glyoxylate lyase and isocitrate glyoxylate lyase this enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism this enzyme belongs to the family of lyases specifically the oxo acid lyases which cleave carbon carbon bonds other enzymes also belong to this family including carboxyvinyl carboxyphosphonate phosphorylmutase which catalyses the conversion of 1 carboxyvinyl carboxyphosphonate to 3 hydrohydroxyphosphoryl pyruvate carbon dioxide and phosphoenolpyruvate mutase which is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphinothricin tripeptide antibiotics during catalysis isocitrate is deprotonated and an aldol cleavage results in the release of succinate and glyoxylate this reaction mechanism functions much like that of aldolase in glycolysis where a carbon carbon bond is cleaved and an aldehyde is released in the glyoxylate cycle malate synthase then catalyzes the condensation of glyoxylate and acetyl coa to form malate so the cycle can continue icl competes with isocitrate dehydrogenase an enzyme found in the tca cycle for isocitrate processing flux through

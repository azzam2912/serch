bas 90 was developed during the 1970s and 1980s from the existing bas 60 system in response to the new threats and needs that had arisen since the conception of the bas 60 system during the 1950s just like bas 60 the bas 90 system was based around defensive force dispersal of aircraft across many krigsflygbaser wartime air bases in case of war as well as dispersion of the air base functions within the individual bases themselves the air units would have been dispersed so one squadron 8 12 aircraft would be stationed per krigsflygbas the system was a protective measure against nuclear weapons and airstrikes the purpose being to make it complicated for an opponent to destroy the swedish air force on the ground and thus ensure endurance for the air force in a conflict scenario the six day war where the israeli air force destroyed most of the egyptian air force on the ground during its opening stages in operation focus served both as validation for the swedish dispersion concept and as reason to develop the system further another reason to improve the system was the introduction of long range attack aircraft primarily the su 24 and cluster

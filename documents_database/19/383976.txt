the history of superconductivity began with dutch physicist heike kamerlingh onnes s discovery of superconductivity in mercury in 1911 since then many other superconducting materials have been discovered and the theory of superconductivity has been developed these subjects remain active areas of study in the field of condensed matter physics james dewar initiated research into electrical resistance at low temperatures dewar and john ambrose fleming predicted that at absolute zero pure metals would become perfect electromagnetic conductors though later dewar altered his opinion on the disappearance of resistance believing that there would always be some resistance walther hermann nernst developed the third law of thermodynamics and stated that absolute zero was unattainable carl von linde and william hampson both commercial researchers nearly at the same time filed for patents on the joule thomson effect for the liquefaction of gases linde s patent was the climax of 20 years of systematic investigation of established facts using a regenerative counterflow method hampson s designs was also of a regenerative method the combined process became known as the hampson linde liquefaction process onnes purchased a linde machine for his research on march 21 1900 nikola tesla was granted a patent for the means

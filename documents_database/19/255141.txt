it is widely used in cartography to measure geodetic height and in construction to measure height differences of construction artifacts optical levelling employs an optical level which consists of a precision telescope with crosshairs and stadia marks the cross hairs are used to establish the level point on the target and the stadia allow range finding stadia are usually at ratios of 100 1 in which case one metre between the stadia marks on the levelling staff represents 100 metres from the target the complete unit is normally mounted on a tripod and the telescope can freely rotate 360 in a horizontal plane the surveyor adjusts the instrument s level by coarse adjustment of the tripod legs and fine adjustment using three precision levelling screws on the instrument to make the rotational plane horizontal the surveyor does this with the use of a bull s eye level built into the instrument mount the surveyor looks through the eyepiece of telescope while an assistant holds a vertical level staff which is a graduated in inches or centimeters the level staff is placed vertically using a level with its foot on the point for which the level measurement is required the telescope

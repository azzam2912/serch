this protein is one of the 19 essential subunits that contributes to the complete assembly of 19s proteasome complex the gene psmd4 encodes one of the non atpase subunits of the 19s regulator base subunit rpn10 pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 10 and 21 the human psmd4 gene has 10 exons and locates at chromosome band 1q21 3 the human protein 26s proteasome non atpase regulatory subunit 4 is 41 kda in size and composed of 377 amino acids the calculated theoretical pi of this protein is 4 68 an alternative splicing during gene expression generates an isoform of the protein in which the amino acid sequence from 269 377 is missing while the amino sequence between 255 268 is replaced from dsddallkmtisqq to gerggirspgtagc 26s proteasome complex is usually consisted of a 20s core particle cp or 20s proteasome and one or two 19s regulatory particles rp or 19s proteasome on either one side or both side of the barrel shaped 20s the cp and rps pertain distinct structural characteristics and biological functions in brief 20s sub complex presents three types proteolytic activities including caspase like trypsin like and chymotrypsin like activities these proteolytic active sites located in

removing the vertices of an odd cycle transversal from a graph leaves a bipartite graph as the remaining induced subgraph a given formula 1 vertex graph formula 2 has an odd cycle transversal of size formula 3 if and only if the cartesian product of graphs formula 4 a graph consisting of two copies of formula 2 with corresponding vertices of each copy connected by the edges of a perfect matching has a vertex cover of size formula 6 the odd cycle transversal can be transformed into a vertex cover by including both copies of each vertex from the transversal and one copy of each remaining vertex selected from the two copies according to which side of the bipartition contains it in the other direction a vertex cover of formula 4 can be transformed into an odd cycle transversal by keeping only the vertices for which both copies are in the cover the vertices outside of the resulting transversal can be bipartitioned according to which copy of the vertex was used in the cover the problem of finding the smallest odd cycle transversal or equivalently the largest bipartite induced subgraph is also called odd cycle transversal and abbreviated as oct

the protoconch is small the apex is minutely globular and with the succeeding inflated whorl smooth the subsequent eight whorls are regularly increasing in diameter the suture is closely appressed obscure bordered in front by two undulated cords the anterior cord larger the axial sculpture consists of on the body whorl 18 equal narrow nodulous ribs with subequal interspaces the ribs extend well over the base from the anterior margin of the anal fasciole where they form a marked shoulder the incremental lines are hardly noticeable except on the fasciole the spiral sculpture consists of on the spire three strong cords the posterior slightly larger which become swollen and nodulous where they intersect the summit of the ribs on the body whorl there are 7 of these cords and 10 minor threads in front of the base and on the siphonal canal in the interspaces between the major cords there are from one to three fine threads which do not become nodulous the anal fasciole is narrow concave somewhat removed from the suture the sulcus shallow in the type specimen the outer lip is thin and sharp the inner lip is erased but if the specimen is immature the outer

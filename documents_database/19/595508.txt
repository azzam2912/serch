the radar is built by northrop grumman it is a solid state active electronically scanned array aesa radar composed of 1956 transmit receive modules each about the size of a gum stick it can perform a near instantaneous beam steering in the order of tens of nanoseconds the apg 77 provides 120 field of view in azimuth and elevation which is the highest possible value for a flat phased array antenna apg 77 has an operating range of while unconfirmed sources suggest an operating range of against a target a range of 400 km or more with the apg 77v1 with newer gaas modules is believed to be possible while using more narrow beams dead link 3 more than 100 apg 77 aesa radars have been produced to date by northrop grumman and much of the technology developed for the apg 77 is being used in the apg 81 radar for the f 35 lightning ii the apg 77v1 was installed on f 22 raptors from lot 5 and on this provided full air to ground functionality high resolution synthetic aperture radar mapping ground moving target indication and track gmti gmtt automatic cueing and recognition combat identification and many other

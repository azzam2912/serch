gravitational waves are perturbations in the theoretical curvature of spacetime caused by accelerated masses the existence of gravitational radiation is a specific prediction of general relativity but is a feature of all theories of gravity that obey special relativity since the 1960s gravitational wave detectors have been built and constantly improved the present day generation of resonant mass antennas and laser interferometers has reached the necessary sensitivity to detect gravitational waves from sources in the milky way gravitational wave observatories are the primary tool of gravitational wave astronomy a number of experiments have provided indirect evidence notably the observation of binary pulsars the orbits of which evolve precisely matching the predictions of energy loss through general relativistic gravitational wave emission the 1993 nobel prize in physics was awarded for this work in february 2016 the advanced ligo team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole merger the 2017 nobel prize in physics was awarded for this work the direct detection of gravitational waves is complicated by the extraordinarily small effect the waves produce on a detector the amplitude of a spherical wave falls off as the inverse of the distance from the source thus even waves

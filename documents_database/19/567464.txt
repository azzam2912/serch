it is a satire of lord bolingbroke s deism burke confronted bolingbroke not in the sphere of religion but civil society and government arguing that his arguments against revealed religion could apply to all institutions so close to bolingbroke s style was the work that burke s ironic intention was missed by some readers leading burke in his preface to the second edition 1757 to make plain that it was a satire nonetheless this work was considered by william godwin to be the first literary expression of philosophical anarchism most historians believe vindication was intended as satire but some others disagree for example murray rothbard argues that burke wrote the vindication in earnest but later wished to disavow it for political reasons rothbard s argument is based on a misunderstanding he believes it took nine years until 1765 for edmund burke to divulge that he was the author of the work and only claimed it to be a satire to save his then spawning political career in reality edmund burke reveals both his authorship and claims the book as a satire in the preface to its second edition published in 1757 long before he would embark upon a political career

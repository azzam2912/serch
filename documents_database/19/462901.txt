neural engineers are uniquely qualified to solve design problems at the interface of living neural tissue and non living constructs hetling 2008 the field of neural engineering draws on the fields of computational neuroscience experimental neuroscience clinical neurology electrical engineering and signal processing of living neural tissue and encompasses elements from robotics cybernetics computer engineering neural tissue engineering materials science and nanotechnology prominent goals in the field include restoration and augmentation of human function via direct interactions between the nervous system and artificial devices much current research is focused on understanding the coding and processing of information in the sensory and motor systems quantifying how this processing is altered in the pathological state and how it can be manipulated through interactions with artificial devices including brain computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics other research concentrates more on investigation by experimentation including the use of neural implants connected with external technology neurohydrodynamics is a division of neural engineering that focuses on hydrodynamics of the neurological system as neural engineering is a relatively new field information and research relating to it is comparatively limited although this is changing rapidly the first journals specifically devoted to neural engineering the journal of neural engineering and the

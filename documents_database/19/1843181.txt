it is a derivative of pyridine with a vinyl group in the 2 position next to the nitrogen it is a colorless liquid although samples are often brown it is used industrially as a precursor to specialty polymers and as an intermediate in the chemical pharmaceutical dye and photo industries it was first synthesized in 1887 a contemporary preparation entails treatment of 2 methylpyridine with formaldehyde followed by dehydration of the intermediate alcohol the reaction is carried out between 150 200 c in an autoclave the conversion must be kept relatively low with short reaction time to suppress the formation of byproducts after removal of unreacted 2 methylpyridine by distillation concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide is added to the residue and the resultant mixture is distilled under reduced pressure during distillation the dehydration of 2 2 pyridyl ethanol occurs to give 2 vinylpyridine which can be purified further by fractional distillation under reduced pressure in the presence of an inhibitor such as 4 tert butylcatechol an alternative synthesis involves the reaction of acrylonitrile and acetylene below 130 140 c in the presence of organocobalt compounds as a catalyst acrylonitrile is the solvent for the reaction vinylpyridine is sensitive to polymerization it

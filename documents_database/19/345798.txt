a tower testing station consists of two steel stands and one or more foundations on which a sample of the tower can be built the number of test conditions is normally limited to between six and eight individual cases with loading condition such as reduced wind and ice the towers to be tested are erected on rigid foundation and the wire ropes attached to the loading point required loading may either be applied by dead weights using scale pans winches or hydraulic rams in the latter cases a load cell or dyamometer is placed in the rigging adjacent to the point of loading at the structure the loading methods induce strain by pulling cables away from the tower to the specified loads the pulling load is indicated through a strain gauge placed on the pulling point loading points on a tower naturally encompasses longitudinal transverse and vertical components either as individual or a combined resultant load the degree of sophistication of the control equipment for the application and recording of the load varies considerably at individual test stations from individual load point application of individual load components with corresponding dial gauges to electronic equipment capable of applying all the loads

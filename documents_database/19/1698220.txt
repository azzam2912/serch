the potential impostor nature of sn 1961v was first identified by fritz zwicky in 1964 sn 1961v occurred in galaxy ngc 1058 about 9 3 mpc away about 30 million light years unlike many supernovae the progenitor star is tentatively known an extremely large very bright blue star similar to eta carinae mass estimates of the precursor star were as high as 2000 times the mass of the sun but these are likely to be extreme overestimates if sn 1961v was not a supernova then it was most likely an extremely large outburst by a luminous blue variable star the remnant of sn 1961v s explosion is expanding at 2 000 km s which is much slower than the majority of supernovae the profile of its light curve with a gradual climb to maximum brightness was unusual when compared to a supernova this unusual light curve led to suspicion that it was some other event if the star survived this would identify sn 1961v as an impostor supernova rather than a true supernova attempts to determine if the progenitor star is still present have been extensive and have included use of both the hubble space telescope and the spitzer space

ordinarily keys are generated by a certificate authority or a key generation center kgc who is given complete power and is implicitly trusted to prevent a complete breakdown of the system in the case of a compromised kgc the key generation process is split between the kgc and the user the kgc first generates a key pair where the private key is now the partial private key of the system the remainder of the key is a random value generated by the user and is never revealed to anyone not even the kgc all cryptographic operations by the user are performed by using a complete private key which involves both the kgc s partial key and the user s random secret value one disadvantage of this is that the identity information no longer forms the entire public key meaning the user s public key is not discoverable from only the user s identity string and the kgc s public key thus the user s public key must be published or otherwise obtained by other users one advantage of the system is that it is possible to verify that any such obtained public key belongs to the stated identity string in

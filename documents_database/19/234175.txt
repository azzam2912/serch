if formula 2 is equipped with the subspace topology then it is a topological space in its own right and is called a subspace of formula 1 subsets of topological spaces are usually assumed to be equipped with the subspace topology unless otherwise stated alternatively we can define the subspace topology for a subset formula 2 of formula 3 as the coarsest topology for which the inclusion map is continuous more generally suppose formula 14 is an injection from a set formula 2 to a topological space formula 3 then the subspace topology on formula 2 is defined as the coarsest topology for which formula 14 is continuous the open sets in this topology are precisely the ones of the form formula 19 for formula 20 open in formula 3 formula 2 is then homeomorphic to its image in formula 3 also with the subspace topology and formula 14 is called a topological embedding a subspace formula 2 is called an open subspace if the injection formula 14 is an open map i e if the forward image of an open set of formula 2 is open in formula 3 likewise it is called a closed subspace if the injection

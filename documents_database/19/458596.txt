the other natural isotope os has an extremely long half life 2 10 years and for practical purposes can be considered to be stable as well os is the daughter of re half life 4 56 10 years and is most often measured in an os os ratio this ratio as well as the re os ratio have been used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as meteoric rocks it has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the mantle roots of continental cratons however the most notable application of os in dating has been in conjunction with iridium to analyze the layer of shocked quartz along the cretaceous paleogene boundary that marks the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago there are also 30 artificial radioisotopes the longest lived of which is os with a half life of six years all others have half lives under 94 days there are also nine known nuclear isomers the longest lived of which is os with a half life of 13 10 hours

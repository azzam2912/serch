the support is of the distribution is indicated by the parameters a and b which are the minimum and maximum values respectively the distribution provides an alternative to the beta distribution such that it allows more density to be placed at the extremes of the bounded interval of support thus it is a bounded distribution that allows for outliers to have a greater chance of occurring than does the beta distribution if parameters of the beta distribution are and and if the mixture parameter is then the beta rectangular distribution has probability density function where formula 7 is the gamma function the cumulative distribution function is where formula 9 and formula 10 is the regularized incomplete beta function the pert distribution variation of the beta distribution is frequently used in pert critical path method cpm and other project management methodologies to characterize the distribution of an activity s time to completion in pert restrictions on the pert distribution parameters lead to shorthand computations for the mean and standard deviation of the beta distribution where a is the minimum b is the maximum and m is the mode or most likely value however the variance is seen to be a constant

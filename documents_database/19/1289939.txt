but irregular spatial and seasonal distribution coupled with high consumption in irrigation and urban water supply translates into water scarcity rapid economic growth and increased urbanization have also affected environmental quality and placed strains on the dr s water resources base in addition the dr is exposed to a number of natural hazards such as hurricanes storms floods drought earthquakes and fires global climate change is expected to induce permanent climate shocks to the caribbean region which will likely affect the dr in the form of sea level rise higher surface air and sea temperatures extreme weather events such as tropical storms and hurricanes increased rainfall intensity leading to both more frequent and severe flooding and more frequent and more severe el ni o like conditions water resources management in the country in particular water quality quantity and watershed management faces major challenges today despite of the lack of systematic data limiting an accurate and detailed assessment of the scope of the problems there is a consensus that i the overall poor quality of surface groundwater and coastal water resources is the result of a lack of waste water management and agricultural run off causing health problems that disproportionately affect

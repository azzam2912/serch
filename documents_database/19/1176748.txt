until that year dickson lake was entirely within chilean territory at the northern end of the torres del paine national park in the magallanes y la ant rtica chilena region but it was unified with a lake that began to form in the 1980s by defrosting the melting of the dickson cubo or cincuentenario and fr as or grande glaciers that lake was on the argentine side when the agreement was signed to specify the route of the limit from mount fitz roy to the daudet hill of 1998 in a sector adjacent to the los glaciares national park but without being part of it the lake is fed by the glacier that shares its name and is drained by the paine river it receives the waters of los perros river which starts at a proglacial lake that was formed during the retreat of los perros glacier administratively it is part of the argentine province of santa cruz while on the chilean side it belongs to the magallanes region

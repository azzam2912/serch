owing to the rigidity of the naphthalene skeleton these substituents on the 1 and 8 positions are constrained to be relatively close 2 5 which is within the van der waals radius for many atoms in contrast ortho substituents pendant from a benzene ring are separated by about 3 3 because of this unusual structural feature many unusual compounds are derived from peri naphthalenes one example is 1 8 bis dimethylamino naphthalene known as proton sponge because of its high affinity for protons its ammonium derivative has a pk of 12 7 the compound 1 8 bis dimethylboryl naphthalene is known as hydride sponge because of its high affinity for hydride it solubilizes potassium hydride other distinctive compounds include the diphosphine 1 8 bis diphenylphosphino naphthalene dppn and the disulfide both of which are ligand precursors several peri naphthalenes are prepared via nitrations dinitration of naphthalene gives 1 8 dinitronaphthalene which undergoes hydrogenation to the diamine the diamine can also be produced by reaction of the 1 8 diol with ammonia at high temperatures the peri naphthalene 1 amino naphthalene 8 sulfonic acid is a precursor to other peri naphthalenes it is prepared by nitration of naphthalene 1 sulfonic acid

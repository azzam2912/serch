it is defined as one tenth of a bar the unit used in the us is the foot sea water fsw based on standard gravity and a sea water density of 64 lb ft according to the us navy diving manual one fsw equals 0 30643 msw or though elsewhere it states that 33 fsw is one atmosphere which gives one fsw equal to about 0 445 psi the msw and fsw are the conventional units for measurement of diver pressure exposure used in decompression tables and the unit of calibration for pneumofathometers and hyperbaric chamber pressure gauges one atmosphere is approximately equal to 33 feet of sea water or 14 7 psi which gives 4 9 11 or about 0 445 psi per foot atmospheric pressure may be considered constant at sea level and minor fluctuations caused by the weather are usually ignored pressures measured in fsw and msw are gauge pressure relative to the surface pressure of 1 atm absolute except when a pressure difference is measured between the locks of a hyperbaric chamber which is also generally measured in fsw and msw the pressure of seawater at a depth of 33 feet equals one atmosphere the absolute

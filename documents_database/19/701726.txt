the information it writes to codice 6 includes example output of a program compiled on linux programmers can eliminate the assertions just by recompiling the program without changing the source code if the macro codice 10 is defined before the inclusion of codice 11 the codice 1 macro may be defined simply as and therefore has no effect on the compilation unit not even evaluating its argument therefore expressions passed to codice 1 must not contain side effects since they will not happen when debugging is disabled for instance will not read a line and not assign to x when debugging is disabled static assert sizeof int 20 i need huge integers c 11 added a similar macro codice 14 that computes the value and prints a message at compile time if it is false it is possible to simulate this using a macro and templates though most modern c compilers include built in support and they might not require the header file it is possible to simulate a static assertion in c using a macro codice 15 though the resulting error is cryptic this feature was formally added in c11 as the keyword codice 16 i 0

this measurement is especially important because loudspeakers being transducers have a higher level of distortion than other audio system components used in playback or sound reinforcement the standard way to test a loudspeaker requires an anechoic chamber with an acoustically transparent floor grid the measuring microphone is normally mounted on an unobtrusive boom to avoid reflections and positioned 1 metre in front of the drive units on axis with the high frequency driver while this will produce repeatable results such a free space measurement is not representative of performance in a room especially a small room for valid results at low frequencies a very large anechoic chamber is needed with large absorbent wedges on all sides most anechoic chambers are not designed for accurate measurement down to 20 hz an alternative is to simply lay the speaker on its back pointing at the sky on open grass ground reflection will still interfere but will be greatly reduced in the mid range because most speakers are directional and only radiate very low frequencies backwards putting absorbent material around the speaker will reduce mid range ripple by absorbing rear radiation at low frequencies the ground reflection is always in phase so that

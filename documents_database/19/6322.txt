it is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort heapsort or merge sort however insertion sort provides several advantages when people manually sort cards in a bridge hand most use a method that is similar to insertion sort insertion sort iterates consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list at each iteration insertion sort removes one element from the input data finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there it repeats until no input elements remain sorting is typically done in place by iterating up the array growing the sorted list behind it at each array position it checks the value there against the largest value in the sorted list which happens to be next to it in the previous array position checked if larger it leaves the element in place and moves to the next if smaller it finds the correct position within the sorted list shifts all the larger values up to make a space and inserts into that correct position the resulting array after k iterations has the property where the first k 1 entries are sorted 1 because the first entry

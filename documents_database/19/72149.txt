hence the quantity of mass is conserved over time the law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed although it may be rearranged in space or the entities associated with it may be changed in form for example in chemical reactions the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction thus during any chemical reaction and low energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system the total mass of the reactants or starting materials must be equal to the mass of the products the concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry mechanics and fluid dynamics historically mass conservation was demonstrated in chemical reactions independently by mikhail lomonosov and later rediscovered by antoine lavoisier in the late 18th century the formulation of this law was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry the conservation of mass only holds approximately and is considered part of a series of assumptions coming from classical mechanics the law has to be modified to comply with the laws of quantum mechanics and special relativity under the principle of mass energy

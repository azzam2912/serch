currents formally behave like schwartz distributions on a space of differential forms but in a geometric setting they can represent integration over a submanifold generalizing the dirac delta function or more generally even directional derivatives of delta functions multipoles spread out along subsets of m let formula 1 denote the space of smooth m forms with compact support on a smooth manifold formula 2 a current is a linear functional on formula 1 which is continuous in the sense of distributions thus a linear functional is an m dimensional current if it is continuous in the following sense if a sequence formula 5 of smooth forms all supported in the same compact set is such that all derivatives of all their coefficients tend uniformly to 0 when formula 6 tends to infinity then formula 7 tends to 0 the space formula 8 of m dimensional currents on formula 2 is a real vector space with operations defined by much of the theory of distributions carries over to currents with minimal adjustments for example one may define the support of a current formula 11 as the complement of the biggest open set formula 12 such that the linear subspace of formula

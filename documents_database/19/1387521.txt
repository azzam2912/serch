central to the imber goal is the development of a predictive understanding of how marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems respond to complex forcing such as large scale climatic variations changing physical dynamics carbon cycle chemistry and nutrient fluxes and the impacts of marine harvesting changes in marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems due to global change will also have consequences for the broader earth system an even greater challenge will be drawing together the natural and social science communities to study some of the key impacts and feedbacks between the marine and human systems imber website http www imber info the imber ipo coordinates and organises international activities of the project provides a structure for data management for imber projects ensures financial management of the project and promotes imber in the wider scientific community to have further information about imber project contact the imber ipo at imber imr no

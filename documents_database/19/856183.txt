it is typically used at compile time to find software bugs or to verify high level correctness properties of programs in java programs it can be used to ensure that a sort method correctly sorts a list for c programs it might look for places where a block of memory is not properly freed shape analysis has been applied to a variety of problems shape analysis is a form of pointer analysis although it is more precise than typical pointer analysis pointer analysis attempts to determine the set of objects to which a pointer can point called the points to set of the pointer unfortunately these analysis are necessarily approximate since a perfectly precise static analysis could solve the halting problem shape analysis can determine smaller more precise points to sets consider the following simple c program this program builds an array of objects processes them in some arbitrary way and then deletes them assuming that the codice 3 function is free of errors it is clear that the program is safe it never references freed memory and it deletes all the objects that it has constructed unfortunately most pointer analyses have difficulty analyzing this program precisely in order to

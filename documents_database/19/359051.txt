depending on the tectonic environment diapirs can range from idealized mushroom shaped rayleigh taylor instability type structures in regions with low tectonic stress such as in the gulf of mexico to narrow dikes of material that move along tectonically induced fractures in surrounding rock the term was introduced by the romanian geologist ludovic mrazek who was the first to understand the principle of salt tectonics and plasticity the term diapir may be applied to igneous structures but it is more commonly applied to non igneous relatively cold materials such as salt domes and mud diapirs in addition to earth based observations diapirism is thought to occur on neptune s moon triton jupiter s moon europa saturn s moon enceladus and uranus s moon miranda diapirs commonly intrude vertically upward along fractures or zones of structural weakness through denser overlying rocks because of density contrast between a less dense lower rock mass and overlying denser rocks the density contrast manifests as a force of buoyancy the process is known as diapirism the resulting structures are also referred to as piercement structures in the process segments of the existing strata can be disconnected and pushed upwards while moving higher they retain much

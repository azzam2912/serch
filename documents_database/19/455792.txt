with the indexing starting with the first 34 are f for the n values in addition to these proven fibonacci primes there have been found probable primes for except for the case n 4 all fibonacci primes have a prime index because if a divides b then formula 1 also divides formula 2 but not every prime is the index of a fibonacci prime f is prime for 8 of the first 10 primes p the exceptions are f 1 and f 4181 37 113 however fibonacci primes appear to become rarer as the index increases f is prime for only 26 of the 1 229 primes p below 10 000 the number of prime factors in the fibonacci numbers with prime index are the largest known certain fibonacci prime is f with 21925 digits it was proved prime by mathew steine and bouk de water in 2015 the largest known probable fibonacci prime is f it was found by henri lifchitz in 2018 it was proved by nick mackinnon that the only fibonacci numbers that are also members of the set of twin primes are 3 5 and 13 a prime formula 3 divides formula 4 if and only

it was identified with the discovery of waharoa ruwhenua by boessenecker and fordyce 2015 which added a new genus and species to a monophyletic family eomysticetidae boessenecker and fordyce 2015 characterize the species as follows waharoa ruwhenua shares tohoraata and tokarahia dorsoventrally shallow and wide occipital condyles a triangular anterior process and well developed incisural flange of the periotic with tohoraata and tokarahia a concave anterodorsal margin of the anterior process of the periotic and a smooth and transversely convex posterior bullar facet with tohoraata a distinct lateral tubercle on the anterior process and with eomysticetus and micromysticetus a short posterior process waharoa ruwhenua had a rostrum that was less flexible than those of modern edentulous mysticetes yet much more flexible than the rostra of toothed mysticetes this intermediate flexibility suggests that w ruwhenua harbored the most primitive form of a kinetic rostrum in the mysticeti waharoa ruwhenua had sulci and palatal foramina localized to the posterior half of the palate and lacked these features anteriorly suggesting that baleen was only present in the posterior palatal regions the posterior localization of baleen along with a delicate temporomandibular joint with a probable synovial capsule an anteroposteriorly expanding palate a non laterally

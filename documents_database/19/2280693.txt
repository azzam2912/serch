hillhouse was an inorganic chemist with a long standing interest in the chemistry of organotransition metal compounds at the university of chicago much of his work focused on creating organometallic compounds to stabilize and isolate reactive intermediates molecules that are proposed to exist briefly during a larger catalytic reaction progress he was born march 1 1955 in greenville south carolina and attended the university of south carolina in 1976 and received his ph d from indiana university in 1980 he then became a postdoctoral research associate at california institute of technology before taking a position in the department of chemistry at the university of chicago in 1983 while the early work of hillhouse focused on early transition metal chemistry his later career efforts were dedicated towards base metals for example in 2001 hillhouse and co workers synthesized a complex that refuted the notion that it was impossible for late transition metals like nickel to form multiple bonds with heteroatoms the result was a molecule that he affectionately referred to as double nickel which possessed an indisputable nickel nitrogen double bond later the group published a study showcasing that one can also synthesize and isolated an electronically similar phosphinidine species additionally

while vaccinium as a larger group is characterized by an inferior ovary and brightly colored berries that are indehiscent the hawaiian group has been traditionally distinguished as having uniquely well developed calyx lobes and longer calyx tube depth more cylindrical corolla shape as compared to urceolate globose reduced or absent staminal awns as opposed to well developed longer pedicel length and compared with temperate relatives much longer leaf persistence they are terrestrial or epiphytic shrubs typically 1 6 feet in height occasionally up to 10 feet ranging widely throughout the hawaiian islands over relatively high elevation 500 3 700 m the three species thrive in many plant communities except for vaccinium reticulatum which tends to thrive around lava flows yet is not limited to them within the group distinct taxa vary in berry color red yellow black blue bloom color white red pink and green foliage shape and size and pedicel length vaccinium reticulatum and vaccinium dentatum are evergreen while vaccinium calycinum is deciduous all three species tend to fruit and flower throughout the year but maximum flower and fruit production generally occurs during may july outcrossing between all three species has been successful and many hybrids have been described

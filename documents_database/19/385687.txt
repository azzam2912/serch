quantum systems with two possible states are sometimes called two level systems essentially all occurrences of doublets in nature arise from rotational symmetry spin 1 2 is associated with the fundamental representation of the lie group su 2 the group that defines rotational symmetry in three dimensional space the term doublet dates back to the 19th century when it was observed that certain spectral lines of an ionized excited gas would split into two under the influence of a strong magnetic field in an effect known as the anomalous zeeman effect such spectral lines were observed not only in the laboratory but also in astronomical spectroscopy observations allowing astronomers to deduce the existence of and measure the strength of magnetic fields around the sun stars and galaxies conversely it was the observation of doublets in spectroscopy that allowed physicists to deduce that the electron had a spin and that furthermore the magnitude of the spin had to be 1 2 see the history section of the article on spin physics for greater detail doublets continue to play an important role in physics for example the healthcare technology of magnetic resonance imaging is based on nuclear magnetic resonance in this technology

the encoded protein interacts with adenomatosis polyposis coli catenin cadherin associated protein beta 1 glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta protein phosphatase 2 and itself this protein functions as a negative regulator of the wingless type mmtv integration site family member 1 wnt signaling pathway and can induce apoptosis the crystal structure of a portion of this protein alone and in a complex with other proteins has been resolved mutations in this gene have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma hepatoblastomas ovarian endometriod adenocarcinomas and medulloblastomas two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene the full length human protein comprises 862 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 96 kda the n terminal rgs domain a gsk3 kinase interacting peptide of axin1 and homologs of the c terminal dix domains have been solved at atomic resolution large wnt downregulating central regions have been characterized as intrinsically disordered by biophysical experiments and bioinformatic analysis biophysical destabilization of the folded rgs domain induces formation of nanoaggregates that expose and locally concentrate intrinsically disordered regions which in turn misregulate wnt signalling many other large idps are affected by missense mutations such as brca1 adenomatous polyposis coli apc creb binding protein

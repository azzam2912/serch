most commonly used to transport oil and gas they are designed to function in a sub marine environment withstanding the effects of raised external pressure salt water corrosion and bubbles or debris in the material carried subsea valves undergo stringent testing to ensure high reliability subsea valves are used in sub marine environments which can range in depth from shallow water usually down to a depth of 75 meters to deep water down to 3500 meters various industries use subsea valves with the oil and gas sector accounting for the majority where there is a need to move material from to or below the seabed external environmental factors to be considered specifically for subsea valves include waterproofing increased ambient pressure and long term corrosion from the high salt content of seawater internal factors to consider for subsea valves are related to the type of flow material what passes through the valve apparatus typically in subsea environments the flows will either be liquid or gas based but due to location of the operation the flow can contain a significant amount of sand and debris this can present internal structural challenges one of the most challenging aspects for subsea valve deployment is

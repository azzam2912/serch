all of the following techniques yield the same matrix function but the domains on which the function is defined may differ if the real function has the taylor expansion then a matrix function can be defined by substituting by a matrix the powers become matrix powers the additions become matrix sums and the multiplications become scaling operations if the real series converges for formula 2 then the corresponding matrix series will converge for matrix argument if formula 3 for some matrix norm formula 4 which satisfies formula 5 if the matrix is diagonalizable the problem may be reduced to an array of the function on each eigenvalue this is to say we can find a matrix and a diagonal matrix such that formula 6 applying the power series definition to this decomposition we find that is defined by where formula 8 denote the diagonal entries of d for example suppose one is seeking 1 for one has for application of the formula then simply yields likewise all complex matrices whether they are diagonalizable or not have a jordan normal form formula 14 where the matrix j consists of jordan blocks consider these blocks separately and apply the power series to

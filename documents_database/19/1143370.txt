the cytochrome p450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol steroids and other lipids this protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and functions as a 19 hydroxylase of the arachidonic acid metabolite prostaglandin h2 pgh2 and the dihomo linolenic acid metabolite pgh1 in seminal vesicles this gene is part of a cluster of cytochrome p450 genes on chromosome 19 another member of this family cyp4f3 is approximately 18 kb away in addition to seminal vesicles cyp4f8 is expressed in kidney prostate epidermis and corneal epithelium and its mrna has been found in retina cyp4f8 is also greatly up regulated in psoriatic skin in addition to its ability to metabolize and presumably thereby to inactivate or reduce the activity of pgh2 and pgh1 cyp4f8 adds hydroxyl residues to carbons 18 and 19 of arachidonic acid and dihomo linolenic acid cyp458 possesses epoxygenase activity in that it metabolizes the omega 3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid dha and eicosapentaenoic acid epa to their corresponding epoxides the epoxydocosapentaenoic acids edps and epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids eeqs respectively the enzyme metabolizes dha primarily to 19 r 20 s epoxyeicosapentaenoic acid and 19 s 20 r epoxyeicosapentaenoic acid isomers termed

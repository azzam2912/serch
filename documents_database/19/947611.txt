in many ways they are analogous to ocean tides atmospheric tides can be excited by the largest amplitude atmospheric tides are mostly generated in the troposphere and stratosphere when the atmosphere is periodically heated as water vapor and ozone absorb solar radiation during the day these tides propagate away from the source regions and ascend into the mesosphere and thermosphere atmospheric tides can be measured as regular fluctuations in wind temperature density and pressure although atmospheric tides share much in common with ocean tides they have two key distinguishing features at ground level atmospheric tides can be detected as regular but small oscillations in surface pressure with periods of 24 and 12 hours however at greater heights the amplitudes of the tides can become very large in the mesosphere heights of 50 100 km atmospheric tides can reach amplitudes of more than 50 m s and are often the most significant part of the motion of the atmosphere the reason for this dramatic growth in amplitude from tiny fluctuations near the ground to oscillations that dominate the motion of the mesosphere lies in the fact that the density of the atmosphere decreases with increasing height as tides or waves propagate

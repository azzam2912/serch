the test aims to find the specific gene types a genotype of the patient that will determine how he or she metabolizes certain medicines therefore guides the doctors to prescribe medicine for best effectiveness and least side effects the amplichip cyp450 test uses micro array technology from affymetrix genechip to determine the genotype of the patient in terms of two cytochrome p450 enzymes 2d6 and 2c19 cyp2d6 and cyp2c19 belong to the cytochrome p450 oxidase family cyp2d6 has over 90 variants 2c19 has mainly three they are responsible for the majority of the inter individual variability in the ability to metabolize drugs there are four phenotypes of cyp2d6 poor metabolizer pm intermediate metabolizer im extensive normal metabolizer em and ultrarapid metabolizer um for cyp2c19 there are only two phenotypes pm and em if a substrate of the enzyme is given to the patient as a medication and if the patient has reduced cyp2d6 or cyp2c19 activity the patient will have elevated drug concentration in their body and therefore severe side effects may occur on the other hand for the um patient the drug concentration might be too low to have a therapeutic effect so testing the phenotype of the patient

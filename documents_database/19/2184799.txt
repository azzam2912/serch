he is the emeritus professor of biosensors at the university of twente he is the inventor of the ion sensitive field effect transistor isfet sensor bergveld s work has focused on electrical engineering and biomedical technology bergveld was born in oosterwolde friesland on 26 january 1940 in 1960 he started studying electrical engineering at the eindhoven university of technology he had preferred to study biomedical engineering but that was not available between 1964 and 1965 he did a master s degree at the philips natuurkundig laboratorium in the latter half of the 1960s bergveld started working as a scientific employee at the technische hogeschool twente which later became the university of twente intrigued by discovering and measuring the origin of electronic activity in the human brain bergveld started working on a new technique in 1970 he completed the development of the ion sensitive field effect transistor isfet sensor it was based on his earlier research on the mosfet metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor which he realized could be adapted into a biosensor for electrochemical and biological applications in 1973 he earned his phd at twente with a dissertation which delved deeper into the possibilities of isfet sensors bergveld worked

standards implementing differential ttl include rs 422 it enables electronic systems to be relatively immune to noise normal ttl signals are single ended which means that each signal consists of a voltage on one wire referenced to a system ground the low voltage level is zero to 0 8 volts and the high voltage level is 2 volts to 5 volts a differential ttl signal consists of two such wires also referenced to a system ground the logic level on one wire is always the complement of the other the principle is similar to that of low voltage differential signaling lvds but with different voltage levels differential ttl is used in preference to single ended ttl for long distance signaling in a long cable stray electromagnetic fields in the environment or stray currents in the system ground can induce unwanted voltages that cause errors at the receiver with a differential pair of wires roughly the same unwanted voltage is induced in each wire the receiver subtracts the voltages on the two wires so that the unwanted voltage disappears and only the voltage created by the driver remains a second advantage of differential ttl is that the differential pair of wires

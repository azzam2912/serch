primary melts have not undergone any differentiation and represent the starting composition of a magma in nature primary melts are rarely seen some leucosomes of migmatites are examples of primary melts primary melts derived from the mantle are especially important and are known as primitive melts or primitive magmas by finding the primitive magma composition of a magma series it is possible to model the composition of the rock from which a melt was formed which is important because we have little direct evidence of the earth s mantle where it is impossible to find the primitive or primary magma composition it is often useful to attempt to identify a parental melt a parental melt is a magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemistries has been derived by the processes of igneous differentiation it need not be a primitive melt for instance a series of basalt lava flows is assumed to be related to one another a composition from which they could reasonably be produced by fractional crystallization is termed a parental melt to prove this fractional crystallization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share a common parental melt fractional crystallization and accumulation

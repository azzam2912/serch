it is the successor to the zeep reactor designed by aecl for candu reactor support the unit saw first criticality on 7 september 1960 the reactor is still operating at chalk river where it is used for reactor physics and nuclear fuel research the zed 2 is a low power 200 w tank type 3 36 meter diameter 3 35 meter high heavy water moderated reactor capable of a peak flux of 10 n cm s seven special zirconium alloy fuel assemblies are used and reactor control is via moderator level adjustment liquid light or heavy water and gas co coolants can be used and be heated to 300 c at 8 6 mpa while the heavy water moderator can be heated or cooled independently of the coolant in the zr assemblies zed 2 has also been used for definitive studies of the effects of heavy water and alternative ordinary light water and organic coolants sufficient canflex 43 element bundles are being built containing seu fuel to provide full core simulation for the advanced candu reactor acr project in november 2010 the american nuclear society officially honoured the zed 2 reactor with the title of nuclear historic landmark recognising its

a wavefunction is a bloch wave if it has the form where r is position is the bloch wave u is a periodic function with the same periodicity as the crystal k is a vector of real numbers called the crystal wave vector e is euler s number and i is the imaginary unit in other words if we multiply a plane wave by a periodic function we get a bloch wave bloch waves are important because of bloch s theorem which states that the energy eigenstates for an electron in a crystal can be written as bloch waves more precisely it states that the electron wave functions in a crystal have a basis consisting entirely of bloch wave energy eigenstates this fact underlies the concept of electronic band structures these bloch wave energy eigenstates are written with subscripts as where n is a discrete index called the band index which is present because there are many different bloch waves with the same k each has a different periodic component u within a band i e for fixed n varies continuously with k as does its energy also for any reciprocal lattice vector k therefore all distinct bloch waves occur

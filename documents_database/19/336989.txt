ioc inverts the flow of control as compared to traditional control flow in ioc custom written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework a software architecture with this design inverts control as compared to traditional procedural programming in traditional programming the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks but with inversion of control it is the framework that calls into the custom or task specific code inversion of control is used to increase modularity of the program and make it extensible and has applications in object oriented programming and other programming paradigms the term was used by michael mattsson in a thesis taken from there by stefano mazzocchi and popularized by him in 1999 in a defunct apache software foundation project avalon then further popularized in 2004 by robert c martin and martin fowler the term is related to but different from the dependency inversion principle which concerns itself with decoupling dependencies between high level and low level layers through shared abstractions the general concept is also related to event driven programming in that it is often implemented using ioc so

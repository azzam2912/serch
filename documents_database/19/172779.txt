the kuiper belt scattered disk and oort cloud are three conventional divisions of this volume of space the catalog of minor planets contains 665 numbered tnos in addition there are more than 2 000 unnumbered tnos first observed between 1993 and 2019 this list consists of all types of tno subgroups classical kuiper belt objects also known as cubewanos the resonant trans neptunian objects with their and higher order resonant subgroups the scattered disc objects sdos and the extreme trans neptunian objects including the esdos eddos and sednoids which have a semi major axis of at least 150 au and a perihelion closest approach to the sun greater than that of neptune the list also contains several centaurs if the object s orbit has a sufficiently large semi major axis a centaurs have unstable orbits in which the perihelion q is well inside of neptune s orbit but the farthest point aphelion q is very distant the first tno to be discovered was pluto in 1930 it became the namesake of a larger group of resonant objects called plutinos another such resonant subgroup are the twotinos it took more than 60 years to discover a second tno albion provisionally known

it was a single person aircraft with an annular wing designed to take off and land vertically therefore requiring no runway and very little space the sole prototype was destroyed on its ninth flight during the 1950s there were many attempts to design aircraft that could fly conventionally after a vertical take off and then land vertically as the thrust to weight ratio of turbojet engines increased sufficiently for a single engine be able to lift an aircraft designers began to investigate ways of maintaining stability beginning in 1956 the french engine manufacturer snecma built a series of wingless test rigs called the atar volant as precursors to a winged aircraft only the first of these was unpiloted and the second flew freely both stabilized by gas jets on outrigger pipes the third had a tilting seat to allow the pilot to sit upright when the fuselage was level and had the lateral air intakes planned for the free flying aircraft though it always operated attached to a movable cradle the pilot for these experiments was auguste morel the c 450 col opt re built by nord aviation had a central core like an atar volant surrounded by an annular

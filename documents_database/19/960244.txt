it was developed by cardion electronics for the u s navy under a contract awarded in 1971 it was originally developed for a class of ships known as patrol frigates but it was also installed on numerous cruisers destroyers and minesweepers it is an i band radar and its antenna consists of two waveguide slotted arrays mounted back to back one array provides linear polarisation and the other provides circular polarisation polarisation is user selectable and the circular polarised array is more effective in reducing returns from precipitation the effective range of the radar is from 50 feet to beyond 50 miles it is primarily used to detect other ships coastlines and navigation hazards the sensitivity time control automatically adjusts the gain of the rf receiver from low to high based on the time elapsed from the last transmitter pulse this helps to adjust for the fact that near by targets generate a larger return than distant targets of the same size the fast time constant filtering helps to remove targets which have a very large range size like clouds while passing targets with a smaller range size like ships or aircraft the sector radiate allows the operator to turn

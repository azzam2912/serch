it states that in a crystalline solid subject to a small strain the positions of the atoms within the crystal lattice follow the overall strain of the medium the currently accepted form is max born s refinement of cauchy s original hypothesis which was used to derive the equations satisfied by the cauchy stress tensor the approximation generally holds for face centered and body centered cubic crystal systems for complex lattices such as diamond however the rule has to be modified to allow for internal degrees of freedom between the sublattices the approximation can then be used to obtain bulk properties of crystalline materials such as stress strain relationship for crystalline bodies of finite size the effect of surface stress is also significant however the standard cauchy born rule cannot deduce the surface properties to overcome this limitation park et al 2006 proposed a surface cauchy born rule several modified forms of the cauchy born rule have also been proposed to cater to crystalline bodies having special shapes arroyo belytschko 2002 proposed an exponential cauchy born rule for modeling of mono layered crystalline sheets as two dimensional continuum shells kumar et al 2015 proposed a helical cauchy born rule for

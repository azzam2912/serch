despite being discovered only 10 days after interstellar asteroid 1i oumuamua it was not announced until march 2018 along with c 2018 c2 lemmon which was believed to be another hyperbolic asteroid at the time as its orbit is not strongly hyperbolic beyond most oort cloud comets based on the absolute magnitude of 10 6 it may measure tens of kilometers in diameter as of august 2018 there is only 1 hyperbolic asteroid known oumuamua but hundreds of hyperbolic comets are known although c 2017 u7 s orbit is no longer bound to the solar system unlike oumuamua it is probably not an interstellar object it had an inbound orbital period of roughly 800000 years its point of origin is inclined only 3 5 degrees from the galactic plane but its aphelion points roughly to the galactic anticenter so if it did somehow originate from interstellar space with a typical solar system velocity which is highly unlikely it would have been travelling on an unusual orbit directly into the galactic core from beyond the sun s orbit around the milky way a barycentric orbit of c 2017 u7 however shows that it is only a very distant solar system object

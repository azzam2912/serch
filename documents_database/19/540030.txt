it provides a method for constructing band limited functions to overcome the effects of intersymbol interference when consecutive symbols are transmitted over a channel by a linear modulation such as ask qam etc the impulse response or equivalently the frequency response of the channel causes a transmitted symbol to be spread in the time domain this causes intersymbol interference because the previously transmitted symbols affect the currently received symbol thus reducing tolerance for noise the nyquist theorem relates this time domain condition to an equivalent frequency domain condition the nyquist criterion is closely related to the nyquist shannon sampling theorem with only a differing point of view if we denote the channel impulse response as formula 1 then the condition for an isi free response can be expressed as for all integers formula 3 where formula 4 is the symbol period the nyquist theorem says that this is equivalent to where formula 6 is the fourier transform of formula 1 this is the nyquist isi criterion this criterion can be intuitively understood in the following way frequency shifted replicas of h f must add up to a constant value in practice this criterion is applied to baseband filtering by regarding

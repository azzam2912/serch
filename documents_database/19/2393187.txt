established in 2005 the wtccc aims to conduct genome wide association studies gwass to shed light on the genetic architecture of common human diseases the founding chairman of the consortium was university of oxford statistician peter donnelly the consortium was funded by 9 million from the wellcome trust according to the consortium s website it has identified approximately 90 new susceptibility loci for common human diseases the consortium s initial goal was to conduct large gwass for eight common human diseases tuberculosis coronary heart disease type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis bipolar disorder and hypertension these gwass included a total of 19 000 subjects of whom 2 000 had one of the eight diseases and an additional 3 000 served as controls the study participants were genotyped using affymetrix s genechip human mapping 500k array set and genotype calling was conducted with the chiamo algorithm the results of the wtccc s initial research were reported in nature in 2007 the research identified 24 genetic association signals that were statistically significant at p london news conference donnelly said if you think of the genome as a very long road that you are trying

the precise way in which they are constructed varies with the main types of mechanical planimeter being polar linear and prytz or hatchet planimeters the swiss mathematician jakob amsler laffon built the first modern planimeter in 1854 the concept having been pioneered by johann martin hermann in 1814 many developments followed amsler s famous planimeter including electronic versions the amsler polar type consists of a two bar linkage at the end of one link is a pointer used to trace around the boundary of the shape to be measured the other end of the linkage pivots freely on a weight that keeps it from moving near the junction of the two links is a measuring wheel of calibrated diameter with a scale to show fine rotation and worm gearing for an auxiliary turns counter scale as the area outline is traced this wheel rolls on the surface of the drawing the operator sets the wheel turns the counter to zero and then traces the pointer around the perimeter of the shape when the tracing is complete the scales at the measuring wheel show the shape s area when the planimeter s measuring wheel moves perpendicular to its axis it rolls

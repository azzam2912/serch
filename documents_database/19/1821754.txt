the primary concern of this methodology is to establish structure reactivity selectivity relationships of catalysts and thereby yield information about mechanisms other uses include those in engineering improvements to existing catalytic materials and processes and in developing new ones in the context of organometallic catalysis an in situ reaction involves the real time measurement of a catalytic process using techniques such as mass spectrometry nmr infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography to help gain insight into functionality of the catalyst approximately 90 of industrial precursor chemicals are synthesized using catalysts understanding the catalytic mechanism and active site is crucial to creating catalysts with optimal efficiency and maximal product yield in situ reactor cell designs typically are incapable of pressure and temperature consistency required for true catalytic reaction studies making these cells insufficient several spectroscopic techniques require liquid helium temperatures making them inappropriate for real world studies of catalytic processes therefore the operando reaction method must involve in situ spectroscopic measurement techniques but under true catalytic kinetic conditions operando latin for working spectroscopy refers to continuous spectra collection of a working catalyst allowing for simultaneous evaluation of both structure and activity selectivity of the catalyst the term operando first appeared in catalytic

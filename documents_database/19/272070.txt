it is the southward continuation of the much deeper kermadec trench it lies in the hikurangi margin subduction zone which is the southern extension of the kermadec tonga subduction zone the hikurangi margin is the subduction zone where the thick oceanic hikurangi plateau is subducting beneath continental crust of the indo australian plate by contrast the kermadec and tonga trenches represent the parts of the subduction zone where oceanic crust of the pacific plate is subducting beneath oceanic crust of the indo australian plate although shallower than the trenches north of it the hikurangi trench reaches depths of 3 000 metres as close as 80 kilometres from shore its maximum depth is about at the southern end of the trench off the coast of the marlborough region the seabed rises sharply and because of the prevailing winds and tides in this area many deep water species are found close to the shore this food source attracts the whales for which the town of kaikoura is famous the plate boundary continues inland along the marlborough fault system linking through to the alpine fault here the plates converge much more obliquely exhibiting transpression instead of subduction

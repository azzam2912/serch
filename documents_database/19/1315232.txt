six u s government organizations recently sponsored the face recognition grand challenge frgc face recognition vendor test frvt 2006 and the iris challenge evaluation ice 2006 results from the frgc and frvt 2006 documented two orders of magnitude improvement in the performance of face recognition under full frontal controlled conditions over the last 14 years for the first time ice 2006 provided an independent assessment of multiple iris recognition algorithms on the same data set however further advances in these technologies are needed to meet the full range of operational requirements many of these requirements focus on biometric samples taken under less than ideal conditions for example building on the challenge problem and evaluation paradigm of frgc frvt 2006 ice 2005 and ice 2006 the multiple biometric grand challenge mbgc will address these problem areas the primary goal of the mbgc is to investigate test and improve performance of face and iris recognition technology on both still and video imagery through a series of challenge problems and evaluation the mbgc seeks to reach this goal through several technology development areas the mbgc will consist of a set of challenge problems designed to advance the current state of technology and conclude

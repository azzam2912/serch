color moments are mainly used for color indexing purposes as features in image retrieval applications in order to compare how similar two images are based on color usually one image is compared to a database of digital images with pre computed features in order to find and retrieve a similar image each comparison between images results in a similarity score and the lower this score is the more identical the two images are supposed to be color moments are scaling and rotation invariant it is usually the case that only the first three color moments are used as features in image retrieval applications as most of the color distribution information is contained in the low order moments since color moments encode both shape and color information they are a good feature to use under changing lighting conditions but they cannot handle occlusion very successfully color moments can be computed for any color model three color moments are computed per channel e g 9 moments if the color model is rgb and 12 moments if the color model is cmyk computing color moments is done in the same way as computing moments of a probability distribution the first color moment can

while it is unknown how the azaspirocyclic core of the pseurotin family of natural products is made the post polyketide synthase modifications are known in vivo and in vitro studies showed the unique mechanism involved in the modification ezymes psoc psod psoe and psof psod codes for a cytochrome p450 which is responsible for oxidizing the benzyl carbon c17 to the conjugated ketone psoc codes for a methyltransferase which methylates the tertiary alcohol closest to the benzoyl moiety on c8 psoe is predicted to be a glutathione s transferase gene and isomerizes the c c bond furthest down the tail from the e stereoisomer to the z stereoisomer psof is unique in that its gene is encoded separate from the pseurotin gene cluster and is responsible for the epoxidation of the trans double bond that remains in the tail this epoxide is spontaneously hydrolyzed by either an sn2 mechanism to form pseurotin a or by an sn2 mechanism to form pseurotin d

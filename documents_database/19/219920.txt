it is substantially prestressed compressed during its fabrication in a manner that strengthens it against tensile forces which will exist when in service this compression is produced by the tensioning of high strength tendons located within or adjacent to the concrete and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service tendons may consist of single wires multi wire strands or threaded bars that are most commonly made from high tensile steels carbon fiber or aramid fiber the essence of prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied the resulting material has the characteristics of high strength concrete when subject to any subsequent compression forces and of ductile high strength steel when subject to tension forces this can result in improved structural capacity and or serviceability compared with conventionally reinforced concrete in many situations in a prestressed concrete member the internal stresses are introduced in a planned manner so that the stresses resulting from the superimposed loads are counteracted to the desired degree prestressed concrete is used in a wide range of building and civil structures where its improved performance can allow for longer spans reduced structural thicknesses and material savings compared with simple reinforced

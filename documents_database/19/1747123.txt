like computational chemistry or computational physics it is both a specific branch of theoretical astrophysics and an interdisciplinary field relying on computer science mathematics and wider physics computational astrophysics is most often studied through an applied mathematics or astrophysics programme at phd level well established areas of astrophysics employing computational methods include magnetohydrodynamics astrophysical radiative transfer stellar and galactic dynamics and astrophysical fluid dynamics a recently developed field with interesting results is numerical relativity many astrophysicists use computers in their work and a growing number of astrophysics departments now have research groups specially devoted to computational astrophysics important research initiatives include the us department of energy doe scidac collaboration for astrophysics and the now defunct european astrosim collaboration a notable active project is the international virgo consortium which focuses on cosmology in august 2015 during the general assembly of the international astronomical union a new commission c b1 on computational astrophysics was inaugurated therewith recognizing the importance of astronomical discovery by computing important techniques of computational astrophysics include particle in cell pic and the closely related particle mesh pm n body simulations monte carlo methods as well as grid free with smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph being an important example and

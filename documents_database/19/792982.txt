they exist in aquatic and terrestrial environments as well as the atmosphere microorganisms in the external environment have existed on earth for 3 5 billion years exogenous bacteria can be either benign or pathogenic pathogenic exogenous bacteria can enter a closed biological system and cause disease such as cholera which is induced by a waterborne microbe that infects the human intestine exogenous bacteria can be introduced into a closed ecosystem as well and have mutualistic benefits for both the microbe and the host a prominent example of this concept is bacterial flora which consists of exogenous bacteria ingested and endogenously colonized during the early stages of life bacteria that are part of normal internal ecosystems also known as bacterial flora are called endogenous bacteria a significant amount of prominent diseases are induced by exogenous bacteria such as gonorrhea meningitis tetanus and syphilis pathogenic exogenous bacteria can enter a host via cutaneous transmission inhalation and consumption only a minority of bacteria species cause disease in humans and many species colonize in the human body to create an ecosystem known as microbiota bacterial flora is endogenous bacteria which is defined as bacteria that naturally reside in a closed system disease can occur

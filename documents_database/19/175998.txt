the solution set of the single equation formula 5 is the set 0 2 for any non zero polynomial formula 6 over the complex numbers in one variable the solution set is made up of finitely many points 3 however for a complex polynomial in more than one variable the solution set has no isolated points in algebraic geometry solution sets are called algebraic sets if there are no inequalities over the reals and with inequalities there are called semialgebraic sets more generally the solution set to an arbitrary collection e of relations e i varying in some index set i for a collection of unknowns formula 7 supposed to take values in respective spaces formula 8 is the set s of all solutions to the relations e where a solution formula 9 is a family of values formula 10 such that substituting formula 7 by formula 9 in the collection e makes all relations true the above meaning is a special case of this one if the set of polynomials f if interpreted as the set of equations f x 0

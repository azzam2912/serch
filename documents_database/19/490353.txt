the protein possesses tyrosine kinase activity the primary single chain precursor protein is post translationally cleaved to produce the alpha and beta subunits which are disulfide linked to form the mature receptor met is a single pass tyrosine kinase receptor essential for embryonic development organogenesis and wound healing hepatocyte growth factor scatter factor hgf sf and its splicing isoform nk1 nk2 are the only known ligands of the met receptor met is normally expressed by cells of epithelial origin while expression of hgf sf is restricted to cells of mesenchymal origin when hgf sf binds its cognate receptor met it induces its dimerization through a not yet completely understood mechanism leading to its activation abnormal met activation in cancer correlates with poor prognosis where aberrantly active met triggers tumor growth formation of new blood vessels angiogenesis that supply the tumor with nutrients and cancer spread to other organs metastasis met is deregulated in many types of human malignancies including cancers of kidney liver stomach breast and brain normally only stem cells and progenitor cells express met which allows these cells to grow invasively in order to generate new tissues in an embryo or regenerate damaged tissues in an adult however

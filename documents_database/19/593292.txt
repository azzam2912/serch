it is also one of the main tools in the study of the spectrum of the laplace operator and is thus of some auxiliary importance throughout mathematical physics the heat kernel represents the evolution of temperature in a region whose boundary is held fixed at a particular temperature typically zero such that an initial unit of heat energy is placed at a point at time t 0 the most well known heat kernel is the heat kernel of d dimensional euclidean space r which has the form of a time varying gaussian function this solves the heat equation for all t 0 and x y r where is the laplacian operator with the initial condition where is a dirac delta distribution and the limit is taken in the sense of distributions to wit for every smooth function of compact support on a more general domain in r such an explicit formula is not generally possible the next simplest cases of a disc or square involve respectively bessel functions and jacobi theta functions nevertheless the heat kernel for say the dirichlet problem still exists and is smooth for t 0 on arbitrary domains and indeed on any riemannian manifold with boundary

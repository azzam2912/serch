the boats had hulls that conformed to the basic design laid down by rnli naval architect george lennox watson during the late victorian period the vast majority of lifeboats in service with the rnli were of the self righting type the disadvantage of the self righters was their lack of stability and to meet the requirements of stations which preferred the stability of a non self righting type g l watson conceived the hull type that bore his name the first watson was built in 1888 and was 42 ft 3in long over the next 27 years 42 watson class pulling and sailing types were built at a variety of lengths the commonest being the 38 footer in 1904 the rnli began experimenting with motor lifeboats when a 38 ft self righter was converted in 1906 three other lifeboats were converted to motor but none of these was a watson however when in 1908 the first new build motor lifeboats were constructed two of them were watson types over the next 55 years 171 boats of the various watson classes were built there was of course no connection between a 1908 40 ft watson and a 1963 47 ft watson

three alternative transcripts encoding the same protein differing only in their 5 utrs have been identified for this gene loss of function mutations in pdcd10 result in the onset of cerebral cavernous malformations ccm illness therefore this gene is also called ccm3 cerebral cavernous malformations ccms are vascular malformations in the brain and spinal cord made of dilated capillary vessels ccm3 encodes a protein called programmed cell death 10 pdcd10 the function of this protein has only recently begun to be understood pdcd10 has roles in vascular development and vegf signaling1 apoptosis and functions as part of a larger signaling complex that includes germinal center kinase iii specifically pdcd10 has been shown to interact with rp6 213h19 1 stk25 strn strn3 mobkl3 cttnbp2nl stk24 and fam40a model organisms have been used in the study of pdcd10 function a conditional knockout mouse line called pdcd10 was generated as part of the international knockout mouse consortium program a high throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion twenty five tests were carried out on mutant mice and two significant abnormalities were

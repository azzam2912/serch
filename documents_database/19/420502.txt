lncap cells are androgen sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cells derived from the left supraclavicular lymph node metastasis from a 50 year old caucasian male in 1977 they are adherent epithelial cells growing in aggregates and as single cells one major obstacle to the conducting the most clinically relevant prostate cancer pca research has been the lack of cell lines that closely mimic human disease progression two hallmarks of metastatic human prostate cancer include the shift of aggressive pca from androgen sensitivity to an androgen insensitive ai state and the propensity of pca to metastasize to bone although the generation of ai cell lines has been quite successful as demonstrated in the classic cell lines du145 and pc3 the behavior of these cells in bone does not fully mimic clinical human disease it is well established that human pca bone metastasis form osteoblastic lesions rather than osteolytic lesions seen in other cancers like breast cancer similarly pc 3 and du145 cells form osteolytic tumors to develop an ai pca cell model that more closely mimics clinical disease lncap sublines have been generated to provide the most clinically relevant tissue culture tools to date the lncap cell line was established from a

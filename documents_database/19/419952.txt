brown charlie brown was a lead engineer on the project which started in 1951 the project initially examined the feasibility of constructing a transistorized airborne digital computer a second application was a transistorized digital computer to be used in a navy track while scan shipboard radar system several models were completed tradic phase one computer flyable tradic leprechaun using junction transistors in 1956 and xmh 3 tradic tradic phase one was developed to explore the feasibility in the laboratory of using transistors in a digital computer that could be used to solve aircraft bombing and navigation problems flyable tradic was used to establish the feasibility of using an airborne solid state computer as the control element of a bombing and navigation system leprechaun was a second generation laboratory research transistor digital computer designed to explore the capabilities of new solid state devices for airborne computers the tradic phase one computer was completed in january 1954 the tradic phase one computer has been claimed to be the world s first fully transistorized computer ahead of the mail fterl in austria or the harwell cadet in the uk which were each completed in 1955 in the uk the manchester university transistor computer

this means that the shocks are not formed by two body coulomb collisions since the mean free path for these collisions is too large often exceeding the size of the system it is widely accepted that the mechanism driving these shocks consists of plasma instabilities that operate on the scale of plasma skin depth which is typically much shorter than the mean free path it is known that collisionless shocks are associated with extremely high energy particles although it has not been definitively established if the high energy photons observed are emitted by protons electrons or both the energetic particles are in general believed to be accelerated by the fermi acceleration mechanism it is usually agreed that shocks caused by supernova remnants expanding in the interstellar medium accelerate the cosmic rays measured above the earth s atmosphere shock waves in stellar environments such as shocks inside a core collapse supernova explosion often become radiation mediated shocks such shocks are formed by photons colliding with the electrons of the matter and the downstream of these shocks is dominated by radiation energy density rather than thermal energy of matter an important type of astrophysical shock is the relativistic shock in which the

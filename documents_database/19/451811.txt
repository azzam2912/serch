a cold chain is a temperature controlled supply chain an unbroken cold chain is an uninterrupted series of refrigerated production storage and distribution activities along with associated equipment and logistics which maintain a desired low temperature range it is used to preserve and to extend and ensure the shelf life of products such as fresh agricultural produce seafood frozen food photographic film chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs such products during transport and when in transient storage are sometimes called cool cargo unlike other goods or merchandise cold chain goods are perishable and always en route towards end use or destination even when held temporarily in cold stores and hence commonly referred to as cargo during its entire logistics cycle cold chain logistics includes all of the means used to ensure a constant temperature for a product that is not heat stable from the time it is manufactured until the time it is used moreover cold chain is considered as a science a technology and a process it is a science as it requires the understanding of the chemical and biological processes associated with product perishability it is a technology as it relies on physical means to ensure desirable temperature conditions along

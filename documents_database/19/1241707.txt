they are almost always used to bind cations they utilize chelating agents covalently attached to a polymer matrix chelating resins have the same bead form and polymer matrix as usual ion exchangers their main use is for preconcentration of metal ions in a dilute solution chelating resins operate similarly to ordinary ion exchange resins most chelating resins are polymers copolymers to be precise with reactive functional groups that chelate to metal ions the variation in chelating resins arises from the nature of the chelating agents pendant from the polymer backbone dowex chelating resin a 1 also known as chelex 100 is based on iminodiacetic acid in a styrene divinylbenzene matrix dowex a 1 is available commercially and is widely used to determine general properties of chelating resins such as rate determining step and ph dependence etc dowex a 1 is produced from chloromethylated styrene divinylbenzene copolymer via amination with aminodiacetic acid poly metal chelating resin has almost negligible affinity to both alkali and alkaline earth metals small quantities of resin can be utilized to concentrate trace metals in natural water systems or biological fluids in which there are three or four orders of magnitude greater alkali and alkaline earth metal

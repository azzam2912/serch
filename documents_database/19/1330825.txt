this term is used in behavioural sciences and neuroscience and studies associated with this term often strive to explain the brain s cognitive abilities based on statistical principles it is frequently assumed that the nervous system maintains internal probabilistic models that are updated by neural processing of sensory information using methods approximating those of bayesian probability this field of study has its historical roots in numerous disciplines including machine learning experimental psychology and bayesian statistics as early as the 1860s with the work of hermann helmholtz in experimental psychology the brain s ability to extract perceptual information from sensory data was modeled in terms of probabilistic estimation the basic idea is that the nervous system needs to organize sensory data into an accurate internal model of the outside world bayesian probability has been developed by many important contributors pierre simon laplace thomas bayes harold jeffreys richard cox and edwin jaynes developed mathematical techniques and procedures for treating probability as the degree of plausibility that could be assigned to a given supposition or hypothesis based on the available evidence in 1988 edwin jaynes presented a framework for using bayesian probability to model mental processes it was thus realized early on that

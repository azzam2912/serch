let now formula 1 be a family of bounded sets in formula 4 with respect to formula 5 with the following properties then the seminorms of the form define a hausdorff locally convex topology on formula 5 which is called the polar topology on formula 5 generated by the family of sets formula 30 the sets form a local base of this topology a net of elements formula 37 tends to an element formula 10 in this topology if and only if because of this the polar topology is often called the topology of uniform convergence on the sets of formula 1 the semi norm formula 41 is the gauge of the polar set formula 13

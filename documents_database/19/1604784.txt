it includes advanced algorithms for image registration segmentation and quantitative morphological and functional image analysis an ide for graphical programming and rapid user interface prototyping is available mevislab is written in c and uses the qt framework for graphical user interfaces it is available cross platform on windows linux and mac os x the software development is done in cooperation between and fraunhofer mevis a freeware version of the mevislab sdk is available see licensing open source modules are delivered as mevislab public sources in the sdk and available from the mevislab community and community sources project mevislab development began in 1993 with the software ilab1 of the cevis institute written in c it allowed to interactively connect algorithms of the image vision library il on silicon graphics sgi to form image processing networks in 1995 the newly founded mevis research gmbh which became fraunhofer mevis in 2009 took over the ilab development and released ilab2 and ilab3 openinventor and tcl scripting was integrated but both programs were still running on sgi only in 2000 ilab4 was released with the core rewritten in objective c for windows for being able to move away from the sgi platform the image vision

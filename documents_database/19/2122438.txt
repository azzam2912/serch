it is commonly used as part of the fda clearance process put simply it is mixing populations of lymphocytes together and measuring the reaction that occurs technically it is an ex vivo cellular immune assay that occurs between two allogeneic lymphocyte populations same species but genetically distinct in a one way mlr only one lymphocyte population can respond or proliferate in a two way mlr both populations can proliferate mlr s are performed to assess how t cells react to external stimuli t cells are a type of white blood cell that scans for cellular abnormalities and infections they are essential to human immunity the mlr was first recognized when researchers mixed leukocytes from two unrelated donors in culture after several days lymphocytes underwent blast transformation dna synthesis and cellular proliferation in response to the major histocompatibility antigen mhc class i and ii differences between the two cell populations designated as responder and stimulator cells responder cells proliferated without previous exposure to stimulator mhc antigens this response became quantifiable when incorporating radioactivity 3h thymidine or 5 bromo 2 deoxyuridine brdu into the mixed cell suspension this cellular response to the histocompatibility antigens that occurs in the mlr is also involved

the lines of growth are sometimes rib like oblique and angulated at the periphery and lighter colored so that the interspaces appear like angulated lines of chestnut or reddish narrow stripes the whole surface is covered by close revolving incised lines the small shell is slender and very acute its color is of a livid purple the shell is covered with an olivaceous periostracum with about eleven whorls the protoconch is more or less eroded but apparently smooth acute and including about two and a half whorls the subsequent whorls are rather flat compressed and appressed at and in front of the suture with a rounded base and inconspicuous anal fasciole the sculpture consists chiefly of flattish spiral threads one at the suture three smaller ones in front of it followed by a flat broader one representing the fasciole then on the body whorl eight more prominent threads undulate or segmented by incremental lines and with wider interspaces sometimes containing an intercalary smaller thread to the base followed by six or seven unsegmented threads to the siphonal fasciole which bears six or seven smaller threads the succession of undulations or slightly swollen segments gives a slightly cancellate effect to the

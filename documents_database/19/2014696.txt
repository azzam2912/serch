the lyrics were written by chris difford and the music by glenn tilbrook chris difford said the lyric is autobiographical in some ways another song that mentions masturbation when discussing the lyrics glenn tilbrook said the bloke who the lyric was about is now a very responsible teacher working just outside liverpool i saw him a couple of months ago and he said how perfectly this described his life at the time chris was spot on in analysing him as someone who liked smoking joints and shagging birds but what s wrong with that tilbrook stated musically it was my tip of the hat to elvis costello he d borrowed the riff from time is tight and used it on a song called temptation i thought it would be funny to use that riff again for in quintessence and expand it although the rest of east side story was produced by elvis costello this track was produced instead by dave edmunds this is because east side story was originally intended to be a double album with each side produced by a different producer others intended for the task included nick lowe and possibly paul mccartney in quintessence was often played

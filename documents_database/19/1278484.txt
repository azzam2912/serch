the foundation of modern day dynamics is newtonian mechanics and its reformulation as lagrangian mechanics and hamiltonian mechanics the field has a long and important history as remarked by hamilton the theoretical development of the laws of motion of bodies is a problem of such interest and importance that it has engaged the attention of all the eminent mathematicians since the invention of the dynamics as a mathematical science by galileo and especially since the wonderful extension which was given to that science by newton william rowan hamilton 1834 transcribed in classical mechanics by j r taylor p 237 some authors for example taylor 2005 and greenwood 1997 include special relativity within classical dynamics historically there were three branches of classical mechanics these three subjects have been connected to dynamics in several ways one approach combined statics and kinetics under the name dynamics which became the branch dealing with determination of the motion of bodies resulting from the action of specified forces another approach separated statics and combined kinetics and kinematics under the rubric dynamics this approach is common in engineering books on mechanics and is still in widespread use among mechanicians today dynamics and kinematics continue to be considered

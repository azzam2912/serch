this has the harmful side effect of making the bike less stable more prone to feedback from uneven road surfaces and more difficult to control if the front wheel significantly deviates from the direction of travel when it touches down it may cause an unwanted wobble steering dampers are factory installed on some high end sport motorcycles and fitted to most contemporary racing bikes to counter these behaviours steering dampers are also mounted to off road motorcycles such as motocross bikes a damper helps keep the bike tracking straight over difficult terrain such as ruts rocks and sand and also smooths out jolts through the handlebars at the end of jumps they also reduce arm fatigue by reducing the effort to control the handlebars on motorcycles one end of the damper is mounted to the steering yoke or triple tree the other to the frame two main types are linear and rotary linear dampers resemble a telescoping shock absorber and operate in a similar manner they can be aligned either longitudinally and to one side of the steering or transversely across the bike rotary dampers resemble small boxes and operate via a rotating pivot they are mounted coaxially with the

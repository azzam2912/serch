it was first discovered in immune challenged pupae of hyalophora cecropia and manduca sexta hemolin has a horseshoe crystal structure with four domains and resembles the developmental protein neuroglian hemolin increases 18 fold up to 7 mg ml following injection of bacteria in h cecropia induction of hemolin in moths after bacterial injection have been shown in several species including antheraea pernyi bombyx mori helicoverpa zea heliothis virescens hyphantria cunea and samia cynthia hemolin has also been suggested to participate in the immune response to virus infection and shown to bind to virus particles it is expressed in response to dsrna in a dose dependent manner galleria melonella responds to caffeine intake by increased hemolin protein expression hemolin is thought to be a gene duplication of the developmental protein neuroglian but has lost two of the protein domains that neuroglian contains in the potential function as a developmental protein hemolin has been shown to increase close to pupation in manduca sexta and is induced during diapause and by 20 hydroxyecdysone in lymantria dispar rnai of hemolin causes malformation in h cecropia

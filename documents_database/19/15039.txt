an example of a 3x3 latin square is the name latin square was inspired by mathematical papers by leonhard euler 1707 1783 who used latin characters as symbols but any set of symbols can be used in the above example the alphabetic sequence a b c can be replaced by the integer sequence 1 2 3 euler began the general theory of latin squares the korean mathematician choi seok jeong was the first to publish an example of latin squares of order nine in order to construct a magic square in 1700 predating leonhard euler by 67 years a latin square is said to be reduced also normalized or in standard form if both its first row and its first column are in their natural order for example the latin square above is not reduced because its first column is a c b rather than a b c any latin square can be reduced by permuting that is reordering the rows and columns here switching the above matrix s second and third rows yields the following square this latin square is reduced both its first row and its first column are alphabetically ordered a b c if each entry of

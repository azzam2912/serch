according to that system g 2 2 2 3 denotes a two bogie narrow gauge steam locomotive with the front bogie having two drive axles but the rear bogie being fitted with three axles only two of them drive axles the g 2 2 2 3 class locomotives differed from their two g 2x2 2 class predecessors which had been delivered in 1891 in having the additional non drive axle in the rear bogie thus providing an extra set of wheels under the driver s cab in 1903 in a follow up order of a further eight mallet type locomotives this second chassis configuration was altered again by reversing the order of the bogies and their wheel arrangement the configuration of the 1903 locomotives therefore became g 2 3 2 2 with the single set of trailing wheels right at the front of the locomotive the 1891 g 2x2 2 class locomotives were then rebuilt into the third configuration the main rationale for locating the g 2 2 2 3 class s sole carrying axle in a position under the locomotive s cab was that it increased the locomotive s operating reserves as the boiler and chassis dimensions remained essentially

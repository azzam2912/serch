therefore the schwarzschild criterion dictates whether an element of a star will rise or sink if displaced by random fluctuations within the star or if the forces the element experiences will return it to its original position for the schwarzschild criterion to hold the displaced element must have a bulk velocity which is highly subsonic if this is the case then the time over which the pressures surrounding the element changes is much longer than the time it takes for a sound wave to travel through the element and smooth out pressure differences between the element and its surroundings if this were not the case the element would not hold together as it traveled through the star in order to keep rising or sinking in the star the displaced element must not be able to become the same density as the gas surrounding it in other words it must respond adiabatically to its surroundings in order for this to be true it must move fast enough for there to be insufficient time for the element to exchange heat with its surroundings

the theory of sdsl is based on the specific reaction of spin labels with amino acids a spin label s built in protein structure can be detected by epr spectroscopy sdsl is also a useful tool in examinations of the protein folding process site directed spin labeling sdsl was pioneered in the laboratory of dr w l hubbell in sdsl sites for attachment of spin labels are introduced into recombinantly expressed proteins by site directed mutagenesis functional groups contained within the spin label determine their specificity at neutral ph protein thiol groups specifically react with the functional groups methanethiosulfonate maleimide and iodoacetamide creating a covalent bond with the amino acid cys spin labels are a unique molecular reporter in that they are paramagnetic contain an unpaired electron spin labels were first synthesized in the laboratory of h m mcconnell in 1965 since then a variety of nitroxide spin labels have enjoyed widespread use for the study of macromolecular structure and dynamics because of their stability and simple epr signal the nitroxyl radical n o is usually incorporated into a heterocyclic ring e g pyrrolidine and the unpaired electron is predominantly localized to the n o bond once incorporated into the

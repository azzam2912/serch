rather than acting as a conventional enzyme inhibitor a protac works by inducing selective intracellular proteolysis protacs consist of two covalently linked protein binding molecules one capable of engaging an e3 ubiquitin ligase and another that binds to a target protein meant for degradation recruitment of the e3 ligase to the target protein results in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target protein by the proteasome because protacs need only to bind their targets with high selectivity rather than inhibit the target protein s enzymatic activity there are currently many efforts to retool previously ineffective inhibitor molecules as protacs for next generation drugs initially described by kathleen sakamoto craig crews and ray deshaies in 2001 the protac technology has been applied by a number of drug discovery labs using various e3 ligases including pvhl mdm2 beta trcp1 cereblon and c iap1 yale university licensed the protac technology to arvinas in 2013 14 protacs achieve degradation through highjacking the cells ubiquitin proteosome system ups the ups consists of an e1 activating enzyme which conjugates to an e2 enzyme transfering a ubiquitin molecule to the e2 e2 then binds to the e3 ligase in a complex which can then recognize target proteins

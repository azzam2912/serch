it belongs to a family of channels known as small conductance potassium channels which consists of three members sk1 sk2 and sk3 encoded by the kcnn1 2 and 3 genes respectively which share a 60 70 sequence identity these channels have acquired a number of alternative names however a nc iuphar has recently achieved consensus on the best names k2 1 sk1 k2 2 sk2 and k2 3 sk3 small conductance channels are responsible for the medium and possibly the slow components of the i k2 3 contains 6 transmembrane domains a pore forming region and intracellular n and c termini and is readily blocked by apamin the gene for k2 3 kcnn3 is located on chromosome 1q21 k2 3 is found in the central nervous system cns muscle liver pituitary prostate kidney pancreas and vascular endothelium tissues k2 3 is most abundant in regions of the brain but has also been found to be expressed in significant levels in many other peripheral tissues particularly those rich in smooth muscle including the rectum corpus cavernosum colon small intestine and myometrium the expression level of kcnn3 is dependent on hormonal regulation particularly by the sex hormone estrogen estrogen not only enhances

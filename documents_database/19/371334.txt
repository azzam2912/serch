in most applications a coating of less than is applied tin has a vickers hardness of 1800 2100 a modulus of elasticity of 251 gpa a thermal expansion coefficient of 9 35 k and a superconducting transition temperature of 5 6 k tin will oxidize at 800 c in a normal atmosphere it is chemically stable at 20 c according to laboratory tests but can be slowly attacked by concentrated acid solutions with rising temperatures depending on the substrate material and surface finish tin will have a coefficient of friction ranging from 0 4 to 0 9 against another tin surface non lubricated the typical tin formation has a crystal structure of nacl type with a roughly 1 1 stoichiometry tin compounds with x ranging from 0 6 to 1 2 are however thermodynamically stable tin becomes superconducting at cryogenic temperatures with critical temperature up to 6 0 k for single crystals superconductivity in thin film tin has been studied extensively with the superconducting properties strongly varying depending on sample preparation up to complete suppression of superconductivity at a superconductor insulator transition a thin film of tin was chilled to near absolute zero converting it into the first known superinsulator

this open channel is highly expressed in the cerebellum it is inhibited by extracellular acidification and arachidonic acid and strongly inhibited by phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate is also known as 12 o tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate tpa task channels are additionally inhibited by hormones and transmitters that signal through gqpcrs the resulting cellular depolarization is thought to regulate processes such as motor control and aldosterone secretion despite early controversy about the exact mechanism underlying this inhibition the current view is that diacyl glycerol produced by the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4 5 bis phosphate by phospholipase c causes channel closure the kcnk9 gene is expressed as an ion channel more commonly known as task 3 this channel has a varied pattern of expression task 3 is coexpressed with task 1 kcnk3 in the cerebellar granule cells locus coeruleus motor neurons pontine nuclei some cells in the neocortex habenula olfactory bulb granule cells and cells in the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb task 3 channels are also expressed in the hippocampus both on pyramidal cells and interneurons it is thought that these channels may form heterodimers where their expressions co localise mice in which the

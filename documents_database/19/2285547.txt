the equation reads subject to the boundary conditions if formula 3 approaches zero as formula 4 becomes large this equation models the charge distribution of a neutral atom as a function of radius formula 4 solutions where formula 3 becomes zero at finite formula 4 model positive ions for solutions where formula 3 becomes large and positive as formula 4 becomes large it can be interpreted as a model of a compressed atom where the charge is squeezed into a smaller space in this case the atom ends at the value of formula 4 for which formula 11 introducing the transformation formula 12 converts the equation to this equation is similar to lane emden equation with polytropic index formula 14 except the sign difference the original equation is invariant under the transformation formula 15 hence the equation can be made equidimensional by introducing formula 16 into the equation leading to so that the substitution formula 18 reduces the equation to if formula 20 then the above equation becomes but this first order equation has no known explicit solution hence the approach turns to either numerical or approximate methods the equation has a particular solution formula 22 which satisfies the boundary

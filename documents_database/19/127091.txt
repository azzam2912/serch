interstitial fluid the fluid which is between the cells in all body tissues enters the lymph capillaries this lymphatic fluid is then transported via progressively larger lymphatic vessels through lymph nodes where substances are removed by tissue lymphocytes and circulating lymphocytes are added to the fluid before emptying ultimately into the right or the left subclavian vein where it mixes with central venous blood since the lymph is derived from the interstitial fluid its composition continually changes as the blood and the surrounding cells continually exchange substances with the interstitial fluid it is generally similar to blood plasma which is the fluid component of blood lymph returns proteins and excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream lymph also transports fats from the digestive system beginning in the lacteals to the blood via chylomicrons bacteria may enter the lymph channels and be transported to lymph nodes where they are destroyed metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph the word lymph is derived from the name of the ancient roman deity of fresh water lympha lymph has a composition similar but not identical to that of blood plasma lymph that leaves a lymph node is richer in lymphocytes than blood plasma

they are based on heavily modified mercedes benz automotive engines all centurion engines are water cooled turbocharged and employ a single lever digital engine management system fadec this simplifies engine management for the pilot as well as improving reliability as it prevents the engine being operated improperly the series utilizes either jet fuel or diesel fuel the high compression ratio of the engine combined with the digitally controlled fuel injection system mirrors similar advances in automotive technology centurion series engines are always fitted with constant speed propellers which allow the engine to be operated at optimum speed at all times however the normal operating speed is too high for any suitable propeller and so the propeller is driven through a reduction gearbox the constant speed propeller and reduction gear result in a propeller tip speed that is 10 15 lower than comparable conventional avgas engines reducing propeller noise the diesel engine s high compression results in better fuel efficiency and the higher operating rpm of the centurion allows higher power to be developed from a smaller displacement in comparison to conventional aircraft piston engines a centurion engine complete with csu reduction gearbox turbocharger and fadec engine management system is considerably

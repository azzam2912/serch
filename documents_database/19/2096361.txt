only 4 trams were built and they served on the line up until their retirement in 1977 the aatc operated a vast network of trams in buenos aires by the early 20th century and the company set out to build the first underground tramway in the city which later became part of the underground network the line would go underground through the centre of buenos aires and then continue as an overground tram service using a ramp at primera junta station which leads to what is today the location of the polvor n workshop where it continued through the caballito neighbourhood the company needed rolling stock to serve the new line and thus took bids from two companies the united electric car company and the belgian company la brugeoise et nicaise et delcuve uec sent 4 of these trams to buenos aires for the aatc s consideration though their exterior design was very similar to the la brugeoise trams the preston trams were noted for their extravagant interiors the trams had seats made of indonesian rattan oak frames and panelling and handrails handles and lights made of bronze ultimately the aatc would settle for the more economical la brugeoise cars

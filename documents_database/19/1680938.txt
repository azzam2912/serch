it was proposed by oldfield thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths anteaters armadillos and pangolins usually classified as placentals from both marsupial and placental mammals an arrangement that received little support from other workers when teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in argentina in the 1980s they were thought to be related to xenarthrans leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals however by the early 1990s gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals the term paratheria was coined by british mammalogist oldfield thomas in 1887 in a review of tooth development in mammals he found that the edentata were especially distinctive in this group he included the sloths anteaters and armadillos which are still placed together as xenarthra as well as the pangolins and the aardvark according to thomas edentate teeth would be derived from the very earliest stage of mammalian dental evolution consequently he suggested that they should be given a grouping separate from the other major groupings of mammals for which terms had been introduced by thomas huxley eutheria placentals and metatheria marsupials for this new grouping he suggested

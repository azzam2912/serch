the term launch pad can be used to describe just the central launch platform or the entire complex launch complex the entire complex will include a launch mount or launch platform to physically support the vehicle a service structure with umbilicals and the infrastructure required to provide propellants cryogenic fluids electrical power communications telemetry rocket assembly payload processing storage facilities for propellants and gases equipment access roads and drainage most launch pads include fixed service structures to provide one or more access platforms to assemble inspect and maintain the vehicle and to allow access to the spacecraft including the loading of crew the pad may contain a flame deflection structure to prevent the intense heat of the rocket exhaust from damaging the vehicle or pad structures and a sound suppression system spraying large quantities of water may be employed the pad may also be protected by lightning arresters a spaceport typically includes multiple launch complexes and other supporting infrastructure a launch pad is distinct from a missile launch facility or missile silo or missile complex which also launches a missile vertically but is located underground in order to help harden it against enemy attack cryogenic propellants liquid oxygen oxidizer and

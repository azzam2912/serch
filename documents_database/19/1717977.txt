they do not exhibit the characteristic spiking behavior of action potential generating neurons non spiking neural networks are integrated with spiking neural networks to have a synergistic effect in being able to stimulate some sensory or motor response while also being able to modulate the response there are an abundance of neurons that propagate signals via action potentials and the mechanics of this particular kind of transmission is well understood spiking neurons exhibit action potentials as a result of a neuron characteristic known as membrane potential through studying these complex spiking networks in animals a neuron that did not exhibit characteristic spiking behavior was discovered these neurons use a graded potential to transmit data as they lack the membrane potential that spiking neurons possess this method of transmission has a huge effect on the fidelity strength and lifetime of the signal non spiking neurons were identified as a special kind of interneuron and function as an intermediary point of process for sensory motor systems animals have become substantial models for understanding more about non spiking neural networks and the role they play in an animal s ability to process information and its overall function animal models indicate that the interneurons

the ventricular escape beat follows a long pause in ventricular rhythm and acts to prevent cardiac arrest it indicates a failure of the electrical conduction system of the heart to stimulate the ventricles which would lead to the absence of heartbeats unless ventricular escape beats occur ventricular escape beats occur when the rate of electrical discharge reaching the ventricles normally initiated by the heart s sinoatrial node sa node transmitted to the atrioventricular node av node and then further transmitted to the ventricles falls below the base rate determined by the rate of phase 4 spontaneous depolarisation of ventricular pacemaker cells an escape beat usually occurs 2 3 seconds after an electrical impulse has failed to reach the ventricles this phenomenon can be caused by the sinoatrial node sa node failing to initiate a beat by a failure of the conductivity from the sa node to the atrioventricular node av node or by atrioventricular block especially third degree av block normally the pacemaker cells of the sinoatrial node discharge at the highest frequency and are thus dominant over other cells with pacemaker activity the av node normally has the second fastest discharge rate when the sinus rate falls below the

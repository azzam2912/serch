as of 2010 flash steam plants are the most common type of geothermal power generation plants in operation today which use water at temperatures greater than that is pumped under high pressure to the generation equipment at the surface with binary cycle geothermal power plants pumps are used to pump hot water from a geothermal well through a heat exchanger and the cooled water is returned to the underground reservoir a second working or binary fluid with a low boiling point typically a butane or pentane hydrocarbon is pumped at fairly high pressure through the heat exchanger where it is vaporized and then directed through a turbine the vapor exiting the turbine is then condensed by cold air radiators or cold water and cycled back through the heat exchanger a binary vapor cycle is defined in thermodynamics as a power cycle that is a combination of two cycles one in a high temperature region and the other in a lower temperature region the use of mercury water cycles in the united states can be dated back to the late 1920s a small mercury water plant which produced about 40 megawatts mw was in use in new hampshire in the 1950s

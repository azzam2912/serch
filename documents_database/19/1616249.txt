tryon sought to demonstrate that genetic traits often did in fact contribute to behavior to do so tryon created an experiment that tested the proficiency of successive generations of rats in completing a maze he initiated the experiment by exposing a genetically diverse group of rats to the maze labeling those who made the fewest errors bright and those with the most errors dull tryon then mated the bright males with bright females and dull males with dull females after their children matured tryon repeated the maze test with them and again separated the bright and the dull again breeding bright with bright and dull with dull tryon continued this process for seven generations creating two distinct breeds of bright and dull rats in order to demonstrate that behavior had little effect on the genetically selectively bred rats and lessen the chance of error when making his conclusions tryon cross fostered the rats that is he had a dull mother raise bright children and vice versa the independent variables in his experiment were the parental pairings the choice of environment and parents for upbringing and number of rats put through the maze the dependent variable was the number of errors

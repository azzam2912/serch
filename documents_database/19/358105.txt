in the theory mutation was the source of novelty creating new forms and new species potentially instantaneously in sudden jumps this was envisaged as driving evolution which was thought to be limited by the supply of mutations before darwin biologists commonly believed in saltationism the possibility of large evolutionary jumps including immediate speciation for example in 1822 tienne geoffroy saint hilaire argued that species could be formed by sudden transformations or what would later be called macromutation darwin opposed saltation insisting on gradualism in evolution as in geology uniformitarianism in 1864 albert von k lliker revived geoffroy s theory in 1901 the geneticist hugo de vries gave the name mutation to seemingly new forms that suddenly arose in his experiments on the evening primrose oenothera lamarckiana and in the first decade of the 20th century mutationism or as de vries named it mutationstheorie became a rival to darwinism supported for a while by geneticists including william bateson thomas hunt morgan and reginald punnett understanding of mutationism is clouded by the mid 20th century portrayal of the early mutationists by supporters of the modern synthesis as opponents of darwinian evolution and rivals of the biometrics school who argued that selection operated

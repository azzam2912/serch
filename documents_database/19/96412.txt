varroa mites are carriers for many viruses that are damaging to bees for example bees infected during their development will often have visibly deformed wings varroa mites have led to the virtual elimination of feral bee colonies in many areas and are a major problem for kept bees in apiaries some feral populations are now recovering it appears they have been naturally selected for varroa resistance varroa mites were first discovered in southeast asia in about 1904 but are now present on all continents except australia they were discovered in the united states in 1987 in new zealand in 2000 and in devon united kingdom in 1992 to the untrained eye these mites are generally not a very noticeable problem for a strongly growing hive as the bees may appear strong in number and may even be very effective at foraging however the mite reproduction cycle occurs inside the capped pupae and the mite population can surge as a result of colony growth careful observation of a colony can help identify signs of disease often spread by mites when the hive population growth is reduced in preparation for winter or due to poor late summer forage the mite population growth

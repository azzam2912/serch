this ion channel is best known as a sensor for environmental irritants giving rise to somatosensory modalities such as pain cold and itch and other protective responses tears airway resistance cough trpa1 is a member of the transient receptor potential channel family trpa1 contains 14 n terminal ankyrin repeats and is believed to function as a mechanical and chemical stress sensor the specific function of this protein has not yet been determined however studies indicate that the function may involve a role in somatosensory neuron mediated protective responses signal transduction and growth control recent studies indicate that trpa1 is activated by a number of reactive allyl isothiocyanate cinnamaldehyde farnesyl thiosalicylic acid formalin hydrogen peroxide 4 hydroxynonenal acrolein and tear gases and non reactive compounds nicotine pf 4840154 and considered as a chemosensor in the body trpa1 is co expressed with trpv1 on nociceptive primary afferent c fibers in humans this sub population of peripheral c fibers is considered important sensors of nociception in humans and their activation will under normal conditions give rise to pain indeed trpa1 is considered as an attractive pain target trpa1 knockout mice showed near complete attenuation of nocifensive behaviors to formalin tear gas and other

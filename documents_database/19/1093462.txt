however one of the main causes of orbital decay on the space station is that the area of the solar arrays brushing against the thin residual atmosphere at orbital altitude results in a small amount of aerodynamic drag the drag can be lowered by orienting the solar arrays in sun slicer mode where they fly edge on to the orbital direction rather than tracking the sun however this orientation reduces the power produced the night glider mode is a hybrid orientation where the solar arrays track the sun during the period when the space station is illuminated are rotated edge on to the orbital direction when it enters in the earth s shadow and then are returned to their tracking position when the station re enters sunlight this reduces the average drag on the station s solar arrays by about 30 percent with no reduction in power use of night glider mode had been proposed at nasa lewis early in the space station s history but was only implemented in 2003 after the space shuttle columbia disaster when the ability of the space shuttle to bring propellant to the station for orbital maintenance was removed while the space shuttle program

the term volcanology is derived from the latin word vulcan vulcan was the ancient roman god of fire a volcanologist is a geologist who studies the eruptive activity and formation of volcanoes and their current and historic eruptions volcanologists frequently visit volcanoes especially active ones to observe volcanic eruptions collect eruptive products including tephra such as ash or pumice rock and lava samples one major focus of enquiry is the prediction of eruptions there is currently no accurate way to do this but predicting eruptions like predicting earthquakes could save many lives in 1841 the first volcanological observatory the vesuvius observatory was founded in the kingdom of the two sicilies seismic observations are made using seismographs deployed near volcanic areas watching out for increased seismicity during volcanic events in particular looking for long period harmonic tremors which signal magma movement through volcanic conduits surface deformation monitoring includes the use of geodetic techniques such as leveling tilt strain angle and distance measurements through tiltmeters total stations and edms this also includes gnss observations and insar surface deformation indicates magma upwelling increased magma supply produces bulges in the volcanic center s surface gas emissions may be monitored with equipment including portable ultra

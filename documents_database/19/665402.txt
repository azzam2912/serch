this area of true contact most often constitutes only a very small fraction of the apparent or nominal contact area in relation to two contacting objects the term contact area refers to the fraction of the nominal area that consists of atoms of one object in true contact with the atoms of the other object because objects are never perfectly flat due to asperities the actual contact area on a microscopic scale is usually much less than the contact area apparent on a macroscopic scale contact area may depend on the normal force between the two objects due to deformation the contact area depends on the geometry of the contacting bodies the load and the material properties the contact area between the two parallel cylinders is a narrow rectangle two non parallel cylinders have an elliptical contact area unless the cylinders are crossed at 90 degrees in which case they have a circular contact area two spheres also have a circular contact area it is an empirical fact for many materials that f n where f is the frictional force for sliding friction is the coefficient of friction and n is the normal force there isn t a simple derivation

typically a modern hang glider is constructed of an aluminium alloy or composite framed fabric wing the pilot is ensconced in a harness suspended from the airframe and exercises control by shifting body weight in opposition to a control frame early hang glider designs did not reliably achieve safe flight their builders lacking a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles of flight the first recorded controlled flights were by german engineer otto lilienthal whose research published in 1889 strongly influenced later designers the type of aircraft employed by lilienthal is now referred to as a hang glider further hang glider research was undertaken during the 1920s in europe australia and the us where designers tested several wing concepts and the pendulum weight shift control system in 1957 the american space agency nasa began testing various formats of a new wing called the rogallo wing with the intent of possibly implementing the design as a recovery system for the gemini space capsules the wing s simplicity of design and ease of construction in combination with its slow flight characteristics did not go unnoticed by hang glider enthusiasts rogallo s flexible wing airfoil was soon adapted to the purpose of recreational flight

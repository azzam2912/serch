it solves a problem by evolving a small population of candidate solutions by means of relatively simple arithmetical operations mps is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions for problems where finding the precise global optimum is less important than finding an acceptable local optimum in a fixed amount of time using a metaheuristic such as mps may be preferable to alternatives such as brute force search or gradient descent mps is used for multidimensional real valued functions but does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized which means mps does not require for the optimization problem to be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi newton methods mps can therefore also be used on optimization problems that are not even continuous are noisy change over time etc in a similar way to differential evolution mps uses difference vectors between the members of the population in order to generate new solutions it attempts to provide an efficient use of function evaluations by maintaining a small population size if the population size is smaller than the

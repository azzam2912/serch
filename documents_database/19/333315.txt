it has the same spectral type as our sun g2v however it is probably slightly less massive and more luminous indicating that it is slightly older as of 2008 there is one known extrasolar planet confirmed to be orbiting the star there is one known planet orbiting the star hd 208487 which is designated hd 208487 b it has a mass at least half that of jupiter and is located in an eccentric 130 day orbit the discovery of a second planet in the system was announced on september 13 2005 by p c gregory the discovery was made using bayesian analysis of the radial velocity dataset to determine the planetary parameters however further analysis revealed that an alternative 2 planet solution for the hd 208487 system was possible with a planet in a 28 day orbit instead of the 908 day orbit postulated and it was concluded that activity on the star is more likely to be responsible for the residuals to the one planet solution than the presence of a second planet

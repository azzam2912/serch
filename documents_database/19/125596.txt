certain genes are chosen as reporters because the characteristics they confer on organisms expressing them are easily identified and measured or because they are selectable markers reporter genes are often used as an indication of whether a certain gene has been taken up by or expressed in the cell or organism population to introduce a reporter gene into an organism scientists place the reporter gene and the gene of interest in the same dna construct to be inserted into the cell or organism for bacteria or prokaryotic cells in culture this is usually in the form of a circular dna molecule called a plasmid it is important to use a reporter gene that is not natively expressed in the cell or organism under study since the expression of the reporter is being used as a marker for successful uptake of the gene of interest commonly used reporter genes that induce visually identifiable characteristics usually involve fluorescent and luminescent proteins examples include the gene that encodes jellyfish green fluorescent protein gfp which causes cells that express it to glow green under blue light the enzyme luciferase which catalyzes a reaction with luciferin to produce light and the red fluorescent protein from

the mining industry is in the transition towards automation it can still require a large amount of human capital particularly in the developing world where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency there are two types of automated mining process and software automation and the application of robotic technology to mining vehicles and equipment in order to gain more control over their operations mining companies may implement mining automation software or processes reports generated by mine automation software allow administrators to identify productivity bottlenecks increase accountability and better understand return on investment addressing concerns about how to improve productivity and safety in the mine site some mine companies are turning to equipment automation consisting of robotic hardware and software technologies that convert vehicles or equipment into autonomous mining units mine equipment automation comes in four different forms remote control teleoperation driver assist and full automation remote control mining equipment usually refers to mining vehicles such as excavators or bulldozers that are controlled with a handheld remote control an operator stands in line of sight and uses the remote control to perform the normal vehicle functions because visibility and feel of the machine are heavily reduced

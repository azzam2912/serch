this scheme transmits multiple redundant copies of a generalised tcm signal distributed over time and a number of antennas space these multiple diverse copies of the data are used by the receiver to attempt to reconstruct the actual transmitted data for an stc to be used there must necessarily be multiple transmit antennas but only a single receive antennas is required nevertheless multiple receive antennas are often used since the performance of the system is improved by the resulting spatial diversity in contrast to space time block codes stbcs they are able to provide both coding gain and diversity gain and have a better bit error rate performance in essence they marry single channel continuous time coding with the signaling protocol being used and extend that with a multi antenna framework however that also means they are more complex than stbcs to encode and decode they rely on a viterbi decoder at the receiver where stbcs need only linear processing also whereas in a single transmitter single receiver framework the viterbi algorithm or one of the sequential decoding algorithms only has to proceed over a trellis in a single time dimension in here the optimal decoding also has to take

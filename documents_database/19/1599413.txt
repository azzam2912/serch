it has a mass of about 156 grams and is about 5 centimeters across at its widest point it was collected by astronaut harrison schmitt as part of a rake sample of lunar soil at geology station 6 near the base of the north massif troctolite 76535 is a coarse grained plutonic rock that is believed to have had a slow cooling history the rock originates from early in the moon s history geologists have described it as a coarse grained olivine plagioclase cumulate with a granular polygonal texture olivine and plagioclase are of about equal quantities within 76535 while the remaining approximate 4 is made up of primarily orthopyroxene studies have shown that the rock is plutonic in origin and originates from about the middle to lower crust of the moon investigations have shown that the rock may have formed as a cumulate at depth thus possibly making the sample an important link in the understanding of the geologic timeline of the moon as troctolite 76535 is the oldest known unshocked lunar rock it has been used for thermochronological calculations in order to determine whether the moon formed a metallic core or generated a core dynamo the results of

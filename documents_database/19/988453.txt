the u3 snorna secondary structure is characterized by a small 5 domain with boxes a and a and a larger 3 domain with boxes b c c and d the two domains being linked by a single stranded hinge boxes b and c form the b c motif which appears to be exclusive to u3 snornas and boxes c and d form the c d motif the latter is functionally similar to the c d motifs found in other snornas the 5 domain and the hinge region act as a pre rrna binding domain the 3 domain has conserved protein binding sites both the box b c and box c d motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of u3 snorna the box c d motif is also necessary for nucleolar localization stability and hyper methylation of u3 snorna both box b c and c d motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rrna processing functions of u3 snorna s cerevisiae secondary structure determined by chemical mapping of u3a rna in a purified snornp is available a human structure model has also been proposed like yeast and human protozoan protist entamoeba histolytica a primitive eukaryote adopted

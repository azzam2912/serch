besides the geodesics principle in a classical field theory there exists fermat s principle for stationary gravity fields in the general case of conformally stationary spacetime with coordinates formula 1 a fermat metric takes the form where the conformal factor formula 3 depends on time formula 4 and space coordinates formula 5 and does not affect the lightlike geodesics apart from their parametrization fermat s principle for a pseudo riemannian manifold states that the light ray path between points formula 6 and formula 7 corresponds to stationary action where formula 9 is any parameter ranging over an interval formula 10 and varying along curve with fixed endpoints formula 11 and formula 12 in principle of stationary integral of energy for a light like particle s motion the pseudo riemannian metric with coefficients formula 13 is defined by a transformation with time coordinate formula 15 and space coordinates with indexes k q 1 2 3 the line element is written in form where formula 17 is some quantity which is assumed equal 1 and regarded as the energy of the light like particle with formula 18 solving this equation for formula 17 under condition formula 20 gives two solutions where formula

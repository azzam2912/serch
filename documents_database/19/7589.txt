instead each element points to the next it is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence in its most basic form each node contains data and a reference in other words a link to the next node in the sequence this structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration more complex variants add additional links allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions a drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear and difficult to pipeline faster access such as random access is not feasible arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures they can be used to implement several other common abstract data types including lists stacks queues associative arrays and s expressions though it is not uncommon to implement those data structures directly without using a linked list as the basis the principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items

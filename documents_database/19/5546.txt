through heredity variations between individuals can accumulate and cause species to evolve by natural selection the study of heredity in biology is genetics in humans eye color is an example of an inherited characteristic an individual might inherit the brown eye trait from one of the parents inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism s genome is called its genotype the complete set of observable traits of the structure and behavior of an organism is called its phenotype these traits arise from the interaction of its genotype with the environment as a result many aspects of an organism s phenotype are not inherited for example suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person s phenotype and sunlight thus suntans are not passed on to people s children however some people tan more easily than others due to differences in their genotype a striking example is people with the inherited trait of albinism who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn heritable traits are known to be passed from one generation to the next via dna a molecule that encodes genetic information dna is a long polymer that

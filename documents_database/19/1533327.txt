like their relatives therein their exact relationships are not yet very well resolved the present lineage is often included in the depressariinae as a tribe amphisbatini though more often within the context of a splitting approach to gelechioidea systematics and taxonomy wherein the depressariinae are elevated to full family rank and the amphisbatinae are treated as a subfamily therein an even more extremely split up layout even treats the amphisbatinae as full family amphisbatidae in the scheme used here the amphisbatinae are included in the oecophoridae as a subfamily alongside the depressariinae that nonwithstanding the delimitation of amphisbatinae versus the depressariinae and oecophorinae is problematic and several individual genera have been moved from one to the other as regards subdivisions the amphisbatinae are commonly divided into the tribes amphisbatini fuchsiini hypercalliini and telechrysidini but neither are these subdivisions as firmly delimited as it might seem nor are they particularly diverse several amphisbatinae taxa are monotypic thus the amphisbatinae are here not divided into tribes pending the availability of more thorough phylogenetic studies and better information on the subfamily s scope and relationships more recently it was discovered that the enigmatic genus lypusa traditionally held to be a monotypic family of

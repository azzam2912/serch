it contains about five or six turreted flattened whorls which are angularly shouldered just below the suture the subsutural band arises abruptly from the suture nearly at right angles and its surface is flat or slightly eoncave marked by strongly recurved lines of growth but mostly without spiral lines the shoulder is often nearly right angled the whorls are decidedly flattened in the middle there are on the body whorl about twenty rather broad flattened or rounded ribs which are nearly straight a little prominent and usually slightly nodose at the shoulder but they disappear a short distance below it they are separated by well excavated concave grooves deepest close to the shoulder the most characteristic feature of the sculpture is that the surface is marked by rather fine but regular and distinct sharply incised narrow revolving grooves which are rather distant with flat intervals of these there are usually about three to five on the penultimate whorl and about twenty to twenty eight on the body whorl the greater number being below the middle on the siphon where they become coarser and closer with narrower rounded intervals one of the sulci just below the shoulder is usually more distinct

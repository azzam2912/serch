in other words formula 1 is the probability that a normal gaussian random variable will obtain a value larger than formula 2 standard deviations equivalently formula 1 is the probability that a standard normal random variable takes a value larger than formula 2 if formula 5 is a gaussian random variable with mean formula 6 and variance formula 7 then formula 8 is standard normal and where formula 10 other definitions of the q function all of which are simple transformations of the normal cumulative distribution function are also used occasionally because of its relation to the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution the q function can also be expressed in terms of the error function which is an important function in applied mathematics and physics formally the q function is defined as thus where formula 13 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal gaussian distribution the q function can be expressed in terms of the error function or the complementary error function as an alternative form of the q function known as craig s formula after its discoverer is expressed as this expression is valid only for positive values of x but it can be used

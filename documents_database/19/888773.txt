they possess both an epoxide and an alcohol i e hydroxyl residue hxa3 hxb3 and their non enzymatically formed isomers are nonclassic eicosanoid derived from acid the pufa arachidonic acid a second group of less well studied hepoxilins hxa4 hxb4 and their non enzymatically formed isomers are nonclassical eicosanoids derived from the pufa eicosapentaenoic acid recently 14 15 hxa3 and 14 15 hxb3 have been defined as arachidonic acid derivatives that are produced by a different metabolic pathway than hxa3 hxb3 hxa4 or hxb4 and differ from the aforementioned hepoxilins in the positions of their hydroxyl and epoxide residues finally hepoxilin like products of two other pufas docosahexaenoic acid and linoleic acid have been described all of these epoxyalcohol metabolites are at least somewhat unstable and are readily enzymatically or non enzymatically to their corresponding trihydroxy counterparts the trioxilins trx hxa3 and hxb3 in particular are being rapidly metabolized to trxa3 trxb3 and trxc3 hepoxilins have various biological activities in animal models and or cultured mammalian including human tissues and cells the trx metabolites of hxa3 and hxb3 have less or no activity in most of the systems studied but in some systems retain the activity of their precursor hepoxilins

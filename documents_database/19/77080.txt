friedman of putting two texts side by side and counting the number of times that identical letters appear in the same position in both texts this count either as a ratio of the total or normalized by dividing by the expected count for a random source model is known as the index of coincidence or ic for short the index of coincidence provides a measure of how likely it is to draw two matching letters by randomly selecting two letters from a given text the chance of drawing a given letter in the text is number of times that letter appears length of the text the chance of drawing that same letter again without replacement is appearances 1 text length 1 the product of these two values gives you the chance of drawing that letter twice in a row one can find this product for each letter that appears in the text then sum these products to get a chance of drawing two of a kind this probability can then be normalized by multiplying it by some coefficient typically 26 in english we can express the index of coincidence ic for a given letter frequency distribution as a summation where

the degradation of fibrin is termed fibrinolysis in humans the plasmin protein is encoded by the plg gene plasmin is a serine protease that acts to dissolve fibrin blood clots apart from fibrinolysis plasmin proteolyses proteins in various other systems it activates collagenases some mediators of the complement system and weakens the wall of the graafian follicle leading to ovulation it cleaves fibrin fibronectin thrombospondin laminin and von willebrand factor plasmin like trypsin belongs to the family of serine proteases plasmin is released as a zymogen called plasminogen plg from the liver into the systemic circulation two major glycoforms of plasminogen are present in humans type i plasminogen contains two glycosylation moieties n linked to n289 and o linked to t346 whereas type ii plasminogen contains only a single o linked sugar o linked to t346 type ii plasminogen is preferentially recruited to the cell surface over the type i glycoform conversely type i plasminogen appears more readily recruited to blood clots in circulation plasminogen adopts a closed activation resistant conformation upon binding to clots or to the cell surface plasminogen adopts an open form that can be converted into active plasmin by a variety of enzymes including tissue plasminogen

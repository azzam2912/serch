john is believed to date from c 1287 it has a low square time worn tower standing amongst green trees gray calls it a pretty little church commended by an arch prelate of this kingdom because it resembled much a cross and a pretty little church it is its quiet simplicity rendered more charming still by the huge piles of modern buildings which surround and overtop it on three sides it has no pretension to architectural beauty there is nothing grand about it its tower is low and square with little pinnacles at the corners its windows have flattened arched tops far from elegant in design but there is something about it which makes it pleasing perhaps it is that it recalls to mind some little country church and that its aspect is suggestive of green trees and sunny pastures and quiet sylvan delights amongst all the turmoil and bustle of the busy streets which run past it over the outside of the large window in the south transept which looks into westgate street is a stone which has carved upon it the arms of robert rhodes the builder of st nicholas steeple and the benefactor of this and all

it is effectively a v engine with a 180 degree angle between the cylinder banks a boxer engine should not be confused with the opposed piston engine in which each cylinder has two pistons sharing a central combustion chamber the most common configuration of flat engines is the boxer engine where each pair of opposed cylinders moves inwards and outwards at the same time the other configuration is called a 180 degree v engine and have each crankpin shared by a pair of cylinders the first flat engine was built in 1897 by karl benz flat engines have been used in various aviation motorcycle and automobile applications however they are less common than straight engines for engines with less than six cylinders and v engines for engines with six or more cylinders the advantages of flat engines are a short length low centre of mass and being well suited to air cooling compared with straight engines the most common layout for engines with four cylinders or less flat engines have better primary balance resulting in less vibration however the disadvantages are increased width and the need to have two cylinder heads compared with v engines the most common layout for

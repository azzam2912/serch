although there are divisibility tests for numbers in any radix or base and they are all different this article presents rules and examples only for decimal or base 10 numbers martin gardner explained and popularized these rules in his september 1962 mathematical games column in scientific american the rules given below transform a given number into a generally smaller number while preserving divisibility by the divisor of interest therefore unless otherwise noted the resulting number should be evaluated for divisibility by the same divisor in some cases the process can be iterated until the divisibility is obvious for others such as examining the last n digits the result must be examined by other means for divisors with multiple rules the rules are generally ordered first for those appropriate for numbers with many digits then those useful for numbers with fewer digits note to test divisibility by any number that can be expressed as 2 or 5 in which n is a positive integer just examine the last n digits note to test divisibility by any number expressed as the product of prime factors formula 1 we can separately test for divisibility by each prime to its appropriate power for example

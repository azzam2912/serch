it characterises a technical standard for piezoelectric sensors which contain built in impedance conversion electronics iepe sensors are used to measure acceleration force or pressure measurement microphones also apply the iepe standard other proprietary names for the same principle are icp ccld isotron or deltatron the electronics of the iepe sensor typically implemented as fet circuit converts the high impedance signal of the piezoelectric material into a voltage signal with a low impedance of typically 100 a low impedance signal is advantageous because it can be transmitted across long cable lengths without a loss of signal quality in addition special low noise cables which are otherwise required for use with piezoelectric sensors are no longer necessary the sensor circuit is supplied with constant current a distinguishing feature of the iepe principle is that the power supply and the sensor signal are transmitted via one shielded wire most iepe sensors work at a constant current between 2 and 20 ma a common value is 4 ma the higher the constant current the longer the possible cable length cables of several hundred meters length can be used without a loss of signal quality supplying the iepe sensor with constant current results in

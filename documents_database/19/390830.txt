drizzle is normally produced by low stratiform clouds and stratocumulus clouds precipitation rates from drizzle are on the order of a millimetre 0 04 in per day or less at the ground owing to the small size of drizzle drops under many circumstances drizzle largely evaporates before reaching the surface and so may be undetected by observers on the ground the metar code for drizzle is dz and for freezing drizzle is fzdz while most drizzle has only a minor immediate impact upon humans freezing drizzle can lead to treacherous conditions freezing drizzle occurs when supercooled drizzle drops land on a surface whose temperature is below freezing these drops immediately freeze upon impact leading to the buildup of sheet ice sometimes called black ice on the surface of roads drizzle tends to be the most frequent form of precipitation over large areas of the world s oceans particularly in the colder regions of the subtropics these regions are dominated by shallow marine stratocumulus and trade wind cumulus clouds which exist entirely within the marine boundary layer despite the low rates of surface accumulation it has become apparent that drizzle exerts a major influence over the structure coverage and radiative properties

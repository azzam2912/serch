released in 2001 the power4 succeeded the power3 and rs64 microprocessors and was used in rs 6000 and as 400 computers ending a separate development of powerpc microprocessors for the as 400 the power4 was a multicore microprocessor with two cores on a single die the first non embedded microprocessor to do so power4 chip was first commercially available multiprocessor chip the original power4 had a clock speed of 1 1 and 1 3 ghz while an enhanced version the power4 reached a clock speed of 1 9 ghz the powerpc 970 is a derivative of the power4 the power4 has a unified l2 cache divided into three equal parts each has its own independent l2 controller which can feed 32 bytes of data per cycle the core interface unit ciu connects each l2 controller to either the data cache or instruction cache in either of the two processors the non cacheable nc unit is responsible for handling instruction serializing functions and performing any noncacheable operations in the storage topology there is an l3 cache controller but the actual memory is off chip the gx bus controller controls i o device communications and there are two 4 byte wide gx

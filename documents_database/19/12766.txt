the name tungsten comes from the former swedish name for the tungstate mineral scheelite tung sten or heavy stone tungsten is a rare metal found naturally on earth almost exclusively combined with other elements in chemical compounds rather than alone it was identified as a new element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783 its important ores include wolframite and scheelite the free element is remarkable for its robustness especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered melting at 3422 c 6192 f 3695 k it also has the highest boiling point at 5930 c 10706 f 6203 k its density is 19 25 times that of water comparable to that of uranium and gold and much higher about 1 7 times than that of lead polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material under standard conditions when uncombined making it difficult to work however pure single crystalline tungsten is more ductile and can be cut with a hard steel hacksaw tungsten s many alloys have numerous applications including incandescent light bulb filaments x ray tubes as both the filament and target electrodes in gas tungsten arc welding superalloys

a quantum state provides a probability distribution for the value of each observable i e for the outcome of each possible measurement on the system knowledge of the quantum state together with the rules for the system s evolution in time exhausts all that can be predicted about the system s behavior a mixture of quantum states is again a quantum state quantum states that cannot be written as a mixture of other states are called pure quantum states all other states are called mixed quantum states mathematically a pure quantum state can be represented by a ray in a hilbert space over the complex numbers the ray is a set of nonzero vectors differing by just a complex scalar factor any of them can be chosen as a state vector to represent the ray and thus the state a unit vector is usually picked but its phase factor can be chosen freely anyway nevertheless such factors are important when state vectors are added together to form a superposition hilbert space is a generalization of the ordinary euclidean space and it contains all possible pure quantum states of the given system if this hilbert space by choice of representation essentially

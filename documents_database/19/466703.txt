they are based on an 8 bit risc architecture and can reach speeds up to 100 mips on the virtex 4 fpga s family the processors have an 8 bit address and data port for access to a wide range of peripherals the license of the cores allows their free use albeit only on xilinx devices and they come with development tools third party tools are available from mediatronix and others also pacoblaze a behavioral and device independent implementation of the cores exists and is released under the bsd license the pauloblaze is an open source vhdl implementation under the apache license the picoblaze design was originally named kcpsm which stands for constant k coded programmable state machine formerly ken chapman s psm ken chapman was the xilinx systems designer who devised and implemented the microcontroller when instantiating a picoblaze microcontroller in vhdl the respective kcpsm component name must be used for example for a picoblaze3 processor all instructions execute in two clock cycles making performance of the core instruction set deterministic interrupt response is not more than five clock cycles as a resource optimization it is possible for two picoblaze cores to share the same 1k x 18 instruction

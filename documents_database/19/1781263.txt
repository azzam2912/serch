this includes minimal surfaces as a subset but typically they are treated as special case note that these surfaces are generally different from constant gaussian curvature surfaces with the important exception of the sphere in 1841 delaunay proved that the only surfaces of revolution with constant mean curvature were the surfaces obtained by rotating the roulettes of the conics these are the plane cylinder sphere the catenoid the unduloid and nodoid in 1853 j h jellet showed that if formula 1 is a compact star shaped surface in formula 2 with constant mean curvature then it is the standard sphere subsequently a d alexandrov proved that a compact embedded surface in formula 2 with constant mean curvature formula 4 must be a sphere based on this h hopf conjectured in 1956 that any immersed compact orientable constant mean curvature hypersurface in formula 5must be a standard embedded formula 6 sphere this conjecture was disproven in 1982 by wu yi hsiang using a counterexample in formula 7 in 1984 henry c wente constructed the wente torus an immersion into formula 2 of a torus with constant mean curvature up until this point it had seemed that cmc surfaces were rare new

in this circuit the base terminal of the transistor serves as the input the emitter is the output and the collector is common to both for example it may be tied to ground reference or a power supply rail hence its name the analogous field effect transistor circuit is the common drain amplifier and the analogous tube circuit is the cathode follower the circuit can be explained by viewing the transistor as being under the control of negative feedback from this viewpoint a common collector stage fig 1 is an amplifier with full series negative feedback in this configuration fig 2 with 1 the entire output voltage v is placed contrary and in series with the input voltage v thus the two voltages are subtracted according to kvl the subtractor from the function block diagram is implemented just by the input loop and their extraordinary difference v v v is applied to the base emitter junction the transistor continuously monitors v and adjusts its emitter voltage almost equal less v to the input voltage by passing the according collector current through the emitter resistor r as a result the output voltage follows the input voltage variations from v up to

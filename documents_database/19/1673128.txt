since hsp90 stabilizes a variety of proteins required for survival of cancer cells these substances may have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of various types of malignancies furthermore a number of hsp90 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials for a variety of cancers hsp90 inhibitors include the natural products geldanamycin and radicicol as well as semisynthetic derivatives 17 n allylamino 17 demethoxygeldanamycin 17aag among heat shock proteins the focus on hsp90 has increased due to its involvement in several cellular phenomena and more importantly in disease progression hsp90 keeps the death proteins in an apoptosis resistant state by direct association its wide range of functions results from the ability of hsp90 to chaperone several client proteins that play a central pathogenic role in human diseases including cancer neurodegenerative diseases and viral infection geldanamycin directly binds to the atp binding pocket in the n terminal domain of hsp90 and hence blocks the binding of nucleotides to hsp90 analysis of the effects of geldanamycin on steroid receptor activation indicates that the antibiotic blocks the chaperone cycle at the intermediate complex preventing the release of the receptor from hsp90 and eventually resulting in its degradation ewing s sarcoma shows several deregulated autocrine loops

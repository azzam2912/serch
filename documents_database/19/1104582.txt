in the nucleus hmgb1 interacts with nucleosomes transcription factors and histones this nuclear protein organizes the dna and regulates transcription after binding hmgb1 bends dna which facilitates the binding of other proteins hmgb1 supports transcription of many genes in interactions with many transcription factors it also interacts with nucleosomes to loosen packed dna and remodel the chromatin contact with core histones changes the structure of nucleosomes the presence of hmgb1 in the nucleus depends on posttranslational modifications when the protein is not acetylated it stays in the nucleus but hyperacetylation on lysine residues causes it to translocate into the cytosol hmgb1 has been shown to play an important role in helping the rag endonuclease form a paired complex during v d j recombination hmgb1 is secreted by immune cells like macrophages monocytes and dendritic cells through leaderless secretory pathway activated macrophages and monocytes secrete hmgb1 as a cytokine mediator of inflammation antibodies that neutralize hmgb1 confer protection against damage and tissue injury during arthritis colitis ischemia sepsis endotoxemia and systemic lupus erythematosus the mechanism of inflammation and damage consists of binding to tlr2 and tlr4 which mediates hmgb1 dependent activation of macrophage cytokine release this positions hmgb1 at the intersection

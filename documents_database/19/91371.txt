it was invented in 1952 by donald a glaser for which he was awarded the 1960 nobel prize in physics supposedly glaser was inspired by the bubbles in a glass of beer however in a 2006 talk he refuted this story although saying that while beer was not the inspiration for the bubble chamber he did experiments using beer to fill early prototypes while bubble chambers were extensively used in the past they have now mostly been supplanted by wire chambers and spark chambers notable bubble chambers include the big european bubble chamber bebc and gargamelle the bubble chamber is similar to a cloud chamber both in application and in basic principle it is normally made by filling a large cylinder with a liquid heated to just below its boiling point as particles enter the chamber a piston suddenly decreases its pressure and the liquid enters into a superheated metastable phase charged particles create an ionization track around which the liquid vaporizes forming microscopic bubbles bubble density around a track is proportional to a particle s energy loss bubbles grow in size as the chamber expands until they are large enough to be seen or photographed several cameras are mounted

they are named after mikhail rabinovich and anatoly fabrikant who described them in 1979 the equations are where are constants that control the evolution of the system for some values of and the system is chaotic but for others it tends to a stable periodic orbit danca and chen note that the rabinovich fabrikant system is difficult to analyse due to the presence of quadratic and cubic terms and that different attractors can be obtained for the same parameters by using different step sizes in the integration also recently a hidden attractor was discovered in the rabinovich fabrikant system the rabinovich fabrikant system has five hyperbolic equilibrium points one at the origin and four dependent on the system parameters and where these equilibrium points only exist for certain values of and 0 an example of chaotic behaviour is obtained for 0 87 and 1 1 with initial conditions of 1 0 0 5 the correlation dimension was found to be 2 19 0 01 the lyapunov exponents are approximately 0 1981 0 0 6581 and the kaplan yorke dimension d 2 3010 danca and romera showed that for 0 1 the system is chaotic for 0 98 but progresses on

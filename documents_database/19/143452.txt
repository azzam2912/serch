there are infinitely many square triangular numbers the first few are write for the th square triangular number and write and for the sides of the corresponding square and triangle so that define the triangular root of a triangular number to be from this definition and the quadratic formula therefore is triangular is an integer if and only if is square consequently a square number is also triangular if and only if is square that is there are numbers and such that this is an instance of the pell equation with all pell equations have the trivial solution for any this is called the zeroth solution and indexed as if denotes the th nontrivial solution to any pell equation for a particular it can be shown by the method of descent that hence there are an infinity of solutions to any pell equation for which there is one non trivial one which holds whenever is not a square the first non trivial solution when is easy to find it is 3 1 a solution to the pell equation for yields a square triangular number and its square and triangular roots as follows hence the first square triangular number derived from

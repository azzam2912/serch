hepatocytes make up 55 65 of the liver s mass these cells are involved in the typical hepatocyte is cubical with sides of 20 30 m in comparison a human hair has a diameter of 17 to 180 m the typical volume of a hepatocyte is 3 4 x 10 cm smooth endoplasmic reticulum is abundant in hepatocytes whereas most cells in the body have only small amounts hepatocytes display an eosinophilic cytoplasm reflecting numerous mitochondria and basophilic stippling due to large amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum and free ribosomes brown lipofuscin granules are also observed with increasing age together with irregular unstained areas of cytoplasm these correspond to cytoplasmic glycogen and lipid stores removed during histological preparation the average life span of the hepatocyte is 5 months they are able to regenerate hepatocyte nuclei are round with dispersed chromatin and prominent nucleoli anisokaryosis or variation in the size of the nuclei is common and often reflects tetraploidy and other degrees of polyploidy a normal feature of 30 40 of hepatocytes in the adult human liver binucleate cells are also common hepatocytes are organised into plates separated by vascular channels sinusoids an arrangement supported by a reticulin collagen type iii

in rhpcr the primers are designed with a removable amplification block on the 3 end amplification of the blocked primer is dependent on the cleavage activity of a hyperthermophilic archaeal type ii rnase h enzyme during hybridization to the complementary target sequence this rnase h enzyme possesses several useful characteristics that enhance the pcr first it has very little enzymatic activity at low temperature enabling a hot start pcr without modifications to the dna polymerase second the cleavage efficiency of the enzyme is reduced in the presence of mismatches near the rna residue this allows for reduced primer dimer formation detection of alternative splicing variants ability to perform multiplex pcr with higher numbers of pcr primers and the ability to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms rhpcr primers consist of three sections 1 the 5 dna section equivalent in length and melting temperature tm requirements to a standard pcr primer is extended after cleavage by the rnase hii enzyme 2 a single rna base provides the cleavage site for the rnase hii 3 a short 3 extension of four or five bases followed by a blocker usually a short non extendable molecule like a propanediol prevents extension by a dna polymerase until

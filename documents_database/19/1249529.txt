the program was designed to amalgamate anthropomorphic robotics artificial intelligence bioelectronics electrical engineering molecular biology physics and medicine into a single program with the aim of developing advanced bio compatible neuro prosthetic implants man machine interfacing for a variety applications e g nervous system interaction with artificial limbs central and peripheral nervous system implants directional neural grafting neural engineering electron harvesting from biological processes to power implanted devices neural arrays cultured on cmos sensors etc neurobioengineering deals with the study and application of bio compatible neuro prosthetic implants neural sensors and interfaces with the nervous system the goal of that branch is to develop a bio artificial brain of cultured neurons capable of replicating human behaviour in an artificial robotic system the european union f e t funded the neurobioengineering department to pursue this ambitious project the neurobioengineering program spawned numerous journal publications by the departmental scientific pioneers dr marco bove dr sergio martinoia dr renato zaccaria and many others and a university course textbook bioelectronics mosfets biosensors and neurons published by massimo grattarola members of the department were collaborating with researchers throughout the european union japan and north america students from throughout the european union and canada enrolled in

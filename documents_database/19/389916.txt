kahn the system is an in band on channel technology that uses the sidebands of any am radio station analog information is still used up to a bandpass of about 7 5khz with standard amplitude modulation the missing treble information that am normally lacks is then transmitted digitally beyond this audio mixing in the receiver then blends them back together unlike other iboc technologies like ibiquity s hd radio kahn s apparently does not provide a direct path to all digital transmissions nor any multichannel capability its advantage however is that it takes up far less of the sidebands thereby causing far less interference to adjacent channels hence the compatible in the name interference has affected hd radio on am along with its like cam d proprietary nature digital radio mondiale commonly used in shortwave broadcasting can use less the same or more bandwidth as am to provide high quality audio digital radio mondiale requires digital detection circuitry not present in conventional am radios to decode programming special cam d receivers provide the benefit of better frequency response and a slow auxiliary data channel for display of station id programming titles etc receivers that could decode cam d were not

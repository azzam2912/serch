the flow of water is very strong and the water in the lake is completely replenished every 72 hours the fauna and flora are unique in lake h v z due to the temperature and chemical composition of the water contains carbonic acid calcium magnesium hydrogen carbonate reduced sulfuric compounds as well as oxygen in solution several species so far can be found only in this lake bacteria is the dominant life form in the lake it is possible that this is a cause of the curative effect several taxa can be found here most common cyanobacteria are filamentous blue green algae oscillatoria princeps o tenuis o jasoruensis o chlorina spirulina major half of the blue species are thermophile stenoterm ones there are two thermophile blue green alga species pseudanabaena papillaterminata pseudanabaena crassa of which lake h v z is the only hungarian habitat bacterial tektons are typical of the lake the crater is covered mostly by thiothrix sp and beggiatoa sp from a depth of 1 5 m to the opening of the springcave these together with the bacterium species play an important role in the lake s sulfur cycle actinomycetes streptomyces sp micromonospora sp are also worth mentioning

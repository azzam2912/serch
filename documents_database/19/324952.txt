the most common application of ion selective glass electrodes is for the measurement of ph the ph electrode is an example of a glass electrode that is sensitive to hydrogen ions glass electrodes play an important part in the instrumentation for chemical analysis and physico chemical studies the voltage of the glass electrode relative to some reference value is sensitive to changes in the activity of certain type of ions the first studies of glass electrodes ge found different sensitivities of different glasses to change of the medium s acidity ph due to effects of the alkali metal ions in 1906 m cremer the father of erika cremer determined that the electric potential that arises between parts of the fluid located on opposite sides of the glass membrane is proportional to the concentration of acid hydrogen ion concentration in 1909 s p l s rensen introduced the concept of ph and in the same year f haber and z klemensiewicz reported results of their research on the glass electrode in the society of chemistry in karlsruhe in 1922 w s hughes showed that the alkali silicate ge are similar to hydrogen electrode reversible with respect to h in 1925 p

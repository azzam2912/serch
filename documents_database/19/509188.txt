the conjecture postulates that the problem of determining the approximate value of a certain type of game known as a unique game has np hard algorithmic complexity it has broad applications in the theory of hardness of approximation if it is true then for many important problems it is not only impossible to get an exact solution in polynomial time as postulated by the p versus np problem but also impossible to get a good polynomial time approximation the problems for which such an inapproximability result would hold include constraint satisfaction problems which crop up in a wide variety of disciplines the conjecture is unusual in that the academic world seems about evenly divided on whether it is true or not the unique games conjecture can be stated in a number of equivalent ways the following formulation of the unique games conjecture is often used in hardness of approximation the conjecture postulates the np hardness of the following promise problem known as label cover with unique constraints for each edge the colors on the two vertices are restricted to some particular ordered pairs unique constraints means that for each edge none of the ordered pairs have the same color for

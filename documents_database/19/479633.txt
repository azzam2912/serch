this technique involves the estimation of formation fluid pressures the strength of the subsurface formations and the use of casing and mud density to offset those pressures in a predictable fashion understanding pressure and pressure relationships is important in well control the aim of oil operations is to complete all tasks in a safe and efficient manner without detrimental environmental effects this aim can only be achieved if well control is maintained at all times the understanding of pressure and pressure relationships are important in preventing blowouts by experienced personnel who are able to detect when the well is kicking and take proper and prompt actions the fluid is any substance that flows e g oil water gas and ice are all examples of fluids under extreme pressure and temperature almost anything acts as a fluid fluids exert pressure and this pressure comes from the density and height of the fluid column oil companies typically measure density in pounds per gallon ppg or kilograms per cubic meter kg m and pressure measurement in pounds per square inch psi or bar or pascal pa pressure increases with fluid density to find out the amount of pressure fluid of a known density

it does this by expanding the system green s function using a multipole expansion which allows one to group sources that lie close together and treat them as if they are a single source the fmm has also been applied in accelerating the iterative solver in the method of moments mom as applied to computational electromagnetics problems the fmm was first introduced in this manner by leslie greengard and vladimir rokhlin jr and is based on the multipole expansion of the vector helmholtz equation by treating the interactions between far away basis functions using the fmm the corresponding matrix elements do not need to be explicitly stored resulting in a significant reduction in required memory if the fmm is then applied in a hierarchical manner it can improve the complexity of matrix vector products in an iterative solver from formula 1 to formula 2 in finite arithmetic i e given a tolerance formula 3 the matrix vector product is guaranteed to be within a tolerance formula 4 the dependence of the complexity on the tolerance formula 3 is formula 6 i e the complexity of fmm is formula 7 this has expanded the area of applicability of the mom to

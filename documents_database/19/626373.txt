it was invented by hans bethe in 1931 to find the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the one dimensional antiferromagnetic heisenberg model hamiltonian since then the method has been extended to other models in one dimension bose gas hubbard model etc in the framework of many body quantum mechanics models solvable by the bethe ansatz can be contrasted with free fermion models one can say that the dynamics of a free model is one body reducible the many body wave function for fermions bosons is the anti symmetrized symmetrized product of one body wave functions models solvable by the bethe ansatz are not free the two body sector has a non trivial scattering matrix which in general depends on the momenta on the other hand the dynamics of the models solvable by the bethe ansatz is two body reducible the many body scattering matrix is a product of two body scattering matrices many body collisions happen as a sequence of two body collisions and the many body wave function can be represented in a form which contains only elements from two body wave functions the many body scattering matrix is equal to the product of pairwise scattering matrices the yang

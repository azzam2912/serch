in such reactions the synthesis favors the formation of a specific enantiomer or diastereomer the method then is an enantioselective asymmetric synthesis reaction since they affect chirality they produce optically active products from optically inactive or mixed starting materials this type of preferential formation of one enantiomer or diastereomer over the other is formally known as an asymmetric induction in this kind of lewis acid the electron accepting atom is typically a metal such as indium zinc lithium aluminium titanium or boron the chiral altering ligands employed for synthesizing these acids most often have multiple lewis basic sites often a diol or a dinitrogen structure that allow the formation of a ring structure involving the metal atom achiral lewis acids have been used for decades to promote the synthesis of racemic mixtures in a myriad different reactions starting in the 1960s chemists have use the chiral acids to induce the enantioselective reactions common reaction types include diels alder reactions the ene reaction 2 2 cycloaddition reactions hydrocyanation of aldehydes and most notably sharpless expoxidations the enantioselectivity of clas derives from their ability to perturb the free energy barrier along the reaction coordinate pathway that leads to either the r or

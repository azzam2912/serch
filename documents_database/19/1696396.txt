its symptoms are often indistinguishable from those caused by pectobacterium but is more virulent causing disease from lower levels of inoculum and spreading through the plant more effectively it was first discovered in the netherlands in 2005 before spreading rapidly causing 25 30 million of damage annually by 2010 three cases appeared in scotland in 2009 and one in 2010 the host for dickeya solani is the potato plant solanum tuberosum dickeya spp can be the causal agents of soft rots and black leg the symptoms that this bacteria causes can at times not be easily distinguished from the symptoms caused by pectobacterium spp since both pathogens induce a rotting of the plant tissue and black leg symptoms on the host black leg symptoms consist of wet black rot on the stem that spread up from the original seed tuber symptoms of a dickeya solani infection can include wilts and soft rots the wilts occur when the bacterial pathogen invades the vascular system of the plant the wilt symptoms can progress rather rapidly soft rots can be identified as soft watery plant tissue with small wet stem lesions dickeya solani can cause disease more effectively in temperate climates in comparison

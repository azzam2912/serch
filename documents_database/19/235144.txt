the identity is named after alexandre th ophile vandermonde 1772 although it was already known in 1303 by the chinese mathematician zhu shijie chu shi chieh see askey 1975 pp 59 60 for the history there is a q analog to this theorem called the q vandermonde identity vandermonde s identity can be generalized in numerous ways including to the identity in general the product of two polynomials with degrees m and n respectively is given by where we use the convention that a 0 for all integers i m and b 0 for all integers j n by the binomial theorem using the binomial theorem also for the exponents m and n and then the above formula for the product of polynomials we obtain where the above convention for the coefficients of the polynomials agrees with the definition of the binomial coefficients because both give zero for all i m and j n respectively by comparing coefficients of x vandermonde s identity follows for all integers r with 0 r m n for larger integers r both sides of vandermonde s identity are zero due to the definition of binomial coefficients vandermonde s identity also admits a combinatorial double

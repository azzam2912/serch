once this happens the cluster formed by this pair of records is more likely to grow by the addition of even more colliding records regardless of whether the new records hash to the same location as the first two this phenomenon causes searches for keys within the cluster to be longer for instance in linear probing a record involved in a collision is always moved to the next available hash table cell subsequent to the position given by its hash function creating a contiguous cluster of occupied hash table cells whenever another record is hashed to anywhere within the cluster it grows in size by one cell because of this phenomenon it is likely that a linear probing hash table with a constant load factor that is with the size of the table proportional to the number of items it stores will have some clusters of logarithmic length and will take logarithmic time to search for the keys within that cluster a related phenomenon secondary clustering occurs more generally with open addressing modes including linear probing and quadratic probing in which the probe sequence is independent of the key as well as in hash chaining in this phenomenon a low

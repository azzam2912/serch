in 2006 he demonstrated the feasibility of phase sensitive x ray imaging with conventional polychromatic x ray sources and a grating interferometer this enlarged the potential of x ray phase imaging for clinical use as before the technique was only possible at synchrotron facilities pfeiffer further introduced the extraction of a supplementary signal so called dark field signal sensitive to porous microstructure of a sample based on x ray scattering his research group at the technical university munich demonstrated a range of possible applications of the new modalities in medical and material research further pfeiffer is known for his research in x ray ptychography x ray tensor tomography grating based neutron interferometric imaging and iterative ct reconstruction algorithms he is author and co author of more than 250 scientific publications and inventor in several patents in 2011 he was awarded the leibniz prize for his achievements in x ray physics

it would heat one side of an object enough to change its orbit and make it hit the atmosphere sooner lasers are designed to target debris between one and ten centimeters in diameter collisions with such debris are commonly of such high velocity that considerable damage and numerous secondary fragments are the result the laser broom is intended to be used at high enough power to penetrate through the atmosphere with enough remaining power to ablate material from the target the ablating material imparts a small thrust that lowers its orbital perigee into the upper atmosphere thereby increasing drag so that its remaining orbital life is short the laser would operate in pulsed mode to avoid self shielding of the target by the ablated plasma the power levels of lasers in this concept are well below the power levels in concepts for more rapidly effective anti satellite weapons nasa research in 2011 indicated that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could alter velocity by per second persisting with these small velocity changes for a few hours per day could alter its course by per day while not causing the junk to reenter this could maneuver it

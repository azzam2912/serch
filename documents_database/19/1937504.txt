it has 6 pentagon and 2 triangle faces this polyhedron can be constructed by truncating two opposite vertices of a cube of a trigonal trapezohedron a convex polyhedron with six congruent rhombus sides formed by stretching or shrinking a cube along one of its long diagonals or of a rhombohedron or parallelepiped less symmetric polyhedra that still have the same combinatorial structure as a cube in the case of a cube or of a trigonal trapezohedron where the two truncated vertices are the ones on the stretching axes the resulting shape has three fold rotational symmetry this polyhedron is sometimes called d rer s solid from its appearance in albrecht d rer s 1514 engraving melencolia i the graph formed by its edges and vertices is called the d rer graph the shape of the solid depicted by d rer is a subject of some academic debate according to the hypothesis that the shape is a misdrawn truncated cube was promoted by however most sources agree that it is the truncation of a rhombohedron despite this agreement the exact geometry of this rhombohedron is the subject of several contradictory theories

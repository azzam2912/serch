the double span burr arch covered bridge structure was built by j j daniels in 1880 and destroyed by arson on october 13 1976 on march 10 1880 the parke county commissioners advertised that they would be taking bids for a bridge to be built at newcombs ford in florida township on may 14 1880 the bids that had been turned in were opened richard epperson had placed a bid for 8 700 and j j daniels had placed two bids with different plans plan 1 was for 7 600 and plan 2 was for 7 300 daniels plan 1 won the contract the final inspection was completed on october 13 1880 early on most covered bridges weren t painted and when they were they were usually painted white this bridge was painted red and also had its ends painted red most bridges had their ends painted white for improved visibility another benefit to painting the bridges may have been that it aided in the horses not being leery of entering them thinking that the bridge was only a long barn rather than a bridge crossing over running water shortly after the bridge was damaged by arson in 1969 william

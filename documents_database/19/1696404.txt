an understanding of the theory and engineering of this formation is an important part of the development of such machines and their cutting tools the formal study of chip formation was encouraged around world war ii and shortly afterwards with increases in the use of faster and more powerful cutting machines particularly for metal cutting with the new high speed steel cutters pioneering work in this field was carried out by kivima 1952 and franz 1958 chip formation is usually described according to a three way model developed by franz this model is best known within the field of machine tool design although it is also used when an application area such as woodworking requires a vocabulary to describe chip formation in more detail than is usually attempted the first three chip types are the original characterisation by dr norman franz the type of chip that forms depends on many factors of both tool and material in general main factors are the angle formed by the edge faces of the tool and also the angle at which this is presented to the surface sharpness of the cutting tool does not usually define the type of chip but rather the quality

therefore this perceptual phenomenon has been named repetition pitch rp in general the perceived rp expressed in hz equivalent is equal to the reciprocal value of the delay time t between the original and the repeated sound or in formula rp 1 t with t expressed in seconds rp is most salient when the original sound is wide band in frequency content and does not produce pitch itself like white noise which contains all audible frequencies in equal strength probably the first written report of the phenomenon dates from 1693 when christiaan huygens noted such a pitch in the wide band sound from a fountain repeatedly reflected against the steps of a large stone staircase in the garden of the castle of chantilly in france in an open field one might be able to hear a gliding rp when a plane flies over in music the phenomenon is sometimes deliberately created by electronic means delay and add to superimpose a pitch or coloration effect on the original music see flanging in room acoustics and sound recording however the phenomenon often causes an unwanted coloration of the original sound see repetition pitch for various sound demos blind people might use rp

in other words not all the air in each breath is available for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide mammals breathe in and out of their lungs wasting that part of the inhalation which remains in the conducting airways where no gas exchange can occur benefits do accrue to a seemingly wasteful design for ventilation that includes dead space in humans about a third of every resting breath has no change in o and co levels in adults it is usually in the range of 150 ml dead space can be increased and better envisioned by breathing through a long tube such as a snorkel even though one end of the snorkel is open to the air when the wearer breathes in they inhale a significant quantity of air that remained in the snorkel from the previous exhalation thus a snorkel increases the person s dead space by adding even more airway that doesn t participate in gas exchange the total dead space also known as physiological dead space is the sum of the anatomical dead space plus the alveolar dead space anatomical dead space is that portion of the airways such as the mouth and trachea to the

the curie temperature is named after pierre curie who showed that magnetism was lost at a critical temperature the force of magnetism is determined by the magnetic moment a dipole moment within an atom which originates from the angular momentum and spin of electrons materials have different structures of intrinsic magnetic moments that depend on temperature the curie temperature is the critical point at which a material s intrinsic magnetic moments change direction permanent magnetism is caused by the alignment of magnetic moments and induced magnetism is created when disordered magnetic moments are forced to align in an applied magnetic field for example the ordered magnetic moments ferromagnetic figure 1 change and become disordered paramagnetic figure 2 at the curie temperature higher temperatures make magnets weaker as spontaneous magnetism only occurs below the curie temperature magnetic susceptibility above the curie temperature can be calculated from the curie weiss law which is derived from curie s law in analogy to ferromagnetic and paramagnetic materials the curie temperature can also be used to describe the phase transition between ferroelectricity and paraelectricity in this context the order parameter is the electric polarization that goes from a finite value to zero when the temperature

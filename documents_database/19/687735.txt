aspects of a complex technical specification may necessarily have more than one interpretation and there are probably many optional features these aspects constitute a profile of the standard two implementations engineered from the same description may not interoperate due to having a different profile of the standard vendors can even ignore features that they view as unimportant yet prevail in the long run the use of profiles in these ways can force one interpretation or create de facto standards from official standards engineers can design or procure by using a profile to ensure interoperability for example the international standard profile isp is used by the iso in their iso isp series of standards in the context of osi networking britain uses the uk gosip profile and the us uses us gosip there are also various mobile profiles adopted by the w3c for web standards in particular implementations of standards on mobile devices often have significant limitations compared to their traditional desktop implementations even if the standard which governs both permits such limitations in structural engineering a profile means a hot rolled structural steel shape like an beam in civil engineering a profile consists of a plotted line which indicates grades

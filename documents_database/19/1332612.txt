it aims at providing middleware that serves third party value added services and applications at a higher application layer the service layer provides capability servers owned by a telecommunication network service provider accessed through open and secure application programming interfaces apis by application layer servers owned by third party content providers the service layer also provides an interface to core networks at a lower resource layer the lower layers may also be named control layer and transport layer the transport layer is also referred to as the access layer in some architectures the concept of service layer is used in contexts such as intelligent networks in wap 3g and ip multimedia subsystem ims it is defined in the 3gpp open services architecture osa model which reused the idea of the parlay api for third party servers in software design for example service oriented architecture the concept of service layer has a different meaning the service layer of an ims architecture provides multimedia services to the overall ims network this layer contains network elements which connect to the serving cscf call session control function using the ip multimedia subsystem service control interface isc the isc interface uses the sip signalling protocol

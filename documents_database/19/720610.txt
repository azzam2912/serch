the conjectures generalize the analytic class number formula expressing the leading coefficient of the taylor series for the dedekind zeta function of a number field as the product of a regulator related to s units of the field and a rational number when k k is an abelian extension and the order of vanishing of the l function at s 0 is one stark gave a refinement of his conjecture predicting the existence of certain s units called stark units and cristian dumitru popescu gave extensions of this refined conjecture to higher orders of vanishing the stark conjectures in the most general form predict that the leading coefficient of an artin l function is the product of a type of regulator the stark regulator with an algebraic number when the extension is abelian and the order of vanishing of an l function at s 0 is one stark s refined conjecture predicts the existence of the stark units whose roots generate kummer extensions of k that are abelian over the base field k and not just abelian over k as kummer theory implies as such this refinement of his conjecture has theoretical implications for solving hilbert s twelfth problem also

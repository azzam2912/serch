the family is known to have existed from the late oligocene to the early pleistocene before going extinct although some phylogenetic studies conducted by recovered the living pygmy right whale as a member of cetotheriidae making the pygmy right whale the only living cetotheriid other authors either dispute this placement or recover neobalaenidae as a sister group to cetotheriidae after its description by brant in 1872 cetotheriidae was used as a wastebasket taxon for baleen whales which were not assignable to extant whale families comparing the cranial and mandibular morphology of 23 taxa including late archaeocetes and both fossil and extant mysticetes found cetotheriidae in this traditional sense to be polyphyletic based on ten cranial characters they also concluded that of the twelve included fossil baleen bearing mysticetes six formed a monophyletic group cetotheriidae sensu stricto several phylogenetic studies since bouetel muizon 2006 support the monophyly of a small group of core cetotheriidae sensu stricto archaic mysticetes with a cranium that have a long ascending process of the maxilla with anteriorly diverging lateral border that interdigitates with the frontal and some other characters this group is limited to cetotherium rathkii metopocetus durinasus mixocetus elysius herpetocetus scaldiensis h transatlanticus h bramblei

knight he worked at the cole polytechnique f d rale de lausanne in switzerland from 1987 to 1997 and is currently a regents professor of physics at the georgia institute of technology he directs the epitaxial graphene laboratory in the school of physics and leads the epitaxial graphene interdisciplinary research group at the georgia tech materials research science and engineering center de heer and his research groups have made significant contributions to several important areas in nanoscopic physics as a graduate student at uc berkeley he participated in groundbreaking research on alkali metal clusters that demonstrated the electronic shell structure of metal clusters this is a property of small metal clusters composed of few atoms that develop atom like electronic properties these clusters are also referred to as superatoms in switzerland he developed methods of measuring the magnetic properties of cold metal clusters and described how magnetism develops in these clusters as their size increases from atomic to bulk he is the author of the most highly cited review articles on metallic clusters de heer turned to carbon nanotubes in 1995 showing that they are excellent field emitters with potential application to flat panel displays in 1998 he discovered that

given its predictable run time its favourable trade off between quality of the results and computing time and its suitability for fast parallel implementation in fpga it has encountered wide adoption in real time stereo vision applications such as robotics and advanced driver assistance systems pixelwise stereo matching allows to perform real time calculation of disparity maps by measuring the similarity of each pixel in one stereo image to each pixel within a subset in the other stereo image given a rectified stereo image pair for a pixel with coordinates formula 1 the set of pixels in the other image is usually selected as formula 2 where formula 3 is a maximum allowed disparity shift a simple search for the best matching pixel produces many spurious matches and this problem can be mitigated with the addition of a regularisation term that penalises jumps in disparity between adjacent pixels with a cost function in the form where formula 5 is the pixel wise dissimilarity cost at pixel formula 6 with disparity formula 7 and formula 8 is the regularisation cost between pixels formula 6 and formula 10 with disparities formula 11 and formula 12 respectively for all pairs of neighbouring pixels

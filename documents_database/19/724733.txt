the group is called fat if it is not thin given any generating set of the group we can consider a graph whose vertices are elements of the group with two vertices adjacent if their ratio is in the generating set the graph is connected and vertex transitive paths in the graph correspond to words in the generators if the graph has a cycle of a given length it has a cycle of the same length containing the identity element thus the girth of the graph corresponds to the minimum length of a nontrivial word that reduces to the identity a nontrivial word is a word that if viewed as a word in the free group does not reduce to the identity if the graph has no cycles its girth is set to be infinity the girth depends on the choice of generating set a thin group is a group where the girth has an upper bound for all finite generating sets some facts about thin and fat groups and about girths

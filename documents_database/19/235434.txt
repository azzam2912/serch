examples of the latter are tripods hiking poles or similar telescoping device the clamping mechanism is based on a cam a set screw or similar locking mechanism slip joints can also be non telescoping such as the joints on some older wooden surveyor s levelling rods these use a joint that keeps the sections offset from each other but able to be slid together for transport examples of continuous slip joints are given below slip joints in large structures are used to allow independent motion of large components while enabling them to be joined in some way for example if two tall buildings are to be joined with a pedestrian skyway at some high level there are two options in structural engineering if the buildings are identical in mass and elasticity they will tend to respond similarly to ground motion induced by earthquakes in this case it may be appropriate to construct a rigid connection between the buildings although this may require additional supporting members within the structures on the other hand a lower cost connection may be made by using a lightweight structure that is not coupled rigidly but instead which is allowed to slide or float relative to

different criticality applications are engineered to different levels of assurance with high criticality applications being the most costly to design and verify these kinds of systems are typically embedded in a machine such as an aircraft whose safety must be ensured traditional safety critical systems had to be tested and certified in their entirety to show that they were safe to use however many such systems are composed of a mixture of safety critical and non critical parts as for example when an aircraft contains a passenger entertainment system that is isolated from the safety critical flight systems some issues to address in mixed criticality systems include real time behaviour memory isolation data and control coupling computer scientists have developed techniques for handling systems which thus have mixed criticality but there are many challenges remaining especially for multi core hardware basically most errors are currently committed when making confusion between priority attribution and criticality management as priority defines an order between different tasks or messages to be transmitted inside a system criticality define classes of messages which can have different parameters depending on the current use case for example in case of car crash avoidance or obstacle anticipation camera sensors

it hangs downwards from the water surface held up by a float of its own construction and is carried along by ocean currents as an adult d fascicularis lives attached to a float made either of natural flotsam or of a cement it secretes itself which has a texture like that of expanded polystyrene foam it is the only barnacle to produce its own gas filled float the cyprid larvae are planktonic and must attach to a float for metamorphosis into the adult form but the adults are eventually capable of using their own float sometimes forming aggregations of many individuals attached to a single float among the floats used by adult buoy barnacles are pellets of tar seaweeds plastic debris driftwood feathers cranberries cuttlefish bone the by the wind sailor velella velella seagrass leaves styrofoam seeds and even apples they have even been known to colonise the backs of turtles and the sea snake pelamis platurus it is a fugitive species which can be out competed by other barnacle species and relies on being able to colonise surfaces and reproduce quickly after settling on a float d fascicularis can reproduce within 45 days d fascicularis appears to be increasing

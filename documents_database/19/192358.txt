it can be used in conjunction with the sylow theorems to obtain certain numerical results on the existence of finite simple groups the transfer was defined by and rediscovered by the construction of the map proceeds as follows let g h n and select coset representatives say for h in g so g can be written as a disjoint union given y in g each yx is in some coset xh and so for some index j and some element h of h the value of the transfer for y is defined to be the image of the product in h h where h is the commutator subgroup of h the order of the factors is irrelevant since h h is abelian it is straightforward to show that though the individual h depends on the choice of coset representatives the value of the transfer does not it is also straightforward to show that the mapping defined this way is a homomorphism if g is abelian then the transfer takes any element y of g to y a simple case is that seen in the gauss lemma on quadratic residues which in effect computes the transfer for the multiplicative group of

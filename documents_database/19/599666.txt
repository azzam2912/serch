these terms reveal some of the internal structure of the messages but some parts will hopefully remain opaque to the adversary the adversary in this model can overhear intercept and synthesize any message and is only limited by the constraints of the cryptographic methods used in other words the attacker carries the message this omnipotence has been very difficult to model and many threat models simplify it as for example the attacker in ubiquitous computing cryptographic primitives are modeled by abstract operators for example asymmetric encryption for a user formula 1 is represented by the encryption function formula 2 and the decryption function formula 3 their main properties are that their composition is the identity function formula 4 and that an encrypted message formula 5 reveals nothing about formula 6 unlike in the real world the adversary can neither manipulate the encryption s bit representation nor guess the key the attacker may however re use any messages that have been sent and therefore become known the attacker can encrypt or decrypt these with any keys he knows to forge subsequent messages a protocol is modeled as a set of sequential runs alternating between queries sending a message over the network

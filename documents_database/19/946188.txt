there are two types of self assembly these are intramolecular self assembly and intermolecular self assembly commonly the term molecular self assembly refers to intermolecular self assembly while the intramolecular analog is more commonly called folding molecular self assembly is a key concept in supramolecular chemistry this is because assembly of molecules in such systems is directed through noncovalent interactions e g hydrogen bonding metal coordination hydrophobic forces van der waals forces interactions and or electrostatic as well as electromagnetic interactions common examples include the formation of micelles vesicles liquid crystal phases and langmuir monolayers by surfactant molecules further examples of supramolecular assemblies demonstrate that a variety of different shapes and sizes can be obtained using molecular self assembly molecular self assembly allows the construction of challenging molecular topologies one example is borromean rings interlocking rings wherein removal of one ring unlocks each of the other rings dna has been used to prepare a molecular analog of borromean rings more recently a similar structure has been prepared using non biological building blocks molecular self assembly underlies the construction of biologic macromolecular assemblies in living organisms and so is crucial to the function of cells it is exhibited in the self

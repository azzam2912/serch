phosphinimide ligands are used to for transition metal complexes that are highly active catalysts in some olefin polymerization reactions although phosphinoimidates are formally anions salts of the anions are typically unavailable owing to their high basicity instead the ligand is installed indirectly preparation of phosphinoimidate complexes are achieved in high yield from the corresponding silyl derivatives rpnsime me ch these derivatives are prepared by oxidation of phosphine ligands with trimethylsilyl azide also known as the staudinger reaction starting from these silyl compounds a variety of phosphinoimidate complexes can be prepared for example reaction of dirhenium heptoxide with n trimethylsilyl triphenylphosphoraneimine yields the monomeric phosphoraneiminato complex reo npph and hexamethylsiloxane the first phosphinoimidate complexes were prepared by reaction of phosphines with molybdenum and tungsten nitrido complexes this reaction is accompanied by reduction of the metal from vi to iv and phosphorus from iii to v the main limitation of this reaction is the relative rarity of metal nitride complexes phosphinoimidate complexes of transition metals containing the rp n ligand are known to adopt several bonding modes in complexes with metal ions in low oxidation states i ii the rp n group often serves as a n bridging ligand for complexes of

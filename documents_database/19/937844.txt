it is a key enzyme in ketogenesis ketone body formation it is a ketongenic enzyme in the liver that catalyzes the formation of acetoacetate from hmg coa within the mitochondria it also plays a prominent role in the catabolism of the amino acid leucine the hmgcl gene encodes a 34 5 kda protein that is localized to the mitochondrion and peroxisome multible isoforms of the proteins are known due to alternative splicing the major isoform isoform 1 is most highly expressed in the liver whereas isoform 2 is found in energy demanding tissues including the brain heart and skeletal muscle structure of the hmgcl protein has been resolved by x ray crystallography at 2 1 resolution and reveals that the protein may function as a dimer substrate access to the active site of the hmgcl enzyme involves substrate binding across a cavity located at the c terminal end of a beta barrel structure in addition the lysine 48 residue which is mutated in patients with 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa lyase deficiency is also found to be necessary for substrate binding the hmgcl protein plays an essential role in breaking down dietary proteins and fats for energy it catalyzes the

the alcohol undergoes an inversion of stereochemistry it was discovered by oyo mitsunobu 1934 2003 several reviews have been published the reaction mechanism of the mitsunobu reaction is fairly complex the identity of intermediates and the roles they play has been the subject of debate initially the triphenyl phosphine 2 makes a nucleophilic attack upon diethyl azodicarboxylate 1 producing a betaine intermediate 3 which deprotonates the carboxylic acid 4 to form the ion pair 5 dead itself deprotonates the alcohol 6 forming an alkoxide that can form the key oxyphosphonium ion 8 the ratio and interconversion of intermediates 8 11 depend on the carboxylic acid pka and the solvent polarity although several phosphorus intermediates are present the attack of the carboxylate anion upon intermediate 8 is the only productive pathway forming the desired product 12 and triphenylphosphine oxide 13 hughes et al have found that the formation of the ion pair 5 is very fast the formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediate 8 is slow and facilitated by the alkoxide therefore the overall rate of reaction is controlled by carboxylate basicity and solvation the order of addition of the reagents of the mitsunobu reaction can be important typically one dissolves the

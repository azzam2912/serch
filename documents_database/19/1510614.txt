historically it was the second of three bells rung around death the first being the passing bell to warn of impending death and the last was the lych bell or corpse bell which survives today as the funeral toll in england an ancient custom was the ringing of bells at three specific times before and after death sometimes a passing bell was first rung when the person was still dying then the death knell upon the death and finally the lych bell which was rung at the funeral as the procession approached the church the ringing of the lych bell is now called the funeral toll the canon law of the church of england also permitted tolling after the funeral during the reign of henry viii and elizabeth i statutes regulated death knell but the immediate ringing after death fell into disuse it was customary in some places by the end of the 19th century to ring the death knell as soon as notice reached the clerk of the church parish clerk or sexton unless the sun had set in which case it was rung at an early hour the following morning elsewhere it was customary to postpone the death

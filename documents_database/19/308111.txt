the essential process involves the dissolving of an internally held salt in water or occasionally in another solvent the water with the salt now held in solution migrates to the surface then evaporates leaving a coating of the salt in what has been described as primary efflorescence the water is the invader and the salt was already present internally some people describe a reverse process where the salt is originally present externally and is then carried inside in solution as secondary efflorescence however others would give this latter phenomenon another name entirely efflorescences can occur in natural and built environments on porous construction materials it may present a cosmetic outer problem only primary efflorescence causing staining but can sometimes indicate internal structural weakness migration degradation of component materials efflorescence may clog the pores of porous materials resulting in the destruction of those materials by internal water pressure as seen in the spalling of brick primary efflorescence is named such as it typically occurs during the initial cure of a cementitious product it often occurs on masonry construction particularly brick as well as some firestop mortars when water moving through a wall or other structure or water being driven out as

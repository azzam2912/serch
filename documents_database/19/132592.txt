this fitness level is used to associate a probability of selection with each individual chromosome if formula 1 is the fitness of individual formula 2 in the population its probability of being selected is where formula 4 is the number of individuals in the population this could be imagined similar to a roulette wheel in a casino usually a proportion of the wheel is assigned to each of the possible selections based on their fitness value this could be achieved by dividing the fitness of a selection by the total fitness of all the selections thereby normalizing them to 1 then a random selection is made similar to how the roulette wheel is rotated while candidate solutions with a higher fitness will be less likely to be eliminated there is still a chance that they may be eliminated because their probability of selection is less than 1 or 100 contrast this with a less sophisticated selection algorithm such as truncation selection which will eliminate a fixed percentage of the weakest candidates with fitness proportionate selection there is a chance some weaker solutions may survive the selection process this is because even though the probability that the weaker solutions will survive

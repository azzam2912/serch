it was discovered in 2007 in samples of human respiratory secretions originally from a child patient in australia who presented with clinical signs of pneumonia and in whom other common respiratory viruses were not detected follow up studies identified the presence of wu virus in respiratory secretion samples from patients in australia and the united states suggesting that like other human polyomaviruses wu virus is widely distributed wu virus was discovered by shotgun sequencing of the nucleic acids found in the respiratory secretions of a young patient diagnosed with pneumonia in whom other known respiratory viruses had not been detected sequence homology was detected among the sequences found in the clinical sample and the known genomes of other human polyomaviruses wu virus was one of two new human polyomaviruses discovered in 2007 the other was ki virus the complete genome of the wu virus has been sequenced and found to be a circular double stranded dna genome of 5229 base pairs containing genetic material characteristic of polyomaviruses encoding five viral proteins three capsid components major capsid protein vp1 vp2 and vp3 and two additional proteins involved in replication the large tumor antigen and small tumor antigen although wu virus has

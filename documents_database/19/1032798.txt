it should not be confused with polybutene a low molecular weight oligomer polybutylene is produced by polymerisation of 1 butene using supported ziegler natta catalysts pb 1 is a high molecular weight linear isotactic and semi crystalline polymer pb 1 combines typical characteristics of conventional polyolefins with certain properties of technical polymers pb 1 when applied as a pure or reinforced resin can replace materials like metal rubber and engineering polymers it is also used synergistically as a blend element to modify the characteristics of other polyolefins like polypropylene and polyethylene because of its specific properties it is mainly used in pressure piping flexible packaging water heaters compounding and hot melt adhesives isotactic pb 1 is synthesized commercially using two types of heterogeneous ziegler natta catalysts the first type of catalyst contains two components a solid pre catalyst the crystalline form of ticl and solution of an organoaluminum cocatalyst such as al ch the second type of pre catalyst is supported the active ingredient in the catalyst is ticl and the support is microcrystalline mgcl these catalysts also contain special modifiers organic compounds belonging to the classes of esters or ethers the pre catalysts are activated by combinations of organoaluminum

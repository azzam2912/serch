lin manuel miranda wrote both the music and lyrics to the song the song recounts the events of the 1804 duel in weehawken new jersey between then vice president aaron burr and former secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton the song begins in burr s perspective burr states ten facts about the duel particularly facts that made it clear that hamilton had the advantage as a reprise of ten duel commandments plays noting that the duel is taking place in the same spot where hamilton s son was killed in a duel burr also states that he will not allow hamilton to kill him because he doesn t want his daughter to become an orphan and also because he is tired of waiting for his moment reflecting hamilton s own methodology from my shot he shoots hamilton and as the bullet approaches him time freezes and hamilton breaks into a soliloquy wondering if his death will be his legacy before realizing that a legacy by definition is something no one ever really lives to see as well as something no one can control but finds peace by mentioning some of his deceased friends who await him on the other side

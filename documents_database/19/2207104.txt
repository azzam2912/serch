historically the proton radius was measured via two independent methods which converged to a value of about 0 877 femtometres 1 fm 10 m this value was challenged by a 2010 experiment utilizing a third method which produced a radius about 5 smaller than this or 0 842 femtometres the discrepancy was resolved when research conducted by hessel et al confirmed the same radius for electronic hydrogen as well as its muonic variant prior to 2010 the proton radius was measured using one of two methods one relying on spectroscopy and one relying on nuclear scattering the spectroscopy method uses the energy levels of electrons orbiting the nucleus the exact values of the energy levels is sensitive to the nuclear radius see lamb shift for hydrogen whose nuclei consists only of one proton this indirectly measures the proton radius measurements of hydrogen s energy levels are now so precise that the proton radius is the limiting factor when comparing experimental results to theoretical calculations this method produces a proton radius of about or with approximately 1 relative uncertainty the nuclear method is similar to rutherford s scattering experiments that established the existence of the nucleus small particles such as electrons

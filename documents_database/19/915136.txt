in tomography the 3d distribution of some physical quantity in the object is determined there is a widespread need to get tomographic information about process this information can be used for example in the design and control of processes tomography involves taking measurements around the periphery of an object e g process vessel or patient to determine what is going on inside the best known technique is ct scanning in medicine however process tomography instrumentation needs to be cheaper faster and more robust many different imaging methods are used in process tomography e g ultrasonic imaging positron emission tomography pet electrical resistance tomography ert and electrical impedance tomography eit electrical capacitance tomography ect magnetic induction tomography mit in all cases external sensors are used to detect signals from boundary of the object and the three dimensional material distribution or the velocity field is computed using the measured data process tomography is an area of rapid growth both in terms of research and applications there are number of challenges remaining in this area including data processing an image reconstruction and application of imaging modalities in a real applications

solovay proved in 1975 that a set can be k trivial without being computable the schnorr levin theorem says that random sets have a high initial segment complexity thus the k trivials are far from random this is why these sets are studied in the field of algorithmic randomness which is a subfield of computability theory and related to algorithmic information theory in computer science at the same time k trivial sets are close to computable for instance they are all superlow i e sets whose turing jump is computable from the halting problem and form a turing ideal i e class of sets closed under turing join and closed downward under turing reduction let k be the prefix free kolmogorov complexity i e given a string x k x outputs the least length of the input string under a prefix free universal machine such a machine intuitively represents a universal programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program for more background of k see e g chaitin s constant we say a set a of the natural numbers is k trivial via a constant b if a

it was standardized by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences as the standard film aspect ratio in 1932 although similar sized ratios were used as early as 1928 silent films were shot at a 1 3 aspect ratio also known as a 4 3 aspect ratio with each frame using all of the negative space between the two rows of film perforations for a length of 4 perforations the frame line between the silent film frames was very thin when sound on film was introduced in the late 1920s the soundtrack was recorded in a stripe running just inside of one set of the perforations and cut into the 1 33 image this made the image area taller usually around 1 19 which was slightly disorienting to audiences used to the 1 3 frame and also presented problems for exhibitors with fixed size screens and stationary projectors from studio to studio the common attempt to reduce the image back to a 1 3 1 ratio by decreasing the projector aperture in house met with conflicting results each movie theater chain furthermore had its own designated house ratio the first standards set for the new sound on film motion

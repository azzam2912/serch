drift iid which is located 1100m underground in the boulby underground laboratory at the boulby mine in north yorkshire england and drift iie which is located on the surface at occidental college los angeles ca usa the drift collaboration ultimately aims to develop and operate an underground array of drift detectors for observing and reconstructing wimp induced nuclear recoil tracks with enough precision to provide a signature of the dark matter halo there are numerous experiments worldwide attempting to detect the energy deposition that is expected to occur when a wimp directly collides with an atom of ordinary matter ultra sensitive experiments are required to detect the low energy and extremely rare interaction that is predicted to occur between a wimp and the nucleus of an atom in a target material the drift detectors vary from the majority of wimp detectors in their use of a low pressure gas as a target material the low pressure gas means that an interaction within the detector causes an ionisation track of measurable length compared to the point like interactions seen in detectors with solid or liquid target materials such ionisation tracks can be reconstructed in three dimensions to determine not only the

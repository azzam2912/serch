it is particularly notable for being the first macintosh virus not to create additional resources within infected files instead it patches existing code resources the most commonly encountered strains of anti have only subtle effects and thus can exist and spread indefinitely without being noticed until an antivirus application is run due to a bug in the virus it cannot spread if multifinder is running which prevents it from infecting system 7 and later versions of mac os as well as system 5 and 6 running multifinder anti only infects applications as opposed to system files and therefore can only spread when an infected application is run when such an application calls the openresfile function the virus searches the computer for applications that fulfill all of the following criteria all matching applications are then infected by appending the virus to the code 1 resource and adding a corresponding entry to the application s jump table there are three strains of anti with the following differences all strains carry a payload related to floppy disk access when an infected application calls the mountvol function the virus checks that the disk is actually a floppy disk and if so reads the first

even though these are non standard threads both iso metric screw thread designations and unc designations have been used to call out thread dimensions and fit class a typical use for a fine adjustment screw is in an optical mirror mount as an adjuster typically 80 tpi screws are used in mirror mounts ultra fine adjuster screws are used in applications requiring extremely fine motion like laser alignment fiber coupling fine and ultra fine adjustment screws are often used in photonics applications as part of purchased equipment i e mirror mounts or built into lab made home built apparatus often screws are purchased with matching bushings to be integrated into an experiment or commercial product once attained fine adjustment screws and mirror mounts are available as standard items from most companies that sell optics hardware the fine motion can most easily be calculated by using the pitch or tpi to determine how many micrometres per revolution the screw moves the table below shows some common examples the screw turns 360 in one revolution and with well made screws minimal stiction and a user with a sensitive touch 1 movements can be achieved thus with the ultra fine adjusters sub micrometre

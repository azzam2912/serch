its distribution overlaps broadly but is slightly north of the similar southern giant petrel macronectes giganteus both giant petrel species make up the genus macronectes they belong to the order procellariiformes the tube nosed seabirds or petrels all tube noses have tubular nostrils and all those in the family procellariidae the true petrels have their nostrils united along the top of the bill procellariform birds have between seven and nine distinct horny plates for their bill and in petrels one of these plates forms the hooked portion of their upper bill called the maxillary unguis they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus this can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights finally they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies due to the high amount of sea water that they imbibe it excretes a concentrated saline solution from their nostrils the genus macronectes comes from the greek makros meaning long or large and n kt s meaning

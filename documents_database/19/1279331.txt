it maintains that if quasars were powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole then such supermassive black holes must exist in our local universe as dead quasars as early as 1969 donald lynden bell wrote a paper suggesting that dead quasars were found at the center of the milky way and nearby galaxies by arguing that given the quasar number counts luminosities distances and the efficiency of accretion into a schwarzschild throat through the last stable circular orbit note that the term black hole had been coined only two years earlier and was still gaining popular usage roughly 10 quasars existed in the observable universe this number density of dead quasars was attributed by lynden bell to high mass to light ratio objects found at the center of galaxies this is essentially the so tan argument though the direct connection between black hole masses and quasar luminosity functions is missing in the paper lynden bell also suggests some radical ideas that are now fully integrated into modern understanding of astrophysics including the model that accretion disks are supported by magnetic fields that extragalactic cosmic rays are accelerated in them and he estimates to within an order of magnitude the

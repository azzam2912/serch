the structure of iptx consists of the molecular weight of the toxin is 3 7 kda iptx acts on the ryanodine receptors ryr which are intracellular ca release channels mainly known for their role in regulating ca release from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum of striated muscles the peptide acts better on ryr type 1 than on type 3 ryr type 2 seems to be insensitive to iptx the part of the peptide that looks like the ii iii loop of the dhpr binds directly to ryr and enhances ryanodine binding to trigger ca release the toxin comes from the venom of the african scorpion pandinus imperator the structure of iptx consists of the molecular weight of the toxin is 15 kda like iptx iptx acts on ryr when an action potential reaches the muscle ryr channels open and ca becomes available in the cell to induce contraction the presence of ca induces the large subunit of iptx to hydrolyze the sn2 fatty acyl bond from the membrane of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum this process is executed by pla2 activity the freed fatty acids bind to the ryr itself or to a closely associated protein linked to gating binding of the ryr induces

the concept is the yakuza versus society shifting from the yakuza versus the police the ordinances prohibit citizens from making or keeping up a relationship with the yakuza the targeted acts and treatment for the violators differ between prefectures some prefectures only set an obligation of endeavor to citizens or a penalty in which companies in violation of the law are publicly exposed but others impose imprisonment or a fine on their citizens among the prefectures fukuoka leads the way in toughening the regulations fukuoka was the first prefecture where the comprehensive ordinance came into force commencing april 10 2010 once the ordinances of okinawa and tokyo went into effect on october 10 2011 all of japan s prefectures have had the ordinance the ordinances pursue cutting any implicit relationships between citizens and the yakuza some of the prohibitions contain punishment against citizens but a few of the definitions and their range of application are blurry especially what acts should be regarded as a payoff that assists the yakuza s activity or operation and close association with the yakuza these definitions remain somewhat arbitrary for the authorities there is criticism based on violation of freedom of expression and the yakuza

this protein is an essential component to form the protein complex of clp protease endopeptidase clp enzyme clpp is a highly conserved serine protease present throughout bacterial and also found in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells the clpp monomer is folded into three subdomains the handle the globular head and the n terminal region by itself clpp can assemble into a tetradecamer complex 14 members and form a closed proteolytic chamber a fully assembled clp protease complex has a barrel shaped structure in which two stacked ring of proteolytic subunits clpp or clpq are either sandwiched between two rings or single caped by one ring of atpase active chaperon subunits clpa clpc clpe clpx or clpy clpxp is presented in almost all bacteria while clpa is found in the gram negative bacteria clpc in gram positive bacteria and cyanobacteria clpap clpxp and clpyq coexist in e coli while only clpxp complex in present in humans in bacteria it was shown that clpp is capable to cleave full length proteins without being associated with clpa but the degradation is at a much slower rate fully functional clp protease requires the participation of aaa atpase these clpx chaperons recognize unfold

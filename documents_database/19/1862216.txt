the lod ing algorithm reduces the geometrical complexity of a 3d object the further it is from the viewer and returns that lost complexity as the viewer gets closer to the 3d object causing it to pop as it becomes suddenly more detailed the lod ing algorithms can depend on more factors than just distance from the viewer but it is often the primary factor that is considered popping is most obvious when switching between different lods directly without intermediate steps techniques like geomorphing and lod blending can reduce visual popping significantly by making the transitions more gradual also known as alpha blending this technique reduces popping by displaying both lods of a 3d model simultaneously and blending them together over a small transition period during the blending process an alpha value is specified for each lod which determine transparency of objects at the beginning of the transition the initial lod would have an alpha value of 1 0 fully opaque and the new lod would be have an alpha value of 0 0 fully transparent as the viewer approaches the 3d object and reaches the distance when the lod change would normally occur the lod alpha values would gradually

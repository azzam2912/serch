moreover consider real one forms that are the real parts of complex differentials let and formally define the conjugate one form to be there is a clear connection with complex analysis let us write a complex number z in terms of its real and imaginary parts say x and y respectively i e since from the point of view of complex analysis the quotient tends to a limit as d z tends to 0 in other words the definition of was chosen for its connection with the concept of a derivative analyticity another connection with the complex unit is that just as for a given function f let us write i e where denotes the partial derivative then now d d f is not always zero indeed where as we have seen above we call the one form harmonic if both and are closed this means that is closed and is closed these are called the cauchy riemann equations on usually they are expressed in terms of as and

this is associated with movement and bilateral symmetry such that the animal has a definite head end this led to the formation of a highly sophisticated brain in three groups of animals namely the arthropods cephalopod molluscs and vertebrates cnidaria such as the radially symmetrical hydrozoa show some degree of cephalization the anthomedusae have a head end with their mouth photoreceptive cells and a concentration of neural cells cephalization is a characteristic feature of the bilateria a large group containing the majority of animal phyla these have the ability to move using muscles and a body plan with a front end that encounters stimuli first as the animal moves forwards and accordingly has evolved to contain many of the body s sense organs able to detect light chemicals and often sound there is often also a collection of nerve cells able to process the information from these sense organs forming a brain in several phyla and one or more ganglia in others the acoela are basal bilaterians part of the xenacoelomorpha they are small and simple animals and have very slightly more nerve cells at the head end than elsewhere not forming a distinct and compact brain this represents an

basic job control features are the suspending resuming or terminating of all processes in the job process group more advanced features can be performed by sending signals to the job job control is of particular interest in unix due to its multiprocessing and should be distinguished from job control generally which is frequently applied to sequential execution batch processing when using unix or unix like operating systems via a terminal or terminal emulator a user will initially only have a single process running their login shell most tasks directory listing editing files etc can easily be accomplished by letting the program take control of the terminal and returning control to the shell when the program exits formally by attaching to standard input and standard output to the shell which reads or writes from the terminal and catching signals sent from the keyboard like the termination signal resulting from pressing however sometimes the user will wish to carry out a task while using the terminal for another purpose a task that is running but is not receiving input from the terminal is said to be running in the background while the single task that is receiving input from the terminal is

it is closely related to the plenary power doctrine that immunizes from judicial review the substantive immigration decisions of the united states congress and the executive branch of the united states government since the alien denied entry at a consulate abroad was not subject to the jurisdiction of the united states it is not a priori clear whether the alien has standing to sue in the us justice system however the principle of consular nonreviewability goes further than simply denying aliens standing it also creates a strong presumption against judicial review of consular decisions requested by united states citizens and residents affected by them consular nonreviewability specifically applies to decisions made by consular officers representing the united states in other countries who are employees of the united states department of state it does not apply to decisions made by united states citizenship and immigration services for many immigrant and non immigrant visas the approval of a petition or application from the uscis is a prerequisite for obtaining the visa however the visa may be denied despite the uscis application having been approved and consular nonreviewability insulates such decisions from challenge for instance in the case of kerry v din 2015

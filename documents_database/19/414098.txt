in adults sinus tachycardia is defined as a heart rate greater than 100 beats min bpm the normal resting heart rate is 60 100 bpm in an average male adult and 60 90 bpm in an average female adult normal heart rate varies with age from infants having faster heart rates 110 150 bpm and the elderly having slower heart rates sinus tachycardia is a normal response to physical exercise when the heart rate increases to meet the body s higher demand for energy and oxygen but sinus tachycardia can also indicate a health problem thus sinus tachycardia is a medical finding that can be either physiological or pathological tachycardia is often asymptomatic it is often a resulting symptom of a primary disease state and can be an indication of the severity of a disease if the heart rate is too high cardiac output may fall due to the markedly reduced ventricular filling time rapid rates though they may be compensating for ischemia elsewhere increase myocardial oxygen demand and reduce coronary blood flow thus precipitating an ischemic heart or valvular disease sinus tachycardia accompanying a myocardial infarction may be indicative of cardiogenic shock sinus tachycardia is usually a response to

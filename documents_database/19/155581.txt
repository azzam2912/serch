declarative denotative or explicit memory is conscious memory divided into semantic memory facts and episodic memory events medial temporal lobe structures that are critical for long term memory include the hippocampus along with the surrounding hippocampal region consisting of the perirhinal parahippocampal and entorhinal neocortical regions the hippocampus is critical for memory formation and the surrounding medial temporal cortex is currently theorized to be critical for memory storage the prefrontal and visual cortices are also involved in explicit memory research has shown that lesions in the hippocampus of monkeys results in limited impairment of function whereas extensive lesions that include the hippocampus and the medial temporal cortex result in severe impairment the temporal lobe communicates with the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of explicit long term memory modulated by the amygdala the temporal lobe holds the primary auditory cortex which is important for the processing of semantics in both speech and vision in humans wernicke s area which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes plays a key role in tandem with broca s area in the frontal lobe in speech comprehension the functions of the left temporal lobe are not limited to low level

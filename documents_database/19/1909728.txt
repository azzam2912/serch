lumen depreciation is the luminous flux lost over time and thus the complement of lumen maintenance lumen maintenance compares the amount of light produced from a light source or from a luminaire when it is brand new to the amount of light output at a specific time in the future for instance if a luminaire produced 1 000 lumens of light when it was brand new and now produces 700 lumens of light after 30 000 hours then it would have lumen maintenance of 70 at 30 000 hours useful lifetime estimates for led lighting products are typically given in terms of the expected operating hours until light output has diminished to 70 of initial levels denoted l life there are a number of methods for controlling lumen maintenance areas iesna lm 80 is the department of energy doe approved testing method for measuring lumen depreciation of solid state led light sources arrays and modules the illumination engineering society of north america iesna and the department of energy solid state lighting standards development group worked together to create the lm 80 test criteria the iesna lm 80 committee is chaired by jeff hulett cto at vektrex electronic systems inc who

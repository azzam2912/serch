it is given a schl fli symbol t 5 3 5 it has 120 vertices and 54 faces 30 squares 12 decagons and 12 decagrams the central region of the polyhedron is connected to the exterior via 20 small triangular holes the name truncated dodecadodecahedron is somewhat misleading truncation of the dodecadodecahedron would produce rectangular faces rather than squares and the pentagram faces of the dodecahedron would turn into truncated pentagrams rather than decagrams however it is the quasitruncation of the dodecadodecahedron as defined by for this reason it is also known as the quasitruncated dodecadodecahedron coxeter et al credit its discovery to a paper published in 1881 by austrian mathematician johann pitsch cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a truncated dodecadodecahedron are all the triples of numbers obtained by circular shifts and sign changes from the following points where formula 1 is the golden ratio each of these five points has eight possible sign patterns and three possible circular shifts giving a total of 120 different points the truncated dodecadodecahedron forms a cayley graph for the symmetric group on five elements as generated by two group members one that swaps the first two elements of a five tuple and

areas on research interest have focused on improving energy density safety rate capability cycle durability flexibility and cost lithium ion battery anodes have traditionally been made of graphite at this time significant other classes of lithium ion battery anode materials have been proposed and evaluated as alternatives to graphite especially in cases where niche applications require novel approaches several types of metal oxides and sulfides can reversibly intercalate lithium cations at voltages between 1 and 2v against lithium metal with little difference between the charge and discharge steps specifically the mechanism of insertion involves lithium cations filling crystallographic vacancies in the host lattice with minimal changes to the bonding within the host lattice this differentiates intercalation anodes from conversion anodes that store lithium by complete disruption and formation of alternate phases usually as lithia conversion systems typically disproportionate to lithia and a metal or lower metal oxide at low voltages 2v for example coo 2li co lio in 1984 researchers at bell labs reported the synthesis and evaluation of a series of lithiated titanates of specific interest were the anatase form of titanium dioxide and the lithium spinel litio anatase has been observed to have a maximum capacity of 150

introducing the constant of proportionality the resistance one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship where is the current through the conductor in units of amperes v is the voltage measured across the conductor in units of volts and r is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms more specifically ohm s law states that the r in this relation is constant independent of the current ohm s law is an empirical relation which accurately describes the conductivity of the vast majority of electrically conductive materials over many orders of magnitude of current however some materials do not obey ohm s law these are called non ohmic the law was named after the german physicist georg ohm who in a treatise published in 1827 described measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire ohm explained his experimental results by a slightly more complex equation than the modern form above see history in physics the term ohm s law is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law for example the vector form of the law used in electromagnetics and material science where j is the current

lftrs use the thorium fuel cycle with a fluoride based molten liquid salt for fuel in a typical design the liquid is pumped between a critical core and an external heat exchanger where the heat is transferred to a nonradioactive secondary salt the secondary salt then transfers its heat to a steam turbine or closed cycle gas turbine molten salt fueled reactors msrs supply the nuclear fuel mixed into a molten salt they should not be confused with designs that use a molten salt for cooling only fluoride high temperature reactors fhrs and still have a solid fuel molten salt reactors as a class include both burners and breeders in fast or thermal spectra using fluoride or chloride salt based fuels and a range of fissile or fertile consumables lftrs are defined by the use of fluoride fuel salts and the breeding of thorium into uranium 233 in the thermal spectrum the lftr concept was first investigated at the oak ridge national laboratory molten salt reactor experiment in the 1960s though the msre did not use thorium the lftr has recently been the subject of a renewed interest worldwide japan china the uk and private us czech canadian and australian

this was historically offered as an alternative to darwinism some forms of mutationism were effectively saltationist implying large discontinuous jumps speciation such as by polyploidy in plants can sometimes be achieved in a single and in evolutionary terms sudden step evidence exists for various forms of saltation in a variety of organisms prior to charles darwin most evolutionary scientists had been saltationists jean baptiste lamarck was a gradualist but similar to other scientists of the period had written that saltational evolution was possible tienne geoffroy saint hilaire endorsed a theory of saltational evolution that monstrosities could become the founding fathers or mothers of new species by instantaneous transition from one form to the next geoffroy wrote that environmental pressures could produce sudden transformations to establish new species instantaneously in 1864 albert von k lliker revived geoffroy s theory that evolution proceeds by large steps under the name of heterogenesis with the publication of on the origin of species in 1859 charles darwin had denied saltational evolution by writing that evolutionary transformation always proceeds gradually and never in jumps darwin insisted on slow accumulation of small steps in evolution and wrote natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight successive favourable variations

the class of k synchronized sequences lies between the classes of k automatic sequences and k regular sequences let be an alphabet of k symbols where k 2 and let n denote the base k representation of some number n given r 2 a subset r of formula 1 is k synchronized if the relation n n is a right synchronized rational relation over where n n formula 2 r let n 0 be a natural number and let f formula 3 be a map where both n and f n are expressed in base k the sequence f n is k synchronized if the language of pairs formula 4 is regular the class of k synchronized sequences was introduced by carpi and maggi given a k automatic sequence s n and an infinite string s s 1 s 2 let n denote the subword complexity of s that is the number of distinct subwords of length n in s go schaeffer and shallit demonstrated that there exists a finite automaton accepting the language this automaton guesses the endpoints of every contiguous block of symbols in s and verifies that each subword of length n starting within a given block

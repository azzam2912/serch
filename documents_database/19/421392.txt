it requires forward flight to create the aerodynamic lift component a rotastat is a hybrid airship with rotary wings and is typically intended for heavy lift applications its rotary wings can provide lift even when hovering or manoeuvring vertically like a helicopter no production designs have been built but several manned and unmanned prototypes have flown the term hybrid airship has also been used to describe an airship comprising a mix of rigid semi rigid and non rigid construction conventional airships have low operating costs because they need no engine power to remain airborne but are limited in several ways including low payload volume ratios and low speeds additionally ground handling of an airship can be difficult because it is floating in even a light breeze it is susceptible to wind buffeting on the other hand heavier than air aircraft or aerodynes especially rotorcraft require the constant use of power to generate lift and conventional airplanes also require runways the hybrid airship combines the airship s aerostatic lift from a lighter than air gas such as helium with the heavier than air craft s dynamic lift from movement through the air such a hybrid craft is still heavier than air

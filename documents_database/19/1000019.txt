the fgsc is a member of the world federation for culture collections and is a leading collection in the us culture collection network research coordination network the fgsc distributes strains of neurospora and aspergillus as well as limited numbers of fusarium magnaporthe and many strains from current fungal genome projects in the 1980s and 1990s the fgsc added molecular materials including cloned genes cloning vectors and gene libraries to the collection as more fungal genomes have been sequenced the fgsc has re evaluated the definition of a genetic system this has led them to expand the collection with additional materials including strains from genome programs and mutant collections for organisms such as neurospora crassa aspergillus nidulans cryptococcus neoformans and candida albicans as a genetic repository the fgsc has always endeavored to represent the diversity of genetic materials available to that end they hold large numbers of strains of a few different species more specifically strains from 76 different species representing 23 different genera of these there are more than ten strains for only nineteen different species these strains have been deposited by 310 different individuals 64 of whom have deposited only one strain the fgsc also holds a number of

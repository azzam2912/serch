rennie dressed in a referee s jersey keeps time and resolves disputes as the ice judge a cluster of seven blue sliders is placed at the centre of a circle on the table each player in turn answers a series of quick fire questions with each correct answer giving them the chance to fire one orange slider into the circle the player s turn ends when either 90 seconds have elapsed or they have knocked all seven blue sliders out if a blue slider hits the edge of the table and bounces back into the circle it must be knocked out again the player with the slowest time is eliminated the table is divided into concentric rings worth 10 20 30 40 and 50 points working inward and a small circle at the centre worth 100 points each player fires one slider onto the table and may try to knock other players sliders away after all four shots each player answers a question for the point value in which their slider is resting if a slider covers the boundary between two zones the value is set by the zone in which the majority of it rests the process is repeated

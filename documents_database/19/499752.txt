american president george w bush initially called the detainees illegal combatants but without a formal announcement of the policy change the bush presidency changed their description to enemy combatant from july 2004 through march 2005 military authorities conducted a one time combatant status review tribunal for each detainee to confirm whether they had been properly been classified as an enemy combatant the combatant status reviews were criticized by human rights workers because the detainees were not entitled to legal counsel and did not know what allegations they had to defend themselves against and the detainees had no presumption of innocence the arb was created in an attempt to mitigate the harsh results of potentially indefinite detention by allowing an annual review to determine whether the enemy combatant should still be detained the combatant status reviews determined that 38 detainees were not illegal combatants after all they determined that the rest of the detainees had been correctly classified as enemy combatants during their original secret classifications the first set of administrative reviews took place between december 14 2004 and december 23 2005 the boards met to consider the cases of al 463 eligible detainees they recommended the release of 14 detainees

the bond angles are cos 109 4712206 109 5 when all four substituents are the same as in methane ch as well as its heavier analogues methane and other perfectly symmetrical tetrahedral molecules belong to point group t but most tetrahedral molecules have lower symmetry tetrahedral molecules can be chiral aside from virtually all saturated organic compounds most compounds of si ge and sn are tetrahedral often tetrahedral molecules feature multiple bonding to the outer ligands as in xenon tetroxide xeo the perchlorate ion the sulfate ion the phosphate ion thiazyl trifluoride snf is tetrahedral featuring a sulfur to nitrogen triple bond other molecules have a tetrahedral arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom for example ammonia nh with the nitrogen atom surrounded by three hydrogens and one lone pair however the usual classification considers only the bonded atoms and not the lone pair so that ammonia is actually considered as pyramidal the h n h angles are 107 contracted from 109 5 this difference is attributed to the influence of the lone pair which exerts a greater repulsive influence than a bonded atom again the geometry is widespread particularly so for complexes where the metal has d or

ep has been implicated in various physiological and pathological responses the ptger2 gene is located on human chromosome 14 at position p22 1 i e 14q22 1 contains 2 introns and 3 exons and codes for a g protein coupled receptor gpcr of the rhodopsin like receptor family subfamily a14 see rhodopsin like receptors subfamily a14 ep is widely distributed in humans its protein is expressed in human small intestine lung media of arteries and arterioles of the kidney thymus uterus brain cerebral cortex brain striatum brain hippocampus corneal epithelium corneal choriocapillaries myometriuml cells eosinophiles sclera of the eye articular cartilage the corpus cavernosum of the penis and airway smooth muscle cells its mrna is expressed in gingival fibroblasts monocyte derived dendritic cells aorta corpus cavernosum of the penis articular cartilage airway smooth muscle and airway epithelial cells in rats the receptor protein and or mrna has been found in lung spleen intestine skin kidney liver long bones and rather extensively throughout the brain and other parts of the central nervous system ep expression in fibroblasts from the lungs of mice with bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis and humans with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is greatly reduced in both instances this reduced

it is typically beneath the rain free base rfb portion of a thunderstorm and indicates the area of the strongest updraft within a storm rotating wall clouds are an indication of a mesocyclone in a thunderstorm most strong tornadoes form from these many wall clouds do rotate however some do not wall clouds are formed by a process known as entrainment when an inflow of warm moist air rises and converges overpowering wet rain cooled air from the normally downwind downdraft as the warm air continues to entrain the cooler air the air temperature drops and the dew point increases thus the dew point depression decreases as this air continues to rise it becomes more saturated with moisture which results in additional cloud condensation sometimes in the form of a wall cloud wall clouds may form as a descending of the cloud base or may form as rising scud comes together and connects to the storm s cloud base wall clouds can be anywhere from a fraction of wide to over across wall clouds form in the inflow region on the side of the storm coinciding with the direction of the steering winds deep layer winds through the height of

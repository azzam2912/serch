together these filters are known as the quadrature mirror filter pair a filter formula 2 will be the quadrature mirror filter of formula 3 if formula 4 the filter responses are symmetric about formula 5 in audio voice codecs a quadrature mirror filter pair is often used to implement a filter bank that splits an input signal into two bands the resulting high pass and low pass signals are often reduced by a factor of 2 giving a critically sampled two channel representation of the original signal the analysis filters are often related by the following formulae in addition to quadrate mirror property this is known as power complementary property in other words the power sum of the high pass and low pass filters is equal to 1 orthogonal wavelets the haar wavelets and related daubechies wavelets coiflets and some developed by mallat are generated by scaling functions which with the wavelet satisfy a quadrature mirror filter relationship the earliest wavelets were based on expanding a function in terms of rectangular steps the haar wavelets this is usually a poor approximation whereas daubechies wavelets are among the simplest but most important families of wavelets a linear filter that is zero

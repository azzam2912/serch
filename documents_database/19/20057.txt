isometric means preserving the length of every path for instance bending without stretching or tearing a page of paper gives an isometric embedding of the page into euclidean space because curves drawn on the page retain the same arclength however the page is bent the first theorem is for continuously differentiable c embeddings and the second for analytic embeddings or embeddings that are smooth of class c 3 k these two theorems are very different from each other the first one has a very simple proof and leads to some very counterintuitive conclusions while the proof of the second one is very technical but the result is not that surprising the c theorem was published in 1954 the c theorem in 1956 the real analytic theorem was first treated by nash in 1966 his argument was simplified considerably by a local version of this result was proved by lie cartan and maurice janet in the 1920s in the real analytic case the smoothing operators see below in the nash inverse function argument can be replaced by cauchy estimates nash s proof of the c case was later extrapolated into the h principle and nash moser implicit function theorem a simplified

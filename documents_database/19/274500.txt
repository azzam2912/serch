and independently demonstrated that two knot diagrams belonging to the same knot up to planar isotopy can be related by a sequence of the three reidemeister moves each move operates on a small region of the diagram and is one of three types no other part of the diagram is involved in the picture of a move and a planar isotopy may distort the picture the numbering for the types of moves corresponds to how many strands are involved e g a type ii move operates on two strands of the diagram one important context in which the reidemeister moves appear is in defining knot invariants by demonstrating a property of a knot diagram which is not changed when we apply any of the reidemeister moves an invariant is defined many important invariants can be defined in this way including the jones polynomial the type i move is the only move that affects the writhe of the diagram the type iii move is the only one which does not change the crossing number of the diagram in applications such as the kirby calculus in which the desired equivalence class of knot diagrams is not a knot but a framed link

often a motion tracker such as a magnetic tracking device or inertial tracking device is attached to capture the global position rotation data of the glove these movements are then interpreted by the software that accompanies the glove so any one movement can mean any number of things gestures can then be categorized into useful information such as to recognize sign language or other symbolic functions expensive high end wired gloves can also provide haptic feedback which is a simulation of the sense of touch this allows a wired glove to also be used as an output device traditionally wired gloves have only been available at a huge cost with the finger bend sensors and the tracking device having to be bought separately wired gloves are often used in virtual reality environments and to mimic human hand movement by robots the sayre glove created by electronic visualization laboratory in 1977 was the first wired glove in 1982 thomas g zimmerman filed a patent us patent 4542291 on an optical flex sensor mounted in a glove to measure finger bending zimmerman worked with jaron lanier to incorporate ultrasonic and magnetic hand position tracking technology to create the power glove and data

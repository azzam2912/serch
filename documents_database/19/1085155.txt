there were some promising clinical trials conducted in the 1960s that found a combination of magnesium and potassium aspartates had a positive effect on fatigue and they reduced muscle hyper excitability in its evaluation in 2005 the afc panel concluded that in humans the bioavailability of magnesium from magnesium l aspartate was similar to that from other organic magnesium salts and the more soluble inorganic magnesium salts overall it was concluded that organic salts of magnesium have the greatest water solubility and demonstrate a greater oral absorption and bioavailability compared to less soluble magnesium preparations such as magnesium oxide magnesium hydroxide magnesium carbonate and magnesium sulphate magnesium l aspartate 1230 mg magnesium 122 mg up to 3 times day dosage adjustment in renal impairment patients with severe renal failure should not receive magnesium due to toxicity from accumulation magnesium supplements and other magnesium containing products such as antacids can bind with prescription medicines reducing their effectiveness aspartate and glutamate are excitatory neurotransmitters at high doses consumed either independently or in excess of other protein containing foods can potentially stimulate neurons to the point of injury or death the most compelling evidence that glutamate and aspartate function as neurotransmitters came from

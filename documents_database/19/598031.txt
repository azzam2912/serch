rietveld 7 march 1932 16 july 2016 was a dutch crystallographer who is famous for his publication on the full profile refinement method in powder diffraction which became later known as the rietveld refinement method the method is used for the characterisation of crystalline materials from powder diffraction data the rietveld refinement uses a least squares approach to refine a theoretical line profile calculated from a known or postulated crystal structure until it matches the measured profile the introduction of this technique which used the full profile instead of individual reflections was a significant step forward in the diffraction analysis of powder samples after completing grammar school in the netherlands he moved to australia and studied physics at the university of western australia in perth in 1964 he obtained his phd degree with a thesis entitled the structure of p diphenylbenzene and other compounds a single crystal neutron and x ray diffraction study this investigation was the first single crystal neutron diffraction study in australia and was conducted at the nuclear reactor hifar in sydney in 1964 he became a research officer at the netherlands energy research foundation ecn in petten where he worked together with bert loopstra and bob

the region experienced substantial folding associated with its landlocked position during the alleghanian orogeny mountain building event the region accumulated sedimentary rocks including small deposits of coal the region was covered with thick atlantic coastal plain sediments with the erosion of the appalachians and the creation of the atlantic ocean throughout the past 200 million years these surficial sediments and soils were substantially reworked by the pleistocene glaciations the state s geology is part of the broader geology of new england rhode island is divided into two distinct physiographic regions the eastern highlands occupy the northwestern interior of the state near the state line with connecticut while the majority of the state s land area is grouped with the larger atlantic coastal plain that extends along the eastern seaboard of the us rhode island is the only state in new england formed entirely atop basement rock from the microcontinent avalonia the bedrock of rhode island first took shape with the emergence of a volcanic arc near a subduction on the margin of the supercontinent gondwana with the earliest rocks likely formed in the late neoproterozoic during the early cambrian period as multi cellular life rapidly increased on earth avalonian basement

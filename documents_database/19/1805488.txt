it does this by having users analyze data from the nasa kepler space telescope it was launched by a team led by debra fischer at yale university as part of the zooniverse project the planet hunters project exploits the fact that humans are better at recognising visual patterns than computers the website displays an image of data collected by the nasa kepler space mission and asks human users referred to as citizen scientists to look at the data and see how the brightness of a star changes over time this brightness data is represented as a graph and referred to as a star s light curve such curves are helpful in discovering extrasolar planets due to the brightness of a star decreasing when a planet passes in front of it as seen from earth periods of reduced brightness can thus provide evidence of planetary transits but may also be caused by errors in recording projection or other phenomena users are asked to sort the light curves based on the patterns the patterns available are quiet and variable when the light curve is quiet the graph mostly follows a straight path when the light curve is variable there are a number

it is dedicated to learn about the possible risks to human beings exposed to cosmic radiation although brookhaven lab researchers and their colleagues used beams of heavy ions for radiobiology research at another brookhaven accelerator from 1995 the nsrl became operational during summer 2003 and over 75 experimenters from some 20 institutions from the u s and abroad have taken part on radiobiology research jointly managed by the u s department of energy s office of science and nasa s johnson space center the facility employs beams of heavy ions extracted from brookhaven s booster accelerator that are then used to simulate the cosmic rays found in space nsrl also features its own beam line dedicated to radiobiology research as well as specimen preparation areas since astronauts are spending more time in outer space they are receiving more exposure to ionizing radiation a stream of particles that when passing through a body has enough energy to cause the atoms and molecules within that substance to become an ion by directly or indirectly ionizing and thus damaging the components of living cells including genetic material called dna ionizing radiation may cause changes in cells ability to carry out repair and reproduction

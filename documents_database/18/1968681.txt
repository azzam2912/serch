indices formula 4 go over states in the computational basis for qubits it is formula 5 for qudits d level systems it is formula 6 it is particularly useful for dealing with ground states of one dimensional quantum spin models e g heisenberg model quantum the parameter formula 3 is related to the entanglement between particles in particular if the state is a product state i e not entangled at all it can be described as a matrix product state with formula 8 for states that are translationally symmetric we can choose in general every state can be written in the mps form with formula 3 growing exponentially with the particle number n however mps are practical when formula 3 is small for example does not depend on the particle number except for a small number of specific cases some mentioned in the section examples such a thing is not possible though in many cases it serves as a good approximation the mps decomposition is not unique for introductions see and in the context of finite automata see for emphasis placed on the graphical reasoning of tensor networks see the introduction one method to obtain an mps representation of a

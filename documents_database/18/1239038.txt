because these structures are extremely complex methods within this field use a high throughput application of neural imaging and histological techniques in order to increase the speed efficiency and resolution of maps of the multitude of neural connections in a nervous system while the principal focus of such a project is the brain any neural connections could theoretically be mapped by connectomics including for example neuromuscular junctions this study is sometimes referred to by its previous name of hodology one of the main tools used for connectomics research at the macroscale level is diffusion mri the main tool for connectomics research at the microscale level is chemical brain preservation followed by 3d electron microscopy used for neural circuit reconstruction correlative microscopy which combines fluorescence with 3d electron microscopy results in more interpretable data as is it able to automatically detect specific neuron types and can trace them in their entirety using fluorescent markers to see one of the first micro connectomes at full resolution visit the open connectome project which is hosting several connectome datasets including the 12tb dataset from bock et al 2011 aside from the human brain some of the model systems used for connectomics research are the

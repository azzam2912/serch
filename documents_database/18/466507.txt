in that context and when looking at a decision of whether to adopt a new treatment technology there is always some degree of uncertainty surrounding the decision because there is always a chance that the decision turns out to be wrong the expected value of perfect information analysis tries to measure the expected cost of that uncertainty which can be interpreted as the expected value of perfect information evpi since perfect information can eliminate the possibility of making the wrong decision at least from a theoretical perspective the problem is modeled with a payoff matrix r in which the row index i describes a choice that must be made by the player while the column index j describes a random variable that the player does not yet have knowledge of that has probability p of being in state j if the player is to choose i without knowing the value of j the best choice is the one that maximizes the expected monetary value where is the expected payoff for action i i e the expectation value and is choosing the maximum of these expectations for all available actions on the other hand with perfect knowledge of j the player

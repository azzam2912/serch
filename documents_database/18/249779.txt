this is in contrast to dehydration by most conventional methods that evaporate water using heat freeze drying results in a high quality product because of the low temperature used in processing the original shape of the product is maintained and quality of the rehydrated product is excellent primary applications of freeze drying include biological e g bacteria and yeasts biomedical e g surgical transplants food processing e g coffee and preservation the first application of the freeze drying process were in the andes where indigenous people took low land tubers up to high elevations and left them to freeze potatoes were squashed to evacuate water and when left to freeze at night and exposed during the day the mash would lose its remaining water while nutrients were preserved through the lyophilization process this resulted in a food called chu o with a long shelf life eaten well past its seasonal availability that could be stored as emergency rations freeze drying as an industrial process began in as early as 1890 by richard altmann who devised a method to freeze dry tissues either plant or animal but went virtually unnoticed until the 1930s in 1909 shackell independently created the vacuum chamber

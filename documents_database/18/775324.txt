it provides a multi platform graphical user interface for instrument data acquisition online or offline data visualisation and analysis gumtree is designed to provide a highly integrated scientific experiment environment isee allowing interaction between different components within the workbench several instrument control server systems including tango epics and sics have been adapted to gumtree current developments include acquisition control and analysis on neutron and synchrotron beamlines in the future it will be extended telescope control and other scientific instruments with distributed hardware gumtree was first started as a small graphical user interface project to fulfill the it requirement for the neutron beam instrument project nbip at ansto later in the year the gumtree project has been approved to go open source for international collaboration gumtree is based on the eclipse rich client platform rcp in order to support scientific operations gumtree extends rcp with data handling framework and visualisation toolkit as part of the gumtree platform api adapting gumtree on a particular instrument requires special customisation to fit the scientific workbench to its instrument ecosystem customisation of gumtree can be achieved by adding new plug ins to the existing gumtree application in a broader sense the common base of gumtree

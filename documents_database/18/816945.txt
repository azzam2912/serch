japan had the earliest working hdtv system which was named hi vision a contraction of high definition television with design efforts going back to 1979 the country began broadcasting wideband analog hdtv signals in 1989 using 1035 active lines interlaced in the standard 2 1 ratio 1035i with 1125 lines total by the time of its commercial launch in 1991 digital hdtv was already under development in the united states hi vision continued broadcasting in analog until 2007 muse a compression system for hi vision signals was developed by nhk science technology research laboratories in the 1980s employed 2 dimensional filtering dot interlacing motion vector compensation and line sequential color encoding with time compression to fold an original 20 mhz source hi vision signal into a bandwidth of 8 1 mhz dpcm audio compression format dpcm quasi instantaneous companding muse is a 1125 line system 1035 visible and is not pulse and sync compatible with the digital 1080 line system used by modern hdtv originally it was a 1125 line interlaced 60 hz system with a 5 3 1 66 1 aspect ratio and an optimal viewing distance of roughly 3 3h for terrestrial muse transmission a bandwidth limited fm

filters and ultrafilters are special subsets of p if p happens to be a boolean algebra each ultrafilter is also a prime filter and vice versa if x is an arbitrary set its power set x ordered by set inclusion is always a boolean algebra and ultra filters on x are usually called ultra filters on x ultrafilters have many applications in set theory model theory and topology an ultrafilter on a set x may be considered as a finitely additive measure in this view every subset of x is either considered almost everything has measure 1 or almost nothing has measure 0 in order theory an ultrafilter is a subset of a partially ordered set that is maximal among all proper filters this implies that any filter that properly contains an ultrafilter has to be equal to the whole poset formally if p is a set partially ordered by then an important special case of the concept occurs if the considered poset is a boolean algebra in this case ultrafilters are characterized by containing for each element a of the boolean algebra exactly one of the elements a and a the latter being the boolean complement of a if

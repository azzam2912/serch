two were built but development ended in 1945 the cornelius xfg 1 developed under the project designation mx 416 was an aerodynamically unusual aircraft intended for an unusual military role george cornelius had been experimenting with aircraft featuring differentially variable incidence since the 1920s his first two machines were otherwise conventional but the third the cornelius mallard from 1943 was not being without a horizontal tailplane and having low aspect ratio and strongly forward swept wings though very different in detail the xfg 1 built on the mallard experience a 1 4 scale model of the xfg 1 was built for wind tunnel tests the fg in its designation stood for fuel glider and its role was as a fuel transport it was to be towed behind another aircraft rather like contemporary troop carrying gliders but its two fuselage tanks held of avgas unlike other troop carrying gliders e g waco cg 4 the xfg 1 could be towed by modern bombers or transports at a cruise speed of proposals seem to have included a piloted tow version behind a large transport the glider landing loaded on skids having jettisoned its wheels after take off or a pilot less version

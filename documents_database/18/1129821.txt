the constitutive proteins include cenpa centromere protein a cenpb cenpc1 and cenpd the term passenger proteins encompasses a broad collection of proteins that localize to the centromere during specific stages of the cell cycle these include cenpe mcak kid cytoplasmic dynein e g dync1h1 clips e g clip1 and cenpf mitosin cenpf the inner centromere proteins incenps the initial members of the passenger protein group display a broad localization along chromosomes in the early stages of mitosis but gradually become concentrated at centromeres as the cell cycle progresses into mid metaphase during telophase the proteins are located within the midbody in the intercellular bridge where they are discarded after cytokinesis incenp is a regulatory protein in the chromosome passenger complex it is involved in regulation of the catalytic protein aurora b it performs this function in association with two other proteins survivin and borealin these proteins form a tight three helical bundle the n terminal domain of incenp is the domain involved in formation of this three helical bundle incenp has been shown to interact with h2afz survivin and cdca8 the ark binding region has been found to be necessary and sufficient for binding to aurora related kinase this interaction

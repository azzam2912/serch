it can be constructed by beginning with a single vertex graph vertex 1 and then adding black vertices as isolated vertices and red vertices as dominating vertices in the order in which they are numbered threshold graphs were first introduced by a chapter on threshold graphs appears in and the book is devoted to them an equivalent definition is the following a graph is a threshold graph if there are a real number formula 1 and for each vertex formula 2 a real vertex weight formula 3 such that for any two vertices formula 4 formula 5 is an edge if and only if formula 6 another equivalent definition is this a graph is a threshold graph if there are a real number formula 7 and for each vertex formula 2 a real vertex weight formula 9 such that for any vertex set formula 10 formula 11 is independent if and only if formula 12 the name threshold graph comes from these definitions s is the threshold for the property of being an edge or equivalently t is the threshold for being independent from the definition which uses repeated addition of vertices one can derive an alternative way of uniquely

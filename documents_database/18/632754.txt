it was developed to serve as a prototype spaceplane to validate the esa s work in the field of reusable launchers the european space agency has a program called future launchers preparatory programme flpp which made a call for submissions for a reusable spaceplane one of the submissions was by the italian space agency that presented their own programme for reusable in orbit demonstrator in europe pride program which went ahead to develop the prototype named intermediate experimental vehicle ixv and the consequential space rider that inherits technology from its prototype ixv on 11 february 2015 the ixv conducted its first 100 minute space flight successfully completing its mission upon landing intact on the surface of the pacific ocean the vehicle holds the distinction of being the first ever lifting body to perform full atmospheric reentry from orbital speed past missions have flight tested either winged bodies which are highly controllable but also very complex and costly or capsules which are difficult to control but offer less complexity and lower cost during the 1980s and 1990s there was significant international interest in the development of reusable launch platforms and reusable spacecraft particularly in respect to spaceplanes perhaps the most high

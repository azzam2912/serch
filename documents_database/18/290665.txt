in digital systems a signal is said to be at digital full scale when its magnitude has reached the maximum representable value once a signal has reached digital full scale all headroom has been utilized and any further increase in amplitude will result in an error known as clipping however this can be avoided if a daw switches from integer to floating point arithmetic this usually entails some loss of precision although the final precision should still be significantly better than that which is needed for the final music processing the signal passes through an anti aliasing resampling or reconstruction filter which may increase peak amplitude slightly due to the gibbs phenomenon the gibbs phenomenon is a mathematical concept and only applies to one point so in practice it is irrelevant to real life circuits and devices it is possible for the analog signal represented by the digital data to exceed digital full scale even if the digital data does not and vice versa in the analog domain there is no peak clipping problem unless the d a analog circuitry was badly designed in the digital domain there are no peaks created by these conversions in analog systems full scale

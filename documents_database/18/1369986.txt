it acts as a non selective serotonin receptor agonist and has been used extensively in scientific research to study the function of the serotonin system unlike serotonin ms is not metabolized by monoamine oxidase on account of the methyl substituent blocking the enzyme s access to the amine as a result it has a much longer half life in comparison similarly to serotonin however ms poorly crosses the blood brain barrier due to its free hydroxyl group and thus has only weak or no central effects when administered peripherally methyltryptophan mtp is a prodrug to ms which does cross the blood brain barrier and thus efficiently delivers ms into the central nervous system as a result mtp acts as an orally bioavailable false or substitute neurotransmitter for serotonin and has been suggested as a possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of disorders where serotonin is deficient the o methylated analogue of ms 5 meo mt also readily enters the brain and could be used for this purpose as well 5 hydroxy alpha methyltryptamine is not scheduled at the federal level in the united states but it could be considered an analog of alpha methyltryptamine amt in which case purchase sales

these were problematic in service they were bulky difficult to dismantle wasted power through friction and they had a tendency to overheat the thrust box was built of a box like cast iron housing with a radial bearing at each end and a number of collars formed on the shaft between them this shaft was often a short section of removable shaft called the thrust shaft linking the engine ahead to the propeller shaft astern a series of iron horseshoe shaped collars fitted over the small diameter of the shaft and bore against the forward face of the shaft s collars each horseshoe was faced with a low friction pad of babbitt metal lubrication was by an oil bath in the box and a plentiful volume was important for cooling purposes too although lignum vitae wood was used for the radial stave bearings in the stuffing box cooled directly by seawater itself this material wasn t capable of withstanding the force needed for the thrust blocks of any but the earliest screw vessels each horseshoe was independently adjustable forwards and back by either wedged gibs or a screwed adjustment a particular problem with these thrust boxes was in adjusting them

by definition every finite group is finitely generated since s can be taken to be g itself every infinite finitely generated group must be countable but countable groups need not be finitely generated the additive group of rational numbers q is an example of a countable group that is not finitely generated every abelian group can be seen as a module over the ring of integers z and in a finitely generated abelian group with generators x x every group element x can be written as a linear combination of these generators with integers subgroups of a finitely generated abelian group are themselves finitely generated the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups states that a finitely generated abelian group is the direct sum of a free abelian group of finite rank and a finite abelian group each of which are unique up to isomorphism a subgroup of a finitely generated group need not be finitely generated the commutator subgroup of the free group formula 1 on two generators is an example of a subgroup of a finitely generated group that is not finitely generated on the other hand all subgroups of a finitely generated abelian group are finitely generated

it is not known if it is a natural group it was erected to distinguish the ungulates of south america from other ungulates relationships between the orders inside meridiungulata remain unresolved and it could well be a wastebasket taxon most meridiungulata died out following the invasion of south america by north american ungulates and predators during the great american interchange but a few of the largest species of notoungulates and litopterns survived until the end pleistocene extinctions meridiungulata might have originated in south america from a north american condylarth ancestor and they may be members of the clade laurasiatheria related to other ungulates including artiodactyls and perissodactyls it has however been suggested the meridiungulata are part of a different macro group of placental mammals called atlantogenata much of the evolution of meridiungulates occurred in isolation from other ungulates a great example of convergent evolution however the argument that meridiungulates are related to artiodactyls and perissodactyls needs support from molecular sequencing some paleontologists have also challenged the monophyly of meridiungulata by suggesting that the pyrotheres are more closely related to other mammals such as embrithopoda an african order possibly related to elephants than to other south american ungulates results from the

social rationality is a form of bounded rationality applied to social contexts where individuals make choices and predictions under uncertainty while game theory deals with well defined situations social rationality explicitly deals with situations in which not all alternatives consequences and event probabilities can be foreseen the idea is that similar to non social environments individuals rely and should rely on fast and frugal heuristics in order to deal with complex and genuinely uncertain social environments this emphasis on simple rules in an uncertain world contrasts with the view that the complexity of social situations requires highly sophisticated mental strategies as has been assumed in primate research and neuroscience among others social rationality is both a descriptive program and a normative program the descriptive program studies the repertoire of heuristics an individual or organization uses that is their adaptive toolbox the normative program studies the environmental conditions to which a heuristic is adapted that is where it performs better than other decision strategies this approach is called the study of the ecological rationality of social heuristics it assumes that social heuristics are domain and problem specific heuristics can be applied to social and non social decision tasks also called social

the rhppc is equivalent to the commercial powerpc 603e processor with the minor exceptions of the phase locked loop pll and the processor version register pvr the rhppc processor is compatible with the powerpc architecture book i iii the powerpc 603e programmers interface and is also supported by common powerpc software tools and embedded operating systems like vxworks the rhppc processor generates 190 mips with the dhrystone mix with its core clock at 100 mhz i e the rhppc processor completes 1 9 instructions per cycle the rhppc runs with a 25 33 3 40 or 50 mhz 60x bus clock sysclk which is generated based on the pci clock the 60x bus clock is de skewed on chip by a pll and can also be multiplied the rhppc processor is a superscalar machine with five execution units system register unit integer unit load store unit floating point unit and branch processing unit the dispatch unit can issue two instructions per cycle the floating point unit has a three level deep pipeline out of order execution is supported through the use of shadow or rename registers the completion unit can complete two instructions per cycle in order by copying results

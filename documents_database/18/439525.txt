the pipeline allows certain cpu intensive operations such as idct motion compensation and deinterlacing to be offloaded to the gpu dxva 2 0 allows more operations including video capturing and processing operations to be hardware accelerated as well dxva works in conjunction with the video rendering model used by the video card dxva 1 0 which was introduced as a standardized api with windows 2000 and is currently available on windows 98 or later can use either the overlay rendering mode or vmr 7 9 dxva 2 0 available only on windows vista windows 7 windows 8 and later oss integrates with media foundation mf and uses the enhanced video renderer evr present in mf the dxva is used by software video decoders to define a codec specific pipeline for hardware accelerated decoding and rendering of the codec the pipeline starts at the cpu which is used for parsing the media stream and conversion to dxva compatible structures dxva specifies a set of operations that can be hardware accelerated and device driver interfaces ddis that the graphic driver can implement to accelerate the operations if the codec needs to do any of the defined operations it can use these interfaces

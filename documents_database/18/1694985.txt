a grid connected pv system consists of solar panels one or several inverters a power conditioning unit and grid connection equipment they range from small residential and commercial rooftop systems to large utility scale solar power stations unlike stand alone power systems a grid connected system rarely includes an integrated battery solution as they are still very expensive when conditions are right the grid connected pv system supplies the excess power beyond consumption by the connected load to the utility grid residential grid connected rooftop systems which have a capacity more than 10 kilowatts can meet the load of most consumers they can feed excess power to the grid where it is consumed by other users the feedback is done through a meter to monitor power transferred photovoltaic wattage may be less than average consumption in which case the consumer will continue to purchase grid energy but a lesser amount than previously if photovoltaic wattage substantially exceeds average consumption the energy produced by the panels will be much in excess of the demand in this case the excess power can yield revenue by selling it to the grid depending on their agreement with their local grid energy company the consumer

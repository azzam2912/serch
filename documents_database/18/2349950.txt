this strength is usually considerably lower than the final ultimate strength of a material the term green strength is usually referenced when discussing non metallic materials such as adhesives and elastomers such as rubber recently it has also been referenced in metallurgy applications such as powdered metallurgy a joint made through the use of an adhesive can be referred to as an adhesive joint or bond the green strength of adhesives is the early development of bond strength of an adhesive it indicated that the adhesive bond is strong enough to be handled a short time after the adherents are mated but much before full cure is obtained usually this strength is significantly lower than the final curing strength most adhesives typically have an initial green strength and a final ultimate tensile strength listed for their application for household adhesives this data is usually reflected on the packaging the best example of this is seen in typical epoxies from a local hardware stores during curing the epoxy will travel into an initial curing phase also called green phase when it begins to gel at that point the epoxy is no longer workable and will move from being tacky to a

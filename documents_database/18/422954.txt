a series x is called hypergeometric if the ratio of successive terms x x is a rational function of n if the ratio of successive terms is a rational function of q then the series is called a basic hypergeometric series the number q is called the base the basic hypergeometric series q q q q x was first considered by it becomes the hypergeometric series f x in the limit when the base q is 1 there are two forms of basic hypergeometric series the unilateral basic hypergeometric series and the more general bilateral basic hypergeometric series the unilateral basic hypergeometric series is defined as where and is the q shifted factorial the most important special case is when j k 1 when it becomes this series is called balanced if a a b b q this series is called well poised if a q a b a b and very well poised if in addition a a qa the unilateral basic hypergeometric series is a q analog of the hypergeometric series since holds the bilateral basic hypergeometric series corresponding to the bilateral hypergeometric series is defined as the most important special case is when j k when it

nominally a sequel to 1995 s it is considered both by critics and by the game director more akin to a stand alone expansion pack mechanically similar to no remorse it features new levels enemies and weapons set immediately after the events of no remorse no regret chronicles the further adventures of the silencer a supersoldier turned resistance fighter in a dystopian 22nd century the gameplay is similar to the player controls the silencer as he fights his way through the levels teleportation pads are used for quick travel within and between levels no regret added several new weapons and death animations including freezing and subsequent shattering and two different kinds of melting in no remorse the silencer could carry no more than five firearms at once in no regret this restriction was lifted entirely nonplayer characters no longer carry money since there are no friendly merchants to deal with on the moon gameplay is more combat oriented than that of no remorse in that game many obstacles could either be circumvented defeated with items such as passkeys or blown up with brute force this latter tactic is usually the only available course of action in no regret no regret

a distinctive feature of this particular rearrangement however is its reversibility as a result the more stable hydroxy carbonyl compound is favored a general scheme for the rearrangement is shown below this rearrangement differs from similar isomerizations of carbohydrates which involve the migration of hydrogen and proceed through discrete enediol intermediates these include the lobry de bruyn van ekenstein transformation the heyns and amadori rearrangements and the voight and bilik reactions hydroxy imines may also undergo the rearrangement although the thermodynamic driving force to amino ketones is often weak in the absence of protic acids see below advantages large thermodynamic energy differences between reactants and products can be harnessed to drive these reactions to completion reaction progress can also be influenced through conformational control and often exhibit asymmetric induction disadvantages because the reaction is reversible and thermodynamically controlled it cannot be used to synthesize unstable hydroxy carbonyl products ideal conditions are often difficult to pinpoint and can require extensive catalyst screening under basic conditions the reaction is initiated by deprotonation of the hydroxyl group substrates must lack hydrogens to prevent competitive reactions involving enolates under br nsted or lewis acidic conditions coordination to the carbonyl oxygen occurs first and under

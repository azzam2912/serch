it is driven into a hole bored through two or more pieces of structural wood mortise and tenon the use of wood as a tenon can be traced back over 7 000 years as archaeologist have found traces of wood nails in the excavation of early germanic sites trenails are notoriously economical and readily available making them a common early building material black locust is a favorite wood when making trunnels in shipbuilding in north america and english oak in europe due to their strength and rot resistance while red oak is typical in buildings traditionally treenails and pegs were made by splitting bolts of wood with a froe and shaping them with a drawknife on a shaving horse treenails are cut from a single piece of wood and perform well because of the natural grain the grain of the treenail runs perpendicular to the grain of the receiving mortises which adds structural strength treenails are typically 1 25 1 5 32 38 mm in diameter and are hand whittled with rough facets the mortise is drilled 1 16 2 mm smaller than the treenail to create a tight fit and take advantage of friction in the mortise in cases

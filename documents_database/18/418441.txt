the disease is caused by trypanosoma equiperdum which belongs to an important genus of parasitic protozoa and is the only member of the genus that is spread through sexual intercourse the occurrence of dourine is notifiable in the european union under legislation from the oie there currently is no vaccine and although clinical signs can be treated there is no cure trypanosoma equiperdum is one of three known strains from the trypanosoma family along with trypanosoma evansi and trypanosoma brucei trypanosoma equiperdum has been discovered to be most closely linked to trypanosoma evansi so much so that even observation under microscope is not sufficient to differentiate between the two as their structure is very similar dourine is a unique disease in the sense that it has no known vectors or fomites existing in the natural world other than members of the equine family including donkeys mules and horses in a laboratory setting trypanosoma equiperdum has been manipulated to adapt to and proliferate in other species such as dogs rabbits mice and rats but this has never been observed to occur naturally and without scientific manipulation although this limits spread of the disease because it is restricted to the equine population

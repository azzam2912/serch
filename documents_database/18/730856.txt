it affects lymphocyte apoptosis it is a rare genetic disorder of abnormal lymphocyte survival caused by defective fas mediated apoptosis normally after infectious insult the immune system down regulates by increasing fas expression on activated b and t lymphocytes and fas ligand on activated t lymphocytes fas and fas ligand interact to trigger the caspase cascade leading to cell apoptosis patients with alps have a defect in this apoptotic pathway leading to chronic non malignant lymphoproliferation autoimmune disease and secondary cancers all people with alps have signs of lymphoproliferation which makes it the most common clinical manifestation of the disease the increased proliferation of lymphoid cells can cause the size of lymphoid organs such as the lymph nodes and spleen to increase lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly present in respectively over 90 and over 80 of patients the liver is enlarged hepatomegaly in 30 40 of patients autoimmune disease is the second most common clinical manifestation and one that most often requires treatment autoimmune cytopenias most common can be mild to very severe can be intermittent or chronic these include autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune neutropenia autoimmune thrombocytopenia other signs can affect organ systems similar to systemic lupus erythematosus least common affecting ataxia

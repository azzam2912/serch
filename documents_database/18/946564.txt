in that case all rupture fields of formula 1 over formula 2 are isomorphic non canonically to formula 15 if formula 16 where formula 5 is a root of formula 1 then the ring homomorphism formula 19 defined by formula 20 for all formula 21 and formula 22 is an isomorphism also in this case the degree of the extension equals the degree of formula 23 a rupture field of a polynomial does not necessarily contain all the roots of that polynomial in the above example the field formula 9 does not contain the other two complex roots of formula 1 namely formula 26 and formula 27 where formula 28 is a primitive third root of unity for a field containing all the roots of a polynomial see the splitting field a rupture field of formula 29 over formula 30 is formula 31 it is also a splitting field the rupture field of formula 29 over formula 33 is formula 34 since there is no element of formula 33 with square equal to formula 36 and all quadratic extensions of formula 33 are isomorphic to formula 34

brown gave the species the name bacterium xylinum it has since been known by several other names mainly acetobacter xylinum and gluconacetobacter xylinus it was given its current name with the establishment of the new genus komagataeibacter in 2012 it is the type species of the genus k xylinus is a member of the acetic acid bacteria a group of gram negative aerobic bacteria that produce acetic acid during fermentation k xylinus is unusual among the group in also producing cellulose bacterial or microbial cellulose also sometimes known as nanocellulose is involved in the formation of biofilms it is chemically identical to plant cellulose but has distinct physical structure and properties the genome of a cellulose deficient strain of k xylinus was sequenced in 2011 and followed by the genomes of cellulose producing strains in 2014 and 2018 the first cellulose producing strain had a genome consisting of one chromosome 3 4 megabase pairs and five plasmids of which one is a megaplasmid of about 330 kilobase pairs key genes related to cellulose production occur in the four gene operon bcsabcd which codes for the four subunits of the cellulose synthase enzyme all four genes are required for efficient cellulose

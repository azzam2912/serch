breathing or external respiration brings air into the lungs where gas exchange takes place in the alveoli through diffusion the body s circulatory system transports these gases to and from the cells where cellular respiration takes place the breathing of all vertebrates with lungs consists of repetitive cycles of inhalation and exhalation through a highly branched system of tubes or airways which lead from the nose to the alveoli the number of respiratory cycles per minute is the breathing or respiratory rate and is one of the four primary vital signs of life under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically and unconsciously controlled by several homeostatic mechanisms which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood constant keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances contributes significantly to tight control of the ph of the extracellular fluids ecf over breathing hyperventilation and under breathing hypoventilation which decrease and increase the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide respectively cause a rise in the ph of ecf in the first case and a lowering of the ph in the second both cause distressing

pappus s hexagon theorem states that every two triples of collinear points abc and abc none of which lie on the intersection of the two lines can be completed to form a pappus configuration by adding the six lines ab ab ac ac bc and bc and their three intersection points and these three points are the intersection points of the opposite sides of the hexagon abcabc according to pappus theorem the resulting system of nine points and eight lines always has a ninth line containing the three intersection points x y and z called the pappus line the pappus configuration can also be derived from two triangles xcc and ybb that are in perspective with each other the three lines through corresponding pairs of points meet at a single crossing point in three different ways together with their three centers of perspectivity z a and a the points of the configuration are the points of the triangles and centers of perspectivity and the lines of the configuration are the lines through corresponding pairs of points the levi graph of the pappus configuration is known as the pappus graph it is a bipartite symmetric cubic graph with 18 vertices and

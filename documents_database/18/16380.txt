electric field is sometimes abbreviated as e field the electric field is defined mathematically as a vector field that associates to each point in space the electrostatic or coulomb force per unit of charge exerted on an infinitesimal positive test charge at rest at that point the si unit for electric field strength is volt per meter v m newtons per coulomb n c is also used as a unit of electric field strength electric fields are created by electric charges or by time varying magnetic fields electric fields are important in many areas of physics and are exploited practically in electrical technology on an atomic scale the electric field is responsible for the attractive force between the atomic nucleus and electrons that holds atoms together and the forces between atoms that cause chemical bonding electric fields and magnetic fields are both manifestations of the electromagnetic force one of the four fundamental forces or interactions of nature from coulomb s law a particle with electric charge formula 1 at position formula 2 exerts a force on a particle with charge formula 3 at position formula 4 of when the charges formula 3 and formula 1 have the same sign this

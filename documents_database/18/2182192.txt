the cccs design differs from the consecutive case series because the latter reports on multiple cases where experimental control was not demonstrated usually because a pre post non experimental design was used in contrast a cccs includes only cases where the intervention was evaluated using single case experimental designs such as a reversal design where experimental control is demonstrated through the replication of treatment effects for each individual participant thus the cccs design has better internal validity than a consecutive case series the cccs design also address some concerns about the external validity or generality of findings of small n single case experimental design studies because it explicitly includes all cases encountered regardless of outcome by including all cases any bias favoring a particular outcome in controlled for resulting in stronger external validity relative to studies describing fewer cases that were not consecutively encountered moreover when a large number of individuals are included in the series this provides opportunities to identify variables that may predict treatment outcomes consecutive controlled case series studies examining behavior analytic interventions of late have examined functional communication training schedule thinning during functional communication training and functional analysis and treatment using caregivers as with any experimental

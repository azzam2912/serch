its core products initially included keyboards mice and other input devices keytronic currently specializes in pcba and full product assembly after the introduction of the ibm pc key tronic began manufacturing keyboards compatible with those computer system units most of their keyboards are based on the 8048 microcontroller to communicate to the computer their early keyboards used an intel 8048 mcu however as the company evolved they began to use their own 8048 based mcus in 1978 key tronic corporation introduced keyboards with capacitive based switches one of the first keyboard technologies to not use self contained switches there was simply a sponge pad with a conductive coated mylar plastic sheet on the switch plunger and two half moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below as the key was depressed the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the pcb below changed which was detected by integrated circuits ic these keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other solid state switch keyboards such as inductive and hall effect but competitive with direct contact keyboards the company which has been described as a contract manufacturer was founded in 1969 went public in 1983 and

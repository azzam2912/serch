initially posited in 1969 by martin goldstein its existence was proved experimentally by gyan p johari and martin goldstein in 1970 by experiments on glasses made from rigid molecules the relaxation a peak in mechanical or dielectric loss at a particular frequency had previously been attributed to a type of molecular flexibility the fact that such a loss peak shows up in glasses of rigid molecules lacking this flexibility demonstrated its universal character the jg relaxation is regarded as the precursor of the relaxation i e its occurrence facilitates viscous flow and it must occur before the latter can occur accordingly the narrow peak observed at ghz frequencies in the spectra of polar liquids at high temperatures is associated with processes similar to the jg relaxation that is observed at lower temperatures as the liquid is cooled the peak at ghz frequency broadens and shifts to lower frequencies a new peak in emerges from the low frequency side of this peak once some value of higher density and viscosity are reached the relaxation time at which it emerges is typically 0 1 to 1 s as the liquid is further cooled this peak broadens and grows in strength at the

it frequently occurs in the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the riemann zeta function the various studies of the behaviour of the divisor function are sometimes called divisor problems the divisor summatory function is defined as where is the divisor function the divisor function counts the number of ways that the integer n can be written as a product of two integers more generally one defines where d n counts the number of ways that n can be written as a product of k numbers this quantity can be visualized as the count of the number of lattice points fenced off by a hyperbolic surface in k dimensions thus for k 2 d x d x counts the number of points on a square lattice bounded on the left by the vertical axis on the bottom by the horizontal axis and to the upper right by the hyperbola jk x roughly this shape may be envisioned as a hyperbolic simplex this allows us to provide an alternative expression for d x and a simple way to compute it in formula 4 time if the hyperbola in this context is replaced by a circle then determining the value of the

the west side of the mountain is composed of a 250 m bed of meta sedimentary rock distinguishable as phyllite and argillite from a distance the meta sedimentary rock is easily mistaken for basalt which is common in the area however basalt is not found on black mountain the phyllite has a slaty cleavage and is foliated in all directions a result of shortening due to pressure solution volume diffusion of as much as 50 as a result of shortening streambeds of nearby washes are filled with black alluvium the western face meta sedimentary beds strike 120 45 when fully illuminated by afternoon sun the dipping angular rocks resemble overlapping flatirons the meta sedimentary beds rise nearly 1300 feet above the local topography black mountain rises 3398 feet above sea level the eastern side of the mountain is composed of a granitic intrusion into the meta sedimentary rock the granite is part of a batholith dated 14 m y a locally known as camelback granite it extends southward from black mountain and is expressed in outcrops in the mcdowell mountains the union hills and camelback mountain texturally the granite varies from a large crystal with phenocrysts of up to 2

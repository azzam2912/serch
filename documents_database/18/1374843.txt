by 1913 of hydrogen was manufactured annually by this process in the early part of the 20th century the process found some use as a means of producing hydrogen lifting gas for airships as it could produce large volumes of gas cheaply lane producers were installed at some british airship stations so the gas could be manufactured on site to work efficiently however the plant required skilled operators and to be running as a quasi continuous process a competing process referred to as the silicol process reacted ferrosilicon with a strong sodium hydroxide solution and had the advantage of flexibility in the 1940s the lane process was superseded by cheaper methods of hydrogen production that used oil or natural gas as a feedstock where hydrogen was commonly produced with the single retort like the messerschmitt and the bamag type lane introduced the multiple retort type in the lane generator water gas was used to heat the retorts up to 600 800 c after which water gas air was used in the retorts in the steam iron process the iron oxidizes and has to be replaced with fresh metal in the lane hydrogen producer the iron is reduced with water gas

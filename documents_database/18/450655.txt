because learning algorithms are evaluated on finite samples the evaluation of a learning algorithm may be sensitive to sampling error as a result measurements of prediction error on the current data may not provide much information about predictive ability on new data generalization error can be minimized by avoiding overfitting in the learning algorithm the performance of a machine learning algorithm is measured by plots of the generalization error values through the learning process which are called learning curves in a learning problem the goal is to develop a function formula 1 that predicts output values formula 2 based on some input data formula 3 the expected error formula 4 of a particular function formula 5 over all possible values of formula 3 and formula 2 is where formula 9 denotes a loss function and formula 10 is the unknown joint probability distribution for formula 3 and formula 2 without knowing the joint probability distribution it is impossible to compute formula 13 instead we can compute the empirical error on sample data given formula 14 data points the empirical error is the generalization error is the difference between the expected and empirical error this is the difference between error on

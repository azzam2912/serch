calcium binding protein 1 is a calcium binding protein discovered in 1999 it has two ef hand motifs and is expressed in neuronal cells in such areas as hippocampus habenular nucleus of the epithalamus purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum and the amacrine cells and cone bipolar cells of the retina calcium binding protein 1 which is a neuron specific member of the calmodulin cam superfamily which modulates ca dependent activity of inositol trisphosphate receptors insp3rs l cabp1 is also associated with the cytoskeleton structures but the s cabp1 is situated in or near the plasma membrane in brain cabp1 is found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and in the protein cabp1 is found in cone bipolar and amacrine cells we can also express that cabp1 may regulate ca dependent activity of insp3rs by promoting structural contacts between suppressor and core domains but has no effect on insp3 binding to the receptor cabp1 contains four ef hands in two separate domains namely ef1 and ef2 is contained in n domain whereas ef3 and ef4 is contained in c domain to which ca binds calcium binding protein 1 cabp1 is placed in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum it is

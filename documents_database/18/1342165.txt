applications of matrix multiplication in computational problems are found in many fields including scientific computing and pattern recognition and in seemingly unrelated problems such as counting the paths through a graph many different algorithms have been designed for multiplying matrices on different types of hardware including parallel and distributed systems where the computational work is spread over multiple processors perhaps over a network directly applying the mathematical definition of matrix multiplication gives an algorithm that takes time on the order of to multiply two matrices in big o notation better asymptotic bounds on the time required to multiply matrices have been known since the work of strassen in the 1960s but it is still unknown what the optimal time is i e what the complexity of the problem is the definition of matrix multiplication is that if for an matrix and an matrix then is an matrix with entries from this a simple algorithm can be constructed which loops over the indices from 1 through and from 1 through computing the above using a nested loop this algorithm takes time in asymptotic notation a common simplification for the purpose of algorithms analysis is to assume that the inputs are all

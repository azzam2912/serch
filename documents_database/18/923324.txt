practitioners in this field come from a variety of backgrounds including physiology evolutionary biology ecology and genetics accordingly the range of phenotypes studied by evolutionary physiologists is broad including life history behavior whole organism performance functional morphology biomechanics anatomy classical physiology endocrinology biochemistry and molecular evolution it is closely related to comparative physiology and environmental physiology and its findings are a major concern of evolutionary medicine one definition that has been offered is the study of the physiological basis of fitness namely correlated evolution including constraints and trade offs of physiological form and function associated with the environment diet homeostasis energy management longevity and mortality and life history characteristics as the name implies evolutionary physiology is the product of what was at one time two distinct scientific disciplines according to garland and carter evolutionary physiology arose in the late 1970s following debates concerning the metabolic and thermoregulatory status of dinosaurs see physiology of dinosaurs and mammal like reptiles this period was followed by attempts in the early 1980s to integrate quantitative genetics into evolutionary biology which had spill over effects on other fields such as behavioral ecology and ecophysiology in the mid to late 1980s phylogenetic comparative methods started to

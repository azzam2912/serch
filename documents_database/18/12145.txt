space propulsion or in space propulsion exclusively deals with propulsion systems used in the vacuum of space and should not be confused with launch vehicles several methods both pragmatic and hypothetical have been developed each having its own drawbacks and advantages most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters often monopropellant rockets or resistojet rockets for orbital station keeping and some use momentum wheels for attitude control soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades and newer western geo orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north south station keeping and orbit raising interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well although a few have used ion thrusters and hall effect thrusters two different types of electric propulsion to great success artificial satellites are first launched into the desired altitude by conventional liquid solid propelled rockets after which the satellite may use onboard propulsion systems for orbital stationkeeping once in the desired orbit they often need some form of attitude control so that they are correctly pointed with respect to the earth the sun and possibly some astronomical object of interest they are also subject to drag from the thin atmosphere so that to stay in orbit for a

this resource was one of eight brcs bioinformatics resource centers funded by niaid with the goal of promoting research against emerging and re emerging pathogens particularly those seen as potential bioterrorism threats the vbrc is now supported by dr chris upton at the university of victoria the curated vbrc database contains all publicly available genomic sequences for poxviruses and african swine fever viruses asfv a unique aspect of this resource relative to other genomic databases is its grouping of all annotated genes into ortholog groups i e protein families based on pre run blastp sequence similarity searches the curated database is accessed through vocs viral orthologous clusters a downloadable java based user interface and acts as the central information source for other programs of the vbrc workbench these programs serve a variety of bioinformatic analysis functions whole or subgenome alignments genome display and several types of gene protein sequence analysis the majority of these tools are programmed to take user supplied input as well the vbrc covers the following viruses the vbrc database stores viral bioinformatic data on three levels vbrc provides researchers with a wide variety of database linked tools of these the central four programs are vocs vgo

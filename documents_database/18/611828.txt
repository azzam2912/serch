the first dirigent protein was discovered in forsythia intermedia this protein has been found to direct the stereoselective biosynthesis of pinoresinol from coniferyl alcohol monomers lignan biosynthesis is catalysed by oxidative enzymes in the test tube the reaction results in a heteregenous mixture of dimeric compounds when dirigent protein is present during the reaction one stereoisomer of one compound is highly enriched dirigent proteins appear to possess no oxidative radical forming activity of their own in the absence of oxidative enzyme no reaction will occur recently a second enantiocomplementary dirigent protein was identified in arabidopsis thaliana which directs enantioselective synthesis of pinoresinol in lignan biosynthesis oxidative enzymes perform proton coupled electron transfer to remove a hydrogen atom from monolignols forming a radical intermediate these intermediates then couple in a radical termination reaction to form one of a variety of dimers known as lignans in vitro reactions of coniferyl alcohol a common monolignol in the presence of oxidative enzymes produce a wide variety of different dimers at varying concentrations when dirigent protein from forsythia intermedia is present production of pinoresinol is greatly enriched and other products are far less abundant because this enrichment is so pronounced the enzyme is hypothesized to

dissertation in 1984 is an agreement algorithm used to select sources for estimating accurate time from a number of noisy time sources a refined version of it renamed the intersection algorithm forms part of the modern network time protocol marzullo s algorithm is also used to compute the relaxed intersection of n boxes or more generally n subsets of r as required by several robust set estimation methods marzullo s algorithm is efficient in terms of time for producing an optimal value from a set of estimates with confidence intervals where the actual value may be outside the confidence interval for some sources in this case the best estimate is taken to be the smallest interval consistent with the largest number of sources if we have the estimates 10 2 12 1 and 11 1 then these intervals are 8 12 11 13 and 10 12 which intersect to form 11 12 or 11 5 0 5 as consistent with all three values if instead the ranges are 8 12 11 13 and 14 15 then there is no interval consistent with all these values but 11 12 is consistent with the largest number of sources namely two of them

in celestial mechanics secular refers to the long term motion of a system and resonance is when two periods or frequenciesare a simple numerical ratio of small integers typically the synchronized precessions in secular resonances are between the rates of change of the argument of the periapses or the rates of change of the longitude of the ascending nodes of two system bodies secular resonances can be used to study the long term orbital evolution of asteroids and their familieswithin the asteroid belt see the resonance below secular resonances occur when the precession of two orbits is synchronised a precession of the perihelion with frequency g or the ascending node with frequency s or both a small body such as a small solar system body in secular resonance with a much larger one e g a planet will precess at the same rate as the large body over relatively short time periods a million years or so a secular resonance will change the eccentricity and inclination of the small body one can distinguish between a prominent example of a linear resonance is the secular resonance between asteroids and saturn asteroids which approach it have their eccentricity slowly increased until they

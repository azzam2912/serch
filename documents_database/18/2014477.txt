it was built by the artuqid turkmens in the mid 12th century between about 1147 and 1167 and at the time its central arch was one of the largest in the world if not the largest the bridge was repaired by ayyubid kurdish and aq qoyunlu turkmen rulers during the 14th and 15th centuries and appears to have eventually collapsed in the early or mid 17th century the bridge s ruined piers still stand two of them in the tigris river as does one arch the ruins of the bridge are expected to be submerged along with most of the town of hasankeyf by the filling of the il su dam starting in 2018 in roman times kepha hasankeyf was a base for legionnaires on the frontier with persia and for a time the capital of the roman province of arzanene the existence of a roman bridge across the tigris at hasankeyf has been viewed as highly probable by one scholar who speculates that like the later bridge it may have had a wooden superstructure based on piers of masonry and natural stone however none of the remaining structure of the bridge appears to date from roman times roman builders

the problem was identified and named by atle selberg in 1949 beginning around 1996 john friedlander and henryk iwaniec developed some parity sensitive sieves that make the parity problem less of an obstacle terence tao gave this rough statement of the problem this problem is significant because it may explain why it is difficult for sieves to detect primes in other words to give a non trivial lower bound for the number of primes with some property for example in a sense chen s theorem is very close to a solution of the twin prime conjecture since it says that there are infinitely many primes p such that p 2 is either prime or the product of two primes the parity problem suggests that because the case of interest has an odd number of prime factors namely 1 it won t be possible to separate out the two cases using sieves this example is due to selberg and is given as an exercise with hints by cojocaru murty the problem is to estimate separately the number of numbers x with no prime divisors x that have an even or an odd number of prime factors it can be shown that

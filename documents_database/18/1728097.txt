it is defined as the ratio of the odds of the test being positive if the subject has a disease relative to the odds of the test being positive if the subject does not have the disease the rationale for the diagnostic odds ratio is that it is a single indicator of test performance like accuracy and youden s j statistic but which is independent of prevalence unlike accuracy and is presented as an odds ratio which is familiar to medical practitioners the diagnostic odds ratio is defined mathematically as where formula 2 formula 3 formula 4 and formula 5 are the number of true positives false negatives false positives and true negatives respectively as an odds ratio the logarithm of the diagnostic odds ratio is approximately normally distributed the standard error of the log diagnostic odds ratio is approximately from this an approximate 95 confidence interval can be calculated for the log diagnostic odds ratio exponentiation of the approximate confidence interval for the log diagnostic odds ratio gives the approximate confidence interval for the diagnostic odds ratio the diagnostic odds ratio ranges from zero to infinity although for useful tests it is greater than one and higher diagnostic odds

it is a form of compost produced primarily by fungal breakdown leaves shed in autumn tend to have a very low nitrogen content and are often dry their main constituents are cellulose and lignin because of this autumn leaves break down far more slowly than most other compost ingredients with very little bacterial decomposition involved fungal decomposition of a heap of leaves in the open can take between one and two years to break down into a dark brown fine powdery humic matter during the two to three years that the process takes to complete in damp temperate climates a succession of different fungal species may be involved a range of micro fauna are also involved in converting the leaf material into a fine grained humus including many isopods millipedes earthworms etc in the natural environment the slow decomposition of leaves provides a moist growing medium for young plants and also protects the ground from drying out during periods of low rainfall it is a significant component of soil organic matter particularly in temperate deciduous woodland the slow rate of decomposition allows the plant nutrients bound up in the leaves to be released slowly back into the environment where they

pseudosuchians are also informally known as crocodilian line archosaurs prior to 2011 the clade pseudosuchia was often called crurotarsi in reference to the crurotarsal ankle found in almost all members of the group which traditionally included phytosaurs ornithosuchids and suchians however a major 2011 study of triassic archosaur relations proposed that phytosaurs were not closely related to other traditional crurotarsans at least compared to bird line archosaurs avemetatarsalians such as pterosaurs and dinosaurs as a result the possession of a crurotarsal ankle was considered a plesiomorphic primitive feature retained by pseudosuchians crurotarsi now refers to a broader group of reptiles including pseudosuchia phytosauria and avemetatarsalia despite pseudosuchia meaning false crocodiles the name is a misnomer as true crocodilians are a subset of the group contrary to popular belief crocodilians differ significantly from their ancestors and distant relatives as pseudosuchia contains a staggering diversity of reptiles with many different lifestyles early pseudosuchians were successful in the triassic period they included giant quadrupedal apex predators such as saurosuchus prestosuchus and luperosuchus ornithosuchids were large scavengers while erpetosuchids and gracilisuchids were small light footed predators a few groups acquired herbivorous diets such as the heavily armored aetosaurs and several were bipedal such as

the dual norm of a continuous linear functional formula 4 belonging to formula 3 is defined to be the real number which holds for all and the dual of the dual norm is the original norm we have formula 7 for all this need not hold in infinite dimensional vector spaces the dual of the euclidean norm is the euclidean norm since the dual of the formula 12 norm is the formula 13 norm and the dual of the formula 13 norm is the formula 12 norm more generally h lder s inequality shows that the dual of the formula 17 norm is the formula 18 norm where satisfies formula 19 i e formula 20 as another example consider the formula 21 or spectral norm on formula 22 the associated dual norm is which turns out to be the sum of the singular values where formula 25 this norm is sometimes called the nuclear norm the frobenius norm defined by is self dual i e its dual norm is formula 27 the spectral norm a special case of the induced norm when formula 28 is defined by the maximum singular values of a matrix i e has the nuclear norm

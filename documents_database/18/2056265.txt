detection of the cognate inputs initiates downstream conformational changes of one or more scrnas leading to generation of the desired output signal the output signal may be intended to read out the state of endogenous biological circuitry e g mapping gene expression for biological research or medical diagnosis or to regulate the state of endogenous biological circuitry e g perturbing gene expression for biological research or medical treatment scrna sequences can be programmed to recognize different inputs or to activate different outputs achieving even single nucleotide sequence selectivity scrna signal transduction exploits principles from the emerging disciplines of dynamic rna nanotechnology molecular programming and synthetic biology fluorophore labeled scrnas have been engineered to transduce between detection of mrna targets and generation of bright fluorescent amplification polymers in situ figure 1 in this context scrna signal transduction enables multiplexed mapping of mrna expression within intact vertebrate embryos figure 2 scrnas have been engineered to perform shape and sequence transduction to conditionally produce a dicer substrate targeting silencing target mrna y upon detection of an independent detection target mrna x with subsequent dicer processing yielding a small interfering rna sirna targeting mrna y for destruction figure 3 in this context scrna signal

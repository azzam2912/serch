the radial wires either may run above the surface of the earth on the surface or buried a centimeter or so under the earth the ends of the wires nearest the antenna base are connected to the antenna system electrical ground and the far ends are either unconnected or connected to metal stakes driven into the earth when used in the context of planning for a transmission system radials are a concept used when describing a radio station s broadcast range the radials in this case are several lines drawn on a map radiating from the transmitter with evenly spaced horizontal bearings the radial extends as far as the transmitted signal can reach either by calculation or by measurement stations transmitting at low frequencies like the mediumwave and longwave am broadcast bands and some lower shortwave frequencies have frequencies so low that any feasible antenna is necessarily short compared to the wavelength the most common being a quarter wave vertical antenna the radials at the antenna base provide a proper ground plane for the types of radio antennas used for long wavelengths these electrically short antennas require grounding or earthing wires to function well the radials are typically buried in

heterodyning is used to shift one frequency range into another new one and is also involved in the processes of modulation and demodulation the two frequencies are combined in a nonlinear signal processing device such as a vacuum tube transistor or diode usually called a mixer in the most common application two signals at frequencies and are mixed creating two new signals one at the sum of the two frequencies and the other at the difference these frequencies are called heterodynes typically only one of the new frequencies is desired and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer heterodyne frequencies are related to the phenomenon of beats in acoustics a major application of the heterodyne process is in the superheterodyne radio receiver circuit which is used in virtually all modern radio receivers in 1901 reginald fessenden demonstrated a direct conversion heterodyne receiver or beat receiver as a method of making continuous wave radiotelegraphy signals audible fessenden s receiver did not see much application because of its local oscillator s stability problem a stable yet inexpensive local oscillator was not available until lee de forest invented the triode vacuum tube oscillator in a 1905 patent fessenden

grothendieck s scheme theory allows the structure sheaf to carry nilpotent elements derived algebraic geometry can be thought of as an extension of this idea and provides natural settings for intersection theory or motivic homotopy theory of singular algebraic varieties and cotangent complexes in deformation theory cf j francis among the other applications basic objects of study in the field are derived schemes and derived stacks they generalize for instance differential graded schemes the oft cited example is serre s intersection formula in the usual formulation the formula involves the tor functor and thus unless higher tor vanish the scheme theoretic intersection i e fiber product of immersions does not yield the correct intersection number in the derived context one takes the derived tensor product formula 1 whose higher homotopy is higher tor whose spec is not a scheme but a derived scheme hence the derived fiber product yields the correct intersection number currently this is hypothetical the derived intersection theory has yet to be developed the term derived comes from derived category it is classic that many operations in algebraic geometry make sense only in the derived category of say quasi coherent sheaves rather than the category of such

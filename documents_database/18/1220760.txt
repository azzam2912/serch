the lemma was a precursor in one dimension of the calder n zygmund lemma the lemma is stated as follows the colorful name of the lemma comes from imagining the graph of the function g as a mountainous landscape with the sun shining horizontally from the right the set e consist of points that are in the shadow we need a lemma suppose c d s but d s then g c g d to prove this suppose g c g d then g achieves its maximum on c d at some point z d since z s there is a y in z b with g z g y if y d then g would not reach its maximum on c d at z thus y d b and g d g z g y this means that d s which is a contradiction thus establishing the lemma the set e is open so it is composed of a countable union of disjoint intervals a b it follows immediately from the lemma that g x g b for x in a b since g is continuous we must also have g a g b if a a or a

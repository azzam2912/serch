a small polish lithuanian force of about 6 000 7 000 under great lithuanian hetman janusz radziwi surprised a numerically superior russian force of 40 000 some estimates speak of about 70 000 but they are likely too high under knyaz yakov cherkassky near shklow the battle took place during a solar eclipse the russian forces due to their surprise were engaged by the poles unprepared and in smaller portions which were defeated in turn eventually the poles forced the entire russian army to retreat the losses are estimated at about 700 for the poles and 7 000 for the russians although they may be overestimated for both sides the conflict was triggered by the khmelnytsky rebellion of ukrainian cossacks against the polish lithuanian commonwealth the cossack leader bohdan khmelnytsky derived his main foreign support from alexis of russia and promised his allegiance in recompense although the zemsky sobor of 1651 was poised to accept the cossacks into the moscow sphere of influence and to enter the war against poland on their side the tsar waited until 1653 when a new popular assembly eventually authorized the unification of ukraine with tsardom of russia after the cossacks ratified this agreement at

before the aptian the island was uplifted particularly in the east likely due to the collision of a volcanic island arc in total hispaniola is formed from 11 distinct small island arcs from the albian to the campanian plutonism metamorphism and volcanism began simultaneously taking place underwater on the largely submerged landmass in the campanian a second arc collision took place picrite from the duarte complex in central hispaniola has been inferred as galapagos hotspot type island plateau rocks the cordillera central in the middle of the island has obducted peridotite from the mid cretaceous on top of a mylonite and phyllonite schist shear zone in the maimon formation deformation appears in rocks north as far as the volcanic and sedimentary los ranchos formation they are unconformably overlain by albian cenomanian limestones into the paleogene at the start of the cenozoic volcanism metamorphism and plutonism continued underwater until the eocene still largely below water however by the middle eocene the amalgamated island arcs collided with the southern margin of the north american plate at the florida bahama platform leading to the formation of extensive carbonates and the end of volcanism and plutonism the island arc rocks became exposed above the

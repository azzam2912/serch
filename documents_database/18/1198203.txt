it is one of the largest buildings to have been moved from one site to another weighing an estimated 3500 tonnes this reinforced concrete building was moved from its original site now the location of the museum of new zealand te papa tongarewa to a site some 180 metres down and across a major road the relocation started in may 1993 and was completed just over five months later in a remarkable feat of engineering the building was turned into a railway carriage and wheeled on 8 sets of parallel rails 100 metres alongside a busy road the wheels were then turned 90 degrees and the building pushed across the road on another set of rails to a point where it was joined to new foundations and recommenced operation as a hotel during this process the only items removed from the hotel were the bed linens everything else remained in situ even the bottles in the bar nothing was damaged in the move and there were no signs of any stress cracks in plaster doors jamming etc whatsoever motive power for the move was a series of hydraulic rams collectively these were capable of providing a push of 160 tonnes

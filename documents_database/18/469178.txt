flows are ubiquitous in science including engineering and physics the notion of flow is basic to the study of ordinary differential equations informally a flow may be viewed as a continuous motion of points over time more formally a flow is a group action of the real numbers on a set the idea of a vector flow that is the flow determined by a vector field occurs in the areas of differential topology riemannian geometry and lie groups specific examples of vector flows include the geodesic flow the hamiltonian flow the ricci flow the mean curvature flow and the anosov flow flows may also be defined for systems of random variables and stochastic processes and occur in the study of ergodic dynamical systems the most celebrated of these is perhaps the bernoulli flow a flow on a set is a group action of the additive group of real numbers on more explicitly a flow is a mapping such that for all and all real numbers and it is customary to write instead of so that the equations above can be expressed as identity function and group law then for all the mapping is a bijection with inverse this follows from

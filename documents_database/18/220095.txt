white blundered with 38 kh2 allowing 38 qd3 this dominates the knight despite having six squares available to it its capture cannot be avoided b2 d2 a5 and e5 are guarded by the black bishop d6 by the black queen and b6 by the pawn additionally there is no way for the white queen to safely defend it as every square she could defend it from is guarded by the black queen examples in composed endgame studies can be rather more subtle complex and spectacular than those found in games the example here is a study by henri rinck first published in la strat gie in 1920 it is white to play and win normally black would be able to sacrifice his rook for the white bishop leaving a drawn position sacrificing it for a knight would be no good since it is possible to force mate with bishop and knight but in this case it turns out that the rook is dominated and its capture cannot be avoided despite its freedom of movement the first move of the solution is 1 nd2 after which all rook moves allow it to be captured or immediately lost to a knight fork

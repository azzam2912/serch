it is to be contrasted with thermodynamics which deals with the direction in which a process occurs but in itself tells nothing about its rate chemical kinetics includes investigations of how different experimental conditions can influence the speed of a chemical reaction and yield information about the reaction s mechanism and transition states as well as the construction of mathematical models that also can describe the characteristics of a chemical reaction in 1864 peter waage and cato guldberg pioneered the development of chemical kinetics by formulating the law of mass action which states that the speed of a chemical reaction is proportional to the quantity of the reacting substances van t hoff studied chemical dynamics and in 1884 published his famous tudes de dynamique chimique in 1901 he was awarded by the first nobel prize in chemistry in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions after van t hoff chemical kinetics deals with the experimental determination of reaction rates from which rate laws and rate constants are derived relatively simple rate laws exist for zero order reactions for which reaction rates are independent of concentration

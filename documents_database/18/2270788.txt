that is if there are 2 input lines and at most only one of them will ever be high the binary code of this hot line is produced on the n bit output lines for example a 4 to 2 simple encoder takes 4 input bits and produces 2 output bits the illustrated gate level example implements the simple encoder defined by the truth table but it must be understood that for all the non explicitly defined input combinations i e inputs containing 0 2 3 or 4 high bits the outputs are treated as don t cares it is the reverse of a decoder in its function if the input circuit can guarantee at most a single active input a simple encoder is a better choice than a priority encoder since it requires less logic to implement but if not this become the major disadvantage of simple encoder that is they can generate the wrong output when there is more than one input present in a high state logic state 1 to rectify this problem a priority encoder is used they act on the request of higher priority and the rest cases go in don t care condition a

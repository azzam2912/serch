its nest cells are of conical structure linearly attached to a string like substratum the nests are typically found in places open to human interactions such as gardens trees or forests around villages there is a clear dominance hierarchy within colonies which often affects the behavioral activities of its members the wasp s most common predators are vespa tropica also known as the great banded hornet p nigricans serrei defends itself by flying away or giving out alarm calls studies investigating the biology and social behavior of stenogastrinae subfamily wasps have begun since the early 20th century but some of their unusual morphological and ethological traits make it hard for them to have a specific systematic allocation in the phylogenetic tree these wasps also vary a significant degree in terms of social organization since there are some species that show a rather primitive social life while some display complex socially dependent behaviors consequently van der vecht classifies them as members of the subfamily of the eumenidae family while carpenter considers them to be included in the vespidae family along with euparaginae masarinae eumeninae polistinae and vespinae therefore studying stenogastrinae family species has long been regarded as a way to investigate

three dimensional porous implantable materials used in the orthopedic and dental implant industries offer the potential for ingrowth as well as ongrowth or osseoincorporation conventional textured or coated implant surfaces are designed to achieve bone to implant contact which is called ongrowth per ingvar br nemark defined this ongrowth phenomenon osseointegration as the direct structural and functional connection between ordered living bone and the surface of a load carrying implant in the case of dental implants they osseointegrate porous implantable materials are designed for bone to grow not only onto the material but also into its pores and in some cases interconnecting within the material s structure in a process called osseoincorporation in some cases the patient has periodontal defects damaged or poor bone structure which hinder osseointegration guided tissue and or bone regeneration may be necessary before the bone can osseointegrate with the dental implant in this case a combination of barrier membranes bone tacks and supplemental autogenous bone may be required to promote proper osseointegration in addition implant surface modification has been studied and now integrated thus promoting an optimal tissue implant interface i e osseointegration implant gingival seal

the combination of the halogen gas and the tungsten filament produces a halogen cycle chemical reaction which redeposits evaporated tungsten to the filament increasing its life and maintaining the clarity of the envelope for this to happen a halogen lamp must be operated at a higher envelope temperature 250 c 482 f than a standard vacuum incandescent lamp of similar power and operating life this also produces light with higher luminous efficacy and color temperature the small size of halogen lamps permits their use in compact optical systems for projectors and illumination the small glass envelope may be enclosed in a much larger outer glass bulb for a bigger package the outer jacket will be at a much lower and safer temperature and it also protects the hot bulb from harmful contamination and makes the bulb mechanically more similar to a conventional lamp that it might replace standard and halogen incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than led and compact fluorescent lamps and have been banned in many jurisdictions because of this a carbon filament lamp using chlorine to prevent darkening of the envelope was patented in 1882 and chlorine filled novak lamps were marketed in 1892 the use of

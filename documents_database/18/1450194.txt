the topography is measured by detecting the deflection of the cantilever using an optical system laser photodiode while the current is detected using a current to voltage preamplifier the fact that the cafm uses two different detection systems optical for the topography and preamplifier for the current is a strong advantage compared to scanning tunneling microscopy stm basically in stm the topography picture is constructed based on the current flowing between the tip and the sample the distance can be calculated depending on the current therefore when a portion of a sample is scanned with an stm it is not possible to discern if the current fluctutations are related to a change in the topography due to surface roughness or to a change in the sample conductivity due to intrinsic inhomogeneities the cafm is usually operated in contact mode the tip can be kept at one location while the voltage and current signals are applied read or it can be moved to scan a specific region of the sample under a constant voltage and the current is collected recently some manufacturers provide the option of measuring the current in semi contact mode the cafm was first developed by john o

the hsp was designed to measure the brightness and polarity of rapidly varying celestial objects it could observe in ultraviolet visible light and near infrared at a rate of one measurement per 10 microseconds the design was novel in that despite being able to view through a variety of filters and apertures it had no moving parts except for the filter wheel it was functional from launch in 1990 until it was removed at the end of 1993 and it helped diagnose an issue with the hubble s primary mirror the hsp was one of the instruments on hubble at launch its primary mission was compromised by the optical problems with the telescope although some projects were still successful during the first servicing mission in december 1993 it was replaced by the corrective optics space telescope axial replacement costar which corrected the optical problem for the remaining instruments the principal investigator for the instrument was dr robert c bless dr bless died in 2015 and his contributions to the hubble space telescope and the hsp instrument were noted in news media he worked at the university of wisconsin madison and the hsp was the lightest and least expensive of the

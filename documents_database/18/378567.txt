rheopectic fluids such as some lubricants thicken or solidify when shaken the opposite and much more common type of behaviour in which fluids become less viscous the longer they undergo shear is called thixotropy examples of rheopectic fluids include gypsum pastes and printer inks in the body synovial fluid exhibits the extraordinary property of inverse thixotropy or rheopexy there is ongoing research into new ways to make and use rheopectic materials there is great interest in possible military uses of this technology moreover the high end of the sports market has also begun to respond to it body armor and combat vehicle armor are key areas where efforts are being made to use rheopectic materials work is also being done to use these materials in other kinds of protective equipment which is seen as potentially useful to reduce apparent impact stress in athletics motor sports transportation accidents and all forms of parachuting in particular footwear with rheopectic shock absorption is being pursued as a dual use technology that can provide better support to those who must frequently run leap climb or descend an incorrect example often used to demonstrate rheopecty is cornstarch mixed with water which is a very viscous

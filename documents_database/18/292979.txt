its defining feature is that it lacks spatial extension being zero dimensional it does not take up space a point particle is an appropriate representation of any object whenever its size shape and structure are irrelevant in a given context for example from far enough away any finite size object will look and behave as a point like object a point particle can also be referred in the case of a moving body in terms of physics in the theory of gravity physicists often discuss a meaning a point particle with a nonzero mass and no other properties or structure likewise in electromagnetism physicists discuss a a point particle with a nonzero charge sometimes due to specific combinations of properties extended objects behave as point like even in their immediate vicinity for example spherical objects interacting in 3 dimensional space whose interactions are described by the inverse square law behave in such a way as if all their matter were concentrated in their centers of mass in newtonian gravitation and classical electromagnetism for example the respective fields outside a spherical object are identical to those of a point particle of equal charge mass located at the center of the sphere

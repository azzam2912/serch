snorkels when used by vehicles with air breathing internal combustion engines sometimes allow limited deep wading capability for river crossing or amphibious landing operations particularly in the case of tanks and other armored vehicles in such cases the snorkel supplies air for both the engine and the sealed crew compartment allowing total submersion often the snorkel pipe is of large diameter and fits over the crew hatch to provide an escape route for the crew in case the vehicle becomes stuck or disabled while underwater military wheeled vehicles such as a hemtt transport or a unimog are often capable of mounting snorkels for the engine air intake only to allow them to wade through relatively deep water limited by the height of snorkel intake and the driver s head usually slightly less than the height of the roof generally the crew compartment is not watertight and the crew will be immersed unlike in tracked vehicles which are generally totally sealed the maximum depth is dictated by the height of the snorkel if the water level should reach the snorkel intake it will be drawn into the engine immediately killing it in the case of a world war ii era amphibious

one is an inequality involving the geometric mean and arithmetic mean of two sets of real numbers of the unit interval the result was published on page 5 of the book inequalities by edwin f beckenbach and richard e bellman 1961 who refer to an unpublished result of ky fan they mention the result in connection with the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means and augustin louis cauchy s proof of this inequality by forward backward induction a method which can also be used to prove the ky fan inequality this ky fan inequality is a special case of levinson s inequality and also the starting point for several generalizations and refinements some of them are given in the references below the second ky fan inequality is used in game theory to investigate the existence of an equilibrium if x with 0 x formula 1 for i 1 n are real numbers then with equality if and only if x x x let denote the arithmetic and geometric mean respectively of x x and let denote the arithmetic and geometric mean respectively of 1 x 1 x then the ky fan inequality can be written as which shows the similarity

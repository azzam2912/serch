carbon nanotube technology has shown to have the potential to alter drug delivery and biosensing methods for the better and thus carbon nanotubes have recently garnered interest in the field of medicine the use of cnts in drug delivery and biosensing technology has the potential to revolutionalize medicine functionalization of single walled nanotubes swnts has proven to enhance solubility and allow for efficient tumor targeting drug delivery it prevents swnts from being cytotoxic and altering the function of immune cells cancer a group of diseases in which cells grow and divide abnormally is one of the primary diseases being looked at with regards to how it responds to cnt drug delivery current cancer therapy primarily involves surgery radiation therapy and chemotherapy these methods of treatment are usually painful and kill normal cells in addition to producing adverse side effects cnts as drug delivery vehicles have shown potential in targeting specific cancer cells with a dosage lower than conventional drugs used that is just as effective in killing the cells however does not harm healthy cells and significantly reduces side effects current blood glucose monitoring methods by patients suffering from diabetes are normally invasive and often painful for example one method

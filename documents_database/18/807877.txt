often when a rider notices the motor start to sputter he or she can access the reserve before the engine shuts down in most cases the main and the reserve settings are actually drawing from the same tank but there are two outlets through which the fuel may leave one outlet is located a short distance above the other when the fuel selector is set to the main position the fuel will flow from the upper outlet and will stop flowing when the fuel level gets below the outlet when the selector is on reserve the lower outlet will be used which allows all the fuel to be drawn from the tank because in most cases the reserve setting simply allows access to all the fuel rather than a dedicated tank the reserve selection allows the rider to deplete the main fuel supply as well as the reserve this causes no harm except that the fuel may run out without warning

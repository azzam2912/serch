it was originally identified as part of a larger conserved region present in the drosophila trithorax protein and was subsequently identified in the drosophila su var 3 9 and enhancer of zeste proteins from which the acronym set is derived studies have suggested that the set domain may be a signature of proteins that modulate transcriptionally active or repressed chromatin states through chromatin remodeling activities model organisms have been used in the study of setdb1 function a conditional knockout mouse line called setdb1 was generated as part of the international knockout mouse consortium program a high throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion twenty seven tests were carried out on mutant mice and four significant abnormalities were observed no homozygous mutant embryos were identified during gestation and therefore none survived until weaning the remaining tests were carried out on heterozygous mutant adult mice and two significant abnormalities were observed females had abnormal peripheral blood lymphocytes data and both sexes displayed increased bone strength and mineral content setdb1 has been shown to interact with trim28

the basic principle is that a pressure drop is created over a by passable pig held back against a pipeline s fluid flow the pipeline fluid passing through the pigs cleaning head is accelerated by this pressure drop forming strong cleaning jets these jets are directed onto the inner wall in front of the pig removing all kinds of deposits pipeline pigs are devices that are inserted into and travel throughout the length of a pipeline driven by the product flow they were originally developed to remove deposits which could obstruct or retard flow through a pipeline fig 1 today pigs are used during all phases in the life of a pipeline for many different reasons pigs used today can be divided into three categories fig 2 generally for cleaning pigs the cleaning force applied is the mechanical force between the pipe inner wall and the cleaning pig itself this force is determined by the pig travel speed as well as by the hardness and shape of the cleaning edge the faster the pig the higher the cleaning impact on the deposits but at the same time only the surface of the debris is scratched away therefore several sometimes many

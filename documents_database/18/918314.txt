it has schl fli symbol of 5 4 it can also be called a pentapentagonal tiling in a bicolored quasiregular form this tiling represents a hyperbolic kaleidoscope of 5 mirrors meeting as edges of a regular pentagon this symmetry by orbifold notation is called 22222 with 5 order 2 mirror intersections in coxeter notation can be represented as 5 4 removing two of three mirrors passing through the pentagon center in the 5 4 symmetry the kaleidoscopic domains can be seen as bicolored pentagons representing mirror images of the fundamental domain this coloring represents the uniform tiling t 5 5 and as a quasiregular tiling is called a pentapentagonal tiling this tiling is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular polyhedra and tilings with pentagonal faces starting with the dodecahedron with schl fli symbol 5 n and coxeter diagram progressing to infinity this tiling is also topologically related as a part of sequence of regular polyhedra and tilings with four faces per vertex starting with the octahedron with schl fli symbol n 4 and coxeter diagram with n progressing to infinity this tiling is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular polyhedra and tilings with vertex

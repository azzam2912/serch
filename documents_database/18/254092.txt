by analogy with the term eigenvector for a vector which when operated on by a linear operator is another vector which is a scalar multiple of itself the term eigenplane can be used to describe a two dimensional plane a 2 plane such that the operation of a linear operator on a vector in the 2 plane always yields another vector in the same 2 plane a particular case that has been studied is that in which the linear operator is an isometry m of the hypersphere written s represented within four dimensional euclidean space where s and t are four dimensional column vectors and is a two dimensional eigenrotation within the eigenplane in the usual eigenvector problem there is freedom to multiply an eigenvector by an arbitrary scalar in this case there is freedom to multiply by an arbitrary non zero rotation this case is potentially physically interesting in the case that the shape of the universe is a multiply connected 3 manifold since finding the angles of the eigenrotations of a candidate isometry for topological lensing is a way to falsify such hypotheses

spline interpolation is often preferred over polynomial interpolation because the interpolation error can be made small even when using low degree polynomials for the spline spline interpolation avoids the problem of runge s phenomenon in which oscillation can occur between points when interpolating using high degree polynomials originally spline was a term for elastic rulers that were bent to pass through a number of predefined points knots these were used to make technical drawings for shipbuilding and construction by hand as illustrated by figure 1 the approach to mathematically model the shape of such elastic rulers fixed by knots formula 1 is to interpolate between all the pairs of knots formula 2 and formula 3 with polynomials formula 4 the curvature of a curve formula 5 is given by as the spline will take a shape that minimizes the bending under the constraint of passing through all knots both formula 7 and formula 8 will be continuous everywhere and at the knots to achieve this one must have that this can only be achieved if polynomials of degree 5 or higher are used the classical approach is to use polynomials of degree 3 called cubic splines which can achieve the

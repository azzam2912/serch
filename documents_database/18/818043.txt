the ventilation part of the test looks at the ability of air to reach all parts of the lungs while the perfusion part evaluates how well blood circulates within the lungs as q in physiology is the letter used to describe bloodflow the term v q scan emerged this test is most commonly done in order to check for the presence of a blood clot or abnormal blood flow inside the lungs such as a pulmonary embolism pe although computed tomography with radiocontrast is now more commonly used for this purpose the v q scan may be used in some circumstances where radiocontrast would be inappropriate as in renal failure a v q lung scan may be performed in the case of serious lung disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd or pneumonia as well as a lung performance quantification tool pre and post lung lobectomy surgery decreased uptake of the inhaled radioisotope may indicate an impaired ability to breathe airway obstruction or possible pneumonia decreased circulation of the injected maa indicates a problem with blood flow into or within the lungs a localized area of decreased uptake usually in a wedge shaped or pie shaped configuration with normal

it is the first element in group 6 it is a steely grey lustrous hard and brittle transition metal chromium is the main additive in stainless steel to which it adds anti corrosive properties chromium is also highly valued as a metal that is able to be highly polished while resisting tarnishing polished chromium reflects almost 70 of the visible spectrum with almost 90 of infrared light being reflected the name of the element is derived from the greek word chr ma meaning color because many chromium compounds are intensely colored ferrochromium alloy is commercially produced from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness a major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel stainless steel and chrome plating electroplating with chromium together comprise 85 of the commercial use in the united states trivalent chromium cr iii ion is considered an essential nutrient in humans for insulin sugar and lipid metabolism however in 2014

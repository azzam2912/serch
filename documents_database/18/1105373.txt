the protein encoded by this gene is one of two proteins that are required to form the dq heterodimer a cell surface receptor essential to the function of the immune system hla dqb1 belongs to the hla class ii beta chain paralogues this class ii molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha dqa and a beta chain dqb both anchored in the membrane it plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins class ii molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells apc b lymphocytes dendritic cells macrophages the beta chain is approximately 26 28 kda and it contains 5 exons exon one encodes the leader peptide exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular protein domains exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and exon 5 encodes the cytoplasmic tail within the dq molecule both the alpha chain and the beta chain contain the polymorphisms specifying the peptide binding specificities resulting in up to 4 different molecules typing for these polymorphisms is routinely done for bone marrow transplantation several alleles of hla dqb1 are associated with an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes the locus also has the genetic name iddm1 as

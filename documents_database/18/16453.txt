in clock recovery applications it is called timing jitter jitter is a significant and usually undesired factor in the design of almost all communications links jitter can be quantified in the same terms as all time varying signals e g root mean square rms or peak to peak displacement also like other time varying signals jitter can be expressed in terms of spectral density jitter period is the interval between two times of maximum effect or minimum effect of a signal characteristic that varies regularly with time jitter frequency the more commonly quoted figure is its inverse itu t g 810 classifies jitter frequencies below 10 hz as wander and frequencies at or above 10 hz as jitter jitter may be caused by electromagnetic interference and crosstalk with carriers of other signals jitter can cause a display monitor to flicker affect the performance of processors in personal computers introduce clicks or other undesired effects in audio signals and cause loss of transmitted data between network devices the amount of tolerable jitter depends on the affected application for clock jitter there are three commonly used metrics in telecommunications the unit used for the above types of jitter is usually the unit

it is separated from the parietal lobe by a groove between tissues called the central sulcus and from the temporal lobe by a deeper groove called the lateral sulcus sylvian fissure the most anterior rounded part of the frontal lobe though not well defined is known as the frontal pole one of the three poles of the cerebrum the frontal lobe is covered by the frontal cortex the frontal cortex includes the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex cortical parts of the motor cortex the front part of the frontal lobe is covered by the prefrontal cortex there are four principal gyri in the frontal lobe the precentral gyrus is directly anterior to the central sulcus running parallel to it and contains the primary motor cortex which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts three horizontally arranged subsections of the frontal gyrus are the superior frontal gyrus the middle frontal gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus the inferior frontal gyrus is divided into three parts the orbital part the triangular part and the opercular part the frontal lobe contains most of the dopamine neurons in the cerebral cortex the dopaminergic pathways are associated with reward attention short term memory

while subtractive synthesis can be applied to any source audio signal the sound most commonly associated with the technique is that of analog synthesizers of the 1960s and 1970s in which the harmonics of simple waveforms such as sawtooth pulse or square waves are attenuated with a voltage controlled resonant low pass filter many digital virtual analog and software synthesizers use subtractive synthesis sometimes in conjunction with other methods of sound synthesis the basis of subtractive synthesis can be understood by considering the human voice when a human speaks sings or makes other vocal noises the vocal folds act as an oscillator and the mouth and throat as a filter consider the difference between singing oooh and aaah at the same pitch the sound generated by the vocal folds is much the same in either case a sound that is rich in harmonics the difference between the two comes from the filtering applied with the mouth and throat by changing the shape of the mouth the frequency response of the filter is changed removing subtracting some of the harmonics the aaah sound has most of the original harmonics still present the oooh sound has most of them removed or to

d hamilton in 1964 an individual s own child who carries one half of the individual s genes is defined as one offspring equivalent a sibling s child who will carry one quarter of the individual s genes is 1 2 offspring equivalent similarly a cousin s child who has 1 16 of the individual s genes is 1 8 offspring equivalent from the gene s point of view evolutionary success ultimately depends on leaving behind the maximum number of copies of itself in the population prior to hamilton s work it was generally assumed that genes only achieved this through the number of viable offspring produced by the individual organism they occupied however this overlooked a wider consideration of a gene s success most clearly in the case of the social insects where the vast majority of individuals do not produce their own offspring hamilton showed mathematically that because other members of a population may share one s genes a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by indirectly promoting the reproduction and survival of other individuals who also carry that gene this is variously called kin theory kin selection theory or inclusive fitness theory the most obvious category

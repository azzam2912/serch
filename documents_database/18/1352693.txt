viewed as an additive noise phase noise increases at frequencies close to the oscillation frequency or its harmonics with the additive noise being close to the oscillation frequency it cannot be removed by filtering without also removing the oscillation signal all well designed nonlinear oscillators have stable limit cycles meaning that if perturbed the oscillator will naturally return to its periodic limit cycle when perturbed the oscillator responds by spiraling back into the limit cycle but not necessarily at the same phase this is because the oscillator is autonomous it has no stable time reference the phase is free to drift as a result any perturbation of the oscillator causes the phase to drift which explains why the noise produced by an oscillator is predominantly in phase there are two different ways commonly used to characterize noise in an oscillator s is the spectral density of the phase and s is the spectral density of the voltage s contains both amplitude and phase components but with oscillators the phase noise dominates except at frequencies far from the carrier and its harmonics s is directly observable on a spectrum analyzer whereas s is only observable if the signal is first passed

commercially available triticale is almost always a second generation hybrid i e a cross between two kinds of primary first cross triticales as a rule triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance including soil conditions of rye only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop depending on the cultivar triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents it is grown mostly for forage or fodder although some triticale based foods can be purchased at health food stores and can be found in some breakfast cereals when crossing wheat and rye wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent pollen donor the resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself the primary producers of triticale are poland germany belarus france and russia in 2014 according to the food and agriculture organization fao 17 1 million tons were harvested in 37 countries across the world the triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species in other words triticale is an allotetraploid

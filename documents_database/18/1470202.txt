some examples of semiconductor quantities that could be characterized include depletion width carrier concentration optical generation and recombination rate carrier lifetimes defect concentration trap states etc these quantities fall into three categories when it comes to characterization methods 1 electrical characterization 2 optical characterization 3 physical chemical characterization electrical characterization can be used to determine resistivity carrier concentration mobility contact resistance barrier height depletion width oxide charge interface states carrier lifetimes and deep level impurities two point probe four point probe differential hall effect capacitance voltage profiling dlts electron beam induced current and dlcp optical characterization may include microscopy ellipsometry photoluminescence transmission spectroscopy absorption spectroscopy raman spectroscopy reflectance modulation cathodoluminescence to name a few electron beam techniques sem tem aes emp eels ion beam techniques sputtering sims rbs x ray techniques xrf xps xrd x ray topography neutron activation analysis naa chemical etching many of these techniques have been perfected for silicon making it the most studied semiconductor material this is a result of silicon s affordability and prominent use in computing as other fields such as power electronics led devices photovoltaics etc begin to come of age characterization of a variety of alternative materials will continue to increase including

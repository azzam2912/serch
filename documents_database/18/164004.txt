this is the algebraic analogue of the geometric notion of a complete intersection for a commutative ring r and an r module m an element r in r is called a non zero divisor on m if r m 0 implies m 0 for m in m an m regular sequence is a sequence such that r is a not a zero divisor on m r r m for i 1 d some authors also require that m r r m is not zero intuitively to say that r r is an m regular sequence means that these elements cut m down as much as possible when we pass successively from m to m r m to m r r m and so on an r regular sequence is called simply a regular sequence that is r r is a regular sequence if r is a non zero divisor in r r is a non zero divisor in the ring r r and so on in geometric language if x is an affine scheme and r r is a regular sequence in the ring of regular functions on x then we say that the closed subscheme r 0 r 0

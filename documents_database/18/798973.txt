they are used in three ways hatch marks are frequently used as an abbreviation of some common units of measurement in regard to distance a single hatch mark indicates feet and two hatch marks indicate inches in regard to time a single hatch mark indicates minutes and two hatch marks indicate seconds in geometry and trigonometry such marks are used following an elevated circle to indicate degrees minutes and seconds hatch marks can probably be traced to hatching in art works where the pattern of the hatch marks represents a unique tone or hue different patterns indicate different tones unit and value hatch marks are short vertical line segments which mark distances they are seen on rulers and number lines the marks are parallel to each other and are evenly spaced the distance between adjacent marks is one unit longer line segments are used for integers and natural numbers shorter line segments are used for fractions hatch marks provide a visual clue as to the value of specific points on the number line even if some hatch marks are not labeled with a number hatch marks are typically seen in number theory and geometry in geometry hatch marks are used

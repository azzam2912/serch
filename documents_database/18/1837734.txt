this means turning what was once solely a social housing development into a self sufficient mixed income multi use community when the community of regent park was originally built in 1948 there was limited access to any of toronto s modes of public transportation since the neighbourhood was built to generate a strong sense of community the area within the neighbourhood was mainly made up of smaller footpaths and small roads not ideal for transportation and inclusion to the rest of the city over time the neighbourhood became isolated and displaced from the adjacent downtown core and grew a reputation as being one of toronto s poorer dangerous neighbourhoods the plan to revitalize regent park is an initiative with the goal to alleviate the socio economic gap that had been created and expanded over the last 60 years revitalization is meant to promote a full community upheaval by building community facilities as well as affordable housing and home ownership opportunities a mixed income mixed use community in regent park will presumably provide a positive socio economic shift in a neighbourhood primarily ignored for decades the new neighbourhood will consist of a mix of rental and condominium buildings townhouses as well

many constitutive equations are designed in the form of a relation between a stress rate and a strain rate or the rate of deformation tensor the mechanical response of a material should not depend on the frame of reference in other words material constitutive equations should be frame indifferent objective if the stress and strain measures are material quantities then objectivity is automatically satisfied however if the quantities are spatial then the objectivity of the stress rate is not guaranteed even if the strain rate is objective there are numerous objective stress rates in continuum mechanics all of which can be shown to be special forms of lie derivatives some of the widely used objective stress rates are the adjacent figure shows the performance of various objective rates in a simple shear test where the material model is hypoelastic with constant elastic moduli the ratio of the shear stress to the displacement is plotted as a function of time the same moduli are used with the three objective stress rates clearly there are spurious oscillations observed for the zaremba jaumann stress rate this is not because one rate is better than another but because it is a misuse of material

in general the fireman s rule bars lawsuits by police officers firefighters and in some jurisdictions all professional rescuers from collecting on damages that occur in the course of their duties even in cases of clear negligence by other parties at the most basic the fireman s rule is based on the notion that public safety officers willingly assume the risks inherent in their duties since the very purpose of public safety officers is to confront danger the public is not liable for injuries incurred while carrying out that function while the rule is named after the risks and actions by firemen the relationship between danger and duties is similar in all public safety officers and other professional rescuers the fireman s rule has been heavily criticized for preventing police officers from suing criminals who intentionally lead them on high speed car chases in response to one such case the california state legislature enacted california civil code section 1714 9 in 1982 which overrides the fireman s rule where the tortious conduct occurred after the defendant knew or should have known of the plaintiff s presence in minnesota peace officers are exempted from the fireman s rule by statute m

a balloon satellite its objective was to study atmospheric density at its orbital altitude and to be the first united states satellite visible to the naked eye booster problems caused both orbital attempts to end in failure beacon was an international geophysical year igy satellite program developed by the naca s space vehicle group at langley under aeronautical engineer william james o sullivan jr o sullivan held the belief that measuring the air density at orbital altitudes would be of critical importance to a space agency and that a simple balloon satellite several meters in diameter would be well suited to the task as their relatively large size and low mass make them especially sensitive to air drag effects after the launch of sputnik a high priority was placed on orbiting an american satellite that would be visible from the ground o sullivan s balloon satellite would accomplish that purpose as once in orbit it would be as bright as a third or fourth magnitude star enabling easy optical and photographic tracking this brightness led to the satellite being called beacon beacon was an uninstrumented inflatable 3 66 meter 12 ft diameter sphere made of laminated mylar polyester film 25

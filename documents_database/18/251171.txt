results of this kind are amongst the most generally useful in mathematics the banach fixed point theorem gives a general criterion guaranteeing that if it is satisfied the procedure of iterating a function yields a fixed point by contrast the brouwer fixed point theorem is a non constructive result it says that any continuous function from the closed unit ball in n dimensional euclidean space to itself must have a fixed point but it doesn t describe how to find the fixed point see also sperner s lemma for example the cosine function is continuous in 1 1 and maps it into 1 1 and thus must have a fixed point this is clear when examining a sketched graph of the cosine function the fixed point occurs where the cosine curve y cos x intersects the line y x numerically the fixed point is approximately x 0 73908513321516 thus x cos x for this value of x the lefschetz fixed point theorem and the nielsen fixed point theorem from algebraic topology is notable because it gives in some sense a way to count fixed points there are a number of generalisations to banach fixed point theorem and further these are

sometimes these disks contain prominent rings as seen in the image of fomalhaut on the right debris disks have been found around both mature and young stars as well as at least one debris disk in orbit around an evolved neutron star younger debris disks can constitute a phase in the formation of a planetary system following the protoplanetary disk phase when terrestrial planets may finish growing they can also be produced and maintained as the remnants of collisions between planetesimals otherwise known as asteroids and comets by 2001 over 900 candidate stars had been found to possess a debris disk they are usually discovered by examining the star system in infrared light and looking for an excess of radiation beyond that emitted by the star this excess is inferred to be radiation from the star that has been absorbed by the dust in the disk then re radiated away as infrared energy debris disks are often described as massive analogs to the debris in the solar system most known debris disks have radii of 10 100 astronomical units au they resemble the kuiper belt in the solar system but with much more dust some debris disks contain a component

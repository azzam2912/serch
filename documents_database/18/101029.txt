gene silencing can occur during either transcription or translation and is often used in research in particular methods used to silence genes are being increasingly used to produce therapeutics to combat cancer and diseases such as infectious diseases and neurodegenerative disorders gene silencing is often considered the same as gene knockdown when genes are silenced their expression is reduced in contrast when genes are knocked out they are completely erased from the organism s genome and thus have no expression gene silencing is considered a gene knockdown mechanism since the methods used to silence genes such as rnai crispr or sirna generally reduce the expression of a gene by at least 70 but do not completely eliminate it methods using gene silencing are often considered better than gene knockouts since they allow researchers to study essential genes that are required for the animal models to survive and cannot be removed in addition they provide a more complete view on the development of diseases since diseases are generally associated with genes that have a reduced expression antisense oligonucleotides were discovered in 1978 by paul zamecnik and mary stephenson oligonucleotides which are short nucleic acid fragments bind to complementary target mrna molecules

as k algebras they generalize the real numbers complex numbers quaternions and several other hypercomplex number systems the theory of clifford algebras is intimately connected with the theory of quadratic forms and orthogonal transformations clifford algebras have important applications in a variety of fields including geometry theoretical physics and digital image processing they are named after the english mathematician william kingdon clifford the most familiar clifford algebras the orthogonal clifford algebras are also referred to as pseudo riemannian clifford algebras as distinct from symplectic clifford algebras a clifford algebra is a unital associative algebra that contains and is generated by a vector space v over a field k where v is equipped with a quadratic form the clifford algebra is the freest algebra generated by v subject to the condition where the product on the left is that of the algebra and the 1 is its multiplicative identity the idea of being the freest or most general algebra subject to this identity can be formally expressed through the notion of a universal property as done below clifford algebras can be identified by the label c r indicating that the algebra is constructed from p simple basis elements with e 1

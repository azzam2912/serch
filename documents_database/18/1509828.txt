the most common of these operations include electric lighting electric motor speed control electric welding and electric heating although it is always possible to control the amount of electrical power delivered to a load by using a variable transformer to create a variable secondary output voltage these transformers are physically large and expensive and need frequent maintenance in high power ratings there are other methods of controlling power to a load but they are mostly not available for high power applications since 1961 an alternative method using thyristors has been in use both silicon controlled rectifiers scr and triacs are members of the thyristor family the term thyristor includes all the semiconductor devices which show inherent on off behavior as opposed to allowing gradual changes in conduction all thyristors are regenerative switching devices and they cannot operate in linear manner thus a transistor is not a thyristor even though it can operate like a switch on off the transistor is not inherently an on off device and it is possible for a transistor to operate linearly some thyristors can be gated into the on state other thyristors cannot be gated on but they can be turned on when the applied

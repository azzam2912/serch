most of the classical engineering materials somehow follow this rule in at least a portion of their shear failure envelope generally the theory applies to materials for which the compressive strength far exceeds the tensile strength in geotechnical engineering it is used to define shear strength of soils and rocks at different effective stresses in structural engineering it is used to determine failure load as well as the angle of fracture of a displacement fracture in concrete and similar materials coulomb s friction hypothesis is used to determine the combination of shear and normal stress that will cause a fracture of the material mohr s circle is used to determine which principal stresses will produce this combination of shear and normal stress and the angle of the plane in which this will occur according to the principle of normality the stress introduced at failure will be perpendicular to the line describing the fracture condition it can be shown that a material failing according to coulomb s friction hypothesis will show the displacement introduced at failure forming an angle to the line of fracture equal to the angle of friction this makes the strength of the material determinable by comparing the

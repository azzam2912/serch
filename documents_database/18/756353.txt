it is the first quantum cryptography protocol the protocol is provably secure relying on the quantum property that information gain is only possible at the expense of disturbing the signal if the two states one is trying to distinguish are not orthogonal see no cloning theorem and an authenticated public classical channel it is usually explained as a method of securely communicating a private key from one party to another for use in one time pad encryption in the bb84 scheme alice wishes to send a private key to bob she begins with two strings of bits formula 1 and formula 2 each formula 3 bits long she then encodes these two strings as a tensor product of formula 3 qubits where formula 6 and formula 7 are the formula 8 th bits of formula 1 and formula 2 respectively together formula 11 give us an index into the following four qubit states note that the bit formula 7 is what decides which basis formula 6 is encoded in either in the computational basis or the hadamard basis the qubits are now in states that are not mutually orthogonal and thus it is impossible to distinguish all of them with

graphite is an important material for the construction of both historical and modern nuclear reactors due to its extreme purity and its ability to withstand extremely high temperatures graphite has also recently been used in nuclear fusion reactors as well such as the wendelstein 7 x as of experiments published in 2019 the use of graphite in elements of the stellarator s wall and a graphite island divertor have greatly improved the plasma performance within the device yielding better control over impurity and heat exhaust and long high density discharges nuclear fission the creation of a nuclear chain reaction in uranium was discovered in 1939 following experiments by otto hahn and fritz strassman and the interpretation of their results by physicists such as lise meitner and otto frisch shortly thereafter word of the discovery spread throughout the international physics community in order for the fission process to chain react the neutrons created by uranium fission must be slowed down by interacting with a neutron moderator an element with a low atomic weight that will bounce when hit by a neutron before they will be captured by other uranium atoms by late 1939 it became well known that the two most

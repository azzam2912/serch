other typical uses are internal and external buses in microprocessors computer memory and peripherals many devices are controlled by an active low input called output enable which dictates whether the outputs should be held in a high impedance state or drive their respective loads to either 0 or 1 level the term tri state should not be confused with ternary logic 3 value logic the basic concept of the third state high impedance hi z is to effectively remove the device s influence from the rest of the circuit if more than one device is electrically connected to another device putting an output into the hi z state is often used to prevent short circuits or one device driving high logical 1 against another device driving low logical 0 three state buffers can also be used to implement efficient multiplexers especially those with large numbers of inputs three state buffers are essential to the operation of a shared electronic bus three state logic can reduce the number of wires needed to drive a set of leds tri state multiplexing or charlieplexing many memory devices designed to connect to a bus such as ram and rom chips have both chip select

its fundamental characteristics are an insulated combustion chamber where fuel generally wood is burned with high efficiency at extremely high temperatures and a large thermal mass in contact with the exhaust gases which absorbs most of the generated heat before the gases are released to the atmosphere according to various reports a rocket mass heater can reduce fuel consumption by 80 90 compared to conventional stoves an internal vertical insulated chimney the combustion chamber ensures an efficient high temperature burn and creates enough draft to push exhaust gases through the rest of the system flue gases are cooled to a relatively low temperature within the thermal store approximately 50 c 122 f and in some designs steam within these gases condenses into liquid releasing the associated latent heat of condensation which further increases the efficiency in the manner of a condensing gas boiler the rocket cooking stove was developed by the aprovecho institute and described in 1982 a rocket stove is a cooking appliance optimized to provide relatively high heat utilization and low emissions the first prototype was built in the 1980s although in some sense simply a variation on a masonry heater most rocket mass heaters are distinct in

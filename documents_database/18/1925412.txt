it is a very thin accumulation of sandstone siltstone and breccia that is exposed in only four places in the chuar valley these exposures occur atop nankoweap butte and within awatubi and sixtymile canyons in the eastern grand canyon arizona the maximum preserved thickness of the sixtymile formation is about the actual depositional thickness of the sixtymile formation is unknown owing to erosion during the formation of the great unconformity and prior to deposition of the tapeats sandstone sixtymile formation and the underlying chuar group are preserved only in a broad asymmetric fold comprising called the chuar syncline the chuar syncline is a doubly plunging fold which means that along the hingeline within the axis of the syncline beds in some areas nankoweap canyon dip toward the south and in other areas lava chuar canyon beds dip toward the north the sixtymile formation chuar group and chuar syncline is bounded on the east by the butte fault zone and on all other sides by the great unconformity and overlying tapeats sandstone the hingeline of the chuar syncline parallels the trace of the butte fault suggesting a genetic relationship between the syncline and the fault in descending order the sixtymile formation

the books are rotated vertically similar to the motion of a water wheel as opposed to rotating on a flat table surface the design for the bookwheel originally appeared in a 16th century illustration by agostino ramelli at a time when large books posed practical problems for readers ramelli s design influenced other engineers and though now obsolete inspires modern artists and historians the bookwheel in its most commonly seen form was invented by italian military engineer agostino ramelli in 1588 presented as one of the 195 designs in le diverse et artificiose machine del capitano agostino ramelli the various and ingenious machines of captain agostino ramelli to ensure that the books remained at a constant angle ramelli incorporated an epicyclic gearing arrangement a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks ramelli s design is unnecessarily elaborate as he likely understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively as it does with a ferris wheel invented centuries later but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess while other people would go on to build bookwheels based on ramelli s design ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own to what extent

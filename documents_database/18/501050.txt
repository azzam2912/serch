the name uncorrelated asymmetry is due to john maynard smith who called payoff relevant asymmetries in games with similar roles for each player correlated asymmetries note that any game with correlated asymmetries must also have uncorrelated asymmetries the explanation of an uncorrelated asymmetry usually makes reference to informational asymmetry which may confuse some readers since games which may have uncorrelated asymmetries are still games of complete information what differs between the same game with and without an uncorrelated asymmetry is whether the players know which role they have been assigned if players in a symmetric game know whether they are player 1 player 2 etc or row vs column player in a bimatrix game then an uncorrelated asymmetry exists if the players do not know which player they are then no uncorrelated asymmetry exists the information asymmetry is that one player believes he is player 1 and the other believes he is player 2 therefore informational asymmetry does not refer to knowledge in the sense of an information set in an extensive form game the concept of uncorrelated asymmetries is important in determining which nash equilibria are evolutionarily stable strategies in discoordination games such as the game of chicken in

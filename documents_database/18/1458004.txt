an n sun is a chordal graph with 2 n vertices partitioned into two subsets u u u and w w w such that each vertex w in w has exactly two neighbors u and u an n sun cannot be strongly chordal because the cycle u w u w has no odd chord strongly chordal graphs may also be characterized as the graphs having a strong perfect elimination ordering an ordering of the vertices such that the neighbors of any vertex that come later in the ordering form a clique and such that for each i dually chordal graph strongly chordal graphs may also be characterized in terms of the number of complete subgraphs each edge participates in yet another characterization is given in it is possible to determine whether a graph is strongly chordal in polynomial time by repeatedly searching for and removing a simple vertex if this process eliminates all vertices in the graph the graph must be strongly chordal otherwise if this process finds a subgraph without any more simple vertices the original graph cannot be strongly chordal for a strongly chordal graph the order in which the vertices are removed by this process is a

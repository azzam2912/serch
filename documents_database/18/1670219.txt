the purpose is to protect electronics against moisture dust dirt and vibration low pressure molding is also used for sealing connectors and molding grommets and strain reliefs key to this process are the raw materials and specialized molding equipment dimer acid based polyamide materials better known as hot melts are used as molding compounds they are thermoplastics i e the material when heated becomes less viscous and is able to be re shaped then hardens to keep the desired form upon cooling down these polyamide materials differ from other thermoplastics in two main areas one viscosity at processing temperature 410f 210c the viscosity is very low typically around 3 000 centipoise similar to pancake syrup low viscosity materials require low injection pressure in order to inject into a cavity in fact it is normal to use a simple gear pump to inject the polyamide material low injection pressure is paramount when over molding relatively fragile electronic component two adhesion polyamide materials are basically high performance hot melt adhesives the adhesive properties of polyamide is what seals a chosen substrate the type of adhesion is purely mechanical i e no chemical reaction takes place polyamide material is heated until liquid typically

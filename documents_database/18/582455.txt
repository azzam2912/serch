from 1969 there were nine county divisions in antrim but the changes in the vicinity of belfast did not affect the boundaries of this division it comprised in terms of local government units existing in 1929 parts of the rural districts of ballycastle and ballymoney together with the whole of the urban districts of ballycastle ballymoney and portrush it returned one member of parliament from 1929 until the parliament of northern ireland was temporarily suspended in 1972 and then formally abolished in 1973 county antrim except for parts of belfast is a strongly unionist area there has never been the slightest chance of a republican or nationalist candidate being elected in a single member antrim county constituency however the boundaries were drawn antrim north has not been an exception at the northern ireland general election of 1929 the new antrim north division was the scene of a reasonably close unionist liberal contest less than a 20 majority however this was the last appearance of a liberal candidate for the northern ireland parliament constituency which became an extremely safe unionist seat for the rest of its existence the elections in this constituency took place using the first past the post electoral

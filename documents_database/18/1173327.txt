they are the basis of plate tectonic analysis allowing the monitoring of continental drift rates with milimetre accuracies a fundamental point is the geometric origin of a geodetic network and defines the geodetic datum of a national survey some fundamental stations are an astronomical or satellite geodetic observatory in any case the geographic latitude and longitude of the station is precisely determined by methods of astrogeodesy and is chosen as ellipsoidal latitude and longitude at the earth ellipsoid which is used to calculate the coordinates of the whole network also precise azimuths to one or two network points are observed and are taken over as orientated directions of these network lines by these procedure the polar axis of the reference ellipsoid becomes parallel to the earth rotation axis and therefore the vertical deflection of the fundamental point is zero important fundamental stations in europe are located in worldwide about 30 fundamental stations are in existence about 5 in the united states and in commonwealth of independent states countries and 2 3 in south america africa eastern asia australia and antarctica the basic coordinate system is the itrf reference frame which is related to the icrs celestial inertial system by means

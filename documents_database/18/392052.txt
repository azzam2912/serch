the method is named after walther ritz in quantum mechanics a system of particles can be described in terms of an energy functional or hamiltonian which will measure the energy of any proposed configuration of said particles it turns out that certain privileged configurations are more likely than other configurations and this has to do with the eigenanalysis analysis of characteristics of this hamiltonian system because it is often impossible to analyze all of the infinite configurations of particles to find the one with the least amount of energy it becomes essential to be able to approximate this hamiltonian in some way for the purpose of numerical computations the ritz method can be used to achieve this goal in the language of mathematics it is exactly the finite element method used to compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a hamiltonian system as with other variational methods a trial wave function formula 1 is tested on the system this trial function is selected to meet boundary conditions and any other physical constraints the exact function is not known the trial function contains one or more adjustable parameters which are varied to find a lowest energy configuration it can be shown that

he was a major influence on the development of algebra and geometry at the university of genova born 8 may 1923 in savona italy gallarati joined the university of pisa in 1941 his studies being interrupted by the war he received his first degree from genova he started his research career at l institiuto naxionale di alta matematica in rome where he was taught by giacomo albanese leonard roth leonida tonelli e g togliatti beniamino segre and francesco severi he took a post at genova in 1947 where he stayed until he retired in 1987 gallarati published 64 papers between 1951 and 1996 important amongst his research was the study of surfaces in p with multiple isolated singularities his lower bounds for maximal number of nodes of surfaces of degree n stood for a long time and exact solutions for large n were still unknown in 2001 in grassmannian geometry he extended segre s bound for the number of linearly independent complexes containing the curve in the grassmannian corresponding to the tangent lines of a nondegenerate projective curve he extended the results to arbitrarily dimensioned varieties tangent spaces to higher degree complexes and to arbitrary curves in grassmannians corresponding to

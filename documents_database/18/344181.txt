it was developed by david mumford in 1965 using ideas from the paper in classical invariant theory geometric invariant theory studies an action of a group g on an algebraic variety or scheme x and provides techniques for forming the quotient of x by g as a scheme with reasonable properties one motivation was to construct moduli spaces in algebraic geometry as quotients of schemes parametrizing marked objects in the 1970s and 1980s the theory developed interactions with symplectic geometry and equivariant topology and was used to construct moduli spaces of objects in differential geometry such as instantons and monopoles invariant theory is concerned with a group action of a group g on an algebraic variety or a scheme x classical invariant theory addresses the situation when x v is a vector space and g is either a finite group or one of the classical lie groups that acts linearly on v this action induces a linear action of g on the space of polynomial functions r v on v by the formula the polynomial invariants of the g action on v are those polynomial functions f on v which are fixed under the change of variables due to the

as a critical component of the dna polymerase iii holoenzyme the clamp protein binds dna polymerase and prevents this enzyme from dissociating from the template dna strand the clamp polymerase protein protein interactions are stronger and more specific than the direct interactions between the polymerase and the template dna strand because one of the rate limiting steps in the dna synthesis reaction is the association of the polymerase with the dna template the presence of the sliding clamp dramatically increases the number of nucleotides that the polymerase can add to the growing strand per association event the presence of the dna clamp can increase the rate of dna synthesis up to 1 000 fold compared with a nonprocessive polymerase the dna clamp fold is an protein that assembles into a multimeric structure that completely encircles the dna double helix as the polymerase adds nucleotides to the growing strand the dna clamp assembles on the dna at the replication fork and slides along the dna with the advancing polymerase aided by a layer of water molecules in the central pore of the clamp between the dna and the protein surface because of the toroidal shape of the assembled multimer the clamp

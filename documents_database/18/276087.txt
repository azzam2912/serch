thus adding a bit plane gives a better approximation if a bit on the nth bit plane on an m bit dataset is set to 1 it contributes a value of 2 otherwise it contributes nothing therefore bit planes can contribute half of the value of the previous bit plane for example in the 8 bit value 10110101 181 in decimal the bit planes work as follows bit plane is sometimes used as synonymous to bitmap however technically the former refers to the location of the data in memory and the latter to the data itself one aspect of using bit planes is determining whether a bit plane is random noise or contains significant information one method for calculating this is compare each pixel x y to three adjacent pixels x 1 y x y 1 and x 1 y 1 if the pixel is the same as at least two of the three adjacent pixels it is not noise a noisy bit plane will have 49 to 51 pixels that are noise as an example in pcm sound encoding the first bit in the sample denotes the sign of the function or in other words defines the half of

in circuits made with individual devices discrete circuits biasing networks consisting of resistors are commonly employed much more elaborate biasing arrangements are used in integrated circuits for example bandgap voltage references and current mirrors the voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages by the use of resistors in certain patterns by selecting the proper resistor values stable current levels can be achieved that vary only little over temperature and with transistor properties such as the operating point of a device also known as bias point quiescent point or q point is the point on the output characteristics that shows the dc collector emitter voltage v and the collector current i with no input signal applied the bias circuit stabilizes the operating point of the transistor for variations in transistor characteristics and operating temperature the gain of a transistor can vary significantly between different batches which results in widely different operating points for sequential units in serial production or after replacement of a transistor by the early effect the current gain is affected by the collector emitter voltage both gain and base emitter voltage depend on the temperature the leakage current also increases with temperature a bias network is selected to

its full title in german was the reichskommissariat f r die besetzten norwegischen gebiete reich commissariat for the occupied norwegian territories it was governed by reichskommissar josef terboven until his deposition on 7 may 1945 the german military forces in norway then under the command of general franz b hme surrendered to the allies on 9 may and the legal government was restored the need by nazi germany to occupy and incorporate norway into a german empire came about for two principal reasons the first was that in 1940 germany was dependent on natural resources mainly iron ore being sent from sweden to germany if norway allowed allied vessels to pass through its waters they could potentially blockade the trade routes the second reason was that germany feared an allied attack either using norway as a staging area or moving through sweden neutrality remained the policy of the norwegian government until the invasion was a fait accompli but its highest priority was to avoid a war with the united kingdom by the autumn of 1939 there was an increasing sense of urgency that norway had to prepare not only to protect its neutrality but indeed to fight for its freedom

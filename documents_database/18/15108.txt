the putamen and caudate nucleus together form the dorsal striatum it is also one of the structures that comprise the basal nuclei through various pathways the putamen is connected to the substantia nigra the globus pallidus the claustrum and the thalamus in addition to many regions of the cerebral cortex a primary function of the putamen is to regulate movements at various stages e g preparation and execution and influence various types of learning it employs gaba acetylcholine and enkephalin to perform its functions the putamen also plays a role in degenerative neurological disorders such as parkinson s disease the word putamen is from latin referring to that which falls off in pruning from putare meaning to prune to think or to consider until recently most mri research focused broadly on the basal ganglia as a whole for various reasons e g image resolution rarity of isolated infarct or hemorrhage within the putamen etc however many studies have been done on the basal ganglia and relevant brain behavior relationships in the 1970s the first single unit recordings were done with monkeys monitoring pallidal neuron activity related to movement since then more extensive neuronal tracing stimulation and imaging research methods e

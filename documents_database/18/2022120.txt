one of the techniques was successfully demonstrated by scientists at the fraunhofer society in november 2013 because most modern computers especially laptops have built in microphones and speakers air gap malware can be designed to communicate secure information acoustically at frequencies near or beyond the limit of human hearing the technique is limited to computers in close physical proximity about and is also limited by the requirement that both the transmitting and receiving machines be infected with the proper malware to form the communication link the physical proximity limit can be overcome by creating an acoustically linked mesh network but is only effective if the mesh network ultimately has a traditional ethernet connection to the outside world by which the secure information can be removed from the secure facility in 2014 researchers introduced airhopper a bifurcated attack pattern showing the feasibility of data exfiltration from an isolated computer to a nearby mobile phone using fm frequency signals in 2015 bitwhisper a covert signaling channel between air gapped computers using thermal manipulations was introduced bitwhisper supports bidirectional communication and requires no additional dedicated peripheral hardware later in 2015 researchers introduced gsmem a method for exfiltrating data from air gapped computers over

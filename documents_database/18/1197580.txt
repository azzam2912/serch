the sole species is nimbaphrynoides occidentalis along with nectophrynoides eleutherodactylus jasperi and limnonectes larvaepartus nimbaphrynoides are the only frogs toads that do not lay eggs nimbaphrynoides occidentalis was first described as nectophrynoides occidentalis by fernand angel in 1943 a second species from mount nimba nectophrynoides liberiensis was described in 1979 the two were then transferred to a newly erected genus nimbaphrynoides in 1987 the two species were similar except for the larger size of n liberiensis compared to n occidentalis and some small colour differences however their calls are similar and the genetic differences are minor on this basis they have been judged to be the same species however acknowledging the significant differences in size and that small genetic differences do exist they are still retained as subspecies adult males of nimbaphrynoides occidentalis occidentalis measure on average and adult females on average in snout vent length nimbaphrynoides occidentalis liberiensis are larger at respectively adult colouration is variable the dorsum in most individuals is brown to black backs without a distinct border between the two colours it may also be uniform in colouration or have lighter and darker browns irregularly mixed there are some lighter areas in the head at least

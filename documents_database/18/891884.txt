cxcl3 controls migration and adhesion of monocytes and mediates its effects on its target cell by interacting with a cell surface chemokine receptor called cxcr2 more recently it has been shown that cxcl3 regulates cell autonomously the migration of the precursors of cerebellar granule neurons toward the internal layers of cerebellum during the morphogenesis of cerebellum moreover if the expression of cxcl3 is reduced in cerebellar granule neuron precursors this highly enhances the frequency of the medulloblastoma the tumor of cerebellum in fact the reduced expression of cxcl3 forces the cerebellar granule neuron precursors to remain at the surface of the cerebellum where they highly proliferate under the stimulus of sonic hedgehog becoming target of transforming insults remarkably the treatment with cxcl3 completely prevents the growth of medulloblastoma lesions in a shh type mouse model of medulloblastoma thus cxcl3 is a target for medulloblastoma therapy cxcl3 is directly regulated transcriptionally by btg2 the gene for cxcl3 is located on chromosome 4 in a cluster of other cxc chemokines

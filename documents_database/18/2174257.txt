it has an apparent visual magnitude of 5 94 which indicates it is a sixth magnitude star that is faintly visible to the naked eye according to the bortle scale it can be viewed from dark suburban skies parallax measurements by the hipparcos spacecraft give an estimated distance of 57 3 light years away this star is a pre main sequence solar analog with a stellar classification of g1 v it is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 7 53 km s and a rotation period of 5 9 days measurements of magnetic activity in the chromosphere show variations over time much like the sunspot cycle this activity showed a distinct peak in 2009 stellar models give an estimated mass equal to 1 13 times the mass of the sun but only 94 of the sun s radius the total or bolometric luminosity of the star is 15 higher than the sun while the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium what astronomer s term the metallicity is nearly the same as in the sun the stellar atmosphere has an effective temperature of 5 940 k giving it the yellow hued glow of a g type star

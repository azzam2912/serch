it was first described for its discovery in 1958 in wheal carpenter gwinear cornwall england uk the name is from cornubia the medieval latin name for cornwall it is a dimorph of cornwallite and the arsenic analogue of pseudomalachite cleavage is distinct in two directions both perpendicular to the enlarged faces of the tabular crystals intersecting at about 70 cornubite is fairly soft with hardness 4 the same as fluorite and specific gravity 4 64 which is similar to another copper arsenate clinoclase at 4 38 but much denser than quartz at 2 66 all triclinic minerals are biaxial cornubite is biaxial its refractive indices are quite high close to 1 9 similar to zircon and garnet it is green as are many copper minerals usually translucent with a vitreous luster and a light green streak cornubite belongs to the triclinic crystal class space group p meaning that it has a very low symmetry with only a center of symmetry and no mirror planes or axes of symmetry in 1984 sieber hofmeister tillmans and abraham reported new data from microprobe analysis of cornubite which gave unit cell parameters a 6 121 b 6 251 c 6 790 92 93 111

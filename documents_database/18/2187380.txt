this exclusive virion a thorough virus which is made of an rna or dna core with a protein coat is found in the negev desert it is incapable of infecting vertebrate cells differentiating it from the series of mosquitoes borne alphaviruses the eilat virus is from the family togaviridae genus alphavirus alphaviruses are miniature spherical shaped around 70 nm in diameter enveloped viruses which consist of a positive sense 5 to 3 rna genome which encompasses two orf s open reading frame which is an incessant stretch of codons that do not contain a stop codon four nonstructural proteins are encoded on two thirds of the genome 5 end which include nsp1 nsp2 nsp3 nsp4 while five structural proteins sps capsid e1 e2 e3 and 6k are encoded on the one third part of the genome 3 portion by receptor mediated endocytosis alphaviruses gain entry into a host cell after acquiring access the low endocytic ph allows for a conformational change that discloses an e1 fusion peptide thus inducing the release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm of the host cell the nucleocapsids in turn aid in initiating virion budding from the host cell membrane the eilat virus was isolated

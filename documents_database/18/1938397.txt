its advanced design incorporated a laminar flow wing t tail retracting undercarriage and a reclining seat to reduce parasitic drag the high performance veltro italian sailplane was one of a group of gliders designed and built internationally in 1953 4 using 6 series laminar flow naca airfoils following the successful 1950 ross johnson rj 5 from the us it was designed by the morelli brothers and completed in just eight months the veltro was a wooden shoulder wing cantilever monoplane with a span wing which was straight tapered in plan and had an aspect ratio of 18 1 its wing was constructed around a main box spar and a lighter auxiliary spar and was made in three pieces with a central panel long the wing was skinned with thick plywood apart from the tight radius leading edge which was made of carefully shaped balsa wood glued to a forward false spar the trailing edges carried fabric covered slotted ailerons outboard and ply covered slotted flaps which at low deflection angles acted as camber changing lift increasing devices to increase the speed range and at higher angles 60 acted as airbrakes the wing tips were fitted with tip bodies long and

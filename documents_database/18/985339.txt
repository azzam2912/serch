roberts in 1969 the boxicity of a graph is the minimum dimension in which a given graph can be represented as an intersection graph of axis parallel boxes that is there must exist a one to one correspondence between the vertices of the graph and a set of boxes such that two boxes intersect if and only if there is an edge connecting the corresponding vertices the figure shows a graph with six vertices and a representation of this graph as an intersection graph of rectangles two dimensional boxes this graph cannot be represented as an intersection graph of boxes in any lower dimension so its boxicity is two a graph has boxicity at most one if and only if it is an interval graph the boxicity of an arbitrary graph g is the minimum number of interval graphs on the same set of vertices such that the intersection of the edges sets of the interval graphs is g every outerplanar graph has boxicity at most two and every planar graph has boxicity at most three if a bipartite graph has boxicity two it can be represented as an intersection graph of axis parallel line segments in the plane many

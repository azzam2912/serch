the ultra low electrical resistivity of a superconducting material allows an rf resonator to obtain an extremely high quality factor q for example it is commonplace for a 1 3 ghz niobium srf resonant cavity at 1 8 kelvins to obtain a quality factor of q 5 10 such a very high q resonator stores energy with very low loss and narrow bandwidth these properties can be exploited for a variety of applications including the construction of high performance particle accelerator structures the amount of loss in an srf resonant cavity is so minute that it is often explained with the following comparison galileo galilei 1564 1642 was one of the first investigators of pendulous motion a simple form of mechanical resonance had galileo experimented with a 1 hz resonator with a quality factor q typical of today s srf cavities and left it swinging in an entombed lab since the early 17th century that pendulum would still be swinging today with about half of its original amplitude the most common application of superconducting rf is in particle accelerators accelerators typically use resonant rf cavities formed from or coated with superconducting materials electromagnetic fields are excited in the cavity by

state of colorado the geologic column of colorado spans about one third of earth s history fossils can be found almost everywhere in the state but are not evenly distributed among all the ages of the state s rocks during the early paleozoic colorado was covered by a warm shallow sea that would come to be home to creatures like brachiopods conodonts ostracoderms sharks and trilobites this sea withdrew from the state between the silurian and early devonian leaving a gap in the local rock record it returned during the carboniferous areas of the state not submerged were richly vegetated and inhabited by amphibians that left behind footprints that would later fossilize during the permian the sea withdrew and alluvial fans and sand dunes spread across the state many trace fossils are known from these deposits the sea returned during the triassic while exposed areas were a richly vegetated coastal plain that was home to dinosaurs colorado was again submerged by a sea during the cretaceous period that was home to plesiosaurs up to 70 feet long during the early part of the cenozoic era rainforests grew in colorado later another rich flora and fauna would come to be preserved

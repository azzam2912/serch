in the context of bayesian statistics it may also be referred to as the evidence or model evidence given a set of independent identically distributed data points formula 1 where formula 2 according to some probability distribution parameterized by formula 3 where formula 3 itself is a random variable described by a distribution i e formula 5 the marginal likelihood in general asks what the probability formula 6 is where formula 3 has been marginalized out integrated out the above definition is phrased in the context of bayesian statistics in classical frequentist statistics the concept of marginal likelihood occurs instead in the context of a joint parameter formula 9 where formula 10 is the actual parameter of interest and formula 11 is a non interesting nuisance parameter if there exists a probability distribution for formula 11 it is often desirable to consider the likelihood function only in terms of formula 10 by marginalizing out formula 11 unfortunately marginal likelihoods are generally difficult to compute exact solutions are known for a small class of distributions particularly when the marginalized out parameter is the conjugate prior of the distribution of the data in other cases some kind of numerical integration method is

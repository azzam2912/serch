it is also known as the klebs l ffler bacillus because it was discovered in 1884 by german bacteriologists edwin klebs 1834 1912 and friedrich l ffler 1852 1915 four subspecies are recognized c d mitis c d intermedius c d gravis and c d belfanti the four subspecies differ slightly in their colonial morphology and biochemical properties such as the ability to metabolize certain nutrients but all may be toxigenic and therefore cause diphtheria or not toxigenic c diphtheriae produces diphtheria toxin which alters protein function in the host by inactivating the elongation factor ef 2 this causes pharyngitis and pseudomembrane in the throat the diphtheria toxin gene is encoded by a bacteriophage found in toxigenic strains integrated into the bacterial chromosome to accurately identify c diphtheriae a gram stain is performed to show gram positive highly pleomorphic organisms with no particular arrangement special stains like albert s stain and ponder s stain are used to demonstrate the metachromatic granules formed in the polar regions the granules are called polar granules babes ernst granules volutin etc an enrichment medium such as l ffler s medium is used to preferentially grow c diphtheriae after that a differential plate known as

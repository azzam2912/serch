more specifically it can be framed in theme 1 climate change and within the line of action development of innovative practices for the management of smart grids in the context of highly decentralized production of renewable energy its main objective is to demonstrate through the implementation of a full scale industrial smartgrid that microgrids can become one of the most suitable solutions for energy generation and management in factories that want to minimize their environmental impact at a national level it is one of the first experiences regarding the implementation of a smartgrid in an industrial plant with and integrated fleet of electric vehicles factory microgrid will take place between july 2014 and june 2017 and it represents an investment of around 2 million euros approximately 50 of the total amount will be financed by the life programme project partners are the jofemar corporation and the national renewable energy centre cener project manager isabel carrilero jofemar what is a microgrid or a smartgrid smart grids are energy networks that can automatically monitor energy flows and adjust to changes in energy supply and demand accordingly when coupled with smart metering systems smart grids reach consumers and suppliers by providing information on

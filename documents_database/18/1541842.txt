then standard methods can be used to solve the linear difference equation in formula 7 one approach to developing the transformed variable formula 7 when formula 10 is to write where formula 12 and formula 13 and where formula 14 further writing formula 15 can be shown to yield this approach gives a first order difference equation for formula 7 instead of a second order one for the case in which formula 18 is non negative write formula 19 implying formula 20 where formula 21 is given by formula 22 and where formula 23 then it can be shown that formula 7 evolves according to the equation can also be solved by treating it as a special case of the where all of a b c e and x are n n matrices in this case n 1 the solution of this is where it was shown in that a dynamic matrix riccati equation of the form which can arise in some discrete time optimal control problems can be solved using the second approach above if the matrix c has only one more row than column

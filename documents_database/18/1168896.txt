these include hb gower 1 consisting of 2 zeta chains and 2 epsilon chains and hb gower 2 which consists of 2 lpha chains and 2 epsilon chains the zeta and epsilon chains being the embryonic haemoglobin chains embryonic hemoglobin is a tetramer produced in the blood islands in the embryonic yolk sac during the mesoblastic stage from 3rd week of pregnancy until 3 months the protein is commonly referred to as hemoglobin chromosomal abnormalities can lead to a delay in switching from embryonic hemoglobin hemoglobin gower 1 also referred to as zeta or hbe gower 1 is a form of hemoglobin existing only during embryonic life and is the primary embryonic hemoglobin it is composed of two zeta chains and two epsilon chains and is relatively unstable breaking down easily hemoglobin gower 2 also referred to as or hbe gower 2 is a form of hemoglobin existing at low levels during embryonic and fetal life it is composed of two alpha chains and two epsilon chains and is somewhat unstable though not as much as hemoglobin gower 1 due to its relative stability compared to hemoglobin gower 1 and hemoglobin s it has been proposed as a subject for

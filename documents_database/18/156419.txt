it is a weak androgen with a potency that is approximately 1 7 that of testosterone androsterone is a metabolite of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone dht in addition it can be converted back into dht via 3 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase bypassing conventional intermediates such as androstenedione and testosterone and as such can be considered to be a metabolic intermediate in its own right androsterone is also known to be an inhibitory androstane neurosteroid acting as a positive allosteric modulator of the gaba receptor and possesses anticonvulsant effects the unnatural enantiomer of androsterone is more potent as a positive allosteric modulator of gaba receptors and as an anticonvulsant than the natural form androsterone s 3 isomer is epiandrosterone and its 5 epimer is etiocholanolone the 3 5 isomer is epietiocholanolone androsterone has generally been considered to be an inactive metabolite of testosterone which when conjugated by glucuronidation and sulfation allows testosterone to be removed from the body but it is a weak neurosteroid that can cross into the brain and could have effects on brain function the view of androsterone as generally being of low significance however seems to need review in the light of 21st century research which

it is useful in many branches of mathematics including algebraic geometry number theory analytic combinatorics applied mathematics as well as in physics including the branches of hydrodynamics thermodynamics and particularly quantum mechanics by extension use of complex analysis also has applications in engineering fields such as nuclear aerospace mechanical and electrical engineering as a differentiable function of a complex variable is equal to the sum of its taylor series that is it is analytic complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions of a complex variable that is holomorphic functions complex analysis is one of the classical branches in mathematics with roots in the 18th century and just prior important mathematicians associated with complex numbers include euler gauss riemann cauchy weierstrass and many more in the 20th century complex analysis in particular the theory of conformal mappings has many physical applications and is also used throughout analytic number theory in modern times it has become very popular through a new boost from complex dynamics and the pictures of fractals produced by iterating holomorphic functions another important application of complex analysis is in string theory which studies conformal invariants in quantum field theory a complex function is a function from complex

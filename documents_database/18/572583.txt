the scientific name is derived from the greek dischidos meaning divided and dactylos meaning finger or toe in reference to the divided ungual flap see below placement of dischidodactylus in the subfamily ceuthomantinae pristimantinae family craugastoridae is based on morphology because no dna sequence data are available dischidodactylus is closely related to ceuthomantis with which they share a synapomorphy completely or almost completely divided ungual flaps both genera also have dorsal skin composed of small flat pliable not keratinized warts and lack nuptial pads in adult males they differ in that dischidodactylus possess a dentigerous process of the vomer and in that ceuthomantis lack basal toe webbing however the amphibiaweb places dischidodactylus in an entirely different family strabomantidae implying a distant relationship with ceuthomantis dischidodactylus are smallish frogs that reach a maximum snout vent length of in females their head is not as wide as body tympanic membrane is not differentiated and tympanic annulus is visible below skin cranial crests are absent vomers have small oblique dentigerous processes terminal discs are expanded rounded and bifurcate circumferential groove is present and terminal phalanges are t shaped dorsum is granular and venter is areolate the genus contains two species

it is caused by a mutation in cpt1a on chromosome 11 carnitine a natural substance acquired mostly through the diet is used by cells to process fats and produce energy people with this disorder have a faulty enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase i that prevents these long chain fatty acids from being transported into the mitochondria to be broken down signs and symptoms of this disorder include low levels of ketones hypoketosis and low blood sugar hypoglycemia together these signs are called hypoketotic hypoglycemia people with this disorder typically also have an enlarged liver hepatomegaly muscle weakness and elevated levels of carnitine in the blood mutations in the cpt1a gene cause carnitine palmitoyltransferase i deficiency by producing a defective version of an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase i without this enzyme long chain fatty acids from food and fats stored in the body cannot be transported into mitochondria to be broken down and processed as a result excessive levels of long chain fatty acids may more rapidly build up in tissues damaging the liver heart and or brain this condition has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern which means the defective gene must be inherited from both parents the parents of a child with

one of the first known reflecting telescopes newton s reflector of 1668 used a 3 3 cm polished metal primary mirror the next major change was to use silver on glass rather than metal in the 19th century such was with the crossley reflector this was changed to vacuum deposited aluminum on glass used on the 200 inch hale telescope solid primary mirrors have to sustain their own weight and not deform under gravity which limits the maximum size for a single piece primary mirror segmented mirror configurations are used to get around the size limitation on single primary mirrors for example the giant magellan telescope will have seven 8 4 meter primary mirrors with the resolving power equivalent to a optical aperture the largest optical telescope in the world as of 2009 to use a non segmented single mirror as its primary mirror is the 8 2 m 26 9 ft subaru telescope of the national astronomical observatory of japan located in mauna kea observatory on hawaii since 1997 however this is not the largest diameter single mirror in a telescope the u s german italian large binocular telescope has two 8 4 m 27 6 ft mirrors which

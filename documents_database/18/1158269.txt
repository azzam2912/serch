it uses eo a template based ansi c compliant computation library paradiseo is portable across both windows system and sequential platforms unix linux mac os x etc paradiseo is distributed under the cecill license and can be used under several environments paradiseo is a white box object oriented framework dedicated to the reusable design of metaheuristics hybrid metaheuristics and parallel and distributed metaheuristics paradiseo provides a broad range of features including evolutionary algorithms local searches particle swarm optimization the most common parallel and distributed models and hybridization mechanisms etc this high content and utility encourages its use at international level paradiseo is based on a clear conceptual separation of the solution methods from the problems they are intended to solve this separation confers to the user a maximum code and design reuse furthermore the fine grained nature of the classes provided by the framework allow a higher flexibility compared to other frameworks paradiseo is of the rare frameworks that provide the most common parallel and distributed models their implementation is portable on distributed memory machines as well as on shared memory multiprocessors as it uses standard libraries such as mpi pvm and pthreads the models can be exploited in a

many criticisms have been leveled at c s design by well known software developers including linus torvalds richard stallman joshua bloch rob pike ken thompson and donald knuth c is a multi paradigm programming language with extensive but not complete backward compatibility with c this article focuses not on c features like pointer arithmetic operator precedence or preprocessor macros but on pure c features that are often criticized the natural interface between source files in c c are header files each time a header file is modified all source files that include the header file should recompile their code header files are slow because they are textual and context dependent as a consequence of the preprocessor c only has limited amounts of information in header files the most important being struct declarations and function prototypes c stores its classes in header files and they not only expose their public variables and public functions like c with its structs and function prototypes but also their private functions this forces unnecessary recompiles of all source files that include the header file each time when changing these private functions this problem is magnified where the classes are written as templates forcing all of

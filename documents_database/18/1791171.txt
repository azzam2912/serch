it characterizes certain abelian categories the grothendieck categories as quotients of module categories there are several generalizations and variations of the gabriel popescu theorem given by for an ab5 category with a set of generators for triangulated categories let a be a grothendieck category an ab5 category with a generator g a generator of a and r be the ring of endomorphisms of g also let s be the functor from a to mod r the category of right r modules defined by s x hom g x then the gabriel popescu theorem states that s is full and faithful and has an exact left adjoint this implies that a is equivalent to the serre quotient category of mod r by a certain localizing subcategory c a localizing subcategory of mod r is a full subcategory c of mod r closed under arbitrary direct sums such that for any short exact sequence of modules formula 1 we have m in c if and only if m and m are in c the serre quotient of mod r by any localizing subcategory is a grothendieck category we may take c to be the kernel of the left adjoint of the functor

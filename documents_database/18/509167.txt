however one lipoxygenase aloxe3 while having a lipoxygenase genetic structure possesses relatively little dioxygenation activity rather its primary activity appears to be as an isomerase that catalyzes the conversion of hydroperoxy unsaturated fatty acids to their 1 5 epoxide hydroxyl derivatives lipoxygenases are found in eukaryotes plants fungi animals protists while the third domain of terrestrial life the archaea possesses proteins with a slight 20 amino acid sequence similarity to lipoxygenases these proteins lack iron binding residues and therefore are not projected to possess lipoxygenase activity based on detailed analyses of 15 lipoxygenase 1 and stabilized 5 lipoxygenase lipoxygenase structures consist of a 15 kilodalton n terminal beta barrel domain a small e g 0 6 kilodalton linker inter domain see protein domain domains and protein flexibility and a relatively large c terminal catalytic domain which contains the non heme iron critical for the enzymes catalytic activity most of the lipoxygenases exception aloxe3 catalyze the reaction polyunsaturated fatty acid o fatty acid hydroperoxide in four steps the oo residue may then be protonated to form a hydroperoxide group ooh and further metabolized by the lipoxygenase to e g leukotrienes hepoxilins and various specialized pro resolving mediators or reduced by ubiquitous

p gregata does not produce survival structures but has the ability to overwinter as mycelium in decaying soybean residue two strains of the fungus exist genotype a causes both foliar and stem symptoms while genotype b causes only stem symptoms common leaf symptoms are browning chlorosis and necrosis foliar symptoms which are often seen with genotype a are chlorosis defoliation and wilting there are many ways to manage phialophora gregata the most effective form of management is disease resistance but crop rotation tiliage scn management and changing the ph of the soil can also be effective phialophora gregata s infection of a soybean plant is accompanied by browning of the plant s vascular and pith tissues the plant often exhibits chlorosis and necrosis as well as leaf browning wilting and defoliation are also known to occur signs of infection often go unnoticed until reproductive stages of a plant s life cycle they can be diagnosed earlier on by opening the stem and visualizing the pathogen one can visualize signs by cutting open the stem in early stages of infection but symptoms do not become apparent until after the soybean pod formation depending on which strain infects the plant and what

if this voltage is exceeded the diode may be destroyed diodes must have a peak inverse voltage rating that is higher than the maximum voltage that will be applied to them in a given application for rectifier applications peak inverse voltage piv or peak reverse voltage prv is the maximum value of reverse voltage which occurs at the peak of the input cycle when the diode is reverse biased the portion of the sinusoidal waveform which repeats or duplicates itself is known as the cycle the part of the cycle above the horizontal axis is called the positive half cycle or alternation the part of the cycle below the horizontal axis is called the negative alternation with reference to the amplitude of the cycle the peak inverse voltage is specified as the maximum negative value of the sine wave within a cycle s negative alternation

the method is versatile as interface structures of different optical regimes e g geometrical and wave optics can be included it is very efficient due to the re usability of the calculated light redistribution properties of the individual interfaces it has so far been mainly used to model optical properties of solar cells and solar modules but it is also applicable for example to leds or oleds with light extraction structures the development of the optos formalism started in 2015 at the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems ise in freiburg germany the mathematical formulation has been described in detail in several open access publications a basic version of the code including documentation with function references has been available since the end of 2015 at the homepage of fraunhofer ise continuous updates and a list of optos related publications can be found on researchgate one key aspect of optos simulations is the division of the modeled system into interface and propagation regions the light redistribution properties are calculated with the most appropriate method for each interface individually and depending on the relevant structure dimension large scale structures can for example be modeled via ray tracing while for interfaces with structure

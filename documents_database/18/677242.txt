the released hyalin modifies the extracellular matrix of the fertilized egg to block other sperm from binding to the egg and is known as the slow block to polyspermy all animals have this slow block mechanism hyalin is a large acidic protein which aids in embryonic development the protein has strong adhesive properties which can help with cell differentiation and as a polyspermy prevention component it forms the hyaline layer which covers the surface of the egg after insemination its physical structure has a major and minor component one is filamentous having flexible molecules containing a globular domain head at the end its conformation is retained mainly by disulfide bonds as virtually all cysteine amino acids are found in the disulfide form but also hydrophobic forces and salt linkages stabilize the molecule the filament length is about 75 nm long and the head being club shaped with a diameter of 12 nm an isoform of the molecule exists having a longer filament of 125 nm instead both forms of these filaments often fold on themselves making the protein heterogeneous resulting in poorly resolved stains on a gel this makes the exact mass uncertain as the protein is very difficult to

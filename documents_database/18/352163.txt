the applications of this algorithm are mainly concerned with medical visualizations such as ct and mri scan data images and special effects or 3 d modelling with what is usually called metaballs or other metasurfaces an analogous two dimensional method is called the marching squares algorithm the algorithm was developed by william e lorensen and harvey e cline as a result of their research for general electric at general electric they worked on a way to efficiently visualize data from ct and mri devices the premise of algorithm is to divide the input volume into a discrete set of cubes by assuming linear reconstruction filtering each cube which contains a piece of a given isosurface can easily be identified because the sample values at the cube vertices must span the target isosurface value for each cube containing a section of the isosurface a triangular mesh that approximates the behavior of the trilinear interpolant in the interior cube is generated the first published version of the algorithm exploited rotational and reflective symmetry and also sign changes to build the table with 15 unique cases however due to the existence of ambiguities in the trilinear interpolant behavior in the cube faces and

mammals represent 5 500 named species out of 66 000 vertebrate species and within this 8 subgroup red blood cells are known as erythrocytes or rbcs and have no cell nucleus in mature organisms in contrast a nucleated red blood cell nrbc also known by several other names is a mammalian rbc that contains a cell nucleus nrbcs occur in normal development as progenitor cells in the erythropoietic lineage and in pathological states normally nucleated rbcs are found only in the circulation of fetuses and newborn infants after infancy rbcs normally only contain a nucleus during the very early stages of the cell s life and the nucleus is ejected as a normal part of cellular differentiation before the cell is released into the bloodstream thus if nrbcs are seen on an adult s peripheral blood smear it suggests that there is a very high demand for the bone marrow to produce rbcs and immature rbcs are being released into circulation possible pathologic causes include anemia myelofibrosis thalassemia miliary tuberculosis cancers involving bone marrow myelomas leukemias lymphomas and in chronic hypoxemia several names are used for nucleated rbcs erythroblast normoblast and megaloblast with one minor variation in word sense the

currently the most accepted mega classification system is under the three domain system which is based on molecular phylogeny in that system bacteria are members of the domain bacteria and phylum is the rank below domain since the rank kingdom is disused at present in bacterial taxonomy when bacterial nomenclature was controlled under the botanical code the term division was used but now that bacterial nomenclature with the exception of cyanobacteria is controlled under the bacteriological code the term phylum is preferred in this classification scheme bacteria is unofficially subdivided into 30 phyla with representatives cultured in a lab many major clades of bacteria that cannot currently be cultured are known solely and somewhat indirectly through metagenomics the analysis of bulk samples from the environment if these possible clades candidate phyla are included the number of phyla is 52 or higher therefore the number of major phyla has increased from 12 identifiable lineages in 1987 to 30 in 2014 or over 50 including candidate phyla the total number has been estimated to exceed 1 000 bacterial phyla at the base of the clade bacteria close to the last universal common ancestor of all living things some scientists believe there may

assembly language often referred to as asm can also be used and c compilers exist for translation into assembly tigcc for motorola 68000 68k based calculators and sdcc for zilog z80 based calculators however both of them are cross compilers not allowing on calculator programming ti basic is considerably slower than the assembly language because it has to be interpreted making it better suited to writing programs to quickly solve math problems or perform repetitive tasks rather than programming games or graphics intensive applications some math instruction books even provide programs in ti basic usually for the widespread variant used by the ti 82 83 84 series although it is somewhat minimalist compared to programming languages used on computers ti basic is nonetheless an important factor in the programming community because ti graphing calculators are required for advanced mathematics classes in many high schools and universities ti basic often provides the first glimpse many students have into the world of programming the syntax of all versions of ti basic are somewhat different from typical basic implementations the language itself has some basic structured programming capabilities but makes limited to no use of or allowance for white space or indentation it

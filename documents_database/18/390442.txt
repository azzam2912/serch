as a result the poles have a higher surface gravity and thus higher temperature and brightness thus the poles are gravity brightened and the equator gravity darkened the star becomes oblate and hence gravity darkening occurs because the centrifugal force resulting from rotation creates additional outward pressure on the star the centrifugal force is expressed mathematically as where formula 2 is mass in this case of a small volume element of the star formula 3 is the angular velocity and formula 4 is the radial distance from the axis of rotation in the case of a star the value of formula 4 is largest at the equator and smallest at the poles this means that equatorial regions of a star will have a greater centrifugal force when compared to the pole the centrifugal force pushes mass away from the axis of rotation and results in less overall pressure on the gas in the equatorial regions of the star this will cause the gas in this region to become less dense and cooler von zeipel s theorem states that the radiation from a star is proportional to the local effective gravity that is to the gravity reduced by any centrifugal force

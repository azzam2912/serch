although a conventional design its combination of light weight mobility heavy firepower and range saw its features widely copied by successive generations of mortars the origins of the m1938 lay in the french mortier brandt de 120mm modele 1935 and the brandt mle 27 31 which the soviet union produced under license as the 82 pm 36 in 1937 the soviets produced a modified version of the 82 pm 36 known as the 82 pm 37 and this mortar served as the pattern for the 120 pm 38 the main difference between the 82 pm 37 and the earlier 82 pm 36 was the adoption of a round base plate revised traverse elevation controls simplified sights and spring loaded shock absorbers on the bi pod to reduce the amount of relaying needed between shots the 120 pm 38 is essentially a scaled up 82 pm 37 which uses the same two wheeled limber as the 107 mm pbhm 38 the limber works in much the same way as a hand truck the limber is wheeled vertically into place hooks on the base plate hook onto the limber the barrel is clamped down and then everything is lowered into towing position

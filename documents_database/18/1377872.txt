it measures the how high the source code s quality is when it is passed on to the qa and is affected by how extensively the code was unit tested and integration tested code integrity is a combination of code coverage and software quality and is usually achieved by unit testing your code to reach high code coverage with code integrity the developer can be sure that his code is written correctly when passed on to qa this is in fact the expected quality level of the code code integrity helps companies release better products with fewer bugs in a shorter time companies who practice code integrity avoid the classic scenario where the development stage is delayed delaying the qa stage delaying the release stage the product is released with more bugs due to time pressure users report tons of bugs back to the development team and they start working on version 1 1 shortly after releasing version 1 0 just to fix bugs that could have been avoided the qa department can t measure the code s integrity even after all their tests are run the only way to measure code integrity and be sure of your code is

the works were collated and republished in 1895 by friedrich engels in these works marx analyzes the class issues and the economic relations which drove forward the social and political upheavals which took place in france in 1848 he focuses extensively on the argument that the conflict was not between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie but between different factions within the bourgeoisie specifically he identifies conflicts between the industrial bourgeoisie whose wealth and income are dependent upon the production and sale of goods and the financial bourgeoisie whom he identifies as bankers and stock market speculators marx identifies a political system where the individuals responsible for the development of public policy and the direction of public funds were the same individuals whose investments stood to be effected by these decisions the result of this he claims was that public policy was manipulated for the sake of self enrichment giving the example of extensive railroad projects being developed with public funds under the direction of legislators who were also the main investors in these endeavors marx asserts however that while this situation was deemed intolerable to the industrial bourgeoisie they were not in any position to take serious action against it

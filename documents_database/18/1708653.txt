disease is caused by members of the mycoplasma genus usually mycoplasma capricolum subsp capricolum but sometimes by m mycoides subsp capri or m mycoides subsp mycoides it is extremely contagious with very high morbidity and mortality rates causing an interstitial fibrinous pleuropneumonia in infected goats infection is spread by close contact aerosol therefore overcrowding and confinement increases disease incidence stress factors such as malnutrition and long transport can also predispose animals to disease goats are the only species affected therefore the disease is not a zoonosis there is no age breed or sex predilection but clinical signs are often worse in younger animals affected animals normally have generalised signs such as depression dullness weakness and lethargy pyrexia and weight loss and decreased production they will also have respiratory signs including bilateral nasal discharge dyspnoea tachypnoea and coughing occasionally the only sign seen is sudden death typical pathological lesions are very suggestive of the disease they are localised exclusively to the lung and pleura lungs are normally a port wine colour and abundant pleural exudate and pleuritis and adhesions are common the pleural exudates may have solidified forming a gelatinous covering histological examination of the lung tissues may show acute serofibrinous

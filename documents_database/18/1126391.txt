the alcohol myopia model posits that rather than disinhibit alcohol produces a myopia effect that causes users to pay more attention to salient environmental cues and less attention to less salient cues therefore alcohol s myopic effects cause intoxicated people to respond almost exclusively to their immediate environment this nearsightedness limits their ability to consider future consequences of their actions as well as regulate their reactive impulses alcohol s ability to alter behavior and decision making stems from its impact on synaptic transmission at gaba receptors alcohol s effects on the synaptic level dampen the brain s processing ability and limit attentional capacity overall the alcohol myopia theory proposes that intoxicated individuals will act rashly and will choose overly simple solutions to complex problems alcohol s myopic effects on the drinker s cognitive processes can be characterized into three classes self inflation relief and excess alcohol consumption alters the drinker s self image by enhancing feelings of self appraisal and even narcissism alcohol inhibits sophisticated levels of mental processing that are necessary to recognize personal flaws the tunnel vision effect of alcohol myopia which limits the attentional capacity of the drinker causes individuals to focus on favorable and superficial characteristics

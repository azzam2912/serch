this system is developed for quick identification of clinically relevant bacteria because of this only known bacteria can be identified it was invented in the 1970s in the united states by pierre janin of analytab products inc presently the api test system is manufactured by biom rieux the api range introduced a standardized miniaturized version of existing techniques which up until then were complicated to perform and difficult to read the api 20e ne fast identification system combines some conventional tests and allows the identification of a limited number of gram negative enterobacteriaceae or non enterobacteriaceae the test systems are stored in 20 small reaction tubes which include the substrates an identification is only possible with microbiological culture to guarantee a comparability of different samples follow the instructions of the manufacturer before starting a test one must confirm the culture is of an enterobacteriaceae to test this a quick oxidase test for cytochrome c oxidase is performed enterobacteriaceae are typically oxidase negative meaning they either do not use oxygen as an electron acceptor in the electron transport chain or they use a different cytochrome enzyme for transferring electrons to oxygen if the culture is determined to be oxidase positive alternative

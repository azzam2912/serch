each possible outcome of a particular experiment is unique and different outcomes are mutually exclusive only one outcome will occur on each trial of the experiment all of the possible outcomes of an experiment form the elements of a sample space for the experiment where we flip a coin twice the four possible outcomes that make up our sample space are h t t h t t and h h where h represents a heads and t represents a tails outcomes should not be confused with events which are sets or informally groups of outcomes for comparison we could define an event to occur when at least one heads is flipped in the experiment that is when the outcome contains at least one heads this event would contain all outcomes in the sample space except the element t t since individual outcomes may be of little practical interest or because there may be prohibitively even infinitely many of them outcomes are grouped into sets of outcomes that satisfy some condition which are called events the collection of all such events is a sigma algebra an event containing exactly one outcome is called an elementary event the event that contains all

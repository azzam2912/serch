gold fingerprinting also assists in understanding the origins of gold artifacts this method is used to characterize gold or a gold containing item by its trace elements a k a fingerprinting the sample by mineralizing event and to the particular mine or bullion source elements that measure above the detection limits include ag cu ti fe pt pd mn cr ni sn hg pb as and te can be used for gold fingerprinting and geochemical characterization in order for this technique to be used to identify the origins of the gold in question a database made from fingerprinting samples of gold from mines and bullion sources is required electron microprobe emp synchrotron micro xrf sr m xrf time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims laser induced breakdown spectroscopy libs atomic emission spectrometry x ray fluorescence spectrometry with higher energy synchrotron radiation sr xfs and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry la icp ms are all methods of gold fingerprinting the most common method is la icp ms primarily because it is quasi nondestructive allowing for the preservation of the samples and convenient as samples require little to no preparation laser ablation allows for high spatial resolution sampling

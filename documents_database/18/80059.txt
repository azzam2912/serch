exposure is measured in lux seconds and can be computed from exposure value ev and scene luminance in a specified region in photographic jargon an exposure is a single shutter cycle for example a long exposure refers to a single protracted shutter cycle to capture enough low intensity light whereas a multiple exposure involves a series of relatively brief shutter cycles effectively layering a series of photographs in one image for the same film speed the accumulated photometric exposure h should be similar in both cases radiant exposure of a surface denoted h e for energetic to avoid confusion with photometric quantities and measured in is given by where luminous exposure of a surface denoted h v for visual to avoid confusion with radiometric quantities and measured in is given by where if the measurement is adjusted to account only for light that reacts with the photo sensitive surface that is weighted by the appropriate spectral sensitivity the exposure is still measured in radiometric units joules per square meter rather than photometric units weighted by the nominal sensitivity of the human eye only in this appropriately weighted case does the h measure the effective amount of light falling on the

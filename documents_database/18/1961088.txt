these forks are a common feature of tree crowns the wood grain orientation at the top of a tree fork is such that the wood s grain pattern most often interlocks to provide sufficient mechanical support a common malformation of a tree fork is where bark has formed within the join often caused by natural bracing occurring higher up in the crown of the tree and these bark included junctions often have a heightened risk of failure especially when bracing branches are pruned out or are shaded out from the tree s crown in arboriculture junctions in the crown structure of trees are frequently categorised as either branch to stem attachments or co dominant stems co dominant stems are where the two or more arising branches emerging from the junction are of near equal diameter and this type of junction in a tree is often referred to in layman s terms as a tree fork there is actually no hard botanical division between these two forms of tree junction they are topologically equivalent and from their external appearance it is only a matter of the diameter ratio between the branches that are conjoined that separates a tree fork from being

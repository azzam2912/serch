thermal desorbers are designed to heat soils to temperatures sufficient to cause constituents to volatilize and desorb physically separate from the soil although they are not designed to decompose organic constituents thermal desorbers can depending upon the specific organics present and the temperature of the desorber system cause some organic constituents to completely or partially decompose the vaporized hydrocarbons are generally treated in a secondary treatment unit e g an afterburner catalytic oxidation chamber condenser or carbon adsorption unit prior to discharge to the atmosphere afterburners and oxidizers destroy the organic constituents condensers and carbon adsorption units trap organic compounds for subsequent treatment or disposal some preprocessing and postprocessing of soil is necessary when using lttd excavated soils are first screened to remove large greater than 2 inches in diameter objects these may be sized e g crushed or shredded and then introduced back into the feed material after leaving the desorber soils are cooled re moistened to control dust and stabilized if necessary to prepare them for disposal or reuse treated soil may be redeposited onsite used as cover in landfills or incorporated into asphalt lttd has proven very effective in reducing concentrations of petroleum products including gasoline jet

kyanite in metamorphic rocks generally indicates pressures higher than four kilobars it is commonly found in quartz although potentially stable at lower pressure and low temperature the activity of water is usually high enough under such conditions that it is replaced by hydrous aluminosilicates such as muscovite pyrophyllite or kaolinite kyanite is also known as disthene rhaeticite and cyanite kyanite is a member of the aluminosilicate series which also includes the polymorph andalusite and the polymorph sillimanite kyanite is strongly anisotropic in that its hardness varies depending on its crystallographic direction in kyanite this anisotropism can be considered an identifying characteristic at temperatures above 1100 c kyanite decomposes into mullite and vitreous silica via the following reaction 3 alo sio 3alo 2sio sio this transformation results in an expansion its name comes from the same origin as that of the color cyan being derived from the ancient greek word this is generally rendered into english as kyanos or kuanos and means dark blue kyanite is used primarily in refractory and ceramic products including porcelain plumbing and dishware it is also used in electronics electrical insulators and abrasives kyanite has been used as a semiprecious gemstone which may display cat s

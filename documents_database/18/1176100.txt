franklin in 2001 this article refers to the protocol version called basicident it is an application of pairings weil pairing over elliptic curves and finite fields as the scheme bases upon pairings all computations are performed in two groups formula 1 and formula 2 for formula 1 let formula 4 be prime formula 5 and consider the elliptic curve formula 6 over formula 7 note that this curve is not singular as formula 8 only equals formula 9 for the case formula 10 which is excluded by the additional constraint let formula 11 be a prime factor of formula 12 which is the order of formula 13 and find a point formula 14 of order formula 15 formula 1 is the set of points generated by formula 17 formula 18 formula 2 is the subgroup of order formula 15 of formula 21 we do not need to construct this group explicitly this is done by the pairing and thus don t have to find a generator the public key generator pkg chooses to create the public key for formula 34 the pkg computes given formula 37 the ciphertext formula 38 is obtained as follows note that formula 43 is the

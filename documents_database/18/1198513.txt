it is a formal power series in one indeterminate say formula 1 where the coefficient of formula 2 gives the dimension or rank of the sub structure of elements homogeneous of degree formula 3 it is closely related to the hilbert polynomial in cases when the latter exists however the hilbert poincar series describes the rank in every degree while the hilbert polynomial describes it only in all but finitely many degrees and therefore provides less information in particular the hilbert poincar series cannot be deduced from the hilbert polynomial even if the latter exists in good cases the hilbert poincar series can be expressed as a rational function of its argument formula 1 let k be a field and let formula 5 be an formula 6 graded vector space over k where each subspace formula 7 of vectors of degree n is finite dimensional then the hilbert poincar series of v is the formal power series a similar definition can be given for an formula 9 graded r module over any commutative ring r in which each submodule of elements homogeneous of a fixed degree n is free of finite rank it suffices to replace the dimension by the

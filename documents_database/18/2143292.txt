the definition of orams is motivated by the fact that an adversary can obtain nontrivial information about the execution of a program and the nature of the data that it is dealing with just by observing the pattern in which various locations of memory are accessed during its execution an adversary can get this information even if the data values are all encrypted the definition suits equally well to the settings of protected programs running on unprotected shared memory as well as a client running a program on its system by accessing previously stored data on a remote server the concept was formulated by oded goldreich in 1987 a turing machine tm the mathematical abstraction of a real computer program is said to be oblivious if for any two inputs of the same length the motions of the tape heads remain the same pippenger and fischer proved that every tm with running time formula 1 can be made oblivious and that the running time of the oblivious tm is formula 2 a more realistic model of computation is the ram model in the ram model of computation there is a cpu that can execute the basic mathematical logical and control

the bus analyzer functionality helps design test and validation engineers to check test debug and validate their designs throughout the design cycles of a hardware based product it also helps in later phases of a product life cycle in examining communication interoperability between systems and between components and clarifying hardware support concerns a bus analyzer is designed for use with specific parallel or serial bus architectures though the term bus analyzer implies a physical communication and interface that is being analyzed it is sometimes used interchangeably with the term protocol analyzer or packet analyzer and may be used also for analysis tools for wireless interfaces like wireless lan like wi fi pan like bluetooth wireless usb and other though these technologies do not have a wired bus the bus analyzer monitors and captures the bus communication data decodes and analyses it and displays the data and analysis reports to the user it is essentially a logic analyzer with some additional knowledge of the underlying bus traffic characteristics one of the key differences between a bus analyzer and a logic analyzer is notably its ability to filter and extract only relevant traffic that occurs on the analyzed bus some advanced logic

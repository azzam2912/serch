it delivers cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum er where they bind to nascent mhc class i molecules the tap structure is formed of two proteins tap 1 and tap 2 which have one hydrophobic region and one atp binding region each they assemble into a heterodimer which results in a four domain transporter the tap transporter is found in the er lumen associated with the peptide loading complex plc this complex of 2 microglobulin calreticulin erp57 tap tapasin and mhc class i acts to keep hold of mhc molecules until they have been fully loaded with peptides tap mediated peptide transport is a multistep process the peptide binding pocket is formed by tap 1 and tap 2 association with tap is an atp independent event in a fast bimolecular association step peptide binds to tap followed by a slow isomerisation of the tap complex it is suggested that the conformational change in structure triggers atp hydrolysis and so initiates peptide transport both nucleotide binding domains nbds are required for peptide translocation as each nbd cannot hydrolyse atp alone the exact mechanism of transport is not known however findings indicate that atp binding to tap 1 is the initial step

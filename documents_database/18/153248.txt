the number ratio can be related to the various units for concentration of solutions for example molarity molality normality chemistry etc the assumption that solution properties are independent of nature of solute particles is only exact for ideal solutions and is approximate for dilute real solutions in other words colligative properties are a set of solution properties that can be reasonably approximated by assuming that the solution is ideal only properties which result from the dissolution of nonvolatile solute in a volatile liquid solvent are considered they are essentially solvent properties which are changed by the presence of the solute the solute particles displace some solvent molecules in the liquid phase and therefore reduce the concentration of solvent so that the colligative properties are independent of the nature of the solute the word colligative is derived from the latin colligatus meaning bound together this indicates that all colligative properties have a common feature namely that they are related only to the number of solute molecules relative to the number of solvent molecules and not to the nature of the solute colligative properties include for a given solute solvent mass ratio all colligative properties are inversely proportional to solute molar mass

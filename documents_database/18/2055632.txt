low age low residual stromal bed rsb thickness low preoperative corneal thickness and high myopia are other important risk factors treatment options include contact lenses intrastromal corneal ring segments custom topography guided transepithelial prk combined with corneal collagen cross linking or corneal transplant when cross linking is performed only after the cornea becomes distorted vision remains blurry even though the disease is stabilised as a result combining corneal collagen cross linking with lasik lasik xtra aims to strengthen the cornea at the point of surgery and may be useful in cases where a very thin cornea is expected after the lasik procedure this would include cases of high spectacle power and people with thin corneas before surgery definitive evidence that the procedure can reduce the risk of corneal ectasia will only become available a number of years later as corneal ectasia if it happens usually occurs in the late post operative period some study show that combining lasik with cross linking adds refractive stability to hyperopic treatments and may also do the same for very high myopic treatments in 2016 the fda approved the kxl system and two photoenhancers for the treatment of corneal ectasia following refractive surgery

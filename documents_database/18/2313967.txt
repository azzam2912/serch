polar orbiting non geosynchronous environmental satellites called the joint polar satellite system jpss 2 is to be launched in 2022 and join noaa 20 and suomi npp in the same orbit circling the earth from pole to pole it will cross the equator about 14 times daily providing full global coverage twice a day jpss 2 will provide operational continuity of satellite based observations and products for noaa polar orbiting environmental satellites poes and suomi npp satellite and ground systems the baseline plan for jpss ground system will be sustained to support jpss 2 similar to noaa 20 the jpss 2 spacecraft will host the following instruments 1 viirs 2 cris 3 atms and 4 omps it was at one time intended to carry the radiation budget instrument rbi but nasa cancelled that project in 2018 on march 24 2015 nasa announced that orbital atk would build one and possibly three joint polar satellite system spacecraft in winning the contract orbital unseated the incumbent ball aerospace which had built noaa 20 jpss 1 and suomi npp jpss 2 is based on orbital atk s leostar 3 spacecraft bus platform which was also used on landsat 8 the second ice cloud

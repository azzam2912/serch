bad is a member of the bh3 only family a subfamily of the bcl 2 family it does not contain a c terminal transmembrane domain for outer mitochondrial membrane and nuclear envelope targeting unlike most other members of the bcl 2 family after activation it is able to form a heterodimer with anti apoptotic proteins and prevent them from stopping apoptosis bax bak are believed to initiate apoptosis by forming a pore in the mitochondrial outer membrane that allows cytochrome c to escape into the cytoplasm and activate the pro apoptotic caspase cascade the anti apoptotic bcl 2 and bcl xl proteins inhibit cytochrome c release through the mitochondrial pore and also inhibit activation of the cytoplasmic caspase cascade by cytochrome c dephosphorylated bad forms a heterodimer with bcl 2 and bcl xl inactivating them and thus allowing bax bak triggered apoptosis when bad is phosphorylated by akt protein kinase b triggered by pip it forms the bad 14 3 3 protein heterodimer this leaves bcl 2 free to inhibit bax triggered apoptosis bad phosphorylation is thus anti apoptotic and bad dephosphorylation e g by ca stimulated calcineurin is pro apoptotic the latter may be involved in neural diseases such

it works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels red green and blue the infrared channel in combination with the other channels is used to detect the location of scratches and dust once located those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting the three color dyes in typical color film emulsions are largely transparent to infrared light so the infrared image is almost uniformly clear unlike the rgb images on the other hand dust absorbs and scratches scatter the infrared any dust spots or scratches appear as dark marks in the infrared making them easy to find and compensate for pixels that are partially occluded for example the dust only obscures a small portion of the pixel may be corrected by scaling the infrared pixel value indicates the fractional amount of the occlusion and rgb values can be scaled appropriately if most or all of a pixel is occluded scaling is not feasible instead the pixel value may be interpolated from nearby good pixels inpainting infrared cleaning is not possible with media which are not transparent to infrared in particular the silver particles

modern medical research and practice have focused on the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying health and disease while evolutionary medicine focuses on the question of why evolution has shaped these mechanisms in ways that may leave us susceptible to disease the evolutionary approach has driven important advances in our understanding of cancer autoimmune disease and anatomy medical schools have been slower to integrate evolutionary approaches because of limitations on what can be added to existing medical curricula utilizing the delphi method 56 experts from a variety of disciplines including anthropology medicine and biology agreed upon 14 core principles intrinsic to the education and practice of evolutionary medicine these 14 principles can be further grouped into five general categories question framing evolution i and ii with ii involving a higher level of complexity evolutionary trade offs reasons for vulnerability and culture additional information regarding these principles may be found in the table below adaptation works within constraints makes compromises and trade offs and occurs in the context of different forms of competition adaptations can only occur if they are evolvable some adaptations which would prevent ill health are therefore not possible other constraints occur as the byproduct of adaptive innovations one

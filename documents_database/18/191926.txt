originally the protocol fixed the exposed node problem as well but modern rts cts includes acks and does not solve the exposed node problem the rts frame contains five fields which are the cts frame contains four fields which are the ack frame contains four fields which are ra receiver address indicating the mac address of the station that shall receive frame ta transmitter address indicating the mac address of the station which has transmitted frame fcs frame check sequence this protocol was designed under the assumption that all nodes have the same transmission ranges and does not solve the hidden terminal problem the rts cts frames can cause a new problem called the exposed terminal problem in which a wireless node that is nearby but is associated with another access point overhears the exchange and then is signaled to back off and cease transmitting for the time specified in the rts rts cts is an additional method to implement virtual carrier sensing in carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance csma ca by default 802 11 relies on physical carrier sensing only which is known to suffer from the hidden node problem the rts cts packet size threshold is

it is an intermediate compound produced during radiocarbon dating procedures is one of an extensive range of lithium carbon compounds which include the lithium rich and the graphite intercalation compounds and is the most thermodynamically stable lithium rich compound and the only one that can be obtained directly from the elements it was first produced by moissan in 1896 who reacted coal with lithium carbonate li2co3 4c li2c2 3co the other lithium rich compounds are produced by reacting lithium vapor with chlorinated hydrocarbons e g ccl lithium carbide is sometimes confused with the drug lithium carbonate because of the similarity of its name in the laboratory samples may be prepared by treating acetylene with a solution of lithium in ammonia on 40 c with creation of addition compound of lic ch 2nh that decomposes in stream of hydrogen at room temperature giving white powder of lic c2h2 2li li2c2 h2 samples prepared in this manner generally are poorly crystalline crystalline samples may be prepared by a reaction between molten lithium and graphite at over 1000 c lic can also be prepared by reacting co with molten lithium 10li 2co2 li2c2 4li2o other method for production of lic is heating of

wang is known for his work on atomic gold pyramids and planar boron clusters wang obtained a b s degree in chemistry from wuhan university in 1982 and a ph d in chemistry from the university of california berkeley in 1990 he completed his postdoctoral stay at rice university before moving to richland wa in 1993 to accept a joint position between washington state university and pacific northwest national laboratory in 2009 he moved to his current position as professor of chemistry at brown university where he teaches physical chemistry and conducts research throughout his career wang has predominately studied nanoclusters and solution phase chemistry in the gas phase focusing on the fundamental behaviors of nanoclusters using photoelectron spectroscopy and computational techniques with his group wang has discovered golden bucky balls and the smallest golden pyramid as well as aromatic clusters and planar boron clusters in addition his group has pioneered spectroscopic studies in the gas phase of free multiply charged anions and solution phase molecules such as metal complexes redox species and biologically relevant molecules his group has also developed ion trap techniques to create ultracold anions that allow high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy to be performed on complex molecules

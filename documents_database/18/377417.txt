an i o device can incorporate mechanical devices that must physically move such as a hard drive seeking a track to read or write this is often orders of magnitude slower than the switching of electric current for example during a disk operation that takes ten milliseconds to perform a processor that is clocked at one gigahertz could have performed ten million instruction processing cycles a simple approach to i o would be to start the access and then wait for it to complete but such an approach called synchronous blocking i o would block the progress of a program while the communication is in progress leaving system resources idle when a program makes many i o operations such as a program mainly or largely dependent on user input this means that the processor can spend almost all of its time idle waiting for i o operations to complete alternatively it is possible to start the communication and then perform processing that does not require that the i o be completed this approach is called asynchronous input output any task that depends on the i o having completed this includes both using the input values and critical operations that claim

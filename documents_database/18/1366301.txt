the formation of similar features during explosive volcanism is generally discounted due to the lack of metamorphic effects unequivocally associated with explosions and the difficulty in reaching sufficient pressures during such an event planar fractures are parallel sets of multiple planar cracks or cleavages in quartz grains they develop at the lowest pressures characteristic of shock waves 5 8 gpa and a common feature of quartz grains found associated with impact structures although the occurrence of planar fractures is relatively common in other deformed rocks the development of intense widespread and closely spaced planar fractures is considered diagnostic of shock metamorphism planar deformation features or pdfs are optically recognizable microscopic features in grains of silicate minerals usually quartz or feldspar consisting of very narrow planes of glassy material arranged in parallel sets that have distinct orientations with respect to the grain s crystal structure pdfs are only produced by extreme shock compressions on the scale of meteor impacts they are not found in volcanic environments this form of twinning in quartz is relatively common but the occurrence of close spaced brazil twins parallel to the basal plane 0001 has only been reported from impact structures experimental formation of basal orientated

discovered in 1963 by salvatore bellini and rediscovered in 1975 by richard blakmore this alignment is believed to aid these organisms in reaching regions of optimal oxygen concentration to perform this task these bacteria have organelles called magnetosomes that contain magnetic crystals the biological phenomenon of microorganisms tending to move in response to the environment s magnetic characteristics is known as magnetotaxis however this term is misleading in that every other application of the term taxis involves a stimulus response mechanism in contrast to the magnetoreception of animals the bacteria contain fixed magnets that force the bacteria into alignment even dead cells are dragged into alignment just like a compass needle the first description of magnetotactic bacteria was in 1963 by salvatore bellini of the university of pavia while observing bog sediments under his microscope bellini noticed a group of bacteria that evidently oriented themselves in a unique direction he realized these microorganisms moved according to the direction of the north pole and hence called them magnetosensitive bacteria the publications were academic peer reviewed by the istituto di microbiologia s editorial committee under responsibility of the institute s director prof l bianchi as usual in european universities at the time

the resistance offered by the systemic circulation is known as the systemic vascular resistance svr or may sometimes be called by the older term total peripheral resistance tpr while the resistance offered by the pulmonary circulation is known as the pulmonary vascular resistance pvr systemic vascular resistance is used in calculations of blood pressure blood flow and cardiac function vasoconstriction i e decrease in blood vessel diameter increases svr whereas vasodilation increase in diameter decreases svr units for measuring vascular resistance are dyn s cm pascal seconds per cubic metre pa s m or for ease of deriving it by pressure measured in mmhg and cardiac output measured in l min it can be given in mmhg min l this is numerically equivalent to hybrid resistance units hru also known as wood units in honor of paul wood an early pioneer in the field frequently used by pediatric cardiologists the conversion between these units is formula 1 the basic tenet of calculating resistance is that flow is equal to driving pressure divided by resistance where the systemic vascular resistance can therefore be calculated in units of dyn s cm as where mean arterial pressure is 2 3 of diastolic blood

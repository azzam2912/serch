it is a model of computation equivalent to a turing machine and therefore it can process the same class of formal languages a queue machine can be defined as a six tuple a machine configuration is an ordered pair of its state and queue contents formula 8 where formula 9 denotes the kleene closure of formula 4 the starting configuration on an input string formula 11 is defined as formula 12 and the transition formula 13 from one configuration to the next is defined as where formula 15 is a symbol from the queue alphabet formula 16 is a sequence of queue symbols formula 17 and formula 18 note the first in first out property of the queue in the relation the machine accepts a string formula 19 if after a finite number of transitions the starting configuration evolves to exhaust the string reaching a null string formula 20 or formula 21 we can prove that a queue machine is equivalent to a turing machine by showing that a queue machine can simulate a turing machine and vice versa a turing machine can be simulated by a queue machine that keeps a copy of the turing machine s contents in

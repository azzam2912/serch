it shows the slope i e derivative of a triple smoothed exponential moving average the name trix is from triple exponential trix is calculated with a given n day period as follows like any moving average the triple ema is just a smoothing of price data and therefore is trend following a rising or falling line is an uptrend or downtrend and trix shows the slope of that line so it s positive for a steady uptrend negative for a downtrend and a crossing through zero is a trend change i e a peak or trough in the underlying average the triple smoothed ema is very different from a plain ema in a plain ema the latest few days dominate and the ema follows recent prices quite closely however applying it three times results in weightings spread much more broadly and the weights for the latest few days are in fact smaller than those of days further past the following graph shows the weightings for an n 10 triple ema most recent days at the left note that the distribution s mode will lie with p s weight i e in the graph above p carries the highest weighting an

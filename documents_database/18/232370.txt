for this purpose a hbga has human interfaces for initialization mutation and recombinant crossover as well it may have interfaces for selective evaluation in short a hbga outsources the operations of a typical genetic algorithm to humans among evolutionary genetic systems hbga is the computer based analogue of genetic engineering allan 2005 this table compares systems on lines of human agency one obvious pattern in the table is the division between organic top and computer systems bottom another is the vertical symmetry between autonomous systems top and bottom and human interactive systems middle looking to the right the selector is the agent that decides fitness in the system it determines which variations will reproduce and contribute to the next generation in natural populations and in genetic algorithms these decisions are automatic whereas in typical hbga systems they are made by people the innovator is the agent of genetic change the innovator mutates and recombines the genetic material to produce the variations on which the selector operates in most organic and computer based systems top and bottom innovation is automatic operating without human intervention in hbga the innovators are people hbga is roughly similar to genetic engineering in both systems the

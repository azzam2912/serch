in the late 19th century the study of continued fractions to solve the moment problem by p l chebyshev and then a a markov and t j stieltjes led to the general notion of orthogonal polynomials for given polynomials formula 1 and formula 2 the classical orthogonal polynomials formula 3 are characterized by being solutions of the differential equation with to be determined constants formula 5 there are several more general definitions of orthogonal classical polynomials for example use the term for all polynomials in the askey scheme in general the orthogonal polynomials formula 6 with respect to a weight formula 7 the relations above define formula 6 up to multiplication by a number various normalisations are used to fix the constant e g the classical orthogonal polynomials correspond to the three families of weights the standard normalisation also called standardization is detailed below for formula 12 the jacobi polynomials are given by the formula they are normalised standardized by and satisfy the orthogonality condition the jacobi polynomials are solutions to the differential equation the jacobi polynomials with formula 17 are called the gegenbauer polynomials with parameter formula 18 for formula 19 these are called the legendre polynomials for which

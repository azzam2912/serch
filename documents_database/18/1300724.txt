the terms anti foam agent and defoamer are often used interchangeably commonly used agents are insoluble oils polydimethylsiloxanes and other silicones certain alcohols stearates and glycols the additive is used to prevent formation of foam or is added to break a foam already formed in industrial processes foams pose serious problems they cause defects on surface coatings and prevent the efficient filling of containers a variety of chemical formulae are available to prevent formation of foams generally a defoamer is insoluble in the foaming medium and has surface active properties an essential feature of a defoamer product is a low viscosity and a facility to spread rapidly on foamy surfaces it has affinity to the air liquid surface where it destabilizes the foam lamellas this causes rupture of the air bubbles and breakdown of surface foam entrained air bubbles are agglomerated and the larger bubbles rise to the surface of the bulk liquid more quickly the first defoamers were aimed at breaking down visible foam at the surface kerosene fuel oil and other light oil products were used to break down foam vegetable oils also found some use fatty alcohols c7 c22 were effective but expensive antifoams they were added

tooth nail records released the album on june 17 2016 tim sendra writes since the album is so short and since he does try to be something else it makes for one of the least satisfying of starflyer 59 s many albums andy argyrakis describes the jason martin led act not only returns to tooth nail records but also turns in another textbook batch of its lo fi atmospheres and melodic textures that could fit right in alongside any current band on pitchfork s tastemaking playlists lyrically speaking the guys sound older wiser and at their most reflective sure to be another sticking point for their extremely dedicated fan base and also a thought provoking entry point for the hipster kids coming up jonathan j francesco states the songs probe deep themes of love and nostalgia of regret and the past the vocals are subdued and relaxed and the music is a laid back rock that has just enough energy to propel things along the two make for a haunting mix that is definitely something i am curious to explore more on repeat listens and also to take a second look at the band s past albums bersain beristain says

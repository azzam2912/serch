however they have not been assigned a name according to the slc root system or been classified into any of the existing slc families most atypical slcs are families within the major facilitator superfamily mfs these atypical slcs are plausible secondary active or facilitative transporter proteins that share ancestry with the known solute carriers they are however not named according to the slc root system or classified into any of the existing slc families atmfs are categorised based on their sequence similarity and phylogenetic closeness some atypical slc of mfs type are oca2 cln3 spns1 spns2 spns3 sv2a sv2b sv2c svop svopl mfsd1 mfsd2a mfsd2b mfsd3 mfsd4a mfsd4b mfsd5 mfsd6 mfsd6l mfsd8 mfsd9 mfsd10 mfsd11 mfsd12 mfsd13a mfsd14a mfsd14b unc93a and unc93b1 all these are atypical slcs found within the major facilitator superfamily also tmem104 apc clan oca2 it clan and cln3 having no clan are atypical slcs in humans although most atypical slcs are from the major facilitator superfamily there are exceptions tmem104 apc superfamily oca2 it superfamily and cln3 unknown superfamily

five were flown but the type never reached operational status because of structural concerns raised by a fatal accident the parasol wing of the j 23 had a thick airfoil section a straight leading edge and a trailing edge which curved forwards to elliptical tips in the central region the wing became thinner and the chord decreased in front of the cockpit it was of wooden two spar construction and plywood covered apart from the ailerons these were angled fabric covered and small but slotted to improve their efficiency parallel pairs of airfoil section flying struts ran on each side from the lower fuselage to the wing spars at about one third span over the fuselage a pair of n form cabane struts leaned inwards to meet at the wing s centre like the wing the fuselage and empennage of the j 23 were wooden structures the elliptical cross section fuselage consisted of pre shaped stress bearing plywood panels around a light framework of frames and stringers the pilot s open cockpit was just aft of the trailing edge from where he could see both over the wing and through the narrow gap between wing and fuselage the six cylinder

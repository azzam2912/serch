reptiles smell using the tip of their tongue and a forked tongue allows them to sense from which direction a smell is coming sensing from both sides of the head and following trails based on chemical cues is called tropotaxis it is unclear whether forked tongued reptiles can actually follow trails or if this is just a hypothesis forked tongues have evolved in these squamate reptiles lizards and snakes for various purposes the advantage to having a forked tongue is that more surface area is available for the chemicals to contact and the potential for tropotaxis the tongue is flicked out of the mouth regularly to sample the chemical environment this form of chemical sampling allows these animals to sense non volatile chemicals which cannot be detected by simply using the olfactory system this increased ability to sense chemicals has allowed for heightened abilities to identify prey recognize kin choose mates locate shelters follow trails and more forked tongues have evolved multiple times in squamates it is unclear based on the morphological and genetic evidence where the exact points of change are from a notched tongue to a forked tongue but it is believed that the change has happened two

ltd m ov of britain in 1937 the kt66 is the direct descendant of the harries valve developed by british engineer j owen harries and marketed by the hivac co ltd in 1935 harries is believed to be the first engineer to discover the critical distance effect which maximized the efficiency of a power tetrode by positioning its anode at a distance which is a specific multiple of the screen grid cathode distance this design also minimized interference of secondary emission electrons dislodged from the anode emi engineers cabot bull and sidney rodda improved the harries design with a pair of beam plates connected to the cathode which directed the electron streams into two narrow areas and also acted like a suppressor grid to deflect some secondary electrons back to the anode the beam tetrode design was also undertaken to avoid the patents which the giant philips firm held on power pentodes in europe because this overall design eliminated the tetrode kink in the lower parts of the tetrode s voltage current characteristic curves which sometimes caused tetrode amplifiers to become unstable m ov marketed this tube family as the kt series standing for kinkless tetrode a number of different

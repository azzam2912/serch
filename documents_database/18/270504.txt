this causes the term polar ice cap to be something of a misnomer as the term ice cap itself is applied more narrowly to bodies that are over land and cover less than 50 000 km larger bodies are referred to as ice sheets the composition of the ice will vary for example earth s polar caps are mainly water ice whereas mars s polar ice caps are a mixture of solid carbon dioxide and water ice polar ice caps form because high latitude regions receive less energy in the form of solar radiation from the sun than equatorial regions resulting in lower surface temperatures earth s polar caps have changed dramatically over the last 12 000 years seasonal variations of the ice caps takes place due to varied solar energy absorption as the planet or moon revolves around the sun additionally in geologic time scales the ice caps may grow or shrink due to climate variation if the polar ice caps are too hot then they will melt however if they are too cold they will increase their sizes earth s north pole is covered by floating pack ice sea ice over the arctic ocean portions of the ice

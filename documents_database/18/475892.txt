it is commonly used to calculate maximum holding time for any particular task maximum force decays exponentially due to the amount of energy in the form of oxygen and atp the body is able to supply to the muscles the circulatory systems keeps muscles flooded in nutrients at all times so that muscles have a supply of fuel ready to burn at any given moment a task requiring maximum force burns a large amount of those nutrients at the onset of the task the circulatory system is then unable to replenish the nutrients at a rate fast enough to maintain maximum force for long as a result the maximum force the muscle is capable of producing is limited by the bottleneck in nutrient availability and decreases exponentially imagine a theoretical arm wrestling match with two perfectly matched opponents each exactly as strong as each other they both begin the match by exerting maximum force on each other s hands but very soon their arms get fatigued and the actual force being exerted on each other s hands drops off quickly they are still exerting as much force as they can but their muscles are burning energy faster than can be

they can consist of a single chemical a monopropellant or a mix of two chemicals called bipropellants bipropellants can further be divided into two categories hypergolic propellants which ignite when the fuel and oxidizer make contact and non hypergolic propellants which require an ignition source about 170 different propellants made of liquid fuel have been tested excluding minor changes to a specific propellant such as propellant additives corrosion inhibitors or stabilizers in the u s alone at least 25 different propellant combinations have been flown no completely new propellant has been used for nearly 30 years many factors go into choosing a propellant for a liquid propellant rocket engine the primary factors include ease of operation cost hazards environment and performance konstantin tsiolkovsky proposed the use of liquid propellants in 1903 in his article exploration of outer space by means of rocket devices on march 16 1926 robert h goddard used liquid oxygen lox and gasoline as rocket fuels for his first partially successful liquid propellant rocket launch both propellants are readily available cheap and highly energetic oxygen is a moderate cryogen as air will not liquefy against a liquid oxygen tank so it is possible to store lox briefly

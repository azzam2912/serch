the type and only known species is v campi named by robert long phillip a murry in 1995 at that time the genus was only known from fragmentary bones including osteoderms and vertebrae however since then many more fossils have been found including a pair of nearly complete skeletons discovered in 2002 these finds have shown that members of the genus were bizarre semiaquatic reptiles vancleavea individuals had short snouts with large fang like teeth and long bodies with small limbs they were completely covered with bony plates known as osteoderms which came in several different varieties distributed around the body phylogenetic analyses by professional paleontologists have shown that vancleavea was an archosauriform part of the lineage of reptiles that would lead to archosaurs such as dinosaurs and crocodilians vancleavea lacks certain traits which are present in most other archosauriforms most notably the antorbital mandibular and supratemporal fenestrae which are weight saving holes in the skulls of other taxa however other features clearly support its archosauriform identity including a lack of the presence of osteoderms an ossified laterosphenoid and several adaptations of the femur and ankle bones in 2016 a new genus of archosauriform litorosuchus was described this genus resembled

he is also one of the earliest physicists from asean countries who studied einstein s general relativity theories in depth born in sumatra to israel silaban and regina lumbantoruan in dairi village in sumatra indonesia silaban finished his bachelor s degree in physics from bandung institute of technology indonesia in 1964 in 1967 he went to united states to study general relativity theory at central studies of gravitation at syracuse university under direction of peter bergmann and joshua n goldberg whom were among the authoritative experts in general relativity after the inventor albert einstein here pantur went furthermore studied one of the hottest topics in physics at the time which tried to unify quantum field and general relativity to find quantum gravity theory it is one of einstein s dream which had tried but failed to formalize the fourth interaction in the universe into one single theory called grand unified theory instead of insisting to work on quantum gravity pantur eventually followed the advice of goldberg to change the subject for his dissertation to amputate the principle of general relativity using poincare group to find a physical quantity that is conserved in gravitational radiation these findings confirmed to the big

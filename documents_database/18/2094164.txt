hentriacontanonaene was originally isolated from bacterial isolates from antarctic sea ice cores all isolated bacteria that produced hentriacontanonaene also produced the polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha given its polyunsaturated nature it has been proposed that this molecule is produced as part of a response to maintain optimal membrane fluidity the biosynthesis of this compound was initially identified by its similarity to other known pathways found in bacteria that produce similar long chain hydrocarbons production of monounsaturated and tri unsaturated long chain hydrocarbons in various microbial lineages has been attributed to the oleabcd gene cluster in this pathway two acyl coa or acyl acp are condensed using a non decarboxylative claisen condensation to yield a keto thioester hydrolysis from the enzyme is followed by reduction of the keto group to an alcohol catalyzed by an nadph dependent reductase oled the remaining steps include decarboxylation and dehydration which might be combined as a single decarboxylation elimination step the exact roles of oleb and olec in this pathway are unknown however deletion of olec yielded a strain that produced a mono ketone product without the completed olefin the overall unsaturation of the compound is determined by the acyl

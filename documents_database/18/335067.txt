from the earth this crater is viewed nearly from the edge limiting the amount of detail that can be observed it can also become hidden from sight due to libration or brought into a more favorably viewing position this crater is situated almost due east of the lava flooded crater oken near the uneven mare australe to the northeast of hamilton along the lunar limb is the flooded crater gum less than three crater diameters to the south is the flooded walled plain lyot this is a nearly circular crater although the rim to the north is somewhat straightened it has a well formed edge that has not been noticeably degraded through impact erosion there are terraces along the interior sides particularly along the western edge which is hidden from view from the earth the interior floor is deep and uneven with an impact feature joining the midpoint to the north northwestern inner wall to the east and southeast of this crater is a larger arcing feature that resembles the remains of an old crater hamilton lies concentric with the circle in the surface that would be described by this arc however only the eastern portion of the old rim

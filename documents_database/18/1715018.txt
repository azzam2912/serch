while traveling approximately in a straight line a beam of light can also be rotating or spinning or twisting around its own axis this rotation while not visible to the naked eye can be revealed by the interaction of the light beam with matter there are two distinct forms of rotation of a light beam one involving its polarization and the other its wavefront shape these two forms of rotation are therefore associated with two distinct forms of angular momentum respectively named light spin angular momentum sam and light orbital angular momentum oam the total angular momentum of light or more generally of the electromagnetic field and the other force fields and matter is conserved in time it is well known that light or more generally an electromagnetic wave carries not only energy but also momentum which is a characteristic property of all objects in translational motion the existence of this momentum becomes apparent in the radiation pressure phenomenon in which a light beam transfers its momentum to an absorbing or scattering object generating a mechanical pressure on it in the process less widely known is the fact that light may also carry angular momentum which is a property of

specifically they are the cellular devices used by pathogenic bacteria to secrete their virulence factors mainly of proteins to invade the host cells they can be classified into different types based on their specific structure composition and activity these major differences can be distinguished between gram negative and gram positive bacteria but the classification is by no means clear and complete there are at least eight types specific to gram negative bacteria four to gram positive bacteria while two are common to both generally proteins can be secreted through two different processes one process is a one step mechanism in which proteins from the cytoplasm of bacteria are transported and delivered directly through the cell membrane into the host cell another involves a two step activity in which the proteins are first transported out of the inner cell membrane then deposited in the periplasm and finally through the outer cell membrane into the host cell the general secretion sec involves secretion of unfolded proteins that first remain inside the cells in gram positive bacteria the secreted protein is sent to either the inner membrane or the periplasm but in gram negative bacteria the protein can stay in the cell or

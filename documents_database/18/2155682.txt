mesomanufacturing processes are filling the gap between macro and micromanufacturing processes and overlaps both of them see picture other manufacturing technologies are nanoscale 0 5 mm application of mesomanufacturing include electronics biotechnology optics medicine avionics communications and other areas specific applications include mechanical watches and extremely small motors and bearings lenses for cameras and other micro parts for mobile telephones micro batteries mesoscale fuel cells microscale pumps valves and mixing devices for microchemical reactors biomedical implants microholes for fiber optics medical devices such as stents and valves mini nozzles for high temperature jets mesoscale molds desktop or micro factories and many others manufacturing in the mesoscale can be accomplished by scaling down macroscale manufacturing processes or scaling up nanomanufacturing processes macroscale techniques like mill and lathe machining have been successful used to create features in the range of 25 m meso machine tools mmts for example miniaturized milling machine is a expansion of using traditional macroscale techniques to manufacture mesoscale products with the limitation of self excited vibration of machine tools and fatigue microassembly and micro and mesoscale milling are created to improve the maximum stiffness and dynamic operation of the milling process which improves the overall performance of manufacturing

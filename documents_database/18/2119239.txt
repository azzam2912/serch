the element is used in implementation of low pass active filters modeled from ladder filters the element is usually implemented from a generalized impedance converter gic or gyrator the impedance of a fdnr is formula 1 or formula 2 when s j the definition and application of frequency dependent negative resistors is discussed in temes lapatra chen and wait huelsman korn the technique is attributed to l t bruton if all the impedances including the source and load impedances of a passive ladder filter are divided by s k the transfer function is not changed the effect of this division is to transform resistors into capacitors inductors into resistors and capacitors into fdnrs the purpose of this transformation is to eliminate inductors which are often problematic components this technique is especially useful when all the capacitors are grounded if the technique is applied to capacitors that are not grounded the resulting fdnrs are floating neither end is grounded which in practice can be difficult to stabilize the resulting circuit has two problems practical fdnrs require a dc path to ground the dc transfer function has a value of r r r the transformed ladder filter realizes the dc transfer gain

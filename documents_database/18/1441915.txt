synapsins associate as endogenous substrates to the surface of synaptic vesicles and act as key modulators in neurotransmitter release across the presynaptic membrane of axonal neurons in the nervous system alternative splicing of the syn2 gene results in two transcripts the timp4 gene is located within an intron of this gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction synapsin ii is a member of the synapsin family synapsins encode neuronal phosphoproteins which associate with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles family members are characterized by common protein domains and they are implicated in synaptogenesis and the modulation of neurotransmitter release suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric diseases this member of the synapsin family encodes a neuron specific phosphoprotein that selectively binds to small synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic nerve terminal synapsin ii the collective name for two proteins synapsin iia and synapsin iib with synapsin iia being the larger of the two isoforms their apparent molecular weights are 74 000 and 55 000 da per sds gel electrophoresis synapsin ii along with synapsin i comprise approximately 9 of the proteins in highly purified samples of synaptic vesicles synapsin ii shares common domains within its amino acid sequence with other

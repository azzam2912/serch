the traditional hand method was to corral the birds catch them grab them by the feet five per hand typically and then drop the animals into crates this is a backbreaking job said to be the worst in the poultry industry the chicken harvester machines by contrast use different systems to collect and deposit the chickens onto a conveyor belt which then moves and cage them into crates or containers to transfer them to subsequent processing chicken harvesters can harvest from 18 up to 26 tons of birds per hour about 8000 birds per hour average bird weight 2 5 kg studies have demonstrated that the use of chicken harvesters may be less stressful to the birds compared to being hand wrangled by humans the use of the machines has also been demonstrated to reduce injuries to chickens compared to those that occur from hand wrangling especially in wings and legs in addition while the machine does not reduce the number of man hours required to process the animals it is said to be easier on the workers a british study found that a mechanical catcher reduced some injuries by as much as 50 other studies indicated more modest improvements

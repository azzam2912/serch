in addition to mrna transcripts rna seq can look at different populations of rna to include total rna small rna such as mirna trna and ribosomal profiling rna seq can also be used to determine exon intron boundaries and verify or amend previously annotated 5 and 3 gene boundaries recent advances in rna seq include single cell sequencing and in situ sequencing of fixed tissue prior to rna seq gene expression studies were done with hybridization based microarrays issues with microarrays include cross hybridization artifacts poor quantification of lowly and highly expressed genes and needing to know the sequence a priori because of these technical issues transcriptomics transitioned to sequencing based methods these progressed from sanger sequencing of expressed sequence tag libraries to chemical tag based methods e g serial analysis of gene expression and finally to the current technology next gen sequencing of cdna notably rna seq the general steps to prepare a complementary dna cdna library for sequencing are described below but often vary between platforms when sequencing rna other than mrna the library preparation is modified the cellular rna is selected based on the desired size range for small rna targets such as mirna the rna is

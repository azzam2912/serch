for ansi c each snowball script produces a program file and corresponding header file with c and h extensions the snowball compiler checks the consistency of its script and this check was used to discover a typo in a seminal academic paper by lovins which had remained undetected for 30 years the basic datatypes handled by snowball are strings of characters signed integers and boolean truth values or more simply strings integers and booleans snowball s characters are either 8 bit wide or 16 bit depending on the mode of use in particular both ascii and 16 bit unicode are supported like the snobol programming language the flow of control in snowball is arranged by the implicit use of signals each statement returns a true or false value rather than the explicit use of constructs such as if then and break found in c and many other programming languages the name snowball was chosen as a tribute to the snobol programming language with which it shares the concept of string patterns delivering signals that are used to control the flow of the program the creator of snowball dr martin porter toyed with the idea of calling it strippergram because it

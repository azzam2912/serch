therefore a message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone in a particular group of people one of the security properties of a ring signature is that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of the group members keys was used to produce the signature ring signatures are similar to group signatures but differ in two key ways first there is no way to revoke the anonymity of an individual signature and second any group of users can be used as a group without additional setup ring signatures were invented by ron rivest adi shamir and yael tauman and introduced at asiacrypt in 2001 the name ring signature comes from the ring like structure of the signature algorithm suppose that a group of entities each have public private key pairs p s p s p s party i can compute a ring signature on a message m on input m s p p anyone can check the validity of a ring signature given m and the public keys involved p p if a ring signature is properly computed it should pass the check on the other hand it should be hard for anyone to create a valid

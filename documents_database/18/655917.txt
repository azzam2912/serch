chromosomes contain long strands of dna containing genetic information compared to prokaryotic chromosomes eukaryotic chromosomes are much larger in size and are linear chromosomes eukaryotic chromosomes are also stored in the nucleus of the cell while chromosomes of prokaryotic cells are not stored in a nucleus some of the first scientists to recognize the structures now known as chromosomes were schleiden virchow and b tschli o the term was coined by heinrich wilhelm gottfried von waldeyer hartz referring to the term chromatin was introduced by walther flemming in the 1900s many scientists concluded the same ideas of heredity that gregor mendel had previously scientists also discovered plant and animal cells have a central compartment called the nucleus they soon realized chromosomes were found inside the nucleus and contained different information for many different traits in eukaryotes such as humans roughly 3 2 billion nucleotides are spread out over 23 different chromosomes males have a y chromosome instead of x compared to females each chromosome consists enormously long linear dna molecule associated with proteins that fold and pack the fine thread of dna into a more compact structure the nucleosome consists of a dna double helix bound to an octamer of

it is used to communicate between nodes e g intelligent lighting instruments and a server a lighting desk or general purpose computer running lighting control software art net is a simple implementation of dmx512 a protocol over udp in which lighting control information is conveyed in ip packets typically on a private local area network such as ethernet supported functions include transmitting and receiving lighting data e g fader levels for individual lights positions of movable lights management functions such as detecting nodes updating node control parameters and transmitting timecodes and functions that allow nodes to subscribe to publisher nodes so that for example nodes a and b can subscribe to node c c will unicast information to a and b art net has gone through four versions which are claimed to be interoperable art net i used broadcasts extensively giving a universe limit of approximately 40 art net ii mostly uses unicast packets and addresses 256 universes art net iii released in 2011 addresses issues in managing larger numbers of universes up to 32 768 a further version artnet iv was released in 2016 internally to the protocol it is referred to as version 14 in its simplest implementation

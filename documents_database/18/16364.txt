the ds0 rate and its equivalents e0 in the e carrier system and t0 in the t carrier system form the basis for the digital multiplex transmission hierarchy in telecommunications systems used in north america europe japan and the rest of the world for both the early plesiochronous systems such as t carrier and for modern synchronous systems such as sdh sonet the ds0 rate was introduced to carry a single digitized voice call for a typical phone call the audio sound is digitized at an 8 khz sample rate or 8000 samples per second using 8 bit pulse code modulation for each of the samples this results in a data rate of 64 kbit s because of its fundamental role in carrying a single phone call the ds0 rate forms the basis for the digital multiplex transmission hierarchy in telecommunications systems used in north america to limit the number of wires required between two involved in exchanging voice calls a system was built in which multiple ds0s are multiplexed together on higher capacity circuits in this system twenty four 24 ds0s are multiplexed into a ds1 signal twenty eight 28 ds1s are multiplexed into a ds3 when carried over

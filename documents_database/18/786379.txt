it is an anti microbial peptide secreted by human eccrine sweat glands onto the skin as a part of the innate host defense of the immune system it is also involved in proteolysis dermicidin is a secreted protein that is subsequently processed into mature peptides of distinct biological activities the c terminal peptide is constitutively expressed in sweat and has antibacterial and antifungal activities the n terminal peptide also known as diffusible survival evasion peptide promotes neural cell survival under conditions of severe oxidative stress a glycosylated form of the n terminal peptide may be associated with cachexia muscle wasting in cancer patients the c termial precursor dcd 1l is a 48 residue peptide that shows partial helicity in solution as evidenced by the determination of its solution structure by nmr and cd spectroscopy the full length precursor is processed by undetermined proteases present in human sweat to form several shorter peptides that show variable antimicrobial activity named according to their c terminal triplet of amino acids and their residue length one such active peptide is ssl25 which shows a 2 fold increase in activity against e coli compared to dcd 1l the crystal structure of dermicidin has been solved

softberry reinforces the aceview data by predicting five exons which are seen in four of the five spliceforms of aceview the general structure of the tmem 249 transcript has a large 5 utr followed by exon 1 then a large intron followed by exon 2 a small intron then exon 3 the rest of the protein follows exon 3 with a large intron exon 4 a small intron then exon 5 the 3 utr the primary transcript contains all five exons and produces a protein that is 235 amino acids long transcript 1 and 2 are translated in the 3 to 5 direction while transcripts 3 through 5 are translated in the 5 to 3 direction note that the gene is encoded on the minus strand within the chromosome the only known paralog of human tmem 249 is found in the second isoform of the protein in gorillas of the 217 amino acids aligned between gorilla and human tmem 249 96 are in complete consensus and 99 are conserved tmem 249 orthologs includes all groups of life except birds fungi archea protists and plants the most distant ortholog rozella allomycis was the most diverged species that qualified as an ortholog

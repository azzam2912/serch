excessively rich fuel mixture or incomplete combustion allows a certain amount of fuel to pass down between the pistons and cylinder walls and dilute the engine oil it is more common in situations where fuel is injected at a very high pressure such as in a direct injected diesel engine when a mixture of air and fuel enters the cylinder of an engine it is entirely possible for condensation of fuel to occur on the cooler parts of the cylinders the condensate may wash the lubricating oil from the cylinder walls travel past the piston rings and collect in the oil pan thus increasing wear and also diluting the lubricating oil since the less volatile components of the fuel will have the greatest tendency to condense the degree of crankcase oil dilution is directly related to the end volatility temperatures of the mixture crankcase dilution occurs when the fuel oil from the engine gets into the lube oil of the engine this can be caused by the walls being wetted due to the fuel condensing in the cylinder if the engine is cold or there is an excess amount of cooling around the cylinder the fuel oil will condense and

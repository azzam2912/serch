dvsi in 1967 osamu fujimura mit showed basic advantages of the multi band representation of speech an approximation to voice aperiodicity ieee 1968 this work gave a start to development of the multi band excitation method of speech coding that was patented in 1997 now expired by founders of dvsi as multi band excitation mbe all consequent improvements known as improved multi band excitation imbe advanced multiband excitation ambe ambe and ambe 2 are based on this mbe method ambe is a codebook based vocoder that operates at bitrates of between 2 and 9 6 kbit s and at a sampling rate of 8 khz in 20 ms frames the audio data is usually combined with up to 7 bit s of forward error correction data producing a total rf bandwidth of approximately 2 250 hz compared to 2 700 3 000 hz for an analogue single sideband transmission lost frames can be masked by using the parameters of the previous frame to fill in the gap ambe is used by the inmarsat and iridium satellite telephony systems and certain channels on xm satellite radio and is the speech coder for opensky trunked radio systems ambe is used in d

for n 1 2 or 3 it coincides with the standard measure of length area or volume in general it is also called n dimensional volume n volume or simply volume it is used throughout real analysis in particular to define lebesgue integration sets that can be assigned a lebesgue measure are called lebesgue measurable the measure of the lebesgue measurable set a is here denoted by a henri lebesgue described this measure in the year 1901 followed the next year by his description of the lebesgue integral both were published as part of his dissertation in 1902 the lebesgue measure is often denoted by dx but this should not be confused with the distinct notion of a volume form given a subset formula 1 with the length of interval formula 2 given by formula 3 the lebesgue outer measure formula 4 is defined as the lebesgue measure is defined on the lebesgue algebra which is the collection of all sets formula 6 which satisfy the carath odory criterion which requires that for every formula 7 for any set in the lebesgue algebra its lebesgue measure is given by its lebesgue outer measure formula 9 sets that are not included

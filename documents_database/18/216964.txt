atmospheric physicists attempt to model earth s atmosphere and the atmospheres of the other planets using fluid flow equations chemical models radiation budget and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere as well as how these tie into other systems such as the oceans in order to model weather systems atmospheric physicists employ elements of scattering theory wave propagation models cloud physics statistical mechanics and spatial statistics which are highly mathematical and related to physics it has close links to meteorology and climatology and also covers the design and construction of instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they provide including remote sensing instruments at the dawn of the space age and the introduction of sounding rockets aeronomy became a subdiscipline concerning the upper layers of the atmosphere where dissociation and ionization are important remote sensing is the small or large scale acquisition of information of an object or phenomenon by the use of either recording or real time sensing device s that is not in physical or intimate contact with the object such as by way of aircraft spacecraft satellite buoy or ship in practice remote sensing is the stand off collection through the use of

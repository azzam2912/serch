several morphologically distinct species are recognized initially discovered by glaessner and walter 1975 arumberia was described as a problematic cupped body fossil of an ediacaran soft bodied organism characterized by hollow compressible ribbed bodies composed of flexible tissue brasier 1979 deemed it a pseudofossil arising from turbid water flow in shallow marine or deltaic environments due in part to physical and morphological similarities to flume induced structures previously observed by dzulynski and walton 1965 arumberia appears as a poorly delimited series of fine parallel grooves arising from a single region or point arumberia banksii consists of an array of straight to gently curved parallel to subparallel ridges rugae about 1 3 mm wide and separated by flat to gently concave furrows of 1 7 mm in width relief from ridge top to furrow bottom is less than 1 mm ridge ranges in length from 1 5 cm to 14 5 cm generally the ridges are parallel but they also bifurcate ridges are developed on plane and rippled surfaces there are four species of arumberia that have been formally recognized arumberia banksi has thin siliciclastic biolaminites known as rugose structures including those with subparallel or fanning out series of rugae arumberia

the liquid will change colour when reacting with different chemicals to indicate the presence of certain substances testing with a reagent kit does not indicate the pill is safe while the testing process does show some particular substances are present it may not show a harmful substance that is also present and unaccounted for by the testing process some substances that cause strong colour changes can also mask the presence of other substances that cause weaker colour changes testing kits are distributed on a not for profit basis by dancesafe and commercially reagent testers might show the colour of the desired substance while not showing a different colour for a more dangerous additive for this reason it is essential to use multiple different tests to show all adulterants as reagent testing has become more popular vendors have begun to offer a greater range of tests this increases the likelihood that a substance might have a unique profile of results and makes the tests more useful other reagents are discussed in scientific literature but limited applications mean they may not be sold for consumer testing the zimmermann reagent for benzodiazepines is a good example its use is limited to benzodiazepines and

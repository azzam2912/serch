it is equal to the reciprocal of the focal length of the device high optical power corresponds to short focal length the si unit for optical power is the inverse metre m which is commonly called the dioptre converging lenses have positive optical power while diverging lenses have negative power when a lens is immersed in a refractive medium its optical power and focal length change for two or more thin lenses close together the optical power of the combined lenses is approximately equal to the sum of the optical powers of each lens p p p similarly the optical power of a single lens is roughly equal to the sum of the powers of each surface these approximations are commonly used in optometry an eye that has too much or too little refractive power to focus light onto the retina has a refractive error a myopic eye has too much power so light is focused in front of the retina conversely a hyperopic eye has too little power so when the eye is relaxed light is focused behind the retina an eye with a refractive power in one meridian that is different from the refractive power of the other

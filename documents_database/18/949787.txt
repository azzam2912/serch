in order to make the next leap forward from the current generation of technology scientists and engineers have been developing energy applications of nanotechnology nanotechnology a new field in science is any technology that contains components smaller than 100 nanometers for scale a single virus particle is about 100 nanometers in width an important subfield of nanotechnology related to energy is nanofabrication nanofabrication is the process of designing and creating devices on the nanoscale creating devices smaller than 100 nanometers opens many doors for the development of new ways to capture store and transfer energy the inherent level of control that nanofabrication could give scientists and engineers would be critical in providing the capability of solving many of the problems that the world is facing today related to the current generation of energy technologies people in the fields of science and engineering have already begun developing ways of utilizing nanotechnology for the development of consumer products benefits already observed from the design of these products are an increased efficiency of lighting and heating increased electrical storage capacity and a decrease in the amount of pollution from the use of energy benefits such as these make the investment of capital in

it is an example of a non perturbative vacuum state characterized by non vanishing condensates such as the gluon condensate and the quark condensate in the complete theory which includes quarks the presence of these condensates characterizes the confined phase of quark matter like any relativistic quantum field theory qcd enjoys poincar symmetry including the discrete symmetries cpt each of which is realized apart from these space time symmetries it also has internal symmetries since qcd is an su 3 gauge theory it has local su 3 gauge symmetry since it has many flavours of quarks it has approximate flavour and chiral symmetry this approximation is said to involve the chiral limit of qcd of these chiral symmetries the baryon number symmetry is exact some of the broken symmetries include the axial u 1 symmetry of the flavour group this is broken by the chiral anomaly the presence of instantons implied by this anomaly also breaks cp symmetry in summary the qcd lagrangian has the following symmetries the following classical symmetries are broken in the qcd lagrangian when the hamiltonian of a system or the lagrangian has a certain symmetry but the vacuum does not then one says that spontaneous

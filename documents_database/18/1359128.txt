they are an alternative to the kb mirror for all materials the real part of the refractive index for x rays is close to 1 hence a single conventional lens for x rays has an extremely long focal length for practical lens sizes in addition x rays attenuate as they pass through a material so that conventional lenses for x rays have long been considered impractical the crl gets its reasonably short focal length on the order of meters by using many lenses in series hence reducing the curvatures of each lens to practical levels absorption in the lens is still a challenge however and lenses are usually made from low atomic number materials such as aluminium beryllium or lithium crls were first demonstrated in the mid 1990s by a group of scientists at the esrf they drilled holes in an aluminium block and achieved focusing in two dimensions for x rays a concave lens focuses the x rays because the index of refraction is slightly below unity in a crl of this type the walls between the cylindrical holes act as concave lenses for x rays traveling perpendicular to the axis of the drilled cylinders in contrast for visible

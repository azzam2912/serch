its length measures 2 4 mm the whorls of the protoconch number at least two and are marked with three slender spiral lirations the apex being deeply obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns the junction of the nucleus and the post nuclear whorls is marked by a varix the five whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded they are marked by three equal and subequally spaced spiral grooves which are crossed by slender axial riblets the combination of grooves and ribs giving the whorls a pitted appearance the four raised spaces bounded by the spiral grooves are finely spirally striated the sutures are deeply channeled the periphery of the body whorl is marked by a spiral groove the base of the body whorl is well rounded it is marked by four incised lines on the posterior two thirds which are equally spaced but grow successively weaker the peripheral and first subperipheral channel are equal to those on the spire all are rendered pitted by the slender axial riblets the anterior third is smooth the aperture is broadly oval somewhat effuse anteriorly the posterior angle is acute the outer lip is thin the columella is slender curved somewhat

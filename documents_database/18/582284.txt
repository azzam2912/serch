the lasing medium is enclosed in a tube lined with uranium 235 and subjected to high neutron flux in a nuclear reactor core the fission fragments of the uranium create excited plasma with inverse population of energy levels which then lases other methods e g the he ar laser can use the he n p h reaction the transmutation of helium 3 in a neutron flux as the energy source or employing the energy of the alpha particles this technology may achieve high excitation rates with small laser volumes some example lasing media research in nuclear pumped lasers started in the early 1970s when researchers were unable to produce a laser with a wavelength shorter than 110 nm with the end goal of creating an x ray laser when laser wavelengths become that short the laser requires a huge amount of energy which must also be delivered in an extremely short period of time in 1975 it was estimated by george chapline and lowell wood from the lawrence livermore national laboratory that pumping a 10 kev 0 12 nm laser would require around a watt per atom in a pulse that was 10 seconds x the square of the wavelength

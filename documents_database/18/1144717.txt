it consists of five exons spread out over a distance of 6223 bp the 213 nucleotide open reading frame encodes a 70 amino acid protein alternative splice variants have been identified both encoding the same protein as is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome including one located in the promoter region of the angiotensin ii receptor type 1 gene ribosomes the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis consist of a small 40s subunit and a large 60s subunit together these subunits are composed of 4 rna species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins this gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 60s subunit the protein belongs to the l38e family of ribosomal proteins it is located in the cytoplasm an 18kbp deletion encompassing the entire rpl38 locus underlies the phenotype in the tail short ts mutant mouse in homozygous state ts mice die at around 3 4 days of gestation ts heterozygous embryos undergo an anemia and develop skeletal malformations during the perinatal period 30 of the heterozygotes die the surviving heterozygous ts exhibit great variations of shortened kinked and otherwise malformed tails they also

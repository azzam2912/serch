it was named after stephen o rice the probability density function is where i z is the modified bessel function of the first kind with order zero in the context of rician fading the distribution is often also rewritten using the shape parameter formula 2 defined as the ratio of the power contributions by line of sight path to the remaining multipaths and the scale parameter formula 3 defined as the total power received in all paths the characteristic function of the rice distribution is given as where formula 5 is one of horn s confluent hypergeometric functions with two variables and convergent for all finite values of formula 6 and formula 7 it is given by where is the rising factorial the first few raw moments are and in general the raw moments are given by here l x denotes a laguerre polynomial where formula 18 is the confluent hypergeometric function of the first kind when k is even the raw moments become simple polynomials in and as in the examples above for the case q 1 2 the second central moment the variance is note that formula 21 indicates the square of the laguerre polynomial formula 22 not

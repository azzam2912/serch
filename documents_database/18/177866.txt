repetitive dna was first detected because of its rapid re association kinetics in many organisms a significant fraction of the genomic dna is highly repetitive with over two thirds of the sequence consisting of repetitive elements in humans repetitive elements found in genomes fall into different classes depending on their structure and or the mode of multiplication the disposition of repetitive elements consists either in arrays of tandemly repeated sequences or in repeats dispersed throughout the genome see below debates regarding the potential functions of these elements have been long standing controversial references to junk or selfish dna were put forward early on implying that repetitive dna segments are remainders from past evolution or autonomous self replicating sequences hacking the cell machinery to proliferate originally discovered by barbara mcclintock dispersed repeats have been increasingly recognized as a potential source of genetic variation and regulation together with these regulatory roles a structural role of repeated dna in shaping the 3d folding of genomes has also been proposed this hypothesis is only supported by a limited set of experimental evidence for instance in human mouse and fly several classes of repetitive elements present a high tendency for co localization within the nuclear

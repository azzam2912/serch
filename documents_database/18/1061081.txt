the appleton hartree equation was developed independently by several different scientists including edward victor appleton douglas hartree and german radio physicist h k lassen lassen s work completed two years prior to appleton and five years prior to hartree included a more thorough treatment of collisional plasma but published only in german it has not been widely read in the english speaking world of radio physics further regarding the derivation by appleton it was noted in the historical study by gilmore that wilhelm altar while working with appleton first calculated the dispersion relation in 1926 the dispersion relation can be written as an expression for the frequency squared but it is also common to write it as an expression for the index of refraction the equation is typically given as follows or alternatively with damping term formula 3 and rearranging terms formula 5 complex refractive index formula 6 formula 7 formula 8 formula 9 formula 10 formula 11 electron collision frequency formula 12 radial frequency formula 13 wave frequency cycles per second or hertz formula 14 electron plasma frequency formula 15 electron gyro frequency formula 16 permittivity of free space formula 17 ambient magnetic field strength formula 18 electron charge

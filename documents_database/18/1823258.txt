it is found in forested regions of africa the blue colour of the fruit created by structural coloration is the most intense of any known biological material the plant was originally described from angola in southern africa it has large smooth narrow leaves and pale pink or whitish flowers on a stem about 60 cm high the fruit capsule is about 4 mm in diameter the surface of the pollia fruit has an especially smooth and transparent cuticle which reflects light as a mirror does specular reflection beneath this glossy surface lies a special layer of cells which have an elaborate but unpigmented microstructure whose function is to reflect light within a narrow range of wavelengths this structural coloration is created by bragg reflection from spirally stacked cellulose microfibrils in the walls of these cells the wavelength reflected depends on the height of the stack which varies from cell to cell variability in the stack height allows more overall light to be reflected and this further enhances the glossy appearance but it makes the fruit appear somewhat pixelated in addition to simply reflecting light of a specific wavelength the helicoid structure also causes light of other wavelengths to be modified

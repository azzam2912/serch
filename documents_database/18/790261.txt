the lower portion of the river is badly affected by human activity and stormwater runoff but the upper reaches have a good range of biodiversity the river descends over its course as the river flows down from the adelaide hills over the para fault escarpment it has formed a large alluvial fan on which salisbury is built the river is narrow and winding formerly flooded in heavy rain and rarely reaches its sea outlet over time the river has been widened and levees added to reduce this flooding in the 19th century lack of consistent flow in the river and the absence of an organised water supply system led to the digging of wells the little para refreshes the well s water mostly held in clay sand and gravel layers up to deep the little para reservoir is built in the path of the river for water storage and flood mitigation as the river s catchment is insufficient to fill the reservoir it is mainly used to store water pumped from the river murray periodically water is released from the reservoir into the river enabling refreshing of ground water the river s name is based directly on the kaurna word

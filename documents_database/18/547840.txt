it can be used to carry out the hofmann rearrangement under acidic conditions the syntheses of all aryl hypervalent iodine compounds start from iodobenzene the compound can be prepared by reaction of iodobenzene with a mixture of trifluoroperacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid in a method analogous to the synthesis of it can also be prepared by dissolving diacetoxyiodobenzene a commercially available compound with heating in trifluoroacetic acid it also brings around the conversion of a hydrazone to a diazo compound for example in the diazo thioketone coupling it also converts thioacetals to their parent carbonyl compounds the hofmann rearrangement is a decarbonylation reaction whereby an amide is converted to an amine by way of an isocyanate intermediate it is usually carried out under strongly basic conditions the reaction can also be carried out under mildly acidic conditions by way of the same intermediate using a hypervalent iodine compound in aqueous solution an example published in organic syntheses is the conversion of cyclobutanecarboxamide easily synthesized from cyclobutylcarboxylic acid to cyclobutylamine the primary amine is initially present as its trifluoroacetate salt which can be converted to the hydrochloride salt to facilitate product purification

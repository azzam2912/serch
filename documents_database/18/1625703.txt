the theorem is named after the french mathematician jacques hadamard let f z be a bounded function of z x iy defined on the strip holomorphic in the interior of the strip and continuous on the whole strip if then log m x is a convex function on a b in other words if formula 3 with formula 4 then define formula 6 by thus f z 1 on the edges of the strip the result follows once it is shown that the inequality also holds in the interior of the strip after an affine transformation in the coordinate z it can be assumed that a 0 and b 1 the function tends to 0 as z tends to infinity and satisfies f 1 on the boundary of the strip the maximum modulus principle can therefore be applied to f in the strip so f z 1 since f z tends to f z as n tends to infinity it follows that f z 1 the three line theorem can be used to prove the hadamard three circle theorem for a bounded continuous function formula 9 on an annulus formula 10 holomorphic in the interior indeed applying the theorem to

the term didactic is used because this kind of influence is unidirectional each individual instance of didactic organisation between two connected neurons does not involve a bidirectional transfer of connectivity or response property information between them evidence for didactic organisation in vivo was first discovered through research into synaptic reorganisation in primary visual cortex that compared the results of neuronal recording experiments and computational models however the tendency of spike timing dependent plasticity to separate neurons into teachers and students had previously been predicted in theory based on computational modelling results alone didactic organisation is primarily a consequence of spike timing dependent plasticity because when the neurons within an interconnected network undergo action potentials or spikes at approximately the same time within the order of tens of milliseconds the efferent synaptic connections of neurons that spike early will have their efficacy increased long term potentiation while neurons that spike late will have the efficacy of their efferent synaptic connections decreased long term depression while spike timing dependent plasticity is an essential ingredient for didactic organisation other features of neuronal activity appear to be required for didactic organisation to occur in vivo one of these features is that activity propagated through

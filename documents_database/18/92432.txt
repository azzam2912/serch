they are typically used to set up or configure printed circuit boards such as the motherboards of computers the process of setting a jumper is often called strapping jumper pins points to be connected by the jumper are arranged in groups called jumper blocks each group having at least one pair of contact points an appropriately sized conductive sleeve called a jumper or more technically a shunt jumper is slipped over the pins to complete the circuit jumpers must be electrically conducting they are usually encased in a non conductive block of plastic for convenience this also avoids the risk that an unshielded jumper will accidentally short out something critical particularly if it is dropped on a live circuit when a jumper is placed over two or more jumper pins an electrical connection is made between them and the equipment is thus instructed to activate certain settings accordingly for example with older pc systems cpu speed and voltage settings were often made by setting jumpers some documentation may refer to setting the jumpers to on off closed or open when a jumper is on or covering at least two pins it is a closed jumper when a jumper is off

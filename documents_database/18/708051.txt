topological conjugacy is important in the study of iterated functions and more generally dynamical systems since if the dynamics of one iterated function can be solved then those for any topologically conjugate function follow trivially to illustrate this directly suppose that formula 1 and formula 2 are iterated functions and there exists an formula 3 such that so that and are topologically conjugate then of course one must have and so the iterated systems are conjugate as well here formula 6 denotes function composition formula 7 and formula 8 are continuous functions on topological spaces formula 9 and formula 10 formula 1 being topologically semiconjugate to formula 2 means by definition that formula 3 is a surjection such that formula 14 formula 1 and formula 2 being topologically conjugate means by definition that they are topologically semiconjugate and formula 3 is furthermore injective then bijective and its reciprocal is continuous too i e formula 3 is a homeomorphism further formula 3 is termed a topological conjugation between formula 1 and formula 2 similarly formula 22 on formula 23 and formula 24 on formula 25 are flows with formula 26 and formula 27 as above formula 22 being topologically semiconjugate to

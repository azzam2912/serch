the reactions are theoretically important in that they show that chemical reactions do not have to be dominated by equilibrium thermodynamic behavior in cases where one of the reagents has a visible color periodic color changes can be observed examples of oscillating reactions are the belousov zhabotinsky reaction bz the briggs rauscher reaction and the bray liebhafsky reaction the earliest scientific evidence that such reactions can oscillate was met with extreme scepticism in 1828 g t fechner published a report of oscillations in a chemical system he described an electrochemical cell that produced an oscillating current in 1899 w ostwald observed that the rate of chromium dissolution in acid periodically increased and decreased both of these systems were heterogeneous and it was believed then and through much of the last century that homogeneous oscillating systems were nonexistent while theoretical discussions date back to around 1910 the systematic study of oscillating chemical reactions and of the broader field of non linear chemical dynamics did not become well established until the mid 1970s chemical systems cannot oscillate about a position of final equilibrium because such an oscillation would violate the second law of thermodynamics for a thermodynamic system which is not at

the differential dy is defined by where formula 2 is the derivative of f with respect to x and dx is an additional real variable so that dy is a function of x and dx the notation is such that the equation holds where the derivative is represented in the leibniz notation dy dx and this is consistent with regarding the derivative as the quotient of the differentials one also writes the precise meaning of the variables dy and dx depends on the context of the application and the required level of mathematical rigor the domain of these variables may take on a particular geometrical significance if the differential is regarded as a particular differential form or analytical significance if the differential is regarded as a linear approximation to the increment of a function traditionally the variables dx and dy are considered to be very small infinitesimal and this interpretation is made rigorous in non standard analysis the differential was first introduced via an intuitive or heuristic definition by gottfried wilhelm leibniz who thought of the differential dy as an infinitely small or infinitesimal change in the value y of the function corresponding to an infinitely small change dx in

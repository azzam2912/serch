consider the family formula 7 and assume that every vector field in formula 8 is complete for every formula 9 and every real formula 10 denote by formula 11 the flow of formula 12 at time formula 10 the orbit of the control system formula 1 through a point formula 15 is the subset formula 16 of formula 4 defined by the difference between orbits and attainable sets is that whereas for attainable sets only forward in time motions are allowed both forward and backward motions are permitted for orbits in particular if the family formula 8 is symmetric i e formula 9 if and only if formula 21 then orbits and attainable sets coincide the hypothesis that every vector field of formula 8 is complete simplifies the notations but can be dropped in this case one has to replace flows of vector fields by local versions of them each orbit formula 16 is an immersed submanifold of formula 4 the tangent space to the orbit formula 16 at a point formula 26 is the linear subspace of formula 27 spanned by the vectors formula 28 where formula 29 denotes the pushforward of formula 12 by formula 31 formula 12

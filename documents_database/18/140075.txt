it was first proved by oswald veblen in 1908 a normal function is a class function f from the class ord of ordinal numbers to itself such that it can be shown that if f is normal then f commutes with suprema for any nonempty set a of ordinals indeed if sup a is a successor ordinal then sup a is an element of a and the equality follows from the increasing property of f if sup a is a limit ordinal then the equality follows from the continuous property of f a fixed point of a normal function is an ordinal such that f the fixed point lemma states that the class of fixed points of any normal function is nonempty and in fact is unbounded given any ordinal there exists an ordinal such that and f the continuity of the normal function implies the class of fixed points is closed the supremum of any subset of the class of fixed points is again a fixed point thus the fixed point lemma is equivalent to the statement that the fixed points of a normal function form a closed and unbounded class the first step of the proof is to

much of the interest in cloud forcing relates to its role as a feedback process in the present period of global warming the following equation calculates this change in the radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere the net cloud radiative effect can be decomposed into its longwave and shortwave components this is because net radiation is absorbed solar minus the outgoing longwave radiation shown by the following equations the first term on the right is the shortwave cloud effect q and the second is the longwave effect olr the shortwave cloud effect is calculated by the following equation where s is the solar constant is the albedo with clouds and is the albedo on a clear day the longwave effect is calculated by the next following equation where is the stefan boltzmann constant t is the temperature at the given height and f is the upward flux in clear conditions putting all of these pieces together the final equation becomes all global climate models used for climate change projections include the effects of water vapor and cloud forcing the models include the effects of clouds on both incoming solar and emitted terrestrial radiation clouds increase the global reflection

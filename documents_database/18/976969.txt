he attended royal school dungannon and went on to trinity college dublin in 1884 where he studied engineering and physical science while still an undergraduate student trouton observed a relationship between boiling points and energies of vaporisations which he presented in two short papers he found the change of entropy per mole for vaporisation at a boiling point is constant or expressed mathematically s 10 5 r where r is the ideal gas constant this became known as trouton s rule and despite having some exceptions is used to estimate the enthalpy of vaporisation of liquids whose boiling points are known trouton himself belittled his discovery as it was merely the result of an afternoon s manipulation of data from a book of tables before graduating he also took a leading role in surveying for a railway trouton graduated master of arts and doctor of science in 1884 and was immediately appointed assistant to the professor of experimental physics george fitzgerald they collaborated on many experiments and became good friends fitzgerald s influence can be seen in a lot of trouton s earlier work he was elected a fellow of the royal society in june 1897 his application citation read

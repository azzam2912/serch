it is currently one of the most widely used methods of machine translation in contrast to the simpler direct model of mt transfer mt breaks translation into three steps analysis of the source language text to determine its grammatical structure transfer of the resulting structure to a structure suitable for generating text in the target language and finally generation of this text transfer based mt systems are thus capable of using knowledge of the source and target languages both transfer based and interlingua based machine translation have the same idea to make a translation it is necessary to have an intermediate representation that captures the meaning of the original sentence in order to generate the correct translation in interlingua based mt this intermediate representation must be independent of the languages in question whereas in transfer based mt it has some dependence on the language pair involved the way in which transfer based machine translation systems work varies substantially but in general they follow the same pattern they apply sets of linguistic rules which are defined as correspondences between the structure of the source language and that of the target language the first stage involves analysing the input text for morphology

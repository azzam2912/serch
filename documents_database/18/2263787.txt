magnetic nanoparticles can impart imaging and controlled release capabilities to drug delivery materials such as micelles liposomes and polymers molecular magnets single molecule magnets are a platform that incorporates insoluble toxic drugs into biocompatible carrier materials without adding magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in which adversely affecting potential side effects attributed to iron overdose as well as low drug loading efficiency the drawbacks in conventional magnetic drug delivery methods can be overcame by switching from typical iron oxide nanoparticles to ones based on molecular magnet such as fe salen based anticancer nanomagnet with proven cancer fighting ability however insoluble drugs including fe salen also have some inherent drawbacks such as poor water solubility loss of magnetic activity in solvents and potential cytotoxicity when accumulated in tissues and organs as an alternative synthetic method of magnetic drug delivery a non iron oxide based smart delivery platform has been very recently developed by self assembly of the fe salen drugs into nano cargoes encapsulated by a smart polymer exhibiting bio safe multifunctional magnetic capabilities including mri magnetic field and ph responsive heat releasing hyperthermia effects and controlled release

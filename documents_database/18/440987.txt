this is accomplished through the bronchial challenge test or methacholine challenge in which a subject inhales aerosolized methacholine leading to bronchoconstriction other therapeutic uses are limited by its adverse cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia and hypotension which arise from its function as a cholinomimetic it is highly active at all of the muscarinic receptors but has little effect on the nicotinic receptors methacholine has a charged quaternary amine structure rendering it insoluble to lipid cell membranes clinically this means that it will not cross the blood brain barrier and has poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract it is broken down at a relatively slow rate within the body due to its relative resistance to acetylcholinesterases methacholine has a methyl group which provides selectivity towards muscarinic receptors as compared to nicotinic receptors the quaternary ammonium group is essential for activity the ester makes it susceptible to the enzyme acetylcholine esterase use of methacholine is contraindicated in patients with recent heart attack or stroke uncontrolled hypertension known severe airway disease or an aortic aneurysm it may be used with caution by nursing or pregnant mothers and patients taking certain medications for myasthenia gravis

the center of the incircle is a triangle center called the triangle s incenter an excircle or escribed circle of the triangle is a circle lying outside the triangle tangent to one of its sides and tangent to the extensions of the other two every triangle has three distinct excircles each tangent to one of the triangle s sides the center of the incircle called the incenter can be found as the intersection of the three internal angle bisectors the center of an excircle is the intersection of the internal bisector of one angle at vertex a for example and the external bisectors of the other two the center of this excircle is called the excenter relative to the vertex a or the excenter of a because the internal bisector of an angle is perpendicular to its external bisector it follows that the center of the incircle together with the three excircle centers form an orthocentric system all regular polygons have incircles tangent to all sides but not all polygons do those that do are tangential polygons see also tangent lines to circles suppose formula 1 has an incircle with radius r and center i let a be the length

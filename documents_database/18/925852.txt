the third and higher moments as used in the skewness and kurtosis are examples of hos whereas the first and second moments as used in the arithmetic mean first and variance second are examples of low order statistics hos are particularly used in estimation of shape parameters such as skewness and kurtosis as when measuring the deviation of a distribution from the normal distribution on the other hand due to the higher powers hos are significantly less robust than lower order statistics in statistical theory one long established approach to higher order statistics for univariate and multivariate distributions is through the use of cumulants and joint cumulants in time series analysis the extension of these is to higher order spectra for example the bispectrum and trispectrum an alternative to the use of hos and higher moments is to instead use l moments which are linear statistics linear combinations of order statistics and thus more robust than hos

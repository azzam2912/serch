more specifically sur proteins are subunits of the inward rectifier potassium ion channels k6 x 6 1 and 6 2 the association of four k6 x and four sur subunits form an ion conducting channel commonly referred to as the k channel three forms of the sulfonylurea receptor are known sur1 encoded by the abcc8 gene and sur2a and sur2b which are splice variants arising from a single abcc9 gene the primary function of the sulfonylurea receptor is to sense intracellular levels of the nucleotides atp and adp and in response facilitate the open or closing its associated k6 x potassium channel hence the k channel monitors the energy balance within the cell depending on the tissue in which the k channel is expressed altering the membrane potential can trigger a variety of downstream events for example in pancreatic beta cells high levels of glucose lead to increased production of atp which in turn binds to the k channel resulting in channel closure the relative depolarization decrease in membrane hyperpolarization in turn opens voltage dependent calcium channels increasing intracellular calcium concentrations which triggers exocytosis of insulin under cerebral ischemic conditions sur1 the regulatory subunit of the k and the nc

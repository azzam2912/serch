a namespace ensures that all the identifiers within it have unique names so that they can be easily identified prominent examples include namespaces are commonly structured as hierarchies to allow reuse of names in different contexts as an analogy consider a system of naming of people where each person has a proper name as well as a family name shared with their relatives if the first names of family members are unique only within each family then each person can be uniquely identified by the combination of first name and family name there is only one jane doe though there may be many janes within the namespace of the doe family just jane suffices to unambiguously designate this person while within the global namespace of all people the full name must be used in a similar way hierarchical file systems organize files in directories each directory is a separate namespace so that the directories letters and invoices may both contain a file to jane in computer programming namespaces are typically employed for the purpose of grouping symbols and identifiers around a particular functionality and to avoid name collisions between multiple identifiers that share the same name in networking the domain

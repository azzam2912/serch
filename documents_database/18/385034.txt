conotoxins have a variety of mechanisms of actions most of which have not been determined however it appears that many of these peptides modulate the activity of ion channels over the last few decades conotoxins have been the subject of pharmacological interest the ld of conotoxin is 50 ng kg conotoxins are hypervariable even within the same species they do not act within a body where they are produced endogenously but act on other organisms therefore conotoxins genes experience less selection against mutations like gene duplication and nonsynonymous substitution and mutations remain in the genome longer allowing more time for potentially beneficial novel functions to arise variability in conotoxin components reduces the likelihood that prey organisms will develop resistance thus cone snails are under constant selective pressure to maintain polymorphism in these genes because failing to evolve and adapt will lead to extinction red queen hypothesis types of conotoxins also differ in the number and pattern of disulfide bonds the disulfide bonding network as well as specific amino acids in inter cysteine loops provide the specificity of conotoxins the number of conotoxins whose activities have been determined so far is five and they are called the alpha delta kappa mu

new tasks can interrupt already started ones before they finish instead of waiting for them to end as a result a computer executes segments of multiple tasks in an interleaved manner while the tasks share common processing resources such as central processing units cpus and main memory multitasking automatically interrupts the running program saving its state partial results memory contents and computer register contents and loading the saved state of another program and transferring control to it this context switch may be initiated at fixed time intervals pre emptive multitasking or the running program may be coded to signal to the supervisory software when it can be interrupted cooperative multitasking multitasking does not require parallel execution of multiple tasks at exactly the same time instead it allows more than one task to advance over a given period of time even on multiprocessor computers multitasking allows many more tasks to be run than there are cpus multitasking is a common feature of computer operating systems it allows more efficient use of the computer hardware where a program is waiting for some external event such as a user input or an input output transfer with a peripheral to complete the central processor

the jumping jupiter scenario was proposed by ramon brasser alessandro morbidelli rodney gomes kleomenis tsiganis and harold levison after their studies revealed that the smooth divergent migration of jupiter and saturn resulted in an inner solar system significantly different from the current solar system during this migration secular resonances swept through the inner solar system exciting the orbits of the terrestrial planets and the asteroids leaving the planets orbits too eccentric and the asteroid belt with too many high inclination objects the jumps in the semi major axes of jupiter and saturn described in the jumping jupiter scenario can allow these resonances to quickly cross the inner solar system without altering orbits excessively although the terrestrial planets remain sensitive to its passage the jumping jupiter scenario also results in a number of other differences with the original nice model the fraction of lunar impactors from the core of the asteroid belt during the late heavy bombardment is significantly reduced most of the jupiter trojans are captured during jupiter s encounters with the ice giant as are jupiter s irregular satellites in the jumping jupiter scenario the likelihood of preserving four giant planets on orbits resembling their current ones appears to

the transformational satellite communications system network currently provides connectivity for all communication through space assets the combat information transport system and theater deployable communications provide terrestrial connectivity for theatre based operations the airborne network is engineered to utilize all airborne assets to connect with space and surface networks building a seamless communications platform across all domains the capabilities identified by this type of system are vastly beyond that of our current military this system will enable the air force to provide a transportable network flexible enough to communicate with any air space or ground asset in the area the network will provide a beyond line of sight los communications infrastructure that can be packed up and moved in and out of the designated battlespace enabling the military to have a reliable and secure communications network that extends globally the network is designed to be flexible enough to provide the right communication and network packages for a specific region mission or technology operationally the an is designed to be self forming self organizing and self generating with nodes joining and leaving the network as they enter and exit a specific region the network consists of dedicated tactical links wideband air to

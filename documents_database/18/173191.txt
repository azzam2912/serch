as the light travels through multiple gas clouds with different redshifts multiple absorption lines are formed the lyman alpha forest was first discovered in 1970 by astronomer roger lynds in an observation of the quasar 4c 05 34 quasar 4c 05 34 was the farthest object observed to that date and lynds noted an unusually large number of absorption lines in its spectrum he suggested that most of the absorption lines were all due to the same lyman alpha transition follow up observations by john bahcall and samuel goldsmith confirmed the presence of the unusual absorption lines though they were less conclusive about the origin of the lines subsequently the spectra of many other high redshift quasars were observed to have the same system of narrow absorption lines lynds was the first to describe them as the lyman alpha forest jan oort argued that the absorption features are due not to any physical interactions within the quasars themselves but to absorption inside clouds of intergalactic gas in superclusters for a neutral hydrogen atom spectral lines are formed when an electron transitions between energy levels the lyman series of spectral lines are produced by electrons transitioning between the ground state and

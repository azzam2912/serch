they also include copper and sometimes titanium alnico alloys are ferromagnetic and are used to make permanent magnets before the development of rare earth magnets in the 1970s they were the strongest type of permanent magnet other trade names for alloys in this family are alni alcomax hycomax columax and ticonal the composition of alnico alloys is typically 8 12 al 15 26 ni 5 24 co up to 6 cu up to 1 ti and the balance is fe the development of alnico began in 1931 when t mishima in japan discovered that an alloy of iron nickel and aluminum had a coercivity of double that of the best magnet steels of the time alnico alloys can be magnetised to produce strong magnetic fields and has a high coercivity resistance to demagnetization thus making strong permanent magnets of the more commonly available magnets only rare earth magnets such as neodymium and samarium cobalt are stronger alnico magnets produce magnetic field strength at their poles as high as 1500 gauss 0 15 tesla or about 3000 times the strength of earth s magnetic field some brands of alnico are isotropic and can be efficiently magnetized in any direction other types

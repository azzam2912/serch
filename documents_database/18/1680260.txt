more formally the reflection principle refers to a lemma concerning the distribution of the supremum of the wiener process or brownian motion the result relates the distribution of the supremum of brownian motion up to time t to the distribution of the process at time t it is a corollary of the strong markov property of brownian motion if formula 1 is a wiener process and formula 2 is a threshold also called a crossing point then the lemma states assuming formula 4 due to continuity of wiener process each path one sampled realization of wiener process on 0 t which ends up at or above value level threshold crossing point a the time t formula 5 must have crossed a threshold a formula 6 at some earlier time formula 7 for the first time it can cross level a multiple times on the interval 0 t we take the earliest for every such path you can define another sampled path of wiener process w on 0 t that is reflected or vertically flipped on the sub interval formula 8 symmetrically around level a from the original path formula 9 that reflected path also reached value formula 10 on the

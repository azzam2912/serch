tin is a silvery metal that characteristically has a faint yellow hue tin like indium is soft enough to be cut without much force when a bar of tin is bent the so called tin cry can be heard as a result of sliding tin crystals reforming this trait is shared by indium cadmium and frozen mercury pure tin after solidifying keeps a mirror like appearance similar to most metals however in most tin alloys such as pewter the metal solidifies with a dull gray color tin is a post transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table of elements it is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite which contains stannic oxide sno tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14 germanium and lead and has two main oxidation states 2 and the slightly more stable 4 tin is the 49th most abundant element on earth and has with 10 stable isotopes the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table thanks to its magic number of protons it has two main allotropes at room temperature the stable allotrope is tin a silvery white malleable metal but at low temperatures it transforms into

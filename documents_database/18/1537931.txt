this suffices to show the valiant vazirani theorem there exists a randomized polynomial time reduction from the satisfiability problem for boolean formulas to the problem of detecting whether a boolean formula has a unique solution here every coordinate of the solution space gets assigned a random weight in a certain range of integers and the property is that with non negligible probability there is exactly one element in the solution space that has minimum weight this can be used to obtain a randomized parallel algorithm for the maximum matching problem stronger isolation lemmas have been introduced in the literature to fit different needs in various settings for example the isolation lemma of has similar guarantees as that of mulmuley et al but it uses fewer random bits in the context of the exponential time hypothesis prove an isolation lemma for k cnf formulas noam ta shma gives an isolation lemma with slightly stronger parameters and gives non trivial results even when the size of the weight domain is smaller than the number of variables it is remarkable that the lemma assumes nothing about the nature of the family formula 3 for instance formula 3 may include all formula 15 nonempty

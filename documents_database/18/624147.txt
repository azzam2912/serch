the reciprocal rule can be used to show that the power rule holds for negative exponents if it has already been established for positive exponents also one can readily deduce the quotient rule from the reciprocal rule and the product rule the reciprocal rule states that if f is differentiable at a point x and f x 0 then g x 1 f x is also differentiable at x and this proof relies on the premise that formula 2 is differentiable at formula 3 and on the theorem that formula 2 is then also necessarily continuous there applying the definition of the derivative of formula 5 at formula 6 with formula 7 gives the limit of this product exists and is equal to the product of the existing limits of its factors because of the differentiability of formula 2 at formula 6 the first limit equals formula 12 and because of formula 13 and the continuity of formula 2 at formula 6 the second limit thus yielding it may be argued that since an application of the product rule says that and this may be algebraically rearranged to say however this fails to prove that 1 f is differentiable at

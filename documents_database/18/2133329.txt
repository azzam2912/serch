5 s hete see 5 hete to its 5 keto analog 5 oxo eicosatetraenoic acid i e 5 oxo 6 s 8 z 11 z 14 z eicosatetraenoic acid or 5 oxo ete it also acts in the reverse direction metabolizing 5 oxo ete to 5 s hete since 5 oxo ete is 30 100 fold more potent than 5 s hete in stimulating various cell types 5 hedh is regarded as a regulator and promoter of 5 s hete s and thereby 5 lox s influences on cell function although 5 hedh has been evaluated in a wide range of intact cells and in crude microsome preparations it has not yet been evaluated for its structure for its gene of in pure form furthermore most studies on it have been conducted in human tissues the substrate specificity of 5 hedh has been evaluated in a variety of intact cells and in crude microsome preparations isolated from cultured human blood monocytes differentiated into macrophages these studies indicate that the enzyme efficiently oxidizes long chain unsaturated fatty acids possessing a hydroxy residue at carbon 5 and a trans double bound at carbon 6 to their corresponding 5 oxo products it is

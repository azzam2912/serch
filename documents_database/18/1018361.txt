they are an important class of ribozymes because they catalyze the assembly of rna fragments into phosphodiester rna polymers a reaction required of all extant nucleic acid polymerases and thought to be required for any self replicating molecule ideas that the origin of life may have involved the first self replicating molecules being ribozymes are called rna world hypotheses ligase ribozymes may have been part of such a pre biotic rna world in order to copy rna fragments or monomers individual building blocks that have 5 triphosphates must be ligated together this is true for modern protein based polymerases and is also the most likely mechanism by which a ribozyme self replicase in an rna world might function yet no one has found a natural ribozyme that can perform this reaction rna in vitro evolution or selex enables the artificial evolution and selection of rna molecules that possess a desired property such as binding affinity for a particular ligand or an activity such as that of an enzyme or catalyst the first such selections involved isolation of various aptamers that bind to small molecules the first catalytic rnas produced by in vitro evolution were rna ligases catalytic rnas that join

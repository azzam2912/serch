when producing a dish made of ham or bacon and eggs the pig provides the ham or bacon which requires his or her sacrifice and the chicken provides the eggs which are not difficult to produce thus the pig is really committed in that dish while the chicken is only involved yet both are needed to produce the dish the fable of the chicken and the pig is used to illustrate the differing levels of project stakeholders involved in a project the basic fable runs sometimes the story is presented as a riddle the fable has been used mostly in contexts where a strong team is needed for success like in sports or in agile software development the fable was referenced to define two types of project members by the scrum agile management system pigs who are totally committed to the project and accountable for its outcome and chickens who consult on the project and are informed of its progress this analogy is based upon the pig being able to provide bacon a sacrificial offering for which the pig must die in order to provide versus a chicken which provides eggs non sacrificial for a scrum project the development team

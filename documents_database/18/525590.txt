it occurs in nature as the dark indigo blue mineral covellite it is a moderate conductor of electricity a black colloidal precipitate of cus is formed when hydrogen sulfide hs is bubbled through solutions of cu ii salts it is one of a number of binary compounds of copper and sulfur see copper sulfide for an overview of this subject and has attracted interest because of its potential uses in catalysis and photovoltaics copper monosulfide can be prepared by passing hydrogen sulfide gas into a solution of copper ii salt alternatively it can be prepared by melting an excess of sulfur with copper i sulfide or by precipitation with hydrogen sulfide from a solution of anhydrous copper ii chloride in anhydrous ethanol the reaction of copper with molten sulfur followed by boiling sodium hydroxide and the reaction of sodium sulfide with aqueous copper sulfate will also produce copper sulfide copper sulfide crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system and this is the form of the mineral covellite there is also an amorphous high pressure form which on the basis of the raman spectrum has been described as having a distorted covellite structure an amorphous room temperature semiconducting form produced by the

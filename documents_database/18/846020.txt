if formula 4 denotes the n th prime gap then andrica s conjecture can also be rewritten as imran ghory has used data on the largest prime gaps to confirm the conjecture for formula 2 up to 1 3002 10 using a table of maximal gaps and the above gap inequality the confirmation value can be extended exhaustively to 4 10 the discrete function formula 7 is plotted in the figures opposite the high water marks for formula 8 occur for n 1 2 and 4 with a 0 670873 with no larger value among the first 10 primes since the andrica function decreases asymptotically as n increases a prime gap of ever increasing size is needed to make the difference large as n becomes large it therefore seems highly likely the conjecture is true although this has not yet been proven as a generalization of andrica s conjecture the following equation has been considered where formula 10 is the n th prime and x can be any positive number the largest possible solution x is easily seen to occur for formula 11 when x 1 the smallest solution x is conjectured to be x 0 567148 which occurs for

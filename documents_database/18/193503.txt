white sugar and some brown sugar produced from sugar cane may still use bone char in the refining process by a few sugar cane refiners for this reason white sugar from sugar cane may not be vegan beet sugar has never been processed with bone char and is vegan the refining completely removes the molasses and makes the white sugar actually sucrose with a purity higher than 99 7 whose molecular formula is cho the origin of the sugar thus produced is therefore chemically indistinguishable sugar cane or sugar beet it is possible however to identify its origin through a carbon 13 analysis similar to radiocarbon dating used in archeology from a chemical and nutritional point of view white sugar does not contain in comparison to brown sugar some minerals such as calcium potassium iron and magnesium present in molasses even if the quantities contained in brown sugar are not significant the only detectable differences are therefore the white color and the less intense flavor

this result was proved by j h c whitehead in two landmark papers from 1949 and provides a justification for working with the concept of a cw complex that he introduced there it is a model result of algebraic topology in which the behavior of certain algebraic invariants in this case homotopy groups determines a topological property of a mapping in more detail let x and y be topological spaces given a continuous mapping and a point x in x consider for any n 1 the induced homomorphism where x x denotes the n th homotopy group of x with base point x for n 0 x just means the set of path components of x a map f is a weak homotopy equivalence if the function is bijective and the homomorphisms f are bijective for all x in x and all n 1 for x and y path connected the first condition is automatic and it suffices to state the second condition for a single point x in x the whitehead theorem states that a weak homotopy equivalence from one cw complex to another is a homotopy equivalence that is the map f x y has a homotopy inverse

as the unicode glossary says a character that would not have been encoded except for compatibility and round trip convertibility with other standards although compatibility is used in names it is not marked as a property however the definition is more complicated than the glossary reveals one of the properties given to characters by the unicode consortium is the characters decomposition or compatibility decomposition over five thousand characters do have a compatibility decomposition mapping that compatibility character to one or more other ucs characters by setting a character s decomposition property unicode establishes that character as a compatibility character the reasons for these compatibility designations are varied and are discussed in further detail below the term decomposition sometimes confuses because a character s decomposition can in some cases be a singleton in these cases the decomposition of one character is simply another approximately but not canonically equivalent character the compatibility decomposition property for the 5 402 unicode compatibility characters includes a keyword that divides the compatibility characters into 17 logical groups those characters with a compatibility decomposition but without a keyword are termed canonical decomposable characters and those characters are not compatibility characters keywords for compatibility decomposable characters include and

mercury is the largest celestial body of this type in the solar system as the other terrestrial planets are silicate planets but larger iron rich exoplanets may exist iron is the sixth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen helium oxygen carbon and neon there are also theorized helium planets and carbon planets iron rich planets may be the remnants of normal metal silicate rocky planets whose rocky mantles were stripped away by giant impacts some are thought to consist of diamond fields current planet formation models predict iron rich planets will form in close in orbits or orbiting massive stars where the protoplanetary disk presumably consists of iron rich material iron rich planets are smaller and more dense than other types of planets of comparable mass such planets would have no plate tectonics or strong magnetic field as they cool rapidly after formation these planets are not like earth since water and iron are unstable over geological timescales wet iron planets in the goldilocks zone may be covered by lakes of iron carbonyl and other exotic volatiles rather than water in science fiction such a planet has been called a cannonball an extrasolar planet candidates that

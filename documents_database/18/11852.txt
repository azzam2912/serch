at its core systems engineering utilizes systems thinking principles to organize this body of knowledge the individual outcome of such efforts an engineered system can be defined as a combination of components that work in synergy to collectively perform a useful function issues such as requirements engineering reliability logistics coordination of different teams testing and evaluation maintainability and many other disciplines necessary for successful system design development implementation and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects systems engineering deals with work processes optimization methods and risk management tools in such projects it overlaps technical and human centered disciplines such as industrial engineering mechanical engineering manufacturing engineering control engineering software engineering electrical engineering cybernetics organizational studies civil engineering and project management systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered and integrated into a whole the systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process a manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time the systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved and identifying the most probable or highest

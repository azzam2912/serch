for example the star formation rate of the milky way galaxy is approximately 3 m yr however starburst galaxies can experience star formation rates that are more than a factor of 100 times greater in a starburst galaxy the rate of star formation is so large that the galaxy will consume all of its gas reservoir from which the stars are forming on a timescale much shorter than the age of the galaxy as such the starburst nature of a galaxy is a phase and one that typically occupies a brief period of a galaxy s evolution the majority of starburst galaxies are in the midst of a merger or close encounter with another galaxy starburst galaxies include m82 ngc 4038 ngc 4039 the antennae galaxies and ic 10 starburst galaxies are defined by these three interrelated factors commonly used definitions include mergers and tidal interactions between gas rich galaxies play a large role in driving starbursts galaxies in the midst of a starburst frequently show tidal tails an indication of a close encounter with another galaxy or are in the midst of a merger interactions between galaxies that do not merge can trigger unstable rotation modes such as the

prior to the widespread use of electric motors small enough to be connected directly to each piece of machinery line shafting was used to distribute power from a large central power source to machinery throughout a workshop or an industrial complex the central power source could be a water wheel turbine windmill animal power or a steam engine power was distributed from the shaft to the machinery by a system of belts pulleys and gears known as millwork a typical line shaft would be suspended from the ceiling of one area and would run the length of that area one pulley on the shaft would receive the power from a parent line shaft elsewhere in the building the other pulleys would supply power to pulleys on each individual machine or to subsequent line shafts in manufacturing where there were a large number of machines performing the same tasks the design of the system was fairly regular and repeated in other applications such as machine and wood shops where there was a variety of machines with different orientations and power requirements the system would appear erratic and inconsistent with many different shafting directions and pulley sizes shafts were usually horizontal and

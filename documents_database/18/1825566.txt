its main purpose is to export power from the chandrapur super thermal power station to the southern region of the indian national power grid the chandrapur back to back hvdc station is owned by power grid corporation of india the converter station consists of two independent poles each with a nominal power transmission rating of 500 mw both poles were built by gec alstom between 1993 and 1997 and have nominal dc voltage and current ratings of 205 kv 2475 a the converter station is located from the eastern terminal of the chandrapur padghe hvdc transmission system the close proximity of the two converter stations meant that the control systems needed to be carefully coordinated a task made more challenging by the fact that the two stations were built by different manufacturers to address this problem a series of joint simulation studies involving the control equipment from both converter stations connected to a common simulator was performed on 31 december 2013 the northern eastern and western grids were synchronised with the southern regional grid creating a single synchronous ac grid over the whole of india as a result the converter station is no longer required for its original purpose of

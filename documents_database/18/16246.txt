some switches can also forward data at the network layer layer 3 by additionally incorporating routing functionality such switches are commonly known as layer 3 switches or multilayer switches switches for ethernet are the most common form of network switch the first ethernet switch was introduced by kalpana in 1990 switches also exist for other types of networks including fibre channel asynchronous transfer mode and infiniband unlike less advanced repeater hubs which broadcast the same data out of each of its ports and let the devices decide what data they need a network switch forwards data only to the devices that need to receive it a switch is a device in a computer network that connects other devices together multiple data cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices switches manage the flow of data across a network by transmitting a received network packet only to the one or more devices for which the packet is intended each networked device connected to a switch can be identified by its network address allowing the switch to direct the flow of traffic maximizing the security and efficiency of the network a switch is more intelligent than an

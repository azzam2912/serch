chain manufacturers began to include this feature in 1971 after the application was invented by joseph montano while working for whitney chain of hartford connecticut o rings were included as a way to improve lubrication to the links of power transmission chains a service that is vitally important to extending their working life these rubber fixtures form a barrier that holds factory applied lubricating grease inside the pin and bushing wear areas further the rubber o rings prevent dirt and other contaminants from entering the chain linkages where such particles would otherwise cause significant wear o ring chains are most notably used in motorcycles one of the most demanding applications for a metal chain high rpm and heavy loads require bulky chains but such engineering increases the effect of friction compared to lighter chains so lubrication plays a vital role here but the high rpm also makes it very difficult to keep lubrication inside and on the chain additionally motorcycle chains are exposed to a large volume of contaminants and particles and must be protected o rings as described above fit this application perfectly

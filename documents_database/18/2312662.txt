unlike hyperbolic comets they have not been seen out gassing light elements and therefore have no cometary coma most of these objects will only be weakly hyperbolic and will not be of interstellar origin so far all hyperbolic asteroids discovered have later displayed cometary behavior by either outgassing or demonstrating motion based on solar radiation pressure oumuamua had the motion of a comet but was never seen outgassing and thus it is listed as a hyperbolic asteroid by the jpl small body database recent hyperbolic comets that were originally listed as hyperbolic asteroids include c 2017 u7 c 2018 c2 lemmon and c 2018 f4 panstarrs asteroids can become ejected or in a highly eccentric orbit around the sun by being ejected by planets like jupiter just because an orbit solution looks unbound at an epoch when the object is near perihelion closest approach to the sun does not mean the orbit will be unbound when beyond the planets

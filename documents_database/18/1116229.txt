it can be used on materials for which a press setup would be prohibitively large or require an unreasonably high pressure and is generally much cheaper than building a large enough and sufficiently high pressure press on the other hand it is unavoidably an individual job production process producing one product at a time and with a long setup ti there are various approaches one is to place metal plate over a die with the intervening space evacuated by a vacuum pump place the whole assembly underwater and detonate a charge at an appropriate distance from the plate for complicated shapes a segmented die can be used to produce in a single operation a shape that would require many manufacturing steps or to be manufactured in parts and welded together with an accompanying loss of strength at the welds there is often some degree of work hardening from the explosive forming process particularly in mild steel tooling can be made out of fiberglass for short run applications out of concrete for large parts at medium pressures or out of ductile iron for high pressure work ideally the tooling should have higher yield strength than the material that is being formed

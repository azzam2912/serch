it entered service in 1983 in the 1950s the royal navy was equipped with british designed and built mk 30 air dropped torpedoes these were passive homing weapons which relied on detecting the noise from submarine targets however as submarine noise levels decreased these weapons became ineffective a design for a british mk 31 torpedo which would have used active echo location sonar failed to receive government approval for production us mk 44 torpedoes were purchased for the royal navy in the 1960s to fill this role and later replaced by us mk 46 torpedoes a desire to not be dependent on us torpedo purchases led to a research programme starting in 1964 to develop a british torpedo initially designated naval and air staff requirement nasr 7511 it was much later in the late 1970s designated the sting ray torpedo design studies in the mid 1960s proposed that a tank of polyethylene oxide be carried behind the warhead this polymer would be exuded at the nose to reduce the drag coefficient experiments using buoyancy propelled torpedoes in 1969 had shown reductions in the drag coefficient up to 25 however by 1969 this scheme had been rejected in favour of carrying

the beginning of the 13th century marks the end of the prehistory of lithuania from this point on the history of lithuania is recorded in chronicles treaties and other written documents in 1219 21 lithuanian dukes signed a peace treaty with galicia volhynia this event is widely accepted as the first proof that the baltic tribes were uniting and consolidating despite continuous warfare with two christian orders the livonian order and the teutonic knights the grand duchy of lithuania was established and gained some control over the lands of black ruthenia polatsk minsk and other territories east of modern day lithuania that had become weak and vulnerable after the collapse of kievan rus the first ruler to hold the title of grand duke was mindaugas traditionally he is considered the founder of the state the one who united the baltic tribes and established the duchy some scholars however challenge this perception arguing that an organized state existed before mindaugas possibly as early as 1183 after quelling an internal war with his nephews mindaugas was baptized in 1251 and was crowned as king of lithuania in 1253 in 1261 he broke the peace with the livonian order perhaps even renouncing christianity

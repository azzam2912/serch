hence high content screening is a type of phenotypic screen conducted in cells involving the analysis of whole cells or components of cells with simultaneous readout of several parameters hcs is related to high throughput screening hts in which thousands of compounds are tested in parallel for their activity in one or more biological assays but involves assays of more complex cellular phenotypes as outputs phenotypic changes may include increases or decreases in the production of cellular products such as proteins and or changes in the morphology visual appearance of the cell hence hca typically involves automated microscopy and image analysis unlike high content analysis high content screening implies a level of throughput which is why the term screening differentiates hcs from hca which may be high in content but low in throughput in high content screening cells are first incubated with the substance and after a period of time structures and molecular components of the cells are analyzed the most common analysis involves labeling proteins with fluorescent tags and finally changes in cell phenotype are measured using automated image analysis through the use of fluorescent tags with different absorption and emission maxima it is possible to measure several different

this compound was first developed as a substitute agent for cocaine since this time a large number of substituted phenylpiperidine derivatives have been discovered hybridizing the basic nocaine structure with that of other similar molecules such as methylphenidate meperidine and modafinil to create a large family of derivatives with a range of activity profiles and potential applications this is a significant field of research with much work ongoing and dozens of novel compounds have been developed although none have yet come to market the nocaine family includes a diverse assortment of piperidine based cocaine mimics the parent compound nocaine was developed in an attempt to develop a substitute drug for cocaine for the treatment of addiction and was found to substitute for cocaine in animal models while having significantly less abuse potential itself although kozikowski reported compound with chlorine in 1998 plain phenyl was reported earlier than this by plati although novel ways to produce these compound exist background stems from arecoline chemistry e g paxil and femoxetine also from this arena of cns chemicals these serotonin based antidepressants in case of paxil n normethyl also some acetylcholinergic according to texts kozikowski made some phenylpiperidine based bridged fused analogs of

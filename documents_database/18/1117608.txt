the purpose of the puncture is to restore a person s ability to speak after the vocal cords have been removed this involves creation of a fistula between trachea and oesophagus puncturing the short segment of tissue or common wall that typically separates these two structures a voice prosthesis is inserted into this puncture the prosthesis keeps food out of the trachea but lets air into the esophagus for oesophageal speech a laryngectomized person is required to breathe through a permanent breathing hole in the neck called a tracheostoma when a laryngectomized person occludes the tracheostoma completely blocking exhaled air to leave the body through that pathway exhaled air is directed through the voice prosthesis this air enters the esophagus and escapes through the mouth during this process as the air passes through the upper tissues of the esophagus and lower throat it allows for vibration of the tissues of the pharyngoesophageal segment also called pe segment neoglottis or pseudoglottis this vibration creates a sound that serves to replace the sound the vocal cords previously produced other methods of alaryngeal speech speech without vocal cords are esophageal speech and artificial larynx speech studies show that tracheoesophageal speech is found to

they are classified as either totipotent itc pluripotent ipsc or progenitor multipotent imsc also called an induced multipotent progenitor cell impc or unipotent iusc according to their developmental potential and degree of dedifferentiation progenitors are obtained by so called direct reprogramming or directed differentiation and are also called induced somatic stem cells three techniques are widely recognized in 1895 thomas morgan removed one of a frog s two blastomeres and found that amphibians are able to form whole embryos from the remaining part this meant that the cells can change their differentiation pathway in 1924 spemann and mangold demonstrated the key importance of cell cell inductions during animal development the reversible transformation of cells of one differentiated cell type to another is called metaplasia this transition can be a part of the normal maturation process or caused by an inducement one example is the transformation of iris cells to lens cells in the process of maturation and transformation of retinal pigment epithelium cells into the neural retina during regeneration in adult newt eyes this process allows the body to replace cells not suitable to new conditions with more suitable new cells in drosophila imaginal discs cells have to choose from

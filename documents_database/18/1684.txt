specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally desirable traits including resistance to pests and to herbicides maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries gm maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow one strain called starlink was approved only for animal feed in the us but was found in food leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000 corn varieties resistant to glyphosate herbicides were first commercialized in 1996 by monsanto and are known as roundup ready corn they tolerate the use of roundup bayer cropscience developed liberty link corn that is resistant to glufosinate pioneer hi bred has developed and markets corn hybrids with tolerance to imidazoline herbicides under the trademark clearfield though in these hybrids the herbicide tolerance trait was bred using tissue culture selection and the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate not genetic engineering consequently the regulatory framework governing the approval of transgenic crops does not apply for clearfield as of 2011 herbicide resistant gm corn was grown in 14 countries by 2012 26 varieties of herbicide resistant gm maize were authorised for import

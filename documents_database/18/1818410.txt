it is analogous to the electromagnetic tensor f a 2 vector used in the covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism in silberstein s formulation i was defined as the imaginary unit and f was defined as a complexified 3 dimensional vector field called a bivector field bernhard riemann used formula 3 to illustrate consolidation of maxwell s equations according to lectures published by heinrich martin weber in 1901 the real and imaginary components of the equation are an interpretation of maxwell s equations without charges or currents riemann s lectures are available on line from university of michigan historical math collection in weber s book 138 s 348 under the title zusammenziehung der maxwell schen gleichungen consolidation of maxwell s equations the riemann silberstein vector is used as a point of reference in the geometric algebra formulation of electromagnetism maxwell s four equations in vector calculus reduce to one equation in the algebra of physical space expressions for the fundamental invariants and the energy density and momentum density also take on simple forms where s is the poynting vector the riemann silberstein vector is used for an exact matrix representations of maxwell s equations in an inhomogeneous medium with sources in

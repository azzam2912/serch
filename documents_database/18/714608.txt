it is at its most diverse in north america with about 297 recognised taxa but china and southeast asia also support very diverse faunas freshwater mussels occupy a wide range of habitats but most often occupy lotic waters i e flowing water such as rivers streams and creeks the recent phylogenetic study reveals that the unionidae most likely originated in southeast and east asia in the jurassic with the earliest expansions into north america and africa since the mid cretaceous followed by the colonization of europe and india since the paleocene unionidae burrow into the substrate with their posterior margins exposed they pump water through the incurrent aperture obtaining oxygen and food they remove phytoplankton and zooplankton as well as suspended bacteria fungal spores and dissolved organic matter despite extensive laboratory studies which of these filtrates unionoids actually process remains uncertain in high densities they have the ability to influence water clarity but filtration rates are dependent on water temperature current velocity and particle size and concentration in addition gill morphology can determine particle size filtered as well as the rate unionidae are distinguished by a unique and complex lifecycle most unionids are of separate sex although some species such

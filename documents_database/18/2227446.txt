white only has the line of pawns and two gold plus their king black has the usual setup of twenty pieces the handicap is not a part of the current official handicap system of the japan shogi association but it is still used by novice players and has received joseki treatment in shogi texts unlike the larger 10 piece and 9 piece handicaps the 8 piece is more balanced with white having the minimum number of pieces needed to defend their line of pawns from black s early bishop attacks the first couple of moves by white are crucial the fastest attack that black can initiate is via their bishop once their bishop s diagonal is open the bishop is directly attacking white s pawn on 33 therefore white must address this threat in their first two moves additionally once the bishop is mobile black may also threaten white s right edge pawn on 93 white must accordingly address this in their first two moves as well if these two points are not defended properly then black will succeed in breaching white s camp very early in the game 1 g 32 white prepares for the bishop attack on 33

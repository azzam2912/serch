memory is a property of the central nervous system with three different classifications short term long term and sensory memory the three types of memory have specific different functions but each are equally important for memory processes sensory information is transformed and encoded in a certain way in the brain which forms a memory representation this unique coding of information creates a memory memory and retention are linked because any retained information is kept in human memory stores therefore without human memory processes retention of material would not be possible in addition memory and the process of learning are also closely connected memory is a site of storage and enables the retrieval and encoding of information which is essential for the process of learning learning is dependent on memory processes because previously stored knowledge functions as a framework in which newly learned information can be linked information is retained in human memory stores in different ways but it is primarily done so through active learning repetition and recall information that is encoded and stored within memory stores can often be forgotten there are multiple explanations for why this happens these include ineffective encoding of material decay of information interference competition

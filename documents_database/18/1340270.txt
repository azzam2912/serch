this is advantageous for phototrophic organisms as they can orient themselves most efficiently to receive light for photosynthesis phototaxis is called positive if the movement is in the direction of increasing light intensity and negative if the direction is opposite two types of positive phototaxis are observed in prokaryotes the first is called scotophobotaxis from the word scotophobia which is observed only under a microscope this occurs when a bacterium swims by chance out of the area illuminated by the microscope entering darkness signals the cell to reverse flagella rotation direction and reenter the light the second type of phototaxis is true phototaxis which is a directed movement up a gradient to an increasing amount of light this is analogous to positive chemotaxis except that the attractant is light rather than a chemical phototactic responses are observed in many organisms such as serratia marcescens tetrahymena and euglena each organism has its own specific biological cause for a phototactic response many of which are incidental and serve no end purpose phototaxis in zooplankton is well studied in the marine annelid platynereis dumerilii platynereis dumerilii trochophore and metatrochophore larvae are positively phototactic phototaxis there is mediated by simple eyespots that consists of

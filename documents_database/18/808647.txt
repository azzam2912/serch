it is secreted by osteoblasts during bone formation initiating mineralization and promoting mineral crystal formation osteonectin also shows affinity for collagen in addition to bone mineral calcium a correlation between osteonectin over expression and ampullary cancers and chronic pancreatitis has been found the human sparc gene is 26 5 kb long and contains 10 exons and 9 introns and is located on chromosome 5q31 q33 osteonectin is a 40 kd acidic and cysteine rich glycoprotein consisting of a single polypeptide chain that can be broken into 4 domains 1 a ca binding domain near the glutamic acid rich region at the amino terminus domain i 2 a cysteine rich domain ii 3 a hydrophilic region domain iii and 4 an ef hand motif at the carboxy terminus region domain iv osteonectin is an acidic extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays a vital role in bone mineralization cell matrix interactions and collagen binding osteonectin also increases the production and activity of matrix metalloproteinases a function important to invading cancer cells within bone additional functions of osteonectin beneficial to tumor cells include angiogenesis proliferation and migration overexpression of osteonectin is reported in many human cancers such as breast prostate and colon this molecule

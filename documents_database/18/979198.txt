tracking is an electrical breakdown on the surface of an insulating material wherein an initial exposure to heat chars the material and the char is more conductive than the original insulator producing more current flow more heat and eventually complete failure a large voltage difference gradually creates a conductive leakage path across the surface of the material by forming a carbonized track testing method is specified in iec standard 60112 to measure the tracking 50 drops of 0 1 ammonium chloride solution are dropped on the material and the voltage measured for a 3 mm thickness is considered representative of the material performance also term pti proof tracking index is used it means voltage at which during testing on five samples the samples pass the test with no failures performance level categories plc were introduced to avoid excessive implied precision and bias the cti value is used for electrical safety assessment of electrical apparatus as for instance carried out by underwriters laboratory in usa and many other laboratories in the world the minimum required creepage distances over an insulating material between electrically conducting parts in apparatus especially between parts with a high voltage and parts that can be touched by

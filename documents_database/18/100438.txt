although they are sometimes grouped together as a single family desmidiaceae most classifications recognize three to five families either within the order zygnematales or as their own order desmidiales the desmidiales comprise around 40 genera and 5 000 to 6 000 species found mostly but not exclusively in fresh water many species may be found in the fissures between patches of sphagnum moss in marshes with a ph level of approximately 4 0 sphagnum peat provides the ideal environment for this flora the structure of these algae is unicellular and lacks flagella although most desmids are unicellular the species desmidium swartzii forms chains of cells resembling the algae genus spirogyra however these filaments are arranged in a helix pattern the cell of a desmid is often divided into two symmetrical compartments separated by a narrow bridge or isthmus wherein the spherical nucleus is located each semi cell houses a large often folded chloroplast for photosynthesizing one or more pyrenoids can be found these form carbohydrates for energy storage the cell wall of two halves termed semicells which in a few species of closterium and penium are of more than one piece has two distinct layers the inner composed mainly of

it produces secondary xylem inwards towards the pith and secondary phloem outwards towards the bark in herbaceous plants it occurs in the vascular bundles which are often arranged like beads on a necklace forming an interrupted ring inside the stem in woody plants it forms a cylinder of unspecialized meristem cells as a continuous ring from which the new tissues are grown unlike the xylem and phloem it does not transport water minerals or food through the plant other names for the vascular cambium are the main cambium wood cambium or bifacial cambium vascular cambia are found in dicots and gymnosperms but not monocots which usually lack secondary growth a few leaf types also have a vascular cambium in dicot and gymnosperm trees the vascular cambium is the obvious line separating the bark and wood they also have a cork cambium for successful grafting the vascular cambia of the rootstock and scion must be aligned so they can grow together the cambium present between primary xylem and primary phloem is called the intrafascicular cambium within vascular bundles during secondary growth cells of medullary rays in a line as seen in section in three dimensions it is a sheet between neighbouring

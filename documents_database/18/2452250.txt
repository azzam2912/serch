photonic topological phases are classical electromagnetic wave analogues of electronic topological phases studied in condensed matter physics similar to their electronic counterparts they can provide robust unidirectional channels for light propagation the field that studies these phases of light is referred to as topological photonics even though the working frequency of these electromagnetic topological insulators may fall in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum such as the microwave range topological order in solid state systems has been studied in condensed matter physics since the discovery of integer quantum hall effect but topological matter attracted considerable interest from the physics community after the proposals for possible observation of symmetry protected topological phases or the so called topological insulators in graphene and experimental observation of a 2d topological insulator in cdte hgte cdte quantum wells in 2007 in 2008 haldane and raghu proposed that unidirectional electromagnetic states analogous to integer quantum hall states can be realized in nonreciprocal magnetic photonic crystals this was followed by the proposals for analogous quantum spin hall states of electromagnetic waves that are now known as photonic topological insulators photonic topological insulators are designed using various photonic platforms including coupled ring resonators bi anisotropic meta materials coupled

both algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory build on commutative algebra prominent examples of commutative rings include polynomial rings rings of algebraic integers including the ordinary integers formula 1 and p adic integers commutative algebra is the main technical tool in the local study of schemes the study of rings that are not necessarily commutative is known as noncommutative algebra it includes ring theory representation theory and the theory of banach algebras commutative algebra is essentially the study of the rings occurring in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry in algebraic number theory the rings of algebraic integers are dedekind rings which constitute therefore an important class of commutative rings considerations related to modular arithmetic have led to the notion of a valuation ring the restriction of algebraic field extensions to subrings has led to the notions of integral extensions and integrally closed domains as well as the notion of ramification of an extension of valuation rings the notion of localization of a ring in particular the localization with respect to a prime ideal the localization consisting in inverting a single element and the total quotient ring is one of the main differences between commutative algebra and the theory of

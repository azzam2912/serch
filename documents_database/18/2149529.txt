zac djamoos of absolutepunk net and ryan j prado of paste praised the album with djamoos remarking one of the best albums of the year and arguably his most versatile yet and prado commenting on the songwriting complimenting the music that his gifts for wrangling emotive detours from unlikely sonic realms is his best talent but he couldn t do that without his crafty capacity for language too james christopher monger of allmusic found the album to be patchwork calling adult film a smorgasbord of pop ephemera with melodies crashing about like boozy butterflies occasionally landing on an idea and then leaping back into the blue in search of less restrictive stimuli and defining this as a major weakness of the album american songwriter s charlie zaillian shared similar observations that there aren t many hooks to latch onto no amount of electronic drums thickly layered synths spanish guitars and theremins can cover a humdrum set of songs all songs written by tim kasher

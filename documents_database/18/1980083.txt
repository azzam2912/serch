it was similar to the uk s gee system but operated at lower frequencies in order to provide an improved range up to with an accuracy of tens of miles it was first used for ship convoys crossing the atlantic ocean and then by long range patrol aircraft but found its main use on the ships and aircraft operating in the pacific theatre loran in its original form was an expensive system to implement requiring a cathode ray tube crt display this limited use to the military and large commercial users automated receivers became available in the 1950s but the same improved electronics also opened the possibility of new systems with higher accuracy the us navy began development of loran b which offered accuracy on the order of a few tens of feet but ran into significant technical problems the us air force worked on a different concept cyclan which the navy took over as loran c loran c offered longer range than loran and accuracy of hundreds of feet the us coast guard took over operations of both systems in 1958 in spite of the dramatically improved performance of loran c loran now known as loran a or standard

gleon includes more than 60 lakes and more than 260 individual members from 34 countries on six continents as of april 2011 the goal is to understand predict and communicate the impact of natural and anthropogenic influences on lake and reservoir ecosystems the researchers include limnologists ecologists information technology experts and engineers who have a common objective of building and growing a scalable persistent network of lake ecology observatories developing new theoretical models based on the more extensive spatial and temporal scales of data integrating new technologies to utilize the data educating a new generation of researchers and engaging the public each lake or reservoir observatory consists of one or more instrumented platforms capable of sensing key limnological variables and moving the data in near real time to web accessible databases a common web portal will allow easy access to researchers and the public a series of web services supported by this portal will allow computation of metrics based on the high frequency data the types of sensors employed at these observatories include temperature dissolved oxygen dissolved carbon dioxide phytoplankton pigments such as chlorophyll and phycocyanin as well as devices that detect water movements such as acoustic doppler current profilers

log polar coordinates are closely connected to polar coordinates which are usually used to describe domains in the plane with some sort of rotational symmetry in areas like harmonic and complex analysis the log polar coordinates are more canonical than polar coordinates log polar coordinates in the plane consist of a pair of real numbers where is the logarithm of the distance between a given point and the origin and is the angle between a line of reference the x axis and the line through the origin and the point the angular coordinate is the same as for polar coordinates while the radial coordinate is transformed according to the rule where formula 2 is the distance to the origin the formulas for transformation from cartesian coordinates to log polar coordinates are given by and the formulas for transformation from log polar to cartesian coordinates are by using complex numbers x y x iy the latter transformation can be written as i e the complex exponential function from this follows that basic equations in harmonic and complex analysis will have the same simple form as in cartesian coordinates this is not the case for polar coordinates laplace s equation in two

host guest chemistry encompasses the idea of molecular recognition and interactions through non covalent bonding non covalent bonding is critical in maintaining the 3d structure of large molecules such as proteins and is involved in many biological processes in which large molecules bind specifically but transiently to one another there are four commonly mentioned types of non covalent interactions hydrogen bonds ionic bonds van der waals forces and hydrophobic interactions host guest chemistry is a branch of supramolecular chemistry in which a host molecule forms a chemical compound with a guest molecule or ion the two components of the compound are held together by non covalent forces most commonly by hydrogen bonding binding between host and guest is usually highly specific to the two moieties concerned the formation of these complexes is central to the subject of molecular recognition there is an equilibrium between the unbound state in which host and guest are separate from each other and the bound state in which there is a structurally defined host guest complex the host component can be considered the larger molecule and it encompasses the smaller guest molecule in biological systems the analogous terms of host and guest are commonly referred

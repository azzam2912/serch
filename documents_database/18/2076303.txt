to increase the electronic conductivity of cathode sulfur is usually mixed with carbon to form a cathode composite magnesium sulfur battery is an emerging energy storage technology and now is still in the stage of research it is of great interest since in theory the mg s chemistry can provide 1722 wh kg energy density with an voltage at 1 7 v magnesium is abundant non toxic and doesn t degrade in air most importantly magnesium does not form dendrites during deposition stripping process which is attributed to be the main cause for the safety issue in lithium ion battery and rechargeable lithium battery a first review on mg s batteries has been published in mrs communications in 2011 toyota motor announced a research project in this area and in the same year they reported a new electrolyte that is chemically compatible with sulfur the electrolyte was prepared as a lewis acid base complex from the hauser base hmds mgcl introduced by c liebenow et al in 2000 and alcl conceptionally similar to aurbach s binuclear electrolyte complex from 2001 although the complex had to be refined by recrystallization and only thf could be used as solvent a discharge voltage

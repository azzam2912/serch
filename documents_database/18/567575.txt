the theorem was conjectured by andrew v zsonyi and proved by a short proof was given by it has since become a prominent example in reverse mathematics as a statement that cannot be proved within atr a form of arithmetical transfinite recursion and a finitary application of the theorem gives the existence of the notoriously fast growing tree function in 2004 the result was generalized from trees to graphs as the robertson seymour theorem a result that has also proved important in reverse mathematics and leads to the even faster growing sscg function we give the version proved by nash williams kruskal s formulation is somewhat stronger all trees we consider are finite given a tree formula 1 with a root and given vertices formula 2 formula 3 call formula 3 a successor of formula 2 if the unique path from the root to formula 3 contains formula 2 and call formula 3 an immediate successor of formula 2 if additionally the path from to formula 2 to formula 3 contains no other vertex take formula 12 to be a partially ordered set if formula 13 are rooted trees with vertices labeled in formula 12 we say that formula 15

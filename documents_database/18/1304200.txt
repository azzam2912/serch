given the structure constants the resulting product is bilinear and can be uniquely extended to all vectors in the vector space thus uniquely determining the product for the algebra structure constants are used whenever an explicit form for the algebra must be given thus they are frequently used when discussing lie algebras in physics as the basis vectors indicate specific directions in physical space or correspond to specific particles recall that lie algebras are algebras over a field with the bilinear product being given by the lie bracket or commutator given a set of basis vectors formula 1 for the underlying vector space of the algebra the structure constants or structure coefficients formula 2 express the multiplication formula 3 of pairs of vectors as a linear combination the upper and lower indices are frequently not distinguished unless the algebra is endowed with some other structure that would require this for example a pseudo riemannian metric on the algebra of the indefinite orthogonal group so p q that is structure constants are often written with all upper or all lower indexes the distinction between upper and lower is then a convention reminding the reader that lower indices behave like the components

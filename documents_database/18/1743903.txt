1 the database was assembled by using a structure based chemical shift calculation program called shiftx to calculate expected protein 1 h 13 c and 15 n chemical shifts from x ray or nmr coordinate data of previously assigned proteins reported in the bmrb the comparison is automatically performed by a program called shiftcor the refdb database currently provides reference corrected chemical shift data on more than 2000 assigned peptides and proteins data from the database indicates that nearly 25 of bmrb entries with 13 c protein assignments and 27 of bmrb entries with 15 n protein assignments require significant chemical shift reference readjustments additionally nearly 40 of protein entries deposited in the biomagresbank appear to have at least one assignment error users may download search or browse the database through a number of methods available through the refdb website refdb provides a standard chemical shift resource for biomolecular nmr spectroscopists wishing to derive or compute chemical shift trends in peptides and proteins all data in refdb is non proprietary or is derived from a non proprietary source it is freely accessible and available to anyone in addition nearly every data item is fully traceable and explicitly referenced to the

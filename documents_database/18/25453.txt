they are modelled visually by square tiles with a color on each side a set of such tiles is selected and copies of the tiles are arranged side by side with matching colors without rotating or reflecting them the basic question about a set of wang tiles is whether it can tile the plane or not i e whether an entire infinite plane can be filled this way the next question is whether this can be done in a periodic pattern in 1961 wang conjectured that if a finite set of wang tiles can tile the plane then there exists also a periodic tiling i e a tiling that is invariant under translations by vectors in a 2 dimensional lattice like a wallpaper pattern he also observed that this conjecture would imply the existence of an algorithm to decide whether a given finite set of wang tiles can tile the plane the idea of constraining adjacent tiles to match each other occurs in the game of dominoes so wang tiles are also known as wang dominoes the algorithmic problem of determining whether a tile set can tile the plane became known as the domino problem according to wang s student

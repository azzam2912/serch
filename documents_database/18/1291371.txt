he obtained an s m 1954 and ph d 1956 in applied physics from harvard university his thesis concerned i the concept of impedance ii high frequency scattering and was advised by ronold w p king at harvard he continued as junior fellow in the society of fellows 1956 59 joined the faculty of applied physics 1959 and is currently the gordon mckay professor of applied physics professor of physics wu has also had visiting appointments with rockefeller university 1966 at the desy in hamburg germany 1971 at cern in geneva switzerland and utrecht university 1977 he has studied statistical mechanics on bose einstein condensation in an external potential classical electromagnetic theory 1960 with hung cheng he used gauge quantum field theory to predict the unboundedly increasing total scattering cross sections at very high energies experimentally verified at cern and tevatron collider wu studied production processes for the large hadron collider in particular to predict the production cross section of a higgs particle with low momentum together with two forward jets with chen ning yang he studied cp violation and what not such as globalization of the gauge theory more recently wu has studied quantum information processing based on the

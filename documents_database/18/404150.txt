it was first proven advantageous in 1976 by shun ichi iwasaki then professor of the tohoku university in japan and first commercially implemented in 2005 the first industry standard demonstration showing unprecedented advantage of pmr over longitudinal magnetic recording lmr at nanoscale dimensions was made in 1998 at ibm almaden research center in collaboration with researchers of data storage systems center dssc a national science foundation nsf engineering research center ercs at carnegie mellon university cmu perpendicular recording can deliver more than three times the storage density of traditional longitudinal recording in 1986 maxell announced a floppy disk using perpendicular recording that could store perpendicular recording was later used by toshiba in 3 5 floppy disks in 1989 to permit 2 88 mb of capacity ed or extra high density but they failed to succeed in the marketplace since about 2005 the technology has come into use for hard disk drives hard disk technology with longitudinal recording has an estimated limit of due to the superparamagnetic effect though this estimate is constantly changing perpendicular recording is predicted to allow information densities of up to around drives with densities of were available commercially and there have been perpendicular recording demonstrations of

this methodology is used to simulate linear continuous systems hybrid continuous and discrete event systems and any other system that involves the rate based movement or flow of material from one location to another industrial areas where drs is used include drs combines the event based timing of discrete event simulation des and the continuous variables calculations found in continuous simulation it predicts and schedules events when the system needs to calculate a new set of rates and determines the appropriate rate of flow for each branch or stream drs is similar to des in that both methodologies model the operation of the system as a discrete sequence of events in time however while des assumes there is no change in the system between consecutive events in a drs model the flow continues to move at a constant rate such that for example the level in a tank could change another difference is that des models are overwhelmingly concerned with the status of system entities discrete objects moving through the system while drs models are concerned with the status quantity and location of homogeneous flow for rate based systems drs has faster computational times and is more accurate in calculating

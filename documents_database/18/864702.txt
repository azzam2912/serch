putnam published in 1978 is seen as pioneering work in the field of software process modelling as a group empirical models work by collecting software project data for example effort and size and fitting a curve to the data future effort estimates are made by providing size and calculating the associated effort using the equation which fit the original data usually with some error created by lawrence putnam sr the putnam model describes the time and effort required to finish a software project of specified size slim software lifecycle management is the name given by putnam to the proprietary suite of tools his company qsm inc has developed based on his model it is one of the earliest of these types of models developed and is among the most widely used closely related software parametric models are constructive cost model cocomo parametric review of information for costing and evaluation software price s and software evaluation and estimation of resources software estimating model seer sem while managing r d projects for the army and later at ge putnam noticed software staffing profiles followed the well known rayleigh distribution putnam used his observations about productivity levels to derive the software equation where

risk assurance is similar to assurance practices one way to think about it is that the assurance department in a firm is broader and more accounting based while the risk assurance department is a subset much smaller and specific auditors that work in the risk assurance department are more focused on auditing information technology general controls itgcs and completing a system and organization control soc 1 report it has become a huge part of public accounting firms revenue as the industry trends show that firms and clients are moving towards making technology a huge part of their day to day services this means risk assurance will become a huge part of their auditors work it starts with a meeting between the client and auditors to discuss which of the client s processes the auditors will choose to audit this decision is based on which processes are significant and what controls are in place to prevent any error or fraud an example of this would be access to the journal entry database to ensure that anyone who has access is supposed to and those who do not cannot access the database

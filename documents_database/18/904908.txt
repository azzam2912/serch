the percentage oxygen saturation of hemoglobin determines the content of oxygen in blood after the human body reaches around 2 100 m 7 000 feet above sea level the saturation of oxyhemoglobin begins to decrease rapidly however the human body has both short term and long term adaptations to altitude that allow it to partially compensate for the lack of oxygen there is a limit to the level of adaptation mountaineers refer to the altitudes above as the death zone where it is generally believed that no human body can acclimatize the human body can perform best at sea level where the atmospheric pressure is 101 325 pa or 1013 25 millibars or 1 atm by definition the concentration of oxygen o in sea level air is 20 9 so the partial pressure of o po is 21 136 kpa in healthy individuals this saturates hemoglobin the oxygen binding red pigment in red blood cells atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude while the o fraction remains constant to about 100 km so po decreases exponentially with altitude as well it is about half of its sea level value at the altitude of the everest base camp and only a third

its role is to produce controlled amount of heat pyrotechnic heat sources are usually based on thermite like or sometimes delay composition like fuel oxidizer compositions with slow burn rate high production of heat at desired temperature and low to zero production of gases pyrotechnic heat sources can be activated by multiple means electric match and percussion cap are the most common ones pyrotechnic heat sources are often used for activation of thermal batteries where they serve to melt the electrolyte there are two main types of design one uses a fuze strip containing barium chromate and powdered zirconium metal in a ceramic paper along the edge of the heat pellets to initiate burning the fuze strip is typically fired by an electrical igniter or squib by application of electric current the second design uses a center hole in the battery stack into which the high energy electrical igniter fires a mixture of hot gases and incandescent particles the center hole design allows much faster activation times tens of milliseconds vs hundreds of milliseconds for the edge strip design battery activation can also be accomplished by a percussion primer similar to a shotgun shell it is desired that the pyrotechnic

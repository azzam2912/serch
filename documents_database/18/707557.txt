desmoglein 1 is expressed everywhere in the skin epidermis but mainly it is expressed in the superficial upper layers of the skin epidermis desmosomes are cell cell junctions between epithelial myocardial and certain other cell types desmoglein 1 is a calcium binding transmembrane glycoprotein component of desmosomes in vertebrate epithelial cells currently four desmoglein subfamily members have been identified and all are members of the cadherin cell adhesion molecule superfamily these desmoglein gene family members are located in a cluster on chromosome 18 the protein encoded by this gene has been identified as the autoantigen of the autoimmune skin blistering disease pemphigus foliaceus it has been found that desmoglein 1 is the target antigen in majority of the cases linked to igg iga pemphigus which is an autoimmune igg iga antibody mediated response deficiency of the desmoglein 1 protein has been found to be associated with increased expression of the for multiple genes encoding allergy related cytokines desmoglein 1 is haploinsufficient and a mutation in the gene can cause the autosomal dominant mutation striate palmoplantar keratoderma recently cases have arose where the homozygous loss of the desmoglein 1 gene has resulted in a rare syndrome known as sam syndrome severe

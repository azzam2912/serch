the two types of subatomic particles are elementary particles which according to current theories are not made of other particles and composite particles particle physics and nuclear physics study these particles and how they interact the idea of a particle underwent serious rethinking when experiments showed that light could behave like a stream of particles called photons as well as exhibiting wave like properties this led to the new concept of wave particle duality to reflect that quantum scale particles behave like both particles and waves they are sometimes described as wavicles to reflect this another new concept the uncertainty principle states that some of their properties taken together such as their simultaneous position and momentum cannot be measured exactly in more recent times wave particle duality has been shown to apply not only to photons but to increasingly massive particles as well interactions of particles in the framework of quantum field theory are understood as creation and annihilation of quanta of corresponding fundamental interactions this blends particle physics with field theory subatomic particles are either elementary i e not made of multiple other particles or composite and made of more than one elementary particle bound together the elementary particles

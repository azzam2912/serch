common law patent doctrine that limits the extent to which patent holders can control an individual article of a patented product after a so called authorized sale under the doctrine once an authorized sale of a patented article occurs the patent holder s exclusive rights to control the use and sale of that article are said to be exhausted and the purchaser is free to use or resell that article without further restraint from patent law however under the repair and reconstruction doctrine the patent owner retains the right to exclude purchasers of the articles from making the patented invention anew i e making another article unless it is specifically authorized by the patentee to do so procedurally the patent exhaustion doctrine operates as an affirmative defense shielding authorized purchasers from infringement claims concerning the sale or use including repair and modification of a patented product after the patent owner authorized its sale because only an authorized sale triggers the doctrine it may be difficult or at least controversial to determine whether the exhaustion doctrine applies in a particular case for example when the patentee purports to restrict or condition the use or resale of the patented article once purchased

as seen in the diagram spade green icon automates many manual activities of the software development process it therefore takes less time and effort to perform the full software development cycle with spade the remaining manual steps are automation of the other steps is possible because the business requirements are specified clearly by using the method smart requirements 2 0 spade then uses intelligent algorithms that incorporate dependency analysis and a set of design patterns to transform these requirements to an optimized business process design including the flow of user interactive and fully automated steps that are part of this business process spade is a domain specific model based software development tool that is well suited for creating both complex as well as simple information processing systems it is currently less suitable for creating software that can control hardware in real time or advanced graphical user interfaces one can however add plug ins for accessing functionality that is not created by spade we will explain creating clear requirements using the language smart notation which is part of the method smart requirements 2 0 followed by explaining how and what spade will automatically create from these requirements we will also explain

a good example of a smart cosubstrate is a lactonizable diol in redox biocatalysis the nicotinamide cofactor nad p h or nad p can act as an electron donor or acceptor by releasing or accepting a hydride the cofactor must be used in the reaction either in stoichiometric amounts leading to inhibition and economic issues or in catalytic amounts coupled with an in situ regeneration system a common approach catalytic amounts is excess use of sacrificial organic molecules such as isopropanol or ethanol this approach however leads to stoichiometric amounts of waste the use of 1 4 butanediol as a smart cosubstrate for cofactor regeneration was the next step towards more sustainable redox biocatalysis scheme 1 the formation of a thermodynamically stable gamma butyrolactone as a co product drives the reaction to completion while yielding higher reaction rates the use of 1 4 butanediol as an intelligent cosubstrate has also been validated in non aqueous media using a commercial adh biocatalytic cascade reactions currently fall into four different categories however only two types of redox neutral cascades have been reported for the in situ regeneration of the cofactors parallel cascades i e bi substrate no intermediate bi or tri product

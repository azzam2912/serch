vcam 1 functions as a cell adhesion molecule the vcam 1 gene contains six or seven immunoglobulin domains and is expressed on both large and small blood vessels only after the endothelial cells are stimulated by cytokines it is alternatively spliced into two known rna transcripts that encode different isoforms in humans the gene product is a cell surface sialoglycoprotein a type i membrane protein that is a member of the ig superfamily the vcam 1 protein mediates the adhesion of lymphocytes monocytes eosinophils and basophils to vascular endothelium it also functions in leukocyte endothelial cell signal transduction and it may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis upregulation of vcam 1 in endothelial cells by cytokines occurs as a result of increased gene transcription e g in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf and interleukin 1 il 1 and through stabilization of messenger rna mrna e g interleukin 4 il 4 the promoter region of the vcam 1 gene contains functional tandem nf b nuclear factor kappa b sites the sustained expression of vcam 1 lasts over 24 hours primarily the vcam 1 protein is an endothelial ligand for vla 4 very late antigen

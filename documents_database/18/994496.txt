the problem asks for the largest number n k of nonoverlapping triangles whose sides lie on an arrangement of k lines variations of the problem consider the projective plane rather than the euclidean plane and require that the triangles not be crossed by any other lines of the arrangement saburo tamura proved that the largest integer not exceeding k k 2 3 provides an upper bound on the maximal number of nonoverlapping triangles realizable by k lines in 2007 a tighter upper bound was found by johannes bader and gilles cl ment by proving that tamura s upper bound couldn t be reached for any k congruent to 0 or 2 mod 6 the maximum number of triangles is therefore at most one less than tamura s bound in these cases perfect solutions kobon triangle solutions yielding the maximum number of triangles are known for k 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 13 15 and 17 for k 10 11 and 12 the best solutions known reach a number of triangles one less than the upper bound as proved by g cl ment and j bader the solutions for k 2 are bounded above by given a perfect solution

many naturally occurring families of graphs are l vy families many mathematicians have noted this fact and have expressed surprise that it does not appear to have a ready explanation formally a family of graphs g n 1 2 3 is a l vy family if for any formula 1 where here d is the graph diameter of g and a is the n graph neighborhood of a note that the maximization ranges over subsets a of g subject to a being over half the size of g in words this means that one can take a subset of size at least half of g and blow it up by only formula 4 of the graph diameter and end up with nearly all the set long stringy i e not compact families of graphs such as the cycle graph of order n clearly don t have such a property one could consider a subset comprising the n 2 neighborhood of a point midnight to six o clock say the graph has graph diameter d of about n 2 so the formula 5 neighborhood of the subset is only of size about n 2 a levy family would have this neighborhood

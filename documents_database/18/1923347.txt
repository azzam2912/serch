a typical application is when clients need to agree on which sites or proxies objects are assigned to rendezvous hashing is more general than consistent hashing which becomes a special case for formula 1 of rendezvous hashing rendezvous hashing was invented by david thaler and chinya ravishankar at the university of michigan in 1996 consistent hashing appeared a year later in the literature one of the first applications of rendezvous hashing was to enable multicast clients on the internet in contexts such as the mbone to identify multicast rendezvous points in a distributed fashion it was used in 1998 by microsoft s cache array routing protocol carp for distributed cache coordination and routing some protocol independent multicast routing protocols use rendezvous hashing to pick a rendezvous point given its simplicity and generality rendezvous hashing has been applied in a wide variety of applications including mobile caching router design secure key establishment and sharding and distributed databases rendezvous hashing solves the distributed hash table problem how can a set of clients given an object o agree on where in a set of n sites servers say to place o each client is to select a site independently but all clients must

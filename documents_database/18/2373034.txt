the abms is used as the method of testing closed circuit breathing apparatus through the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh and national personal protective technology laboratory npptl kyiazi 1986 to simulate human respiration and metabolism an automated breathing metabolic simulator needs to control wischhoefer 1984 respiratory researchers have long desired an accurate method of simulating the breathing and metabolic processes of a human in a lab setting simulators have become a vital resource for research institutes regulatory centers testing houses and manufacturers due to their ability to produce data that can accurately resemble a human s breathing without the risk of direct human exposure to the tested device prior to the early 1980s accurately simulating human breathing in a controlled and repetitive manner was not possible due to the lack of technological development and human knowledge on the respiratory system once understanding of human respiratory system was better understood basic breathing metabolic simulators bms were devised these were designed around a manual pump that a technician would use to simulate human breathing but they led to inaccurate procedures being developed due to inaccurate testing equipment the first bms was developed by u s bureau of mines in

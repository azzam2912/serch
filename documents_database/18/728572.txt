it was intended to study the temporal and spatial distribution of the electron density the electron temperature the ion concentration the ion mass the micrometeorite distribution and the micrometeorite mass in the ionosphere at altitudes between 400 and 1600 km and their variation from full sunlit conditions to full shadow or nighttime conditions the payload was in the form of two truncated cones with the bases attached to a cylindrical equator the outer shell was aluminum and had a diameter of 76 cm and a height of 76 cm the 108 00 mhz transmitter had 100 mw average power and it functioned for the life of the battery pack 54 days the data system included telemetry consisting of continuous operation with real time transmission to avoid the possibility of effects on the experiments by asymmetrical charging on solar cell surfaces solar cells were not used experiment instrumentation included an rf impedance probe an ion current monitor a retarding potential probe a two element and a three element electron temperature probe an electron current monitor a photomultiplier type and a microphone type micrometeorite detector an electric field meter a solar horizon sensor and thermistor temperature probes simultaneous measurements of electron and

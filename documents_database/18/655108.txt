cells of other shapes require much more complex equations it was named after ole lamm later professor of physical chemistry at the royal institute of technology who derived it during his ph d studies under svedberg at uppsala university the lamm equation can be written where c is the solute concentration t and r are the time and radius and the parameters d s and represent the solute diffusion constant sedimentation coefficient and the rotor angular velocity respectively the first and second terms on the right hand side of the lamm equation are proportional to d and s respectively and describe the competing processes of diffusion and sedimentation whereas sedimentation seeks to concentrate the solute near the outer radius of the cell diffusion seeks to equalize the solute concentration throughout the cell the diffusion constant d can be estimated from the hydrodynamic radius and shape of the solute whereas the buoyant mass m can be determined from the ratio of s and d where k t is the thermal energy i e boltzmann s constant k multiplied by the temperature t in kelvins solute molecules cannot pass through the inner and outer walls of the cell resulting in the boundary

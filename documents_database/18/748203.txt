beside 5 fu widely prescribed oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine xeloda could put dpd deficient patients at risk of experiencing severe or lethal toxicities as well dpd deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner this means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome and two copies of the defective gene one inherited from each parent are required in order to be born with the disorder the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder a small number of genetic variants have been repeatedly associated with dpd deficiency such as ivs14 1g a mutation in intron 14 coupled with exon 14 deletion a k a dpyd 2a 496a g in exon 6 2846a t in exon 22 and t1679g a k a dpyd 13 in exon 13 however testing patients for these allelic variants usually show high specificity i e bearing the mutation means that severe toxicity will occur indeed but very low sentivity i e not bearing the mutation does not mean that there is no risk for severe toxicities alternatively phenotyping dpd using ex

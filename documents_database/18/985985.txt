for example individuals may learn about a current event from a friend but later report having learned about it on the local news thus reflecting an incorrect source attribution this error occurs when normal perceptual and reflective processes are disrupted either by limited encoding of source information or by disruption to the judgment processes used in source monitoring depression high stress levels and damage to relevant brain areas are examples of factors that can cause such disruption and hence source monitoring errors one of the key ideas behind source monitoring is that rather than receiving an actual label for a memory during processing a person s memory records are activated and evaluated through decision processes through these processes a memory is attributed to a source source monitoring relies heavily on the individual s activated memory records if anything prevents encoding the contextual details of an event while it happens relevant information will not be fully retrieved and errors will occur if the attributes of memory representations are highly differentiated then fewer errors are expected to occur and vice versa two cognitive judgment processes exist regarding source monitoring these are commonly called heuristic and systematic judgement processes heuristic judgements are made

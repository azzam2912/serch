informedness is its generalization to the multiclass case and estimates the probability of an informed decision youden s j statistic is with the two right hand quantities being sensitivity and specificity thus the expanded formula is the index was suggested by w j youden in 1950 as a way of summarising the performance of a diagnostic test its value ranges from 0 through 1 inclusive and has a zero value when a diagnostic test gives the same proportion of positive results for groups with and without the disease i e the test is useless a value of 1 indicates that there are no false positives or false negatives i e the test is perfect the index gives equal weight to false positive and false negative values so all tests with the same value of the index give the same proportion of total misclassified results youden s index is often used in conjunction with receiver operating characteristic roc analysis the index is defined for all points of an roc curve and the maximum value of the index may be used as a criterion for selecting the optimum cut off point when a diagnostic test gives a numeric rather than a dichotomous

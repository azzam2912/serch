it is the oxime of salicylaldehyde this crystalline colorless solid is a chelator and sometimes used in the analysis of samples containing transition metal ions with which it often forms brightly coloured coordination complexes salicylaldoxime is the conjugate acid of a bidentate ligand in highly acidic media the ligand decomplexes and the metal aqua complex is liberated in this way the ligand is used as a recyclable extractant it typically forms charge neutral complexes with divalent metal ions in the era when metals were analysed by spectrophotometry many chelating ligands were developed that selectively formed brightly coloured complexes with particular metal ions this methodology has been eclipsed with the introduction of inductively coupled plasma methodology salicylaldoxime can be used to selectively precipitate metal ions for gravimetric determination it forms a greenish yellow precipitate with copper at a ph of 2 6 in the presence of acetic acid under these conditions this is the only metal that precipitates at ph 3 3 nickel also precipitates iron iii will interfere saloximes are used in the extraction and separation of metals from their ores in one application of hydrometallurgy cu is extracted into organic solvents as its saloxime complex

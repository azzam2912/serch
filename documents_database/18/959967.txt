the subjects could not consciously tell the difference but when played music with the hfcs they showed differences measured in two ways no effect was detected on listeners in the study when only the ultrasonic frequencies higher than 24 khz portion of the test material was played for test subjects the demonstrated effect was only present when comparing full bandwidth to bandwidth limited material it is a common understanding in psychoacoustics that the ear cannot respond to sounds at such high frequency via an air conduction pathway so one question that this research raised was does the hypersonic effect occur via the ordinary route of sound travelling through the air passage in the ear or in some other way a peer reviewed study in 2006 seemed to confirm the second of these options by testing the different effect of hfcs when presented via loudspeakers or via headphones the hypersonic effect did not occur when the hfcs were presented via headphones the 2006 study also investigated the comfortable listening level cll of music with and without hfcs an alternative way of measuring subject response to the sound the cll for the music with hfcs was higher than that for the music

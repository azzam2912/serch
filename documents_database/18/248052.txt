it undergoes alpha decay to stable pb with a half life of 138 376 days the longest of all naturally occurring polonium isotopes first identified in 1898 and also marking the discovery of the element polonium po is generated in the decay chain of uranium 238 and radium 226 po is a prominent contaminant in the environment mostly affecting seafood and tobacco it is also extremely toxic to humans as a result of its intense radioactivity in 1898 marie and pierre curie discovered a strongly radioactive substance in pitchblende and determined that it was a new element it was one of the first radioactive elements discovered having identified it as such they named the element polonium after marie s home country poland willy marckwald discovered a similar radioactive activity in 1902 and named it radio tellurium and at roughly the same time ernest rutherford identified the same activity in his analysis of the uranium decay chain and named it radium f originally radium e by 1905 rutherford concluded that all these observations were due to the same substance po further discoveries and the concept of isotopes first proposed in 1913 by frederick soddy firmly placed po as the penultimate step

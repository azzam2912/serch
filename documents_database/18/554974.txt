yu s p kulik y h shih and marlan o scully and reported in early 1999 is an elaboration on the quantum eraser experiment that incorporates concepts considered in wheeler s delayed choice experiment the experiment was designed to investigate peculiar consequences of the well known double slit experiment in quantum mechanics as well as the consequences of quantum entanglement the delayed choice quantum eraser experiment investigates a paradox if a photon manifests itself as though it had come by a single path to the detector then common sense which wheeler and others challenge says that it must have entered the double slit device as a particle if a photon manifests itself as though it had come by two indistinguishable paths then it must have entered the double slit device as a wave if the experimental apparatus is changed while the photon is in mid flight then the photon should reverse its original decision as to whether to be a wave or a particle wheeler pointed out that when these assumptions are applied to a device of interstellar dimensions a last minute decision made on earth on how to observe a photon could alter a decision made millions or even

the deficiencies can arise through mutations epigenetic alterations or inhibitors of one of the genes in a synthetic lethal genetic screen it is necessary to begin with a mutation that does not kill the cell although may confer a phenotype for example slow growth and then systematically test other mutations at additional loci to determine which confer lethality synthetic lethality has utility for purposes of molecular targeted cancer therapy with the first example of a molecular targeted therapeutic exploiting a synthetic lethal exposed by an inactivated tumor suppressor gene brca1 and 2 receiving fda approval in 2016 parp inhibitor a sub case of synthetic lethality where vulnerabilities are exposed by the deletion of passenger genes rather than tumor suppressor is the so called collateral lethality the phenomenon of synthetic lethality was first described by calvin bridges in 1922 who noticed that some combinations of mutations in the model organism drosophila melanogaster confer lethality theodore dobzhansky coined the term synthetic lethality in 1946 to describe the same type of genetic interaction in wildtype populations of drosophila if the combination of genetic events results in a non lethal reduction in fitness the interaction is called synthetic sickness although in classical genetics the

this anchor is based on the stone dog hitch a two point climbing anchor requires three carabiners one at each fixed point and one at the master point where the load is transferred to the climbing rope the aim is to distribute the force equally to each fixed point a triangle anchor is formed by clipping a length of webbing or cord through all three carabiners creating a shape which gives the dangerous anchor its descriptive name the force on each fixed point depends on the angle at the focal point the following table lists the percentage of force transferred to the fixed point for various focal point angles along with figures for a standard v shaped anchor table values are derived from vector analysis the load on the sling is the same in each example for the v arrangement the anchor force is equal to the tension in the sling but for the triangle the anchor force is greater than the sling tension aside from the magnification of forces the death triangle violates several best practices for building climbing anchors including an alternate v shaped form of the death triangle involves clipping a single loop of webbing or cord

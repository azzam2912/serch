veto cells were first described in 1979 as cells that can prevent generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes by normal spleen cells against self antigens hence veto cells delete t cells that recognize the veto cells the responding t cells are vetoed and thus removed from the system the establishment and maintenance of self tolerance is an essential property of an immune system designed to eliminate foreign substances avoiding self reactivity in the t cell compartment is maintained by clonal deletion in the thymus and suppressive cells that eliminate or induce tolerance on autoreactive lymphocytes that escaped selection veto activity is thought to be a form of antigen specific suppression that maintains continuous self tolerance cells with veto activity induce a state of tolerance in t cell precursors with specificity for antigen determinants expressed on the surface of the veto active cell this means that t cells with a t cell receptor specific to antigens presented on the veto cell bind to the veto cell and are in turn tolerized or eliminated hence veto activity is selective but is not t cell receptor mediated both clonal anergy and clonal deletion have been shown to operate in vetoed t cells the veto cell

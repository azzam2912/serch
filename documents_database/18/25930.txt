for example the electron configuration of the neon atom is 1s 2s 2p using the notation explained below electronic configurations describe each electron as moving independently in an orbital in an average field created by all other orbitals mathematically configurations are described by slater determinants or configuration state functions according to the laws of quantum mechanics for systems with only one electron a level of energy is associated with each electron configuration and in certain conditions electrons are able to move from one configuration to another by the emission or absorption of a quantum of energy in the form of a photon knowledge of the electron configuration of different atoms is useful in understanding the structure of the periodic table of elements this is also useful for describing the chemical bonds that hold atoms together in bulk materials this same idea helps explain the peculiar properties of lasers and semiconductors electron configuration was first conceived under the bohr model of the atom and it is still common to speak of shells and subshells despite the advances in understanding of the quantum mechanical nature of electrons an electron shell is the set of allowed states that share the same principal quantum

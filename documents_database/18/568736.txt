introduced in 1980 the line evolved into today s 4t40 45 65 80 line the 3 speed turbo hydramatic 125 was introduced in 1980 and produced through 2001 it carried over some parts from the light duty turbo hydramatic 200 and 350 but was generally a new design the 125 was renamed 3t40 later following gm s new naming convention after the 1995 introduction of the electronically controlled 4t40 e 4 speed the 3t40 was gradually phased out applications this was a later model of the 125 that debuted for 1982 and included a torque converter clutch or tcc the tcc acts similar to a clutch in a manual transmission vehicle in that at speeds above 35 mph a combination of engine vacuum and temperature sensing valves and a dedicated brake switch and in later models an ecu activated a solenoid which engaged a clutch physically locking the impeller and turbine inside the torque converter together causing engine power to be transferred directly to the transaxle the c in turbo hydramatic 125 c denoted the use of a tcc the solenoid that controls this is notorious for failure due to overheated plastic componentry and problems indicated by an engine stall

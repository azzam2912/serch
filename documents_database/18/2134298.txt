it is also called a demiregular tiling by some authors its two vertex configurations are shared with two 1 uniform tilings it can be seen as a type of diminished rhombitrihexagonal tiling with dodecagons replacing periodic sets of hexagons and surrounding squares and triangles this is similar to the johnson solid a diminished rhombicosidodecahedron which is a rhombicosidodecahedron with faces removed leading to new decagonal faces the dual of this variant is shown to the right deltoidal hexagonal insets the hexagons can be dissected into 6 triangles and the dodecagons can be dissected into triangles hexagons and squares this 2 uniform tiling can be used as a circle packing cyan circles are in contact with 3 other circles 2 cyan 1 pink corresponding to the v4 6 12 planigon and pink circles are in contact with 4 other circles 1 cyan 2 pink corresponding to the v3 4 6 4 planigon it is homeomorphic to the ambo operation on the tiling with the cyan and pink gap polygons corresponding to the cyan and pink circles mini vertex configuration polygons one dimensional duals to the respective planigons both images coincide the dual tiling has right triangle and kite faces defined by

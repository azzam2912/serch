it is a lossless compression technique although the video coding standards in which it is used are typically for lossy compression applications cabac is notable for providing much better compression than most other entropy encoding algorithms used in video encoding and it is one of the key elements that provides the h 264 avc encoding scheme with better compression capability than its predecessors in h 264 mpeg 4 avc cabac is only supported in the main and higher profiles of the standard as it requires a larger amount of processing to decode than the simpler scheme known as context adaptive variable length coding cavlc that is used in the standard s baseline profile cabac is also difficult to parallelize and vectorize so other forms of parallelism such as spatial region parallelism may be coupled with its use in hevc cabac is used in all profiles of the standard cabac is based on arithmetic coding with a few innovations and changes to adapt it to the needs of video encoding standards cabac has multiple probability modes for different contexts it first converts all non binary symbols to binary then for each bit the coder selects which probability model to use then

it is a microelectromechanical system that takes advantage of an electrical potential that appears under mechanical stress piezomems can be found in a variety of applications such as switches inkjet printer heads sensors micropumps and energy harvesters interest in piezomems technology began around the early 1990s as scientists explored alternatives to electrostatic actuation in radio frequency rf microelectromechanical systems mems for rf mems electrostatic actuation specialized high voltage charge pump circuits due to small electrode gap spacing and large driving voltages in contrast piezoelectric actuation allowed for high sensitivity as well as low voltage and power consumption as low as a few millivolts it also had the ability to close large vertical gaps while still allowing for low microsecond operating speeds lead zirconate titanate pzt in particular offered the most promise as a piezoelectric material because of its high piezoelectric coefficient tunable dielectric constant and electromechanical coupling coefficient piezomems have been applied to various different technologies from switches to sensors and further research have led to the creation of piezoelectric thin films which aided in the realization of highly integrated piezomems devices the first reported piezoelectrically actuated rf mems switch was developed by scientists at the lg electronics institute of

it displays properties which illustrate promise for innovative cancer treatments but still requires further research dynemicin a was first isolated from the soil in the gujarat state of india it was discovered to be the natural product of the indigenous bacteria micromonospora chersina the natural product displays a bright purple color due to the anthraquinone chromophore structure within dynemicin a initially this compound was isolated for its aesthetic properties as a dye until further research demonstrated its anti cancer properties shortly after the compound s discovery the bristol myers pharmaceutical company first elucidated the structure in japan the structure of dynemicin a was determined from x ray diffraction studies of triacetyldynemicin a a closely related compound the first reported synthesis of dynemicin was accomplished by myers and coworkers dynemicin a is an antitumor natural product isolated from micromonospora chersina which causes dna strand cleavage iwasaki et al first studied the biosynthetic pathway of dynemicin a by c nmr labeling experiments dynemicin a is thought to be biosynthesized separately from two different heptaketide chains originated from seven head to tail coupled acetate units which is then connected to form dynemicin a initially precursors such as 3 and 4 were proposed to

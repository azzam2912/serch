this can be made precise as follows the representation space of a compact oriented 3 manifold m is defined as formula 13 where formula 14 denotes the space of irreducible su 2 representations of formula 15 for a heegaard splitting formula 16 of formula 17 the casson invariant equals formula 18 times the algebraic intersection of formula 19 with formula 20 kevin walker found an extension of the casson invariant to rational homology 3 spheres a casson walker invariant is a surjective map from oriented rational homology 3 spheres to q satisfying the following properties 1 s 0 2 for every 1 component dehn surgery presentation k of an oriented rational homology sphere m in an oriented rational homology sphere m where note that for integer homology spheres the walker s normalization is twice that of casson s formula 26 christine lescop defined an extension of the casson walker invariant to oriented compact 3 manifolds it is uniquely characterized by the following properties the casson walker lescop invariant has the following properties in 1990 c taubes showed that the su 2 casson invariant of a 3 homology sphere m has a gauge theoretic interpretation as the euler characteristic of formula

the dry sump system uses two or more oil pumps and a separate oil reservoir as opposed to a conventional wet sump system which uses only the main sump u s oil pan below the engine and a single pump a dry sump engine requires a pressure relief valve to regulate negative pressure inside the engine so internal seals are not inverted engines are both lubricated and cooled by oil that circulates throughout the engine feeding various bearings and other moving parts and then draining via gravity into the sump at the base of the engine in the wet sump system of most production automobile engines a pump collects this oil from the sump and directly circulates it back through the engine in a dry sump the oil still falls to the base of the engine however instead of collecting in a reservoir style oil sump it falls into a much shallower sump where one or more scavenge pumps draw it away and transfer it to a usually external reservoir where it is both cooled and de aerated before being recirculated through the engine by a pressure pump dry sump designs frequently mount the pressure pump and scavenge pumps on

the gaussian binomial coefficient written as formula 1 or formula 2 is a polynomial in q with integer coefficients whose value when q is set to a prime power counts the number of subspaces of dimension k in a vector space of dimension n over a finite field with q elements the gaussian binomial coefficients are defined by where m and r are non negative integers for the value is 1 since numerator and denominator are both empty products although the formula in the first clause appears to involve a rational function it actually designates a polynomial because the division is exact in z q note that the formula can be applied for and gives 0 due to a factor in the numerator in accordance with the second clause for even larger r the factor 0 remains present in the numerator but its further factors would involve negative powers of q whence explicitly stating the second clause is preferable all of the factors in numerator and denominator are divisible by with as quotient a q number dividing out these factors gives the equivalent formula which makes evident the fact that substituting into formula 6 gives the ordinary binomial coefficient formula

however if the layers become tufted in appearance due to increased airmass instability then the altocumulus clouds become more purely cumuliform in structure like other cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds altocumulus signifies convection a sheet of partially conjoined altocumulus perlucidus is sometimes found preceding a weakening warm front where the altostratus is starting to fragment resulting in patches of altocumulus perlucidus between the areas of altostratus altocumulus is also commonly found between the warm and cold fronts in a depression although this is often hidden by lower clouds towering altocumulus known as altocumulus castellanus frequently signals the development of thunderstorms later in the day as it shows instability and convection in the middle levels of the troposphere the lowest layer of the atmosphere the area where towering cumulus clouds can turn into cumulonimbus it is therefore one of three warning clouds often recorded by the aviation industry the other two being towering cumulus and cumulonimbus altocumulus generally forms about above ground level a similar level to altostratus formations and satellite photography has revealed that the two types of cloud can create formations that can stretch for thousands of square miles extensive altocumulus formations particularly if they take the form of undulatus

until recently there was little evidence unequivocally supporting one side over the other and in the past many scientists either believed in shallow subduction or its complete non existence however the past two decades have witnessed the potential beginning of a change in geologic understanding as new evidence is increasingly indicative of episodic non shallow subduction subduction is the density driven process by which one tectonic plate moves under another and sinks into the mantle at a convergent boundary gravitational pull from dense slabs provides approximately 90 of the driving force for plate tectonics and consequently subduction is crucial in changing the earth s layout guiding its thermal evolution and building its compositional structure in particular subduction zones are the primary sites of present day continental crust formation another process of modern earth that has a mysterious past furthermore subduction is the main mechanism by which surface materials enter the deep earth and is also largely responsible for the formation of ores considering the importance of subduction in many geological processes it is clear that studying its past and present nature is essential to developing our understanding of the earth as a dynamic system those who favour non existent subduction

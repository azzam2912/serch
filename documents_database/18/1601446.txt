a ring r with 1 is called semiprimary if r j r is semisimple and j r is a nilpotent ideal where j r denotes the jacobson radical the theorem states that if r is a semiprimary ring and m is an r module the three module conditions noetherian artinian and has a composition series are equivalent without the semiprimary condition the only true implication is that if m has a composition series then m is both noetherian and artinian the theorem takes its current form from a paper by charles hopkins and a paper by jacob levitzki both in 1939 for this reason it is often cited as the hopkins levitzki theorem however yasuo akizuki is sometimes included since he proved the result for commutative rings a few years earlier in 1935 since it is known that right artinian rings are semiprimary a direct corollary of the theorem is a right artinian ring is also right noetherian the analogous statement for left artinian rings holds as well this is not true in general for artinian modules because there are examples of artinian modules which are not noetherian another direct corollary is that if r is right artinian then r

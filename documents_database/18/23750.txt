the method was in fact first mentioned explicitly by raymond e a c paley and norbert wiener in 1934 the box muller transform is commonly expressed in two forms the basic form as given by box and muller takes two samples from the uniform distribution on the interval 0 1 and maps them to two standard normally distributed samples the polar form takes two samples from a different interval 1 1 and maps them to two normally distributed samples without the use of sine or cosine functions the box muller transform was developed as a more computationally efficient alternative to the inverse transform sampling method the ziggurat algorithm gives a more efficient method for cpu while the box muller transform is superior for gpu furthermore the box muller transform can be employed for drawing from truncated bivariate gaussian densities suppose u and u are independent samples chosen from the uniform distribution on the unit interval 0 1 let and then z and z are independent random variables with a standard normal distribution the derivation is based on a property of a two dimensional cartesian system where x and y coordinates are described by two independent and normally distributed random variables

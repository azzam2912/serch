it is the main contributing current during the repolarizing phase 1 of the cardiac action potential it is a result of the movement of positively charged potassium k ions from the intracellular to the extracellular space i is complemented with i resulting from cl ions to form the transient outward current i i is rapidly activated and deactivated it is activated after the fast increase of the membrane potential following the phase 0 of the cardiac action potential once activated k ions from inside the cells flow to the extracellular space this outward flow of positively charged ions constitutes the i and causes the transmembrane voltage to decrease this decrease of the transmembrane potential is known as repolarization i is then quickly deactivated stopping the repolarization and ending the phase 1 of the action potential i is ca independent and has been clearly demonstrated in myocytes from different cardiac regions and species there are two kinetic variants of cardiac i fast i called i and slow ito called i the channel responsible for i is formed by assembly of kv4 2 kcnd2 subunits kv4 3 kcnd3 subunits or a combination of the two while the channel responsible for i is

boring is a technique used in many aspects of building woodworkers have used boring as a form of drilling for centuries in woodworking the boring tool is static in size and used to form circular plunge cuts in metalworking boring is slightly different in that the hole that results need not be circular in metal boring the tool can be plunged and dragged on the x or y axes to create a slot or asymmetrical hole or channel or it may be moved only in an up and down motion on the z axis to create a perfect circular hole modern boring tools have three primary components although many differing designs the parts include the body bar holder and dial screw graduated micro screw the body made of solid stock has two basic parts the top part threads or presses into the supporting shank the lower part bar holder is connected via dovetail t slots or a smooth notch with an adjustment for bore diameter via the dial screw as the dial screw is adjusted the cutting bit s are moved further out creating a larger cut this also can create some slight distortion if the cutting tool is moved

the large 3 position substituent is required for anticoagulant activity the primary mechanism of the 4 hydroxycoumarin drugs is the inhibition of vitamin k epoxide reductase these compounds are not direct antagonists in the pharmaceutical sense of vitamin k but rather act to deplete reduced vitamin k in tissues for this reason vitamin k antagonizes their effect and this has led to the loose terminology of vitamin k antagonism although 4 hydroxycoumarin itself is not an anticoagulant it is an important fungal metabolite from the precursor coumarin which is also not an anticoagulant and its production leads to further fermentative production of the natural anticoagulant dicoumarol this happens in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde which allows attachment of a second 4 hydroxycoumarin molecule through the linking carbon of the formaldehyde to the 3 position of the first 4 hydroxycoumarin molecule giving the semi dimer the motif of the drug class dicoumarol appears in spoiled sweet clover silages and is considered a natural chemical substance of combined plant and fungal origin mycotoxin also shares these properties the identification of dicoumarol in 1940 is the precursor of the drug class known as 4 hydroxycoumarin see warfarin for this history the synthetic

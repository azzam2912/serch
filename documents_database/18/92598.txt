it is a three dimensional generalization of the one dimensional cantor set and two dimensional sierpinski carpet it was first described by karl menger in 1926 in his studies of the concept of topological dimension the construction of a menger sponge can be described as follows the second iteration gives a level 2 sponge image 2 third from left the third iteration gives a level 3 sponge image 2 4th from left and so on the menger sponge itself is the limit of this process after an infinite number of iterations the n th stage of the menger sponge m is made up of 20 smaller cubes each with a side length of 1 3 the total volume of m is thus 20 27 the total surface area of m is given by the expression 2 20 9 4 8 9 therefore the construction s volume approaches zero while its surface area increases without bound yet any chosen surface in the construction will be thoroughly punctured as the construction continues so that the limit is neither a solid nor a surface it has a topological dimension of 1 and is accordingly identified as a curve each face of the construction

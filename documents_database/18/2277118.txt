the material s toughness is described by irreversible work accompanying crack propagation designing against this crack propagation leads to toughening the material when crack propagates associated irreversible work in different materials classes is different thus the most effective toughening mechanisms differ among different materials classes the crack tip plasticity is important in toughening of metals and long chain polymers ceramics have limited crack tip plasticity and primarily rely on different toughening mechanisms for the case of a ductile material such as a metal this toughness is typically proportional to the fracture stress and strain as well as the gauge length of the crack the plane strain toughness in a metal is given by where formula 2 is the plane strain toughness formula 3 is a constant that incorporates the stress state formula 4 is the tensile flow stress at fracture formula 5 is the tensile fracture strain and formula 6 is the radius of crack tip in a low yield strength material the crack tip can be blunted easily and larger crack tip radius is formed thus in a given metallic alloy toughness in a low strength condition is usually higher than for higher strength conditions because less plasticity is

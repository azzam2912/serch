fossils have only been recovered from the lower elliot formation in south africa and lesotho and in one locality in zimbabwe in 1863 alfred brown recovered fossil material consisting of limb bones and vertebrae in the lower elliot formation in the southeastern free state in 1866 thomas henry huxley first described euskelosaurus from brown s fossil material and named the holotype specimen euskelosaurus brownii after brown harry seeley later described euskelosaurus in 1894 as did friedrich von huene in 1902 since then other researchers including robert broom have mentioned euskelosaurus in their papers euskelosaurus is considered to have been a large robust member of the sauropodomorph clade estimates from the existing fossil material measure this dinosaur at about 10m in length its bones are robust and it had a graviportal limb arrangement a key character trait of basal sauropodomorphs while paleontologists currently consider euskelosaurus a basal plateosaurid sauropodomorph many paleontologists consider euskelosaurus a waste basket taxon its phylogenetic relationships are poorly understood and warrant further study

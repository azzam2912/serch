it is also known as mean square weighted deviation mswd in isotopic dating and variance of unit weight in the context of weighted least squares its square root is called regression standard error standard error of the regression or standard error of the equation it is defined as chi squared per degree of freedom where the chi squared is a weighted sum of squared deviations with inputs variance formula 3 observations o and calculated data c the degree of freedom formula 4 equals the number of observations n minus the number of fitted parameters m in weighted least squares the definition is often written in matrix notation as where r is the vector of residuals and w is the weight matrix the inverse of the input diagonal covariance matrix of observations as a rule of thumb when the variance of the measurement error is known a priori a formula 6 indicates a poor model fit a formula 7 indicates that the fit has not fully captured the data or that the error variance has been underestimated in principle a value of formula 8 indicates that the extent of the match between observations and estimates is in accord with the error

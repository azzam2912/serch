the most common substrates are chlorinated aliphatics pce tce chlorinated phenols dehalorespiring bacteria are highly diverse this trait is found in some proteobacteria chloroflexi green nonsulfur bacteria low g c gram positive clostridia and ultramicrobacteria the process of halorespiration or dehalorespiration uses reductive dehalogenation to produce energy that can be used by the respiring microorganism to carry out its growth and metabolism halogenated organic compounds are used as the terminal electron acceptor which results in their dehalogenation reductive dehalogenation is the process by which this occurs it involves the reduction of halogenated compounds by removing the halogen substituents while simultaneously adding electrons to the compound hydrogenolysis and vicinal reduction are the two known processes of this mechanism that have been identified in both processes the removed halogen substituents are released as anions reductive dehalogenation is catalyzed by reductive dehalogenases which are membrane associated enzymes most of these enzymes contain iron sulfur fe s clusters and a corrinoid cofactor at their active sites although the exact mechanism is unknown research suggests that these two components of the enzyme may be involved in the reduction common substrates that are used as terminal electron acceptors in dehalorespiration are organochloride pesticides aryl halides and

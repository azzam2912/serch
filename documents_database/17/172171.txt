some common examples of hydrolase enzymes are esterases including lipases phosphatases glycosidases peptidases and nucleosidases esterases cleave ester bonds in lipids and phosphatases cleave phosphate groups off molecules an example of crucial esterase is the acetylcholine esterase which assists in transforming the neuron impulse into acetic acid after it the hydrolase breaks the acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid acetic acid is an important metabolite in the body and a critical intermediate for other reactions such as glycolysis lipases hydrolyze glycerides glycosidases cleave sugar molecules off carbohydrates and peptidases hydrolyze peptide bonds nucleosidases hydrolyze the bonds of nucleotides hydrolase enzymes are important for the body because they have degradative properties in lipids lipases contribute to the breakdown of fats and lipoproteins and other larger molecules into smaller molecules like fatty acids and glycerol fatty acids and other small molecules are used for synthesis and as a source of energy in biochemistry a hydrolase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a chemical bond for example any enzyme that catalyzes the following reaction is a hydrolase where a b represents a chemical bond of unspecified molecules systematic names of hydrolases are formed as substrate hydrolase however common names are typically

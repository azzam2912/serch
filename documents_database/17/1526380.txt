in this field nucleic acids are used as non biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells researchers in the field have created static structures such as two and three dimensional crystal lattices nanotubes polyhedra and arbitrary shapes and functional devices such as molecular machines and dna computers the field is beginning to be used as a tool to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics including applications in x ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins to determine structures potential applications in molecular scale electronics and nanomedicine are also being investigated the conceptual foundation for dna nanotechnology was first laid out by nadrian seeman in the early 1980s and the field began to attract widespread interest in the mid 2000s this use of nucleic acids is enabled by their strict base pairing rules which cause only portions of strands with complementary base sequences to bind together to form strong rigid double helix structures this allows for the rational design of base sequences that will selectively assemble to form complex target structures with precisely controlled nanoscale features several assembly methods are used to make these structures including tile

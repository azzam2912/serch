cerevisiae sirt3 is member of the mammalian sirtuin family of proteins which are homologs to the yeast sir2 protein sirt3 exhibits nad dependent deacetylase activity members of the sirtuin family are characterized by a sirtuin core domain and grouped into four classes and the protein encoded by this gene is included in class i of the sirtuin family the human sirtuins have a range of molecular functions and have emerged as important proteins in aging stress resistance and metabolic regulation yeast sirtuin proteins are known to regulate epigenetic gene silencing and suppress recombination of rdna in addition to protein deacetylation studies have shown that the human sirtuins may also function as intracellular regulatory proteins with mono adp ribosyltransferase activity sirt3 is a soluble protein located in the mitochondrial matrix and contains a mitochondrial processing peptide at the n terminus a set of crystal structures of human sirt3 have been solved including an apo structure with no substrate a structure with a peptide containing acetyl lysine of its natural substrate acetyl coa synthetase 2 a reaction intermediate structure trapped by a thioacetyl peptide and a structure with the dethioacetylated peptide bond these structures show the conformational changes induced by the two

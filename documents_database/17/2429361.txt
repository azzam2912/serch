he studied physics at the university of minnesota and physics and mathematics at the university of michigan where he wrote his dissertation entitled symmetry breaking in fluid dynamics lie group reducible motions for real fluids receiving his phd in 1976 supervised by roy axford a result discovered in this work was later used to substantiate the accuracy of the los alamos on site yield verification method corrtex for the us ussr threshold test ban treaty ttbt holm s main research contributions have been in nonlinear science from integrable to chaotic behaviour from solitons to turbulence and from fluid dynamics to shape analysis much of this work is based on lie symmetry reduction from hamilton s principle he joined los alamos national laboratory in 1971 moving to the theoretical division in 1980 where he helped found the center for nonlinear studies and served as its acting director with roberto camassa he derived the camassa holm equation which is an integrable partial differential equation for nonlinear shallow water waves whose solutions in the dispersionless limit are peaked solitons so called peakons published in 1993 in 2005 he moved to imperial college london as professor of applied mathematics and mathematical physics supported by

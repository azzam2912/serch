the surface plate is often used as the baseline for all measurements to a workpiece therefore one primary surface is finished extremely flat with tolerances below per 2960 mm for a grade 0 plate surface plates are a common tool in the manufacturing industry and are often permanently attached to robotic type inspection devices such as a coordinate measuring machine plates are typically square or rectangular there are varying grades used to describe the accuracy of some metrology equipment such as aa a b and workshop grade while workshop grade is the least accurate the plates are often held to a high degree of flatness surface plates must be calibrated regularly to ensure that chipping warping or wear has not occurred a common problem is wear to particular areas such as that caused by the frequent use of a tool in one place such as a height gauge that causes an uneven surface and reduces overall accuracy of the plate tools and workpieces may also cause damage when dropped on the surface plate also damage can be caused when swarf and other debris has not been removed this will result in erroneous measurements damage to the plate can only be

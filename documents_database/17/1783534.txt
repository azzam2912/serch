in contrast to scalar radiative transfer rt which models only the first stokes component the intensity vrt models all four components through vector methods for a single frequency formula 1 the vrt equation for a scattering media can be written as follows where s is the path formula 3 is the propagation vector k is the extinction matrix formula 4 is the absorption vector b is the planck function and z is the scattering phase matrix all the coefficient matrices k formula 4 and z will vary depending on the density of absorbers scatterers present and must be calculated from their density independent quantities that is the attenuation coefficient vector formula 4 is calculated from the mass absorption coefficient vector times the density of the absorber moreover it is typical for media to have multiple species causing extinction absorption and scattering thus these coefficient matrices must be summed up over all the different species extinction is caused both by simple absorption as well as from scattering out of the line of sight formula 3 therefore we calculate the extinction matrix from the combination of the absorption vector and the scattering phase matrix where i is the identity matrix the four

this type of laser is unique from other types in that it does not require any artificial energy source the two most studied lasing media for solar pumped lasers have been iodine with a laser wavelength of 1 31 micrometers and which lases at 1 06 micrometers wavelength solar pumped semiconductor lasers have also been proposed by landis and others solar pumped lasers are not used commercially because the low cost of electricity in most locations means that other more efficient types of lasers that run on electrical power can be more economically used solar pumped lasers might become useful in off grid locations very fine grained dispersed powders can be produced by the use of laser synthesis technology a leader in this field is shigeaki uchida and his team in japan tokyo osaka their design uses fresnel lenses and a solar pumped laser to drive a magnesium based cycle which produces hydrogen gas as its product since there is no grid power in space most spacecraft today use solar power sources mostly photovoltaic solar cells powering lasers requires high levels of power so the inefficiency of pv solar cells usually less than 27 efficiency motivates interest in solar pumping

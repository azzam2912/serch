thermal equilibrium obeys the zeroth law of thermodynamics a system is said to be in thermal equilibrium with itself if the temperature within the system is spatially uniform and temporally constant systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are always in thermal equilibrium but the converse is not always true if the connection between the systems allows transfer of energy as heat but does not allow transfer of matter or transfer of energy as work the two systems may reach thermal equilibrium without reaching thermodynamic equilibrium the relation of thermal equilibrium is an instance of equilibrium between two bodies which means that it refers to transfer through a selectively permeable partition the contact path for the relation of thermal equilibrium the contact path is permeable only to heat it does not permit the passage of matter or work it is called a diathermal connection according to lieb and yngvason the essential meaning of the relation of thermal equilibrium includes that it is reflexive and symmetric it is not included in the essential meaning whether it is or is not transitive after discussing the semantics of the definition they postulate a substantial physical axiom that they call the zeroth law of thermodynamics that thermal

once foreground images are extracted then desired algorithms such as those for motion tracking object tracking and facial recognition may be executed using these images however background subtraction requires that the background image is already available and unfortunately this is not always the case traditionally the background image is searched for manually or automatically from the video images when there are no objects more recently automatic background generation through object detection medial filtering medoid filtering approximated median filtering linear predictive filter non parametric model kalman filter and adaptive smoothening have been suggested however most of these methods have high computational complexity and are resource intensive the teknomo fernandez algorithm is also an automatic background generation algorithm its advantage however is its computational speed of only formula 1 time depending on the resolution formula 3 of an image and its accuracy gained within a manageable number of frames only at least three frames from a video is needed to produce the background image assuming that for every pixel position the background occurs in the majority of the videos furthermore it can be performed for both grayscale and colored videos generally however the algorithm will certainly work whenever the following single important

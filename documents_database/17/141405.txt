following that year s treaty of union the kingdom of scots and the kingdom of england were combined under the name of great britain and a new peerage of great britain was introduced in which subsequent titles were created after the union the peers of the ancient parliament of scotland elected 16 representative peers to sit in the house of lords the peerage act 1963 granted all scottish peers the right to sit in the house of lords but this automatic right was revoked as for all hereditary peerages except those of the incumbent earl marshal and lord great chamberlain when the house of lords act 1999 received royal assent had the scottish people voted yes in the 2014 scottish independence referendum the eligibility of peers of scotland to sit in the house of lords would have been reviewed unlike most peerages many scottish titles have been granted with remainder to pass via female offspring thus an italian family has succeeded to and presently holds the earldom of newburgh and in the case of daughters only these titles devolve to the eldest daughter rather than falling into abeyance as is the case with ancient english baronies by writ of summons

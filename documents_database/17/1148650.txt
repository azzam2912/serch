these proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis this gene is a member of the wnt gene family it encodes a protein showing 99 and 91 amino acid identity to the mouse and xenopus wnt7a proteins respectively among members of the human wnt family this protein is most similar to wnt7a protein 77 1 total amino acid identity this gene may play important roles in the development and progression of gastric cancer esophageal cancer and pancreatic cancer wnt7b is a key paracrine signaling factor secreted by the ureteric epithelium that establishes the cortico medullary axis of the mammalian kidney wnt7b is a signaling protein that plays a crucial role for many developmental processes including placental lung eye dendrite and bone formation along with kidney development the primary role of wnt7b is to establish the cortico medullary axis of epithelial organization the establishment of the cortico medullary axis plays an essential role for the development of the medullary component of the kidney wnt7b regulates orientation of cell divisions in renal medullary collecting duct epithelium in which is the major structure driving renal medulla formation there are two interstitial

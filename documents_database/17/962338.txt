the genus polylepis originated in the eastern south america andean forests the plant has small pinnate leaves 7 10 cm long normally composed of five or seven leaflets in harsh winters polylepis australis survives by producing rolls of loose papery like exfoliating brownish bark the rough outer covering of the woody stem of tree the southernmost stands of polylepis australis are located in the high c rdoba mountains of central argentina 1 200 2 884 m above sea level south american polylepis mountain forests are recognised as being one of the most endangered forest ecosystems in the world during a reforestation project d renison university of c rdoba argentina found that the germination of polylepis australis stands decreases significantly with decreasing tree coverage the first results of additional studies carried out in collaboration with isabell hensen university of halle germany indicate that a clear negative correlation exists between the viability of seeds of polylepis australis and the degree of human influence on the woodland stands seeds of polylepis australis exhibited a great variation in terms of mass and percent seed germination among individual trees and among geographical regions

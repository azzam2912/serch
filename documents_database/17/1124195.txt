when hand pressure is applied to the bottle the liquid inside becomes pressurized and is forced out of the nozzle into a narrow stream of liquid most wash bottles are made up of polyethylene which is a flexible solvent resistant petroleum based plastic most bottles contain an internal dip tube allowing upright use wash bottles may be filled with a range of common laboratory solvents and reagents according to the work to be undertaken these include deionized water detergent solutions and rinse solvents such as acetone isopropanol or ethanol in biological labs it is common to keep sodium hypochlorite solution in a wash bottle to disinfect unneeded cultures there are a consistent set of colour codes and markings used to identify the contents of wash bottles red is used for acetone white for ethanol or sodium hypochlorite green for methanol yellow for isopropanol and blue for distilled water safety warning labels are also used to identify potential hazards where reagents with high vapour pressure are used such as ethanol or methanol small pressure release holes are incorporated into the cap to release and excess vapour pressure and avoid material being ejected through the nozzle when not in use the use

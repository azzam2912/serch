as such polymake uses many third party software packages for specialized computations thereby providing a common interface and bridge between different tools a user can easily and unknowingly switch between using different software packages in the process of computing properties of a polytope polymake internally uses a server client model where the server holds information about each object e g a polytope and the clients sends requests to compute properties the server has the job of determining how to complete each request from information already known about each object using a rule based system for example there are many rules on how to compute the facets of a polytope facets can be computed from a vertex description of the polytope and from a possibly redundant inequality description polymake builds a dependency graph outlining the steps to process each request and selects the best path via a dijkstra type algorithm polymake can be used within a perl script moreover users can extend polymake and define new objects properties rules for computing properties and algorithms polymake divides its collection of functions and objects into 10 different groups called applications they behave like c namespaces the polytope application was the first one developed

it is one of the final phases of genetic recombination which occurs in the pachytene stage of prophase i of meiosis during a process called synapsis synapsis begins before the synaptonemal complex develops and is not completed until near the end of prophase i crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome crossing over was described in theory by thomas hunt morgan he relied on the discovery of frans alfons janssens who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it chiasmatypie the term chiasma is linked if not identical to chromosomal crossover morgan immediately saw the great importance of janssens cytological interpretation of chiasmata to the experimental results of his research on the heredity of drosophila the physical basis of crossing over was first demonstrated by harriet creighton and barbara mcclintock in 1931 the linked frequency of crossing over between two gene loci markers is the crossing over value for fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure chromosome tends to be constant and the same is then true for the crossing over value which is used in the production of genetic

the underlying scheme programming language has a long tradition of use in theoretical computer science artificial intelligence and rapid program development the scheme programming language was designed as a simplified and more abstract variant of the early lisp programming language the first lisp implementation was available in 1958 scheme was introduced in 1975 development of lambdanative toolkit started in 2009 at the pediatric anesthesia research team part in vancouver canada it was initially used as an in house platform for a closed loop intravenous anesthesia system support for mobile platforms was added as part became engaged in global health projects in 2010 the core lambdanative framework was open sourced in 2013 lambdanative combines the possibilities of a rapid prototyping environment using scheme and c programming languages feature of the underlying gambit c implementation with easy cross platform software generation and a set of modules including gui programming fast fourier transform and modules to access typical phone hardware components such as camera gps and audio lambdanative is released under the bsd license lambdanative supports building native applications for the following operating systems lambdanative applications are written in the scheme language which can be easily mixed with c code scheme is a

it includes 24 extant species in six genera and three subfamilies peltopsinae with one genus peltops artaminae with one genus containing the woodswallows and cracticinae currawongs butcherbirds and the australian magpie artamids used to be monotypic containing only the woodswallows but it was expanded to include the family cracticidae in 1994 some authors however still treat the two as separate families some species in this family are known for their beautiful song their feeding habits vary from nectar sucking woodswallows to predation on small birds pied currawong the family artamidae was introduced by the irish zoologist nicholas aylward vigors in 1825 the artamids are part of the malaconotoidea superfamily a lineage which is widespread through australasia and consists of a vast diversity of omnivorous and carnivorous songbirds artamids has been divided over time into two subfamilies with few studies and dispute on the inclusion of cracticidae within the family artamidae it appears they have been placed in this respective joint position due to lack of evidence or knowledge jerome fuchs and colleagues extensively analysed both the mitochondrial and nuclear dna of the artamid family the results suggested that the group may have existed in australasia for 33 7 to 45

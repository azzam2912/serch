such accumulation is referred to as epibiosis when the host surface is another organism and the relationship is not parasitic antifouling is the ability of specifically designed materials and coatings to remove or prevent biofouling by any number of organisms on wetted surfaces since biofouling can occur almost anywhere water is present biofouling poses risks to a wide variety of objects such as medical devices and membranes as well as to entire industries such as paper manufacturing food processing underwater construction and desalination plants specifically the buildup of biofouling on marine vessels poses a significant problem in some instances the hull structure and propulsion systems can be damaged the accumulation of biofoulers on hulls can increase both the hydrodynamic volume of a vessel and the hydrodynamic friction leading to increased drag of up to 60 the drag increase has been seen to decrease speeds by up to 10 which can require up to a 40 increase in fuel to compensate with fuel typically comprising up to half of marine transport costs antifouling methods are estimated to save the shipping industry around 60 billion per year increased fuel use due to biofouling contributes to adverse environmental effects and is predicted to

it has elements of the ring as its vertices and pairs of elements whose product is zero as its edges there are two variations of the zero divisor graph commonly used in the original definition of the vertices represent all elements of the ring in a later variant studied by the vertices represent only the zero divisors of the given ring if formula 1 is a semiprime number the product of two prime numbers then the zero divisor graph of the ring of integers modulo formula 1 with only the zero divisors as its vertices is either a complete graph or a complete bipartite graph it is a complete graph formula 3 in the case that formula 4 for some prime number formula 5 for in this case the vertices are all the nonzero multiples of formula 5 and the product of any two of these numbers is 0 modulo formula 7 it is a complete bipartite graph formula 8 in the case that formula 9 for two distinct prime numbers formula 5 and formula 11 the two sides of the bipartition are the formula 12 nonzero multiples of formula 11 and the formula 14 nonzero multiples of formula 5

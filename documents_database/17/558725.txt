prior to the demonstration that depolarization induced suppression of inhibition was dependent on the cannabinoid cb1 receptor function there was no way of producing an in vitro endocannabinoid mediated effect depolarization induced suppression of inhibition is classically produced in a brain slice experiment i e a 300 400 m slice of brain with intact axons and synapses where a single neuron is depolarized the normal 70 mv potential across the neuronal membrane is reduced usually to 30 to 0 mv for a period of 1 to 10 seconds after the depolarization inhibitory gaba mediated neurotransmission is reduced this has been demonstrated to be caused by the release of endogenous cannabinoids from the depolarized neuron which diffuses to nearby neurons and binds and activates cb1 receptors which act presynaptically to reduce neurotransmitter release depolarization induced suppression of inhibition was discovered in 1992 by vincent et al 1992 working in purkinje cells of the cerebellum then confirmed in the hippocampus by pitler alger 1992 these groups were studying the responses of large pyramidal projection neurons to gaba the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system gaba is typically released by small interneurons in many regions of the brain where its job

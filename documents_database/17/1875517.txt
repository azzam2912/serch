the characters as written during the 2nd and 1st millennia bce the era during which the vast majority of cuneiform texts were written are considered font variants of the same characters the final proposal for unicode encoding of the script was submitted by two cuneiform scholars working with an experienced unicode proposal writer in june 2004 the base character inventory is derived from the list of ur iii signs compiled by the cuneiform digital library initiative of ucla based on the inventories of miguel civil rykle borger 2003 and robert englund rather than opting for a direct ordering by glyph shape and complexity according to the numbering of an existing catalogue the unicode order of glyphs was based on the latin alphabetic order of their main sumerian transliteration as a practical approximation the following table allows matching of borger s 1981 and 2003 numbering with unicode characters the primary transliteration column has the glyphs sumerian values as given by the official glyph name slightly modified here for legibility by including traditional assyriological symbols such as x rather than times the exact unicode names can be unambiguously recovered by prefixing cuneiform numeric sign replacing times for x plus for and over

the term came into general use in the usa from the 1960s onwards and alludes to a type of rifle cartridge or rifle cartridge combination that will shoot very accurately and with an exceptionally flat trajectory out to distances of 300 500 yards thereby minimising the need for very precise distance judging before taking a shot cartridge rifle combinations with extremely flat shooting characteristics are especially appreciated by those sportsmen who hunt in steep mountainous terrain often having to make informed guesstimates about the distances of deer and other game animals seen on the far sides of dead ground such as valleys and canyons hence the term although any very high velocity flat shooting cartridge rifle combo will qualify as a canyon rifle the term has been particularly associated with the very flat shooting ranges of magnum cartridges and appropriately chambered rifles devised and marketed by roy weatherby and more recently by lazzeroni an important english rifle and cartridge designer who sought a ballistic solution to shooting in mountainous surroundings was david lloyd who developed the 244 h h magnum cartridge and the lloyd rifle during the 1950s specifically for such conditions

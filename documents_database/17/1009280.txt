these ions carry the positive charge formula 1 where formula 2 is the atomic number of the atom examples of hydrogen like ions are he li be and b because hydrogen like ions are two particle systems with an interaction depending only on the distance between the two particles their non relativistic schr dinger equation can be solved in analytic form as can the relativistic dirac equation the solutions are one electron functions and are referred to as hydrogen like atomic orbitals other systems may also be referred to as hydrogen like atoms such as muonium an electron orbiting an antimuon positronium an electron and a positron certain exotic atoms formed with other particles or rydberg atoms in which one electron is in such a high energy state that it sees the rest of the atom practically as a point charge in the solution to the schr dinger equation which is non relativistic hydrogen like atomic orbitals are eigenfunctions of the one electron angular momentum operator l and its z component l a hydrogen like atomic orbital is uniquely identified by the values of the principal quantum number n the angular momentum quantum number l and the magnetic quantum number

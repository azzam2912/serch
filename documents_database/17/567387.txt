the ability to virtually instantaneously change the growth direction of their columnar morphology through simple variations in the direction of the incident vapor flux leads to a wide spectrum of columnar forms these forms can be the column diameter and the column separation normal to the thickness direction of any stf are nominally constant the column diameter can range from about 10 to 300 nm while the density may lie between its theoretical maximum value to less than 20 thereof the crystallinity must be at a scale smaller than the column diameter the chemical composition is essentially unlimited ranging from insulators to semiconductors to metals most recently polymeric stfs have been deposited by combining physical and chemical vapor deposition processes and deposition on micropatterned substrates has also been carried out to date the chief applications of stfs are in optics as polarization filters bragg filters and spectral hole filters at visible and infrared wavelengths a single section stf is a unidirectionally nonhomogeneous continuum with direction dependent properties several sections can be grown consecutively into a multisection stf which can be conceived of as an optical circuit that can be integrated with electronic circuitry on a chip being porous an stf

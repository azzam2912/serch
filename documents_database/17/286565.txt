specifically it is an outer membrane protein that promotes adhesion to tracheal epithelial cells prn is purified from bordetella pertussis and is used for the vaccine production as one of the important components of acellular pertussis vaccine a large part of the n terminus of the pertactin protein is composed of beta helix repeats this region of the pertactin protein is secreted through the c terminal autotransporter the n terminal signal sequences promotes the secretion of prn into the periplasm through the bacterial secretion system sec and consequently the translocation into the outer membrane where it is proteolytically cleaved the loops in the right handed helix of the n terminus that protrudes out of cell surface region r1 contains sequence repeats gly gly xaa xaa pro and the rgd domain arg gly asp this rgd domain allows prn to function as an adhesin and invasin binding to integrins on the outer membrane of the cell another loop of the extending helix is region 2 r2 which contains pro gln pro pqp repeats towards the c terminus this protein s contribution to immunity is still premature reports suggest that r1 and r2 are immunogenic regions however recent studies regarding genetic variation

this can be described as high hydrogen stoichiometry examples include iron pentahydride feh lih and lih the more well known lithium hydride only has one hydrogen atom polyhydrides are only known to be stable under high pressure polyhydrides are important because they can form substances with a very high density of hydrogen they may resemble the elusive metallic hydrogen but can be made under lower pressures one possibility is that they could be superconductors hydrogen sulfide under high pressures forms sh units and can be a superconductor at and a pressure of 1 5 million atmospheres the polyhydrides of alkaline earth and alkali metals contain cage structures also hydrogen may be clustered into h h or h units polyhydrides of transition metals may have the hydrogen atoms arranged around the metal atom computations suggest that increasing hydrogen levels will reduce the dimensionality of the metal arrangement so that layers form separated by hydrogen sheets the h substructure is linear h would form triangular structures in the hypothetical hcl when sodium hydride is compressed with hydrogen nah and nah form these are formed at 30 gpa and 2 100 k heating and compressing a metal with ammonia borane avoids using bulky

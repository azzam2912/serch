bittyrant is designed to give preference to clients uploading to it fastest and limiting slower uploaders it is free software and cross platform currently available for windows os x and linux bittyrant is a result of research projects at university of washington and university of massachusetts amherst developed and supported by professors tom anderson arvind krishnamurthy arun venkataramani and students michael piatek jarret falkner and tomas isdal the paper describing how it works do incentives build robustness in bittorrent sought to challenge the common belief that bittorrent s must upload to download transfer protocol prevents strategic clients from gaming the system it won a best student paper award at the 2007 networked systems design and implementation conference as a strategic client it has demonstrated an average increase in download speed by 70 over a standard bittorrent client non bittyrant leechers in the swarm may receive a decrease in download speed even so if all clients are bittyrant high capacity peers are more effectively utilized allowing for an overall increase in download speed however there is a caveat if high capacity peers are involved in many swarms low capacity peers lose some performance like azureus bittyrant also supports the use of

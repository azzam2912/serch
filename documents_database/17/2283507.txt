the sndp is a charitable society working for the spiritual and educational uplift of the ezhava community for the past 114 years the sndp yogam drew inspiration from the ideas of narayana guru which suited the aspirations of the upwardly mobile ezhava middle class who were the main benefactors of the movement in both religious and social matters the guru was a traditionalist who strove to create a modern outlook among the masses narayana guru conceived of the temple as a social space where everybody could meet and exchange ideas while pursuing his spiritual mission he advocated education industrialization and abolition of caste as necessary prerequisites for social regeneration guru stood against caste based discrimination that was largely prevalent in kerala as also across india this work demonstrates that the sndp was an organization of an emerging ezhava middle class which worked as both its strength and weakness it focused on such issues as education employment in government service industrialization abolition of cyclical rituals and caste anti alcoholism and the demand for a new law of inheritance however some mismatch between principles and practice exist in the functioning of the sndp yogam

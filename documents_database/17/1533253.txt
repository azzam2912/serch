in the actin remodeling of neurons the protein actin is part of the process to change the shape and structure of dendritic spines g actin is the monomer form of actin and is uniformly distributed throughout the axon and the dendrite f actin is the polymer form of actin and its presence in dendritic spines is associated with their change in shape and structure actin plays a role in the formation of new spines as well as stabilizing spine volume increase the changes that actin brings about lead to the formation of new synapses as well as increased cell communication actin remodeling consists of the dynamic changes in actin polymerization that underlie the morphological changes at the neural synapse actin is only able to cause all of the changes that promote long term potentiation ltp through its formation from g actin into f actin when f actin is unable to form long term depression ltd is induced which promotes opposite results stimulation of the neuron that promotes ltp causes larger spine volume increased cell communication and a greater ratio of f actin to g actin in the ltd environment spine volume is decreased cell communication is decreased and there is

roughly speaking it states that a smooth enough function near a critical point can be expressed as a quadratic form after a suitable change of coordinates the morse palais lemma was originally proved in the finite dimensional case by the american mathematician marston morse using the gram schmidt orthogonalization process this result plays a crucial role in morse theory the generalization to hilbert spaces is due to richard palais and stephen smale let h be a real hilbert space and let u be an open neighbourhood of 0 in h let f u r be a k 2 times continuously differentiable function with k 1 i e f c u r assume that f 0 0 and that 0 is a non degenerate critical point of f i e the second derivative d f 0 defines an isomorphism of h with its continuous dual space h by then there exists a subneighbourhood v of 0 in u a diffeomorphism v v that is c with c inverse and an invertible symmetric operator a h h such that for all x v let f u r be c such that 0 is a non degenerate critical point then there exists a

the impulse travels next through the left and right atria and summates at the atrioventricular node from the av node the electrical impulse travels down the bundle of his and divides into the right and left bundle branches the right bundle branch contains one fascicle the left bundle branch subdivides into two fascicles the left anterior fascicle and the left posterior fascicle other sources divide the left bundle branch into three fascicles the left anterior the left posterior and the left septal fascicle the thicker left posterior fascicle bifurcates with one fascicle being in the septal aspect ultimately the fascicles divide into millions of purkinje fibres which in turn interdigitate with individual cardiac myocytes allowing for rapid coordinated and synchronous physiologic depolarization of the ventricles when a bundle branch or fascicle becomes injured by underlying heart disease myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery it may cease to conduct electrical impulses appropriately this results in altered pathways for ventricular depolarization since the electrical impulse can no longer use the preferred pathway across the bundle branch it may move instead through muscle fibers in a way that both slows the electrical movement and changes the directional propagation of the impulses as a result

an ohv engine s valvetrain operates its valves via a camshaft within the cylinder block cam followers or tappets pushrods and rocker arms the ohv engine was an advance over the older flathead engine whose valves were situated in the cylinder block some early ohv engines known as f heads used both side valves and overhead valves a variation over the ohv design is the overhead camshaft or ohc engine whose camshaft lies in the cylinder head itself above the valves to avoid confusion ohc engines are not referred to as ohv despite also having their valves in the head in early 1894 rudolf diesel s second diesel engine prototype was built with a cylinder head featuring push rods rocker arms and poppet valves diesel had published this design in 1893 in 1896 u s patent 563 140 awarded to william f davis illustrated a gasoline engine with the same head configuration patenting his solution to the problem of how to cool the head which problem had made the overhead valve engine difficult before then henry ford s quadricycle of 1896 had valves in the head with push rods for exhaust valves only the intake using suction valves in 1898

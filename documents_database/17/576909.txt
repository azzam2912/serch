the study of super vector spaces and their generalizations is sometimes called super linear algebra these objects find their principal application in theoretical physics where they are used to describe the various algebraic aspects of supersymmetry a super vector space is a formula 1 graded vector space with decomposition vectors that are elements of either formula 7 or formula 8 are said to be homogeneous the parity of a nonzero homogeneous element denoted by formula 9 is formula 3 or formula 4 according to whether it is in formula 7 or formula 8 vectors of parity 0 are called even and those of parity 1 are called odd in theoretical physics the even elements are sometimes called bose elements or bosonic and the odd elements fermi elements or fermionic definitions for super vector spaces are often given only in terms of homogeneous elements and then extended to nonhomogeneous elements by linearity if formula 15 is finite dimensional and the dimensions of formula 7 and formula 8 are formula 18 and formula 19 respectively then formula 15 is said to have dimension formula 21 the standard super coordinate space denoted formula 22 is the ordinary coordinate space formula 23 where the

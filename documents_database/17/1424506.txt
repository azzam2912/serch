it is used for grounding earthing coaxial cables of copper or aluminium on antenna installations for telecommunication mobile communications grounding kits earthing kits are composed of two main components a clamp and a cable the clamp will be screwed on a coaxial cable and in case of lightning strokes in the antenna installation the voltage will be diverted over a ripple in the clamp with the combined cable and will be earthed grounded by this way the clamps of the grounding kits earthing kits are composed of an ozone and uv resistant rubber coat with a device where the ripple can be lodged the tin plated ripple with a special alloying enables the bridging over big tolerances between kit and coaxial cable which is important for a best possible voltage transmission the ripple to the skinned coaxial cable has a low contact resistance between 0 10 and 0 15 m it also enables a better length compensation as well as even and low contact pressures which avoids damages on the coaxial cable these characteristics are known as relaxation behaviour for assembling a grounding kit earthing kit with integrated cable lug the coaxial cable is skinned the grounding kit earthing kit

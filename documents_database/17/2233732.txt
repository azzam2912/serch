this species has been used as a model for human plasmodium vivax because plasmodium cynomolgi shares the same life cycle and some important biological features with p vivax the life cycle of p cynomolgi resembles that of other plasmodium species particularly the related human parasite plasmodium vivax like other plasmodium species p cynomolgi infects both an insect host and a vertebrate generally old world monkeys the parasite is transmitted when the mosquito host takes a blood meal from the vertebrate host during the feeding motile parasites called sporozoites are injected from the mosquito salivary gland into the host tissue these sporozoites move into the bloodstream and infect cells in the host liver where they grow and divide over the course of approximately one week at this point the parasitized liver cells rupture releasing thousands of parasite daughter cells called merozoites which either move into the bloodstream to infect red blood cells or remain in the liver to reinfect liver cells those that reinfect liver cells form a quiescent stage called a hypnozoite which can remain dormant in the liver cell for months or years before reactivating the merozoites that enter the bloodstream infect red blood cells where they grow and

it is associated with derbylite hematite rutile karelianite siderite and calcite founded in the buca della vena mine tuscany italy the mineral was called dessauite in honor of professor gabor dessau 1907 1983 dessauite occurs as small flattened rhombohedral crystals tabular 001 with hexagonal outline members of the crichtonite group may be confused with ilmenite or hematite the difference between dessauite and other minerals in the crichonite group is the occurrence of three additional octahedral sites and of a site in square pyramidal coordination all with low occupancies the mineral is black and opaque presents a metallic luster and it is brittle dessauite presents dimensions of diameter up to 1mm and thickness up to 0 2mm in reflected plane polarized light the color is ash grey with pale bluish tones the calculated density is 4 68 g cm the habit is tabular forming thin dimensions in one direction and hardness of 6 5 and 7 dessauite differs from other elements of the crichtonite group because of the quantity of cations and x ray diffraction pattern dessauite was found in the buca della vena mine apuan alps northern tuscany italy with many other minerals coming from hydrothermal fluids circulating through a

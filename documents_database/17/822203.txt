most vegetation around the world lacks sufficient amounts of phosphate phosphorus is an essential mineral for all animals as it plays a major role in the formation of the skeletal system and is necessary for many biological processes including energy metabolism protein synthesis cell signaling and lactation phosphate deficiencies can cause physiological side effects especially pertaining to the reproductive system as well as side effects of delayed growth and failure to regenerate new bone the importance of having sufficient amounts of phosphorus further resides in the physiological importance of maintaining a proper phosphorus to calcium ratio having a ca p ratio of 2 1 is important for the absorption of these minerals as deviations from this optimal ratio can inhibit their absorption dietary calcium and phosphorus ratio along with vitamin d regulates bone mineralization and turnover by affecting calcium and phosphorus transport and absorption in the intestine it has been suggested that osteophagy is an innate behavior that allows animals to supplement their phosphorus and calcium uptake in order to avoid the costly effects of deficiencies in these minerals osteophagic behavior has been observed in pastoral and wild animals most notably ungulates and other herbivores for over two hundred years

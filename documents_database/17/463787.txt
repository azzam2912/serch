any non linear junction in the vicinity for example and particularly the p n junction will receive this energy and because of the asymmetric response of the junction to an electric field it will rectify it re emitting some of it on multiples of the illumination frequency see harmonic the detector has a sensitive receiver tuned to these harmonics as well as appropriate processing and displays to make their presence known to the user of the device because the basis of almost all semiconductor electronics is the p n junction an nljd is correspondingly capable of detecting almost any unshielded electronic device containing semiconductors whether the electronics are actively powered or not in its basic form an nljd can also detect things that are not themselves electronic in nature so the use of the device requires a modicum of skill and experience for example a rusty nail inside a wall can give a false positive for this reason most modern nljds examine the ratio between the second and the third harmonic of the illumination frequency when a true electronic p n junction is encountered the second harmonic will generally be stronger than the third the nljd was invented by charles

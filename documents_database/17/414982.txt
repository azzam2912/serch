it can also be used for radiolabeling this process is called nick translation because the dna to be processed is treated with dnaase to produce single stranded nicks this is followed by replacement in nicked sites by dna polymerase i which elongates the 3 hydroxyl terminus removing nucleotides by 5 3 exonuclease activity replacing them with dntps to radioactively label a dna fragment for use as a probe in blotting procedures one of the incorporated nucleotides provided in the reaction is radiolabeled in the alpha phosphate position similarly a fluorophore can be attached instead for fluorescent labelling or an antigen for immunodetection when dna polymerase i eventually detaches from the dna it leaves another nick in the phosphate backbone the nick has translated some distance depending on the processivity of the polymerase this nick could be sealed by dna ligase or its 3 hydroxyl group could serve as the template for further dna polymerase i activity proprietary enzyme mixes are available commercially to perform all steps in the procedure in a single incubation nick translation could cause double stranded dna breaks if dna polymerase i encounters another nick on the opposite strand resulting in two shorter fragments this does not

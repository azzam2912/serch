these are appreciably larger than those of living gorillas but the exact size and structure of the rest of the body can only be estimated in the absence of additional findings dating methods have shown that g blacki existed for at least a million years going extinct about 100 000 years ago after having been contemporary with anatomically modern humans homo sapiens for tens of thousands of years and co existing with h erectus who preceded the appearance of h sapiens in 2014 for the first time fossil teeth and mandible of g blacki were found in indonesia in the past gigantopithecus blacki was thought to be closely related to early hominins particularly australopithecus on the basis of molar evidence this is now regarded a result of convergent evolution gigantopithecus is now placed in the subfamily ponginae along with the orangutan g blacki s method of locomotion is uncertain as no pelvic or leg bones have been found the dominant view is that this species walked on hands and feet like modern gorillas and chimpanzees however a minority opinion favors bipedal locomotion this was most notably championed by the late grover krantz but this assumption is based only on the

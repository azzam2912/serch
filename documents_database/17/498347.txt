this rule should not be confused with the so called t rules t regels the rule goes as follows for example because of the idiosyncrasies of dutch spelling some forms are spelled in unexpected ways the past tense forms of proeven and blozen are written with f and s as dutch spelling rules permit the letters v and z only at the beginning of a syllable however the pronunciation remains and words may not end in a double consonant so the past participles gerust geland and gered do not get an additional d see dutch orthography for more information because of regular final obstruent devoicing the past participle ending is pronounced with a voiceless even though d is spelled when the participle is inflected in accordance with a following noun the devoicing is undone like in other words thus geland geleegd geproefd inflect to gelande geleegde geproefde respectively on a phonological level the rule is a form of voicing assimilation the consonant of the past tense ending takes on the voicing of whatever sound precedes it thus the endings beginning with voiceless t are used after voiceless consonants while the endings beginning with voiced d are used after voiced consonants

their main uses are in the treatment of hypertension high blood pressure diabetic nephropathy kidney damage due to diabetes and congestive heart failure they selectively block the activation of at receptors preventing the binding of angiotensin ii compared to ace inhibitors arbs and the similar attributed ace inhibitors are both indicated as the first line antihypertensives in patients developing hypertension along the left sided heart failure however arbs appear to produce less adverse effects compared to ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor blockers are used primarily for the treatment of hypertension where the patient is intolerant of ace inhibitor therapy primarily because of cough they do not inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin or other kinins and are thus only rarely associated with the persistent dry cough and or angioedema that limit ace inhibitor therapy more recently they have been used for the treatment of heart failure in patients intolerant of ace inhibitor therapy in particular candesartan irbesartan and losartan have trial data showing benefit in hypertensive patients with type ii diabetes and may delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy a 1998 double blind study found that lisinopril improved insulin sensitivity whereas losartan did not affect it candesartan is used experimentally in

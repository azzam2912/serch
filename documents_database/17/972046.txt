the infecting virus causes lysis of the host cell or when the cell dies without lysis due to an inability to reproduce both of these effects occur due to cpes if a virus causes these morphological changes in the host cell it is said to be cytopathogenic common examples of cpe include rounding of the infected cell fusion with adjacent cells to form syncytia and the appearance of nuclear or cytoplasmic inclusion bodies cpes and other changes in cell morphology are only a few of the many effects by cytocidal viruses when a cytocidal virus infects a permissive cell the viruses kill the host cell through changes in cell morphology in cell physiology and the biosynthetic events that follow these changes are necessary for efficient virus replication but at the expense of the host cell cpes are important aspects of a viral infection in diagnostics many cpes can be seen in unfixed unstained cells under the low power of an optical microscope with the condenser down and the iris diaphragm partly closed however with some cpes namely inclusion bodies the cells must be fixed and stained then viewed under light microscopy some viruses cpes are characteristic and therefore can be

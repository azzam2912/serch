a hyperbola has two pieces called connected components or branches that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite bows the hyperbola is one of the three kinds of conic section formed by the intersection of a plane and a double cone the other conic sections are the parabola and the ellipse a circle is a special case of an ellipse if the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones then the conic is a hyperbola hyperbolas arise in many ways and so on each branch of the hyperbola has two arms which become straighter lower curvature further out from the center of the hyperbola diagonally opposite arms one from each branch tend in the limit to a common line called the asymptote of those two arms so there are two asymptotes whose intersection is at the center of symmetry of the hyperbola which can be thought of as the mirror point about which each branch reflects to form the other branch in the case of the curve formula 1 the asymptotes are the two coordinate axes hyperbolas share many of the ellipses analytical properties such as

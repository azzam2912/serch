it fixes several small flaws in the 68000 and adds a few features the 68010 was pin compatible with the 68000 but was not 100 software compatible some of the differences were additionally the 68010 had a loop mode which accelerates loops consisting of only two instructions such as a move and a dbra it acts like a tiny special case instruction cache in practice the overall speed gain over a 68000 at the same frequency was less than 10 the 68010 could be used with the 68451 mmu however aspects of its design such as its 1 clock memory access penalty made this configuration unpopular some vendors used their own mmu designs such as sun microsystems in their sun 2 workstation the 68010 was never as popular as the 68000 however due to the 68010 s small speed boost over the 68000 and its support for virtual memory it can be found in a number of smaller unix systems both with the 68451 mmu for example in the torch triple x and with a custom mmu such as the sun 2 workstation at t unix pc the ncr tower xp and early hp 9000s like the model 300 and

ba10 was originally defined broadly in terms of its cytoarchitectonic traits as they were observed in the brains of cadavers but because modern functional imaging cannot precisely identify these boundaries the terms anterior prefrontal cortex rostral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar prefrontal cortex are used to refer to the area in the most anterior part of the frontal cortex that approximately covers ba10 simply to emphasize the fact that ba10 does not include all parts of the prefrontal cortex ba10 is the largest cytoarchitectonic area in the human brain it has been described as one of the least well understood regions of the human brain present research suggests that it is involved in strategic processes in memory recall and various executive functions during human evolution the functions in this area resulted in its expansion relative to the rest of the brain the volume of the human ba10 is about 14 cm and constitutes roughly 1 2 of total brain volume this is twice what would be expected in a hominoid with a human sized brain by comparison the volume of ba10 in bonobos is about 2 8 cm and makes up only 0 74 of its brain volume in each hemisphere

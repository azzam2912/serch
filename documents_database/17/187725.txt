adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells which give rise to adipocytes through adipogenesis in cell culture adipocytes can also form osteoblasts myocytes and other cell types there are two types of adipose tissue white adipose tissue wat and brown adipose tissue bat which are also known as white and brown fat respectively and comprise two types of fat cells white fat cells or monovacuolar cells contain a large lipid droplet surrounded by a layer of cytoplasm the nucleus is flattened and located on the periphery a typical fat cell is 0 1 mm in diameter with some being twice that size and others half that size the fat stored is in a semi liquid state and is composed primarily of triglycerides and cholesteryl ester white fat cells secrete many proteins acting as adipokines such as resistin adiponectin leptin and apelin an average human adult has 30 billion fat cells with a weight of 30 lbs or 13 5 kg if excess weight is gained as an adult fat cells increase in size about fourfold before dividing and increasing the absolute number of fat cells present brown fat cells or plurivacuolar cells are polyhedral in shape unlike white fat cells

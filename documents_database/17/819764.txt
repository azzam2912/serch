the alloy specifications are set by astm international in specification astm a53 a53m a53 pipe comes in three types and two grades a53 type f which is longitudinally furnace butt welded or continuous welded grade a only a53 type e which is longitudinally electric resistance welded grades a and b and a53 type s which is seamless pipe produced by hot working and possibly cold finishing the steel grades a and b astm a53 pipe is sized according to the nominal pipe size nps system it is commonly available with national pipe thread ends or with plain cut ends it can be used for steam water and air conveyance it is also weldable and can be used in structural applications although astm a500 tube which is available in the same nps sizes is sometime preferred this is a standard set by the standards organization astm international a voluntary standards development organizations that sets technical standards for materials products systems and services astm a53 standard 06a hysp 1 scope of astm a53 standard astm a53 is standard specification for pipe steel black and hot dipped zinc coated welded and seamless this specification covers seamless and welded black and hot dipped galvanized

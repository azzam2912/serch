dolichols function as a membrane anchor for the formation of the oligosaccharide glc3 man9 glcnac2 where glc is glucose man is mannose and glcnac is n acetylglucosamine this oligosaccharide is transferred from the dolichol donor onto certain asparagine residues onto a specific sequence that is asn x ser thr of newly forming polypeptide chains dolichol is also involved in transfer of the monosaccharides to the forming glc3 man9 glcnac2 dolichol carrier in addition dolichols can be adducted to proteins as a posttranslational modification a process in which branched carbohydrate trees are formed on a dolichol moiety and then transferred to an assembly of proteins to form a large glycoprotein in the rough endoplasmic reticulum dolichols are the major lipid component 14 by mass of human substantia nigra sn neuromelanin dolichol phosphate was discovered at the university of liverpool in the 1960s although researchers did not know its function at the time of discovery dolichol has been suggested to be used as a biomarker for aging during aging the human brain shows a progressive increase in levels of dolichol a reduction in levels of ubiquinone but relatively unchanged concentrations of cholesterol and dolichyl phosphate in the neurodegenerative disease alzheimer s disease

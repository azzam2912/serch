it is found in coastal areas of northwest europe at depths down to 50 metres the base of s elegans is wider than the column and may reach in diameter the base is usually anchored to the substrate but can be used as a foot for locomotion it often has a ragged outline due to fragmentation having occurred the column is soft and fleshy and varies in shape even in one individual from squat to cylindrical or trumpet shaped and can grow up to tall the lower part of the column is somewhat corrugated and there are a number of pale coloured suckers on the upper part to which grit or shell fragments may adhere occasionally the disc is saucer shaped with an undulating margin and there are up to 200 tentacles arranged irregularly often arching over the edge these are mostly about the same length but occasionally there is a much longer one among them this may be used as it is in some other sea anemone species to prevent competing organisms from settling and occupying space nearby when it is disturbed a large number of white threads known as acontia are discharged from cells on the column and

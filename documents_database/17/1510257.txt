two metals e g gold au gold au are brought into atomic contact applying force and heat simultaneously the diffusion requires atomic contact between the surfaces due to the atomic motion the atoms migrate from one crystal lattice to the other one based on crystal lattice vibration this atomic interaction sticks the interface together the diffusion process is described by the following three processes this method enables internal structure protecting device packages and direct electrical interconnect structures without additional steps beside the surface mounting process the most established materials for thermocompression bonding are copper cu gold au and aluminium al because of their high diffusion rates in addition aluminium and copper as relatively soft metals have good ductile properties the bonding with al or cu requires temperatures 400 c to ensure sufficient hermetical sealing furthermore aluminium needs extensive deposition and requires a high applied force to crack the surface oxide as it is not able to penetrate through the oxide using gold for diffusion a temperature around 300 c is needed to achieve a successful bond compared to al or cu it does not form an oxide this allows to skip a surface cleaning procedure before bonding copper has the

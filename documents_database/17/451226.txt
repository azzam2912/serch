the significance is that van a vre is resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin van b vre is resistant to vancomycin but susceptible to teicoplanin and van c is only partly resistant to vancomycin the mechanism of resistance to vancomycin found in enterococcus involves the alteration of the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway the d alanyl d lactate variation results in the loss of one hydrogen bonding interaction four as opposed to five for d alanyl d alanine being possible between vancomycin and the peptide the d alanyl d serine variation causes a six fold loss of affinity between vancomycin and the peptide likely due to steric hindrance once the individual has vre it is important to ascertain which strain screening for vre can be accomplished in a number of ways for inoculating peri rectal anal swabs or stool specimens directly one method uses bile esculin azide agar plates containing 6 g ml of vancomycin black colonies should be identified as an enterococcus to species level and further confirmed as vancomycin resistant by an mic method before reporting as vre vancomycin resistance can be determined for enterococcal colonies available in pure culture by inoculating a suspension of the organism onto a commercially

while any two arrangements of atoms in a molecule that differ by rotation about single bonds can be referred to as different conformations conformations that correspond to local minima on the energy surface are specifically called conformational isomers or conformers conformations that correspond to local maxima on the energy surface are the transition states between the local minimum conformational isomers rotations about single bonds involve overcoming a rotational energy barrier to interconvert one conformer to another if the energy barrier is low there is free rotation and a sample of the compound exists as a rapidly equilibrating mixture of multiple conformers if the energy barrier is high enough then there is restricted rotation a molecule may exist for a relatively long time period as a stable rotational isomer or rotamer an isomer arising from hindered single bond rotation when the time scale for interconversion is long enough for isolation of individual rotamers usually arbitrarily defined as a half life of interconversion of 1000 seconds or longer the isomers are termed atropisomers see atropisomerism the ring flip of substituted cyclohexanes constitutes another common form of conformational isomerism conformational isomers are thus distinct from the other classes of stereoisomers i e configurational

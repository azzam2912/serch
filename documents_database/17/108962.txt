it is used as a rocket propellant in bipropellant rocket engines because it is hypergolic with various oxidizers such as nitrogen tetroxide no and nitric acid hno as a propellant it is described in specification mil prf 27404 mmh is a hydrazine derivative that was once used in the orbital maneuvering system oms and reaction control system rcs engines of nasa s space shuttle which used mmh and mon 3 a mixture of nitrogen tetroxide with approximately 3 nitric oxide this chemical is toxic and carcinogenic in small amounts but it is easily stored in orbit providing moderate performance for very low fuel tank system weight mmh and its chemical relative unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine udmh have a key advantage that they are stable enough to be used in regeneratively cooled rocket engines the european space agency esa has attempted to seek new options in terms of bipropellant rocket combinations to avoid poisonous chemicals such as mmh and its relatives mmh is believed to be the main cause of the toxicity of mushrooms of genus gyromitra especially the false morel gyromitra esculenta in these cases mmh is formed by the hydrolysis of gyromitrin monomethylhydrazine is considered to be a possible occupational carcinogen

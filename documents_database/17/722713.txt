it was first developed by stling johansson in 1984 and later modified by singh et al in 1988 it has since increased in popularity as a standard technique for evaluation of dna damage repair biomonitoring and genotoxicity testing it involves the encapsulation of cells in a low melting point agarose suspension lysis of the cells in neutral or alkaline ph 13 conditions and electrophoresis of the suspended lysed cells the term comet refers to the pattern of dna migration through the electrophoresis gel which often resembles a comet the comet assay single cell gel electrophoresis is a simple method for measuring deoxyribonucleic acid dna strand breaks in eukaryotic cells cells embedded in agarose on a microscope slide are lysed with detergent and high salt to form nucleoids containing supercoiled loops of dna linked to the nuclear matrix electrophoresis at high ph results in structures resembling comets observed by fluorescence microscopy the intensity of the comet tail relative to the head reflects the number of dna breaks the likely basis for this is that loops containing a break lose their supercoiling and become free to extend toward the anode this is followed by visual analysis with staining of dna and calculating

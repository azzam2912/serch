the word gauge means a measurement a thickness an in between distance as in railroad tracks or a resulting number of units per certain parameter a number of loops in an inch of fabric or a number of lead balls in a pound of ammunition modern theories describe physical forces in terms of fields e g the electromagnetic field the gravitational field and fields that describe forces between the elementary particles a general feature of these field theories is that the fundamental fields cannot be directly measured however some associated quantities can be measured such as charges energies and velocities for example say you cannot measure the diameter of a lead ball but you can determine how many lead balls which are equal in every way are required to make a pound using the number of balls the elemental mass of lead and the formula for calculating the volume of a sphere from its diameter one could indirectly determine the diameter of a single lead ball in field theories different configurations of the unobservable fields can result in identical observable quantities a transformation from one such field configuration to another is called a gauge transformation the lack of change in

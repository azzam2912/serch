in ear eeg the electrodes are exclusively placed in or around the outer ear resulting in both a much greater invisibility and wearer mobility compared to full scalp electroencephalography eeg but also significantly reduced signal amplitude as well as reduction in the number of brain regions in which activity can be measured it may broadly be partitioned into two groups those using electrode positions exclusively within the concha and ear canal and those also placing electrodes close to the ear usually hidden behind the ear lobe generally speaking the first type will be the most invisible but also offer the most challenging noisy signal ear eeg is a good candidate for inclusion in a hearable device however due to the high complexity of ear eeg sensors this has not yet been done ear eeg was first described in a1 us patent us20070112277 a1 though other noteworthy mentions are b1 ep patent ep2448477 b1 and auditory evoked responses from ear eeg recordings since then it has grown to be an endeavor spread across multiple research groups and collaborations as well as private companies notable incarnations of the technology are the ceegrid see picture to the right and the custom 3d printed

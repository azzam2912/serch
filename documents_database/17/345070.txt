this is done without stopping the flow of the product in the pipeline these operations include but are not limited to cleaning and inspecting the pipeline this is accomplished by inserting the pig into a pig launcher or launching station an oversized section in the pipeline reducing to the normal diameter the launching station is then closed and the pressure driven flow of the product in the pipeline is used to push the pig along down the pipe until it reaches the receiving trap the pig catcher or receiving station pigging has been used for many years to clean large diameter pipelines in the oil industry today however the use of smaller diameter pigging systems is now increasing in many continuous and batch process plants as plant operators search for increased efficiencies and reduced costs pigging can be used for almost any section of the transfer process between for example blending storage or filling systems pigging systems are already installed in industries handling products as diverse as lubricating oils paints chemicals toiletries cosmetics and foodstuffs pigs are used in lube oil or paint blending to clean the pipes to avoid cross contamination and to empty the pipes into the product

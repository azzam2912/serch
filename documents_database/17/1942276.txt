the fiber architecture of three dimensional braided fabrics provides high strength stiffness and structural integrity making them suitable for a wide array of applications 3d fabrics can be produced via weaving knitting and non weaving processes three dimensional braiding is among the oldest and most important of textile processes transforming small natural fibers into more functional forms fabrics used in 3d braiding such as rope have been used since 4 000 bc in 1748 patents for the first 3d braiding machines were initiated in england most 3d braiding machines of the time were developed by modifying 2d braiding machines in 1767 the first braiding machines which produced two dimensional fabrics whose properties were different from 3d fabrics appeared in germany during the 1960s the u s government as well as industrial and academic researchers developed 3d braiding machines for use in producing composite material preforms such as carbon fiber composites 3d braids show improved mechanical and structural properties an important characteristic of 3d braids is their ability to form a variety of complex shapes the direct manufacturing of complex structural shapes helps to eliminate the process of cutting to form joints overlaps and splices 3d braided fabrics have high torsional

the detector should be much bigger and more sensitive than any previous detector and make new discoveries in the field of particle and astroparticle physics the project involves 21 european institutions in 10 european countries and brings together over 100 scientists as of 2011 the project is assessing the feasibility of developing the observatory infrastructure and the observatory particle detectors themselves as well as looking for deployment site 7 candidates in europe there have also been propositions of merging the project with similar international projects like dusel june 2011 the laguna collaboration finished the feasibility studies of building the proposed neutrino detectors the studies were paid for by the eu 1 7 million euro no further activity is known as of 2016 the laguna project seems to be defunct no further development has happened and it is unclear if any development will happen also the similar dusel project in the united states was cancelled however the neutrino component of the dusel project the long baseline neutrino experiment lbne was rebooted as the dune project the construction of dune started in 2017 in sanford lab in south dakota usa with expected completion 2027 it is expected that with dune under construction

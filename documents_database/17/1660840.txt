its distinctive arrow like shape derives from the way it includes condition unique 0 n or n 0 points into the plot via an epsilon factor an ra plot like its cousin the ma plot is a re scaled and 45 degree rotated version of a simple two dimensional scatter plot of a vs b where a and b are equal length vectors of positive measurements this rescaling and rotation allows for better visibility and emphasis of important outliers points that vary between the two measurement conditions essentially it is a plot of the log ratio r vs the average log a of each pairing of the elements of a and b unlike an ma plot however because the ra plot takes non negative integer counts as input it must employ work arounds to include mathematically invisible points such as points where one or both element s of the pair is zero if we modify our original a or b vector via where then r and a can be defined as r like m is plotted on the y axis and represents a log fold change ratio between a and b a is plotted on the x axis and represents

cocompactness has been in use in mathematical analysis since the 1980s without being referred to by any name lemma 6 lemma 2 5 theorem 1 or by ad hoc monikers such as vanishing lemma or inverse embedding cocompactness property allows to verify convergence of sequences based on translational or scaling invariance in the problem and is usually considered in the context of sobolev spaces the term cocompact embedding is inspired by the notion of cocompact topological space let formula 1 be a group of isometries on a normed vector space formula 2 one says that a sequence formula 3 converges to formula 4 formula 1 weakly if for every sequence formula 6 the sequence formula 7 is weakly convergent to zero a continuous embedding of two normed vector spaces formula 8 is called cocompact relative to a group of isometries formula 1 on formula 2 if every formula 1 weakly convergent sequence formula 3 is convergent in formula 13 embedding of the space formula 15 into itself is cocompact relative to the group formula 1 of shifts formula 17 indeed if formula 18 formula 19 is a sequence formula 1 weakly convergent to zero then formula 21 for any choice

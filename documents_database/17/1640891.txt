it was centered on the north of present day afghanistan the expansion of the greco bactrians into present day eastern afghanistan and pakistan from 180 bc established the indo greek kingdom which was to last until around ad 10 diodotus the satrap of bactria and probably the surrounding provinces founded the greco bactrian kingdom when he seceded from the seleucid empire around 250 bc and became king diodotus i of bactria the preserved ancient sources see below are somewhat contradictory and the exact date of bactrian independence has not been settled somewhat simplified there is a high chronology c 255 bc and a low chronology c 246 bc for diodotos secession the high chronology has the advantage of explaining why the seleucid king antiochus ii issued very few coins in bactria as diodotos would have become independent there early in antiochus reign on the other hand the low chronology from the mid 240s bc has the advantage of connecting the secession of diodotus i with the third syrian war a catastrophic conflict for the seleucid empire diodotus the governor of the thousand cities of bactria defected and proclaimed himself king all the other people of the orient followed his example

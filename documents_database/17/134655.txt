sobolev spaces can be defined by some growth conditions on the fourier transform they and their embedding theorems are an important subject in functional analysis generalized functions later known as distributions were first introduced by sobolev in 1935 for weak solutions and further developed by laurent schwartz sobolev abstracted the classical notion of differentiation so expanding the range of application of the technique of newton and leibniz the theory of distributions is considered now as the calculus of the modern epoch he was born in st petersburg the son of lev alexandrovich sobolev a lawyer and his wife natalya georgievna his city was renamed petrograd in his youth and then leningrad in 1924 sobolev studied mathematics at leningrad university and graduated in 1929 having studied under prof nikolai g nther after graduation he worked with vladimir smirnov whom he considered as his second teacher he worked in leningrad from 1932 and at the steklov mathematical institute in moscow from 1934 he headed the institute in evacuation to kazan during the world war ii he was a moscow state university professor of mathematics from 1935 to 1957 and also a deputy director of the institute for atomic energy from 1943 to

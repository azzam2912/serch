the modern building is a 19th century construction based on lund cathedral in southern sweden which bears no resemblance to the medieval cathedral that stood on the site since 1130 the town of viborg was one of the four major centers for religion and politics in ancient denmark as early as 800 there was a viking era settlement at viborg which lies in north central jutland with connections to the limfjord an important water through jutland until modern times the people of denmark were religious people but it is difficult to know precisely how they practiced religion because they did not write about it themselves and the descriptions of early christian missionaries only hint at how and what the danes worshiped scholars suggest that danish life was centered in a region led by chiefs perhaps a reminder of the days when danes were several tribes who settled in jutland and the islands with a common language and culture nearly everyone was connected to the land and the sea for the necessities of life danes followed the gods which oversaw different aspects of life for example fertility deities freyr and nordyr were important for planting and harvesting from time to time

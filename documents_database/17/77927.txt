it may be a closed ball including the boundary points that constitute the sphere or an open ball excluding them these concepts are defined not only in three dimensional euclidean space but also for lower and higher dimensions and for metric spaces in general a ball or hyperball in dimensions is called an ball and is bounded by an sphere thus for example a ball in the euclidean plane is the same thing as a disk the area bounded by a circle in euclidean 3 space a ball is taken to be the volume bounded by a 2 dimensional sphere in a one dimensional space a ball is a line segment in other contexts such as in euclidean geometry and informal use sphere is sometimes used to mean ball in general practice the volume of a ball is calculated as where is the radius and is the diameter of the ball in euclidean space an open ball of radius and center is the set of all points of distance less than from a closed ball of radius is the set of all points of distance less than or equal to away from in euclidean space every ball is bounded by

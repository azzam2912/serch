in the 2 d case the situation is quite different from the 1 d case because the multi dimensional polynomials cannot in general be factored this means that an arbitrary transfer function cannot generally be manipulated into a form required by a particular implementation the input output relationship of a 2 d iir filter obeys a constant coefficient linear partial difference equation from which the value of an output sample can be computed using the input samples and previously computed output samples because the values of the output samples are fed back the 2 d filter like its 1 d counterpart can be unstable due to the rapid development of information science and computing technology the theory of digital filters design and application has achieved leap forward development we encounter a variety of signals in real life such as broadcasting signals television signals radar signals mobile phone signals navigation signals radio astronomy signal biomedical signals control signals weather signal seismic signal mechanical vibration signal remote sensing and telemetry signals etc most of these signals are analog signals and just a small portion of them are digital signals the analog signals are continuous function of the independent variables which can be

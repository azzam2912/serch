farther from the neuron s cell body degenerates a related process of dying back or retrograde degeneration known as wallerian like degeneration occurs in many neurodegenerative diseases especially those where axonal transport is impaired primary culture studies suggest that a failure to deliver sufficient quantities of the essential axonal protein nmnat2 is a key initiating event wallerian degeneration occurs after axonal injury in both the peripheral nervous system pns and central nervous system cns it occurs in the section of the axon distal to the site of injury and usually begins within 24 36 hours of a lesion prior to degeneration the distal section of the axon tends to remain electrically excitable after injury the axonal skeleton disintegrates and the axonal membrane breaks apart axonal degeneration is followed by degradation of the myelin sheath and infiltration by macrophages the macrophages accompanied by schwann cells serve to clear the debris from the degeneration schwann cells respond to loss of axons by extrusion of their myelin sheaths downregulation of myelin genes dedifferentiation and proliferation they finally align in tubes b ngner bands and express surface molecules that guide regenerating fibers within 4 days of the injury the distal end of the portion

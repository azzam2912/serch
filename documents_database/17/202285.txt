the iupac name for alanine is 3 aminopropanoic acid unlike its counterpart alanine alanine has no stereocenter in terms of its biosynthesis it is formed by the degradation of dihydrouracil and carnosine alanine ethyl ester is the ethyl ester which hydrolyses within the body to form alanine it is produced industrially by the reaction of ammonia with propiolactone alanine is not found in any major proteins or enzymes it is a component of the naturally occurring peptides carnosine and anserine and also of pantothenic acid vitamin b which itself is a component of coenzyme a under normal conditions alanine is metabolized into acetic acid alanine is the rate limiting precursor of carnosine which is to say carnosine levels are limited by the amount of available alanine not histidine supplementation with alanine has been shown to increase the concentration of carnosine in muscles decrease fatigue in athletes and increase total muscular work done simply supplementing with carnosine is not as effective as supplementing with alanine alone since carnosine when taken orally is broken down during digestion to its components histidine and alanine hence by weight only about 40 of the dose is available as alanine histidine with a pk of 6

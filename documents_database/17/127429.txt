once a crack has initiated each loading cycle will grow the crack a small amount typically producing striations on some parts of the fracture surface the crack will continue to grow until it reaches a critical size which occurs when the stress intensity factor of the crack exceeds the fracture toughness of the material producing rapid propagation and typically complete fracture of the structure fatigue has traditionally been associated with the failure of metal components which led to the term metal fatigue in the nineteenth century the sudden failing of metal railway axles was thought to be caused by the metal crystallising because of the brittle appearance of the fracture surface but this has since been disproved most materials seem to experience some sort of fatigue related failure such as composites plastics and ceramics to aid in predicting the fatigue life of a component fatigue tests are carried out using coupons to measure the rate of crack growth by applying constant amplitude cyclic loading and averaging the measured growth of a crack over thousands of cycles however in order to predict the fatigue life of a component there are a number of special cases that need to be considered where

in psychology transduction refers to reasoning from specific cases to general cases typically employed by children during their development the word has many specialized definitions in varying fields furthermore transduction is defined as what takes place when many sensors in the body convert physical signals from the environment into encoded neural signals sent to the central nervous system the five senses vision audition touch and taste smell allow physical stimulation around us to turn to neural stimulation which is sent to the brain vision is from light reflecting off objects around us audition is from the vibrations caused by change in air pressure touch is from the signals in our skin feeling the pressure of objects touching us and taste smell is from the molecules in the air or in our saliva that let us know what we are smelling or tasting cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp plays an important role in visual transductions this fact was well rooted when fesenko demonstrated that this nucleotide cgmp was able to directly regulate a new assort of membrane channels now called the nucleotide gated cation channels this was how the route from the light to a change in the rod receptor membrane conductance

whereas a determinant is a scalar valued function defined on an n n square matrix a hyperdeterminant is defined on a multidimensional array of numbers or tensor like a determinant the hyperdeterminant is a homogeneous polynomial with integer coefficients in the components of the tensor many other properties of determinants generalize in some way to hyperdeterminants but unlike a determinant the hyperdeterminant does not have a simple geometric interpretation in terms of volumes there are at least three definitions of hyperdeterminant the first was discovered by cayley in 1843 published in 1849 and reprinted in volume 1 of his collected mathematical papers the paper was actually presented to the cambridge philosophical society in 1843 it is in two parts and cayley s first hyperdeterminant is covered in the second part it is usually denoted by det the second cayley hyperdeterminant originated in 1845 and is often called det this definition is a discriminant for a singular point on a scalar valued multilinear map cayley s first hyperdeterminant is defined only for hypercubes having an even number of dimensions although variations exist in odd dimensions cayley s second hyperdeterminant is defined for a restricted range of hypermatrix formats including the hypercubes

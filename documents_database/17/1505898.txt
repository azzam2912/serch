this facilitates standardized service contracts across the service inventory the agility promised by a service oriented architecture soa is usually measured in terms of the reusability level of its contained services however this reusability relates directly to the way the service contract defines service capabilities a service built on a potentially reusable functional context but with a contract that does not convey this reusability correctly does not achieve its reusability potential within service oriented solutions a service contract represents a fundamental artifact as this is the only medium through which services interact with each other or other consumer programs this creates a strong need to standardize the service contracts in order to make services reusable and recomposable as much as possible in order to achieve this the standardized service contract design principle needs to be applied as its application results in standardized service contracts that are based on design standards as set within a service inventory one of its goals is to reduce the need for data transformations as two services interact with each other which can be achieved if the service contracts use standardized data models e g xml schemas if the services have been implemented as web services

during a transit venus appears as a small black disc travelling across the sun this unusual astronomical phenomenon takes place in a pattern that repeats itself every 243 years it includes two transits that are eight years apart separated by breaks of 121 5 and 105 5 years these men along with a crew of scientists were commissioned by the royal society of london for the primary purpose of viewing the transit of venus not only would their findings help expand scientific knowledge it would help with navigation by accurately calculating the observer s longitude at this time longitude was difficult to determine and not always precise a secret mission that followed the transit included the exploration of the south pacific to find the legendary terra australis incognita or unknown land of the south in 1663 scottish mathematician james gregory came up with the idea of using venus or mercury transits to determine the astronomical unit by measuring the apparent solar parallax between different points on the surface of the earth in a 1716 issue of the philosophical transactions of the royal society edmund halley illustrated gregory s theory more fully and explained further how it could establish the distance

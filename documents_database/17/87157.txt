prior to quantum physics it was thought that quantum indeterminacy can be quantitatively characterized by a probability distribution on the set of outcomes of measurements of an observable the distribution is uniquely determined by the system state and moreover quantum mechanics provides a recipe for calculating this probability distribution indeterminacy in measurement was not an innovation of quantum mechanics since it had been established early on by experimentalists that errors in measurement may lead to indeterminate outcomes however by the later half of the eighteenth century measurement errors were well understood and it was known that they could either be reduced by better equipment or accounted for by statistical error models in quantum mechanics however indeterminacy is of a much more fundamental nature having nothing to do with errors or disturbance an adequate account of quantum indeterminacy requires a theory of measurement many theories have been proposed since the beginning of quantum mechanics and quantum measurement continues to be an active research area in both theoretical and experimental physics possibly the first systematic attempt at a mathematical theory was developed by john von neumann the kind of measurements he investigated are now called projective measurements that theory was based in

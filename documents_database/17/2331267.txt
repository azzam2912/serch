the parts to be welded must be round and in plane with each other like all other welding methods this process utilizes heat time and pressure to create a weld joint heat is generated via internal friction generated between the two parts when rotating and subjected to a load normal to the weld joint this frictional heat causes the plastic to melt and a bond to be created due to this process s high speeds and high repeat ability it is favored for a high production environment this process was initially used to weld plastic compasses under a liquid to allow the internal parts of the compass to be filled with the liquid but it is used in a very wide range of industries and applications today spin welding machines come in two different types an inertia welding machine and a continuous drive machine in general one of the parts to be welded is clamped in place while the other is rotated spin welding machines consist of two tool fixtures fixed tooling and a driven tooling the tooling in the spin welding machine provides support for the materials being joined while under heat and pressure tooling can be made of

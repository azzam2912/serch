distance transitive graphs were first defined in 1971 by norman l biggs and d h smith a distance transitive graph is interesting partly because it has a large automorphism group some interesting finite groups are the automorphism groups of distance transitive graphs especially of those whose diameter is 2 some first examples of families of distance transitive graphs include the simplest asymptotic family of examples of distance transitive graphs is the hypercube graphs after introducing them in 1971 biggs and smith showed that there are only 12 finite trivalent distance transitive graphs these are every distance transitive graph is distance regular but the converse is not necessarily true in 1969 before publication of the biggs smith definition a russian group led by georgy adelson velsky showed that there exist graphs that are distance regular but not distance transitive the only graph of this type with degree three is the 126 vertex tutte 12 cage the smallest distance regular graph that is not distance transitive is the shrikhande graph complete lists of distance transitive graphs are known for some degrees larger than three but the classification of distance transitive graphs with arbitrarily large vertex degree remains open

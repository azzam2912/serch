the thin shell is depressed it is deep crimson colored with a crescent of white bordering the columella the sculpture consists of rather narrow spaced acute spiral cords of which there are two larger ones on the upper surface one at the shoulder the spaces between are occupied by intervening smaller spirals and very close fine microscopic spiral striae decussated by finer radiating striae of increment the upper whorls show low radiating scarcely visible folds the base is nearly smooth having only fine separated spiral threads with flat interspaces all sculpture becomes obsolete in the white crescent except the fine very oblique growth lines the principal spirals of the upper surface are more or less distinctly beaded the whorls of the spire show only two spiral carinae the short spire is acute and contains 4 whorls the last are rapidly enlarging descending toward the aperture the oval aperture is extremely oblique reddish and scarcely iridescent this species may be known by the bright coral red color or white with longitudinal stripes usually broken into distinct squarish spots the principal spirals above are granose there is an astonishing amount of variation in degree of depression the nacreous layer is excessively thin

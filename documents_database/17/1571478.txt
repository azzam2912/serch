one of the job programs is mts the job program with which most users interact mts operates as a collection of command language subsystems clss one of the clss allows for the execution of user programs mts provides a collection of system subroutines that are available to clss user programs and mts itself among other things these system subroutines provide standard access to device support routines dsrs the components that perform device dependent input output the system is organized as a set of independent components with well defined interfaces between them this idea is of course neither new nor unique but mts components are generally larger interfaces between components more rigid and a component communicates with fewer other components than in many systems as a result components are more independent of each other and it is easier to replace one component without affecting others the interface with the supervisor is the same for all components and very few special cases are allowed for example all input output operations are done using the same supervisor facilities whether the input output is for a card reader a paging device or any other device most access to supervisor services is via system subroutines

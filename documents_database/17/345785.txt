a strum or stroke is a sweeping action where a finger or plectrum brushes over several strings to generate sound on most stringed instruments strums are typically executed by a musician s designated strum hand typically the musician s dominant hand which is often responsible for generating the majority of sound on a stringed instrument while the remaining hand referred to as the fret hand on most instruments with a fingerboard often supports the strum hand by altering the tones and pitches of any given strum strums are often contrasted with plucking as a means of vibrating an instrument s strings in plucking a specific string or designated set of strings are individually targeted to vibrate whereas in strumming a less precise targeting is usually used compared to other plucking techniques any group of strings brushed in a single sweep by a plectrum could be considered a strum due to the plectrum s less precise string group targeting however a plectrum might simultaneously pluck a small group of strings without being considered a strum in contrast a musician could utilize a technique with more precise string group targeting such as a fingerstyle or fingerpick technique to pluck all the strings

it extends the classical finite element method fem approach by enriching the solution space for solutions to differential equations with discontinuous functions the extended finite element method xfem was developed in 1999 by ted belytschko and collaborators to help alleviate shortcomings of the finite element method and has been used to model the propagation of various discontinuities strong cracks and weak material interfaces the idea behind xfem is to retain most advantages of meshfree methods while alleviating their negative sides the extended finite element method was developed to ease difficulties in solving problems with localized features that are not efficiently resolved by mesh refinement one of the initial applications was the modelling of fractures in a material in this original implementation discontinuous basis functions are added to standard polynomial basis functions for nodes that belonged to elements that are intersected by a crack to provide a basis that included crack opening displacements a key advantage of xfem is that in such problems the finite element mesh does not need to be updated to track the crack path subsequent research has illustrated the more general use of the method for problems involving singularities material interfaces regular meshing of microstructural features such

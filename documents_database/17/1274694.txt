this is a fundamental result in absolute geometry because its proof does not depend upon the parallel postulate in several high school treatments of geometry the term exterior angle theorem has been applied to a different result namely the portion of proposition 1 32 which states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the remote interior angles this result which depends upon euclid s parallel postulate will be referred to as the high school exterior angle theorem hseat to distinguish it from euclid s exterior angle theorem some authors refer to the high school exterior angle theorem as the strong form of the exterior angle theorem and euclid s exterior angle theorem as the weak form a triangle has three corners called vertices the sides of a triangle line segments that come together at a vertex form two angles four angles if you consider the sides of the triangle to be lines instead of line segments only one of these angles contains the third side of the triangle in its interior and this angle is called an interior angle of the triangle in the picture below the angles

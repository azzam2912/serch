in 4 space there are three intermediate forms between the tesseract and the hypersphere altogether they are the these constructions correspond to the five partitions of 4 the number of dimensions if the two ends of a spherinder are connected together or equivalently if a sphere is dragged around a circle perpendicular to its 3 space it traces out a spheritorus the spherinder is related to the uniform prismatic polychora which are cartesian product of a regular or semiregular polyhedron and a line segment there are eighteen convex uniform prisms based on the platonic and archimedean solids tetrahedral prism truncated tetrahedral prism cubic prism cuboctahedral prism octahedral prism rhombicuboctahedral prism truncated cubic prism truncated octahedral prism truncated cuboctahedral prism snub cubic prism dodecahedral prism icosidodecahedral prism icosahedral prism truncated dodecahedral prism rhombicosidodecahedral prism truncated icosahedral prism truncated icosidodecahedral prism snub dodecahedral prism plus an infinite family based on antiprisms and another infinite family of uniform duoprisms which are products of two regular polygons

this type of water pollution can also occur naturally due to the presence of a minor and unwanted constituent contaminant or impurity in the groundwater in which case it is more likely referred to as contamination rather than pollution the pollutant often creates a contaminant plume within an aquifer movement of water and dispersion within the aquifer spreads the pollutant over a wider area its advancing boundary often called a plume edge can intersect with groundwater wells or daylight into surface water such as seeps and springs making the water supplies unsafe for humans and wildlife the movement of the plume called a plume front may be analyzed through a hydrological transport model or groundwater model analysis of groundwater pollution may focus on soil characteristics and site geology hydrogeology hydrology and the nature of the contaminants pollution can occur from on site sanitation systems landfills effluent from wastewater treatment plants leaking sewers petrol filling stations or from over application of fertilizers in agriculture pollution or contamination can also occur from naturally occurring contaminants such as arsenic or fluoride using polluted groundwater causes hazards to public health through poisoning or the spread of disease different mechanisms have influence on the transport

very few composers gave opus numbers to all of their published works without exception there are cases where works that a composer chose not to publish were published after their death and assigned very late opus numbers that often give a misleading idea of their order of composition cases include mendelssohn chopin and tchaikovsky other composers simply never used opus numbers at all examples include copland vaughan williams and many other 20th century composers in some cases the opus numbers that were established during the composer s lifetime are still used but symbols from alternative comprehensive catalogues are used for unpublished works or works that have come to light since the composer s death for the above and other reasons musicologists have often found it necessary to produce comprehensive catalogues that incorporate the most up to date information available about the composers works these catalogues sometimes also include unpublished sketches incomplete drafts even doubtful works and those known to have been spuriously attributed as well as writings and other non musical output when such a catalogue finds general acceptance the sequence numbers allocated by the author then become the standard way of referencing the composer s works and these numbers

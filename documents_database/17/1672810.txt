newman is an american engineer and materials scientist known for his work on fracture and fatigue for aerospace vehicles nasa has listed him as a superstar of modern aeronautics he is known for his work in safety analysis of structures and pioneered the finite element studies of planar cracks in three dimensional finite bodies and the development of extensive stress intensity factor equations these solutions are now considered to be classic contributions to fracture mechanics and are used as benchmarks for new crack stress analysis methods he developed the theory for predicting plasticity induced crack closure and software fastran which is widely used in the aircraft industry in 2001 dr newman left nasa for a professorship at mississippi state university where he developed a fatigue and fracture laboratory and a new astm fracture standard e 2472 many of the stress intensity factor solutions for crack configurations in the astm fatigue crack growth and fracture standards were developed by dr newman along with stress intensity factor solutions and equations for three dimensional crack configurations such as surface cracks and corner cracks at holes his life prediction model and code fastran is used to make life assessments of aircraft structures and is

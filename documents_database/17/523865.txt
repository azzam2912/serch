it is a white crystalline solid that is soluble in water and polar organic solvents it is a useful precursor to various drugs the molecule is chiral the racemic mixture is known as paramandelic acid mandelic acid was discovered in 1831 by the german pharmacist ferdinand ludwig winckler 1801 1868 while heating amygdalin an extract of bitter almonds with diluted hydrochloric acid the name is derived from the german mandel for almond derivatives of mandelic acid are formed as a result of metabolism of adrenaline and noradrenaline by monoamine oxidase and catechol o methyl transferase mandelic acid is usually prepared by the acid catalysed hydrolysis of mandelonitrile which is the cyanohydrin of benzaldehyde mandelonitrile can also be prepared by reacting benzaldehyde with sodium bisulfite to give the corresponding adduct forming mandelonitrile with sodium cyanide which is hydrolyzed alternatively it can be prepared by base hydrolysis of phenylchloroacetic acid and dibromacetophenone it also arises by heating phenylglyoxal with alkalis the biotechnological production of 4 hydroxy mandelic acid and mandelic acid on the basis of glucose was demonstrated with a genetically modified yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae in which the hydroxymandelate synthase naturally occurring in the bacterium amycolatopsis was incorporated into a wild type

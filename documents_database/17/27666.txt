erosion can remove part of the overlying block creating a fenster or window when the underlying block is exposed only in a relatively small area when erosion removes most of the overlying block leaving island like remnants resting on the lower block the remnants are called klippen singular klippe if the fault plane terminates before it reaches the earth s surface it is referred to as a blind thrust fault because of the lack of surface evidence blind thrust faults are difficult to detect until they rupture the destructive 1994 quake in northridge california was caused by a previously undiscovered blind thrust fault because of their low dip thrusts are also difficult to appreciate in mapping where lithological offsets are generally subtle and stratigraphic repetition is difficult to detect especially in peneplain areas thrust faults particularly those involved in thin skinned style of deformation have a so called ramp flat geometry thrusts mostly propagate along zones of weakness within a sedimentary sequence such as mudstones or salt layers these parts of the thrust are called decollements if the effectiveness of the decollement becomes reduced the thrust will tend to cut up the section to a higher stratigraphic level until it

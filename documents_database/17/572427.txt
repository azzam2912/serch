arthur s armor can now resist more than one hit when it is powered up when he eventually loses his armor and is down to his boxer shorts he can only sustain one more hit ultimate mode plays similarly to older ghosts n goblins titles arthur has a smaller number of lives and once he dies he is sent back to a pre determined point of the stage rather than being resurrected he will either be sent back to the start or if he travelled far enough before dying to the stage s half way point in this mode arthur can only take one hit before losing his armor no matter what kind he is wearing this mode is for traditionalists and expert players novice mode is an easier version of standard mode certain environmental obstacles are excluded from this mode such as the tornadoes in the death castle in addition upon death and respawn arthur is given the pow power up which lasts until arthur gets hit by an enemy the levels are varied ranging from being inside a more traditional haunted forest to volcanic pits and ruined castles enemies are varied and tend to be thrown at arthur

the size of the reservoir is referred to as its metabolic pool the metabolic pool concept is important to cellular biology in certain ways a metabolic pathway is similar to a factory assembly line products are assembled from parts by workers who each perform a specific step in the manufacturing process enzymes of a cell are like workers on an assembly line each is only responsible for a particular step in the assembly process a lag period also occurs when a new factory is constructed a time period before finished products begin to roll off the assembly line at a steady rate this lag period partially results from the time needed to fill supply bins with the necessary parts as you might imagine when parts are not readily available production slows or stops metabolite pools are somewhat analogous to the parts bins of a factory the calvin benson cycle will only operate at full speed when the cellular bins are full of the molecular building blocks that lie between pga and rubp

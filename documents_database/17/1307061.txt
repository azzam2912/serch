waspaloy alloy is typically used in high temperature applications particularly in gas turbines nickel 58 chromium 19 cobalt 13 molybdenum 4 titanium 3 aluminium 1 4 waspaloy is an age hardenable nickel based superalloy with excellent strength properties through temperatures of roughly 980 c 1800 f other characteristics of waspaloy include good corrosion resistance as well as being relatively impervious to oxidation making it well suited for service in extreme environments waspaloy has useful strength at temperatures up to 760 870 c 1400 1600 f and good oxidation resistance in gas turbine engine atmospheres up to 870 c 1600 f the creep rupture strength of waspaloy is superior to that of alloy 718 at temperatures above 620 650 c 1150 1200 f short time hot tensile strength is inferior to ra718 at temperatures up to 730 c 1350 f waspaloy is often used in extreme environments it is common in gas turbine blades seals rings shafts and turbine disks the nist certified reference material 1243 a standard for x ray fluorescence spectroscopy is made from waspaloy the british aircraft corporation tsr 2 a supersonic strike aircraft developed from the late 1950s had a fairing to its rear fuselage around the

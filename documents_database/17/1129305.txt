in binding the protein loricrin involucrin contributes to the formation of a cell envelope that protects corneocytes in the skin this gene is mapped to 1q21 among calpactin i light chain trichohyalin profillaggrin loricrin and calcyclin involucrin is a highly reactive soluble transglutaminase substrate protein present in keratinocytes of epidermis and other stratified squamous epithelia it first appears in the cell cytosol but ultimately becomes cross linked to membrane proteins by transglutaminase thus helping in the formation of an insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane functioning as a glutamyl donor during assembly of the cornified envelope involucrin is synthesised in the stratum spinosum and cross linked in the stratum granulosum by the transglutaminase enzyme that makes it highly stable thus it provides structural support to the cell thereby allowing the cell to resist invasion by micro organisms apigenin a plant derived flavanoid that has significant promise as a skin cancer chemopreventive agent has been found to regulate normal human keratinocyte differentiation by suppressing involucrin and this is associated with reduced cell proliferation without apoptosis as one of the precursor proteins of the cornified cell envelope involucrin is markedly increased in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis lamellar ichthyosis involves a

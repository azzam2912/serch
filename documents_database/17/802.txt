this contrasts with a cathode an electrode through which conventional current leaves an electrical device a common mnemonic is acid for anode current into device the direction of conventional current the flow of positive charges in a circuit is opposite to the direction of electron flow so negatively charged electrons flow out the anode into the outside circuit in a galvanic cell the anode is the electrode at which the oxidation reaction occurs an anode is also the wire or plate having excess positive charge consequently anions will tend to move towards the anode the terms anode and cathode are not defined by the voltage polarity of electrodes but the direction of current through the electrode an anode is an electrode through which conventional current positive charge flows into the device from the external circuit while a cathode is an electrode through which conventional current flows out of the device if the current through the electrodes reverses direction as occurs for example in a rechargeable battery when it is being charged the naming of the electrodes as anode and cathode is reversed conventional current depends not only on the direction the charge carriers move but also the carriers electric charge

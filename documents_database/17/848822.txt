written some thirteen years after the experience described in once upon an island this book presents another year in the life of the couple who began their island paradise this book is based on the diary connover kept and presents a mixture of his experiences as he was writing his first book and philosophical insights and wisdom which he collected during his life on the island a sample of what he wrote in making love or making a dessert i am the constant novice when i am not learning i am not living the tragedy of our life is our inability to grow to change to stretch every day beckons me to enlarge myself i wire or shingle a cotage in the morning make camera studies repair a wharf ora generator and catch a salmon in the afternoon write a chapter study the greeks or create a poem at night my curiosity keeps me in a perpetual state of adolescence every tool i see i wish to use every skill i wish to practice living is so exciting i find it difficult to apply myself to any other occupation

developed at cesbio since 1992 dart model was patented in 2003 it is freeware for scientific activities dart model simulates simultaneously in several wavelengths of the optical domain e g visible and thermal infrared the radiative budget and remotely sensed images of any earth scene natural urban with without relief for any sun direction any atmosphere any view direction and any sensor ftm it was designed to be precise easy to use and adapted for operational use for that it simulates it simulates any landscape as a 3d matrice of cells that contain turbid material and triangles turbid material is used for simulating vegetation e g tree crowns grass agricultural crops and the atmosphere triangles are used for simulating translucent and opaque surfaces that makes up topography urban elements and 3d vegetation dart can use structural and spectral data bases atmosphere vegetation soil it includes a lidar simulation mode the approaches used to simulate radiative transfer differ on 2 levels mathematical method of resolution and mode of representation of the propagation medium these two levels are in general dependent the models of radiative transfer are often divided into 2 categories associated with the 2 principal modes of representation of the

the original proposal was for a tournament to be held every four years with the first hosted by england in 1912 for a variety of reasons the tournament was not a success the summer was one of the wettest since records began in 1766 rainfall in the three months of june july and august was more than twice the annual average and august 1912 was the coldest dullest and wettest august of the 20th century at that time pitches were not covered to protect them against rain so the batsmen were at a distinct disadvantage on the proverbial sticky wicket these problems were exacerbated since tests in england were in those days played over three days rather than the five days that is now usual two of the matches between england and australia were drawn due to the weather with the final match being played on a pitch said to be better suited to water polo in addition disputes between the players and management in australia meant that six leading australian players refused to tour including the captain clem hill and victor trumper neither of whom played for australia again weakening a side that had otherwise been level with england

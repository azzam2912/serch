this order includes whales porpoises and dolphins brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal however many other factors also affect intelligence and recent discoveries concerning bird intelligence have called into question the influence of brain size since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks allometric analysis indicates that in general mammalian brain size scales at approximately the or exponent of body mass comparison of actual brain size with the size expected from allometry provides an encephalization quotient eq that can be used as a more accurate indicator of an animal s intelligence spindle cells neurons without extensive branching have been discovered in the brains of the humpback whale fin whale sperm whale killer whale bottlenose dolphins risso s dolphins and beluga whales humans great apes and elephants species all well known for their high intelligence are the only others known to have spindle cells spindle neurons appear to play a central role in the development of intelligent behavior such a discovery may suggest a convergent evolution of these species elephant

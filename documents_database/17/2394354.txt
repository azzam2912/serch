it is the band s first album to feature drummer jason bittner making it their first one without ron lipnicki since relixiv 2005 as he had left overkill shortly after the release of its predecessor the grinding wheel 2017 about a year after the release of the grinding wheel overkill announced that that they were in the studio working on demos for their nineteenth studio album two months later bittner announced on his facebook page that they were in pre production for the album writing and were in pre production this week been awhile since i dusted the ol rolands off but we re pressed for space when asked in an april 2018 interview with jimmy kay of canada s the metal voice what fans could expect to hear from the album frontman bobby blitz ellsworth stated i think we caught a wave on the last four records part of that wave was ron lipnicki behind the drums and ron is now gone so i don t know what to expect but the beauty of it is that when you re inside the writing team that s what becomes motivational now obviously it s gonna be a heavy metal record

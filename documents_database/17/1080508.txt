wilson proposes that the sphinx was constructed by a technologically advanced people nearly 10 000 years before egyptologists have hypothesized by the same people who provided plans for the construction of the pyramids of egypt central and south america the book explores the connection between astronomy and mythology arguing that ancient man used lunar knowledge intuition as opposed to modern man s solar knowledge logic to interpret the universe and therefore possessed an entirely different but equally valid mentality from that of modern man wilson proposes that the outlook of ancient man was based on seeing the big picture rather than logically breaking down the universe into its constituent parts wilson develops this idea of civilizations founded on lunar knowledge together with astronomy to explain the monumental and seemingly spontaneous achievements of ancient cultures such as the pyramid complex at giza in egypt wilson argues that the essential weakness of james george frazer s the golden bough is that frazer attributed the fundamental mythological systems to the beginnings of the farming cultures specifically to fertility agreeing with the philosopher giorgio de santillana s thesis developed in hamlet s mill 1969 wilson places the genesis of mythology previous to fertility cultures

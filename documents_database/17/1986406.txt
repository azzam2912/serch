public key cryptography provides a rich set of different cryptographic algorithms the create digital signatures however the primary public key signatures currently in use rsa and elliptic curve signatures will become completely insecure if scientists are ever able to build a moderately sized quantum computer post quantum cryptography is a class of cryptographic algorithms designed to be resistant to attack by a quantum cryptography several post quantum digital signature algorithms based on hard problems in lattices are being created replace the commonly used rsa and elliptic curve signatures a subset of these lattice based scheme are based on a problem known as ring learning with errors ring learning with errors based digital signatures are among the post quantum signatures with the smallest public key and signature sizes developments in quantum computing over the past decade and the optimistic prospects for real quantum computers within 20 years have begun to threaten the basic cryptography that secures the internet a relatively small quantum computer capable of processing only ten thousand of bits of information would easily break all of the widely used public key cryptography algorithms used to protect privacy and digitally sign information on the internet one of the most widely

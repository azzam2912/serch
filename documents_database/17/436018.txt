the timelike unit vector field is often denoted by formula 1 and the three spacelike unit vector fields by formula 2 all tensorial quantities defined on the manifold can be expressed using the frame field and its dual coframe field frames were introduced into general relativity by hermann weyl in 1929 the index notation for tetrads is explained in tetrad index notation frame fields always correspond to a family of ideal observers immersed in the given spacetime the integral curves of the timelike unit vector field are the worldlines of these observers and at each event along a given worldline the three spacelike unit vector fields specify the spatial triad carried by the observer the triad may be thought of as defining the spatial coordinate axes of a local laboratory frame which is valid very near the observer s worldline in general the worldlines of these observers need not be timelike geodesics if any of the worldlines bends away from a geodesic path in some region we can think of the observers as test particles that accelerate by using ideal rocket engines with a thrust equal to the magnitude of their acceleration vector alternatively if our observer is attached to

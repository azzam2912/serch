in reality string is too thick to provide a clear reading and breaks easily under the tension needed to minimise movement due to wind a reel of wire may be used instead with special holders hallade forks employed to hold the wire at a fixed distance from the rail the measurement is taken with a hallade rule a specialist ruler whose zero point matches the offset of the forks thus cancelling it out the purpose of the offset is to allow small negative measurements without this surveyors would frequently have to read from both sides of the rail to determine the correct values on straight sections of track which typically feature a mix of small positive and negative versines a standard chord length is used in the uk this is conventionally 30 metres or sometimes 20 metres half chords i e 15 metre or 10 metre intervals are marked on the datum rail using chalk the string which is one full chord long is then held taut with one end on two marks at each end of a chord and the offset at the half chord mark measured the versine of the chord which is equal to this measured offset

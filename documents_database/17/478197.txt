it was initially described by the german chemist alfred einhorn in a paper published in 1905 describing n methylol compounds of amides in 1914 chemist karl brunner published a paper expanding on einhorn s research of the reaction pictured below thus resulting in the naming as the einhorn brunner further research by brunner and others in the scientific community have proven successful synthesis of substituted 1 2 4 triazole products from various imides and hydrazines in the case that the r groups of the imide are different the reaction has regioselectivity in their research on the synthesis of 1 2 4 triazoles potts determined that the strongest acidic group attached to the side of the imide will be favored for the 3 position on the triazole ring in the diagram below if one considers the blue r group to be more acidic in respect to the green the favored product would be the isomer on the right for clarity in depicting the electron flow of the mechanism the image below only consists of one of the isomers generated in an einhorn brunner reaction the first step of the mechanism involves the protonating of the substituted nitrogen of the hydrazine 1

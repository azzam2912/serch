the bottom quark is also notable because it is a product in almost all top quark decays and is a frequent decay product of the higgs boson the bottom quark was first described theoretically in 1973 by physicists makoto kobayashi and toshihide maskawa to explain cp violation the name bottom was introduced in 1975 by haim harari the bottom quark was discovered in 1977 by the fermilab e288 experiment team led by leon m lederman when collisions produced bottomonium kobayashi and maskawa won the 2008 nobel prize in physics for their explanation of cp violation on its discovery there were efforts to name the bottom quark beauty but bottom became the predominant usage by analogy of top and bottom to up and down the bottom quark s bare mass is around a bit more than four times the mass of a proton and many orders of magnitude larger than common light quarks although it almost exclusively transitions from or to a top quark the bottom quark can decay into either an up quark or charm quark via the weak interaction ckm matrix elements v and v specify the rates where both these decays are suppressed making lifetimes of most bottom

he is a professor of chemical and systems biology and biochemistry at stanford university school of medicine he was chair of the dept of chemical and systems biology from its inception in 2006 until 2011 ferrell was an undergraduate at williams college majoring in physics chemistry and mathematics and graduated in 1976 he received his ph d degree in chemistry from stanford university in 1984 for work in the laboratory of wray h huestis on the control of red cell shape and received his m d degree from stanford in 1986 he carried out postdoctoral work on signal transduction in the laboratory of g steven martin at uc berkeley through studies of xenopus laevis oocyte maturation ferrell showed how graded changes in the inductive stimulus progesterone are converted into irreversible all or none changes in map kinase activity cyclin dependent kinase activity and cell fate these studies helped demonstrate how ultrasensitivity positive feedback and bistability can allow cells to switch between discrete states subsequent work from the ferrell lab and others demonstrated that the cell cycle transition between interphase and mitosis is regulated by a bistable switch and that the xenopus early embryonic cell cycle operates like a relaxation oscillator

member species of this genus are commonly known as cycluras or more commonly as rock iguanas and only occur on islands in the west indies rock iguanas have a high degree of endemism with a single species or subspecies restricted to individual islands currently there are nine described species and eight subspecies identified in this genus rock iguanas most often inhabit subtropical areas of west indian dry forest biomes characterized by eroded limestone and sparse vegetation ranging from only moderately dry acacia forest to much drier mesquite and cactus habitats these are nonvolcanic islands made up of heavily eroded limestone which form natural caves that the iguanas use as retreats all rock iguanas are herbivorous consuming leaves flowers berries and fruits from different plant species a study in 2000 by allison alberts of the san diego zoo revealed that seeds passing through the digestive tracts of rock iguanas germinate more rapidly than those that do not these seeds in the fruits consumed by cycluras have an adaptive advantage by sprouting before the end of very short rainy seasons the iguanas are an important means of distributing these seeds to new areas particularly if females migrate to nesting sites and as

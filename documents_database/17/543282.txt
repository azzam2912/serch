in this way some of the otherwise lost energy can be reclaimed and the specific fuel consumption of the plant can be decreased large land based electric powerplants built using this combined cycle can reach conversion efficiencies of over 60 if the turbines do not drive a propeller shafts directly and instead a turbo electric transmission is used the system is also known as coges cogas differs from many other combined marine propulsion systems in that it is not intended to operate on one system alone while this is possible it will not operate efficiently this way as with combined diesel and gas systems when run solely on diesel engines especially cogas should not be confused with combined steam and gas cosag power plants which employ traditional oil fired boilers for steam turbine propulsion for normal cruising and supplement this with gas turbines for faster reaction times and higher dash speed cogas has been proposed as upgrade for ships that use gas turbines as their main or only engines e g in cogog or cogag mode such as the s but currently no naval ship uses this concept however some modern cruise ships are equipped with coges e g celebrity

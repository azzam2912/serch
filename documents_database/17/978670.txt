it was first described as peripheral benzodiazepine receptor pbr a secondary binding site for diazepam but subsequent research has found the receptor to be expressed throughout the body and brain in humans the translocator protein is encoded by the tspo gene it belongs to family of tryptophan rich sensory proteins regarding intramitochondrial cholesterol transport tspo has been proposed to interact with star steroidogenic acute regulatory protein to transport cholesterol into mitochondria though evidence is mixed in animals tspo pbr is a mitochondrial protein usually located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and characterised by its ability to bind a variety of benzodiazepine like drugs as well as to dicarboxylic tetrapyrrole intermediates of the haem biosynthetic pathway tspo has many proposed functions depending on the tissue the most studied of these include roles in the immune response steroid synthesis and apoptosis mitochondrial cholesterol transport is a molecular function closely tied to tspo in the scientific literature tspo binds with high affinity to the lipid cholesterol and pharmacological ligands of tspo facilitate cholesterol transport across the mitochondrial intermembrane space to stimulate steroid synthesis and bile acid synthesis in relevant tissues however tspo deletion in genetically engineered mouse models has yielded mixed results regarding

statistical methods offer objectivity but while there is agreement on systems to rate the strengths of current players there is disagreement on whether such techniques can be applied to players from different generations who never competed against each other perhaps the best known statistical model is that devised by arpad elo in 1960 and further elaborated on in his 1978 book the rating of chessplayers past and present he gave ratings to players corresponding to their performance over the best five year span of their career according to this system the highest ratings achieved were in 1970 fide adopted elo s system for rating current players so one way to compare players of different eras is to compare their elo ratings the best ever elo ratings are tabulated below as of december 2015 there were 101 chess players in history who broke 2700 and thirteen of them exceeded 2800 particularly notable are the peak ratings of fischer karpov and kasparov who achieved their peak ratings in earlier years 1972 1994 and 1999 respectively the average elo rating of top players has risen over time for instance the average of the top 10 active players rose from 2751 in july 2000

it measures the resistance voltage changes in a material that is sensitive to the net energy transfer by radiation that occurs between itself and its surroundings which can be either in or out by also measuring its own temperature and making some assumptions about the nature of its surroundings it can infer a temperature of the local atmosphere with which it is exchanging radiation these instruments generally have no spectral frequency wavelength measurement capabilities they use a single non frequency resolved resistance voltage measurement they are constructed to be sensitive to the infra red radiation spectrum that extends approximately from 4 5 m to 100 m thus excluding the main shortwave solar spectrum since the mean free path of ir radiation in the atmosphere is 25 meters this device typically measures ir flux in the nearest 25 meter layer a pyrgeometer consists of the following major components the atmosphere and the pyrgeometer in effect its sensor surface exchange long wave ir radiation this results in a net radiation balance according to where formula 2 net radiation at sensor surface w m formula 3 long wave radiation received from the atmosphere w m formula 4 long wave radiation emitted by the

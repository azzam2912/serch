the work ranges from basic circuit design to strategic mass developments a telecommunication engineer is responsible for designing and overseeing the installation of telecommunications equipment and facilities such as complex electronic switching systems and other plain old telephone service facilities optical fiber cabling ip networks and microwave transmission systems telecommunication engineering also overlaps with broadcast engineering telecommunication is a diverse field of engineering connected to electronic civil and systems engineering they help find the cost of money for different types of computers and technological objects ultimately telecom engineers are responsible for providing high speed data transmission services they use a variety of equipment and transport media to design the telecom network infrastructure the most common media used by wired telecommunications today are twisted pair coaxial cables and optical fibers telecommunications engineers also provide solutions revolving around wireless modes of communication and information transfer such as wireless telephony services radio and satellite communications and internet and broadband technologies telecommunication systems are generally designed by telecommunication engineers which sprang from technological improvements in the telegraph industry in the late 19th century and the radio and the telephone industries in the early 20th century today telecommunication is widespread and devices that assist the

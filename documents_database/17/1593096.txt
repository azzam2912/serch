dense areas of gas shielded by an evaporating gas globule can be conducive to the birth of stars evaporating gas globules were first conclusively identified via photographs taken by the hubble space telescope in 1995 egg s are the likely predecessors of new protostars inside an egg the gas and dust are denser than in the surrounding dust cloud gravity pulls the cloud even more tightly together as the egg continues to draw in material from its surroundings as the cloud density builds up the globule becomes hotter under the weight of the outer layers a protostar is formed inside the egg a protostar may have too little mass to become a star if so it becomes a brown dwarf if the protostar has sufficient mass the density reaches a critical level where the temperature exceeds 10 million kelvin at its center at this point a nuclear reaction starts converting hydrogen to helium and releasing large amounts of energy the protostar then becomes a star and joins the main sequence on the hr diagram

it was a major update of the earlier type 271 radar offering much more power better signal processing new displays and new antennas with greatly improved performance and had much simpler mounting requirements it allowed a radar with performance formerly found only on cruisers and battleships to be fit even to the smallest corvettes it began to replace the 271 in 1943 and was widespread by the end of the year the type 271 was one of the first microwave frequency radars to enter service when microwave electronics design was still in its infancy while it was still being fit to escort ships during 1941 and 1942 great strides in technique were being made in cavity magnetron waveguide antenna design and general electronics those upgrades that could be easily combined with the existing systems became the 271 mark iv models while those that required longer to develop were originally known as the mark v given the magnitude of the changes in march 1943 the mark v s were renamed as the 277 series the 277 used a 500 kw magnetron compared to the 271 s 5 kw added a much higher gain antenna that was stabilized in pitch replaced the

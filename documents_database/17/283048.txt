it was named after the 19th century british mathematician arthur cayley it lies to the northwest of the smaller crater de morgan and the larger d arrest west and slightly north of cayley is whewell a crater of about the same dimensions to the north is a linear rille designated rima ariadaeus which follows a course to the east southeast this is a circular bowl shaped formation with a small interior floor at the midpoint small being relative to the overall diameter as it occupies about one fourth the total cross section the sloping interior walls are relatively light in hue having a higher albedo as the surrounding terrain however it is not nearly as bright as the slightly larger crater dionysius to the east southeast and lacks a ray system the smooth rolling plains to the east of this crater are called the cayley formation it is somewhat similar to the lunar maria but has a slightly higher albedo and is overlapped at the eastern edge by the mare tranquillitatis lunar scientists suspect that this plain may have resulted from deposits of ejecta from the formation of large impact basins such as mare imbrium or mare orientale the most

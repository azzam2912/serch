it is a hypersurface of dimension d in a dimensional space and it is defined as the zero set of an irreducible polynomial of degree two in d 1 variables in the case of conic sections when the defining polynomial is not absolutely irreducible the zero set is generally not considered a quadric although it is often called a degenerate quadric or a reducible quadric in coordinates the general quadric is thus defined by the algebraic equation which may be compactly written in vector and matrix notation as where is a row vector x is the transpose of x a column vector q is a matrix and p is a dimensional row vector and r a scalar constant the values q p and r are often taken to be over real numbers or complex numbers but a quadric may be defined over any field a quadric is an affine algebraic variety or if it is reducible an affine algebraic set quadrics may also be defined in projective spaces see below quadrics in the euclidean plane are those of dimension d 1 which is to say that they are plane curves in this case one talks of conic sections or conics

other forces such as gravitational attraction from tertiary bodies air resistance solar pressure or thrust from a propulsion system are typically modeled as secondary effects directly modeling an orbit can push the limits of machine precision due to the need to model small perturbations to very large orbits because of this perturbation methods are often used to model the orbit in order to achieve better accuracy the study of orbital motion and mathematical modeling of orbits began with the first attempts to predict planetary motions in the sky although in ancient times the causes remained a mystery newton at the time he formulated his laws of motion and of gravitation applied them to the first analysis of perturbations recognizing the complex difficulties of their calculation many of the great mathematicians since then have given attention to the various problems involved throughout the 18th and 19th centuries there was demand for accurate tables of the position of the moon and planets for purposes of navigation at sea the complex motions of orbits can be broken down the hypothetical motion that the body follows under the gravitational effect of one other body only is typically a conic section and can be readily

the tuple formula 7 is said to be in the frequency domain and the index formula 13 is called frequency the tuple formula 7 is also called the spectrum of formula 5 this terminology derives from the applications of fourier transforms in signal processing if formula 1 is an integral domain which includes fields it is sufficient to choose formula 17 as a primitive n th root of unity which replaces the condition 1 by proof take formula 20 with formula 19 since formula 22 formula 23 giving where the sum matches 1 since formula 17 is a primitive root of unity formula 26 since formula 1 is an integral domain the sum must be zero another simple condition applies in the case where n is a power of two 1 may be replaced by formula 28 the inverse of the discrete fourier transform is given as where formula 30 is the multiplicative inverse of formula 31 in formula 1 if this inverse does not exist the dft cannot be inverted proof substituting 2 into the right hand side of 3 we get this is exactly equal to formula 34 because formula 35 when formula 36 by 1 with formula

the subject looks at letters or symbols and the sequences they form combinatorics on words affects various areas of mathematical study including algebra and computer science there have been a wide range of contributions to the field some of the first work was on square free words by axel thue in the early 1900s he and colleagues observed patterns within words and tried to explain them as time went on combinatorics on words became useful in the study of algorithms and coding it led to developments in abstract algebra and answering open questions combinatorics is an area of discrete mathematics discrete mathematics is the study of countable structures these objects have a definite beginning and end the study of enumerable objects is the opposite of disciplines such as analysis where calculus and infinite structures are studied combinatorics studies how to count these objects using various representation combinatorics on words is a recent development in this field which focuses on the study of words and formal languages a formal language is any set of symbols and combinations of symbols that people use to communicate information some terminology relevant to the study of words should first be explained first and foremost a

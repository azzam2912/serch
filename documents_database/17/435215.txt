they are brain signals evoked by sensory stimulation but usually buried by the ongoing brain activity repeating the stimulus multiple times and averaging the signals reduces the uncorrelated ongoing activity and reveals the evoked field evoked fields are the magnetoencephalographic equivalent to evoked potentials which are part of the electroencephalogram an auditory evoked field aef is a form neural activity that is induced by an auditory stimulus and recorded via magnetoencephalography which is an equivalent of auditory evoked potential aep recorded by electroencephalography the advantage of aef over aep is the powerful spatial resolution provided by magnetic field recording which aep lacks thus researchers using aef often deals with the global responses of the whole brain at the cortical level while focusing on the role of the auditory pathway the common applications of aef are prenatal and neonatal hearing screening cortical pitch perception language comprehension and attention the main source of the auditory evoked field is the auditory cortex and the association cortices the earliest cortical components of aef is equivalent to the middle latency response mlr of the eeg evoked potential called the middle latency auditory evoked field mlaef which occurs at 30 to 50 ms after the stimulus

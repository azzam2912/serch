it commonly refers to either inverse rigid body dynamics or inverse structural dynamics inverse rigid body dynamics is a method for computing forces and or moments of force torques based on the kinematics motion of a body and the body s inertial properties mass and moment of inertia typically it uses link segment models to represent the mechanical behaviour of interconnected segments such as the limbs of humans animals or robots where given the kinematics of the various parts inverse dynamics derives the minimum forces and moments responsible for the individual movements in practice inverse dynamics computes these internal moments and forces from measurements of the motion of limbs and external forces such as ground reaction forces under a special set of assumptions the fields of robotics and biomechanics constitute the major application areas for inverse dynamics within robotics inverse dynamics algorithms are used to calculate the torques that a robot s motors must deliver to make the robot s end point move in the way prescribed by its current task the inverse dynamics problem in robotics engineering was solved by eduardo bayo in 1987 this solution calculates how each of the numerous electric motors that control a robot arm

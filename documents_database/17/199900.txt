the directions perpendicular to the galactic plane point to the galactic poles in actual usage the terms galactic plane and galactic poles usually refer specifically to the plane and poles of the milky way in which planet earth is located some galaxies are irregular and do not have any well defined disk even in the case of a barred spiral galaxy like the milky way defining the galactic plane is slightly imprecise and arbitrary since the stars are not perfectly coplanar in 1959 the iau defined the position of the milky way s north galactic pole as exactly ra dec in the then used b1950 epoch in the currently used j2000 epoch after precession is taken into account its position is ra dec this position is in coma berenices near the bright star arcturus likewise the south galactic pole lies in the constellation sculptor the zero of longitude of galactic coordinates was also defined in 1959 to be at position angle 123 from the north celestial pole thus the zero longitude point on the galactic equator was at b1950 or j2000 and its j2000 position angle is 122 932 the galactic center is located at position angle 31 72 b1950

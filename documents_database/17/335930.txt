vertebrates serve as natural hosts there are currently four species in this genus including the type species equine arteritis virus diseases associated with this genus include eav vascular lesions fever edema abortion prrsv abortions and respiratory disease shfv fever edema dehydration hemorragies death almost 100 group ssrna order nidovirales family arteriviridae viruses in arterivirus are enveloped with spherical round and isometric geometries the diameter is around 45 60 nm genomes are linear and non segmented around 12 16kb in length viral replication is cytoplasmic entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors which mediates clathrin mediated endocytosis replication follows the positive stranded rna virus replication model positive stranded rna virus transcription is the method of transcription translation takes place by leaky scanning and 1 ribosomal frameshifting vertebrates serve as the natural host transmission routes are transplancental contact urine semen air borne particles and saliva in 1996 the family arteriviridae was included within the order nidovirales arteriviruses are small enveloped animal viruses with an icosahedral core containing a positive sense rna genome the family includes equine arteritis virus eav porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus ldv of mice and simian haemorrhagic fever

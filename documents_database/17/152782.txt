it is the rate of increase of wind strength with unit increase in height above ground level in metric units it is often measured in units of meters per second of speed per kilometer of height m s km which reduces to the standard unit of shear rate inverse seconds s surface friction forces the surface wind to slow and turn near the surface of the earth blowing directly towards the low pressure when compared to the winds in the nearly frictionless flow well above the earth s surface this layer where surface friction slows the wind and changes the wind direction is known as the planetary boundary layer daytime solar heating due to insolation thickens the boundary layer as winds warmed by contact with the earth s hot surface rise up and become increasingly mixed with winds aloft radiative cooling overnight gradually decouples the winds at the surface from the winds above the boundary layer increasing vertical wind shear near the surface also known as wind gradient typically due to aerodynamic drag there is a wind gradient in the wind flow especially in the first few hundred meters above the earth s surface the surface layer of the planetary

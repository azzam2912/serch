the current floppotron 2 0 build sports 64 floppy drives 8 hard drives and a pair of flatbed scanners the net effect is of a robot orchestra the first version of the instrument was built in 2011 and consisted on two floppy drives and an atmega microcontroller the sound is generated by the magnetic head moved by its stepper motor to make a specific sound head must be moved with appropriate frequency the invention gained public notoriety with a demonstration of the imperial march posted in youtube achieving more than 6 million visits in 2016 pawe zadro niak improved his previous version of the floppotron with 64 floppy drives 8 hard drives and two flatbed scanners every column of 8 fdds is connected to one 8 channel controller built on atmega16 microcontroller the hd is controlled by 2 push pull outputs built with discrete smd mosfets and the scanner head controllers were built using of the shelf boards an arduino uno any device with an electric motor is able to generate a sound scanners and floppy drives use stepper motors to move the head with sensors which scan an image or perform read write operations on a magnetic disk the

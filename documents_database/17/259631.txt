it is also known as cascade encryption cascade ciphering multiple encryption and superencipherment superencryption refers to the outer level encryption of a multiple encryption some cryptographers like matthew green of johns hopkins university says multiple encryption addresses a problem that mostly doesn t exist modern ciphers rarely get broken you re far more likely to get hit by malware or an implementation bug than you are to suffer a catastrophic attack on aes picking any two ciphers if the key used is the same for both the second cipher could possibly undo the first cipher partly or entirely this is true of ciphers where the decryption process is exactly the same as the encryption process the second cipher would completely undo the first if an attacker were to recover the key through cryptanalysis of the first encryption layer the attacker could possibly decrypt all the remaining layers assuming the same key is used for all layers to prevent that risk one can use keys that are statistically independent for each layer e g independent rngs with the exception of the one time pad no cipher has been theoretically proven to be unbreakable furthermore some recurring properties may be found in

the enzyme is most well known for its ability to directly oxidize caffeine a type of methylxanthine to trimethyluric acid caffeine dehydrogenase can be found in bacterium pseudomonas sp cbb1 and in several species within the genera alcaligenes rhodococcus and klebsiella caffeine dehydrogenase found in pseudomonas sp cbb1 is a heterotrimer with a structure and is encoded by the gene cdha the alpha subunit is the largest of the three and the gamma subunit is the smallest the molecular weights of the alpha beta and gamma subunits are 90 0 kd 40 0 kd and 20 0 kd respectively however caffeine dehydrogenase has also been found as a monomeric structure in alcaligenes sp strain cf8 65 kda and a rhodococcus sp klebsiella sp mixed culture consortium the heterotrimer is noted as being similar to the xanthine dehydrogenase found in veillonella atypica in comparison to n demthylases another class of caffeine degrading enzymes caffeine dehydrogenase does not require the use of oxygen nad or nadp as electron acceptors instead caffeine dehydrogenase uses dichlorophenol indophenol coenzyme q0 and cytochrome c as electron acceptors caffeine dehydrogenase has been noted as being more stable as well caffeine dehydrogenase is responsible for catalyzing the oxidation

in dta the material under study and an inert reference are made to undergo identical thermal cycles i e same cooling or heating programme while recording any temperature difference between sample and reference this differential temperature is then plotted against time or against temperature dta curve or thermogram changes in the sample either exothermic or endothermic can be detected relative to the inert reference thus a dta curve provides data on the transformations that have occurred such as glass transitions crystallization melting and sublimation the area under a dta peak is the enthalpy change and it s not affected by the heat capacity of the sample a dta consists of a sample holder thermocouples sample containers and a ceramic or metallic block a furnace a temperature programmer and a recording system the key feature is the existence of two thermocouples connected to a voltmeter one thermocouple is placed in an inert material such as alo while the other is placed in a sample of the material under study as the temperature is increased there will be a brief deflection of the voltmeter if the sample is undergoing a phase transition this occurs because the input of heat will raise the

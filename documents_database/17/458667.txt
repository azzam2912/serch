it is characterised by the same pattern of hot brighter and cold darker pixels occurring with images taken under the same illumination conditions in an imaging array this problem arises from small differences in the individual responsitivity of the sensor array including any local postamplification stages that might be caused by variations in the pixel size material or interference with the local circuitry it might be affected by changes in the environment like different temperatures exposure times etc the term fixed pattern noise usually refers to two parameters one is the dark signal non uniformity dsnu which is the offset from the average across the imaging array at a particular setting temperature integration time but no external illumination and the photo response non uniformity prnu which describes the gain or ratio between optical power on a pixel versus the electrical signal output the latter is often simplified as a single value measured at e g 50 saturation level implying a linear approximation of the not perfectly linear photo response non linearity prnl often prnu as defined above is subdivided in pure offset fpn which is the part not dependent on temperature and integration time and the integration time and temperature

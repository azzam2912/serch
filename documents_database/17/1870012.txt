this concept was pioneered by m m martynyuk in 1976 and then later advanced by fucke and seydel explosive boiling can be best described by a p t phase diagram figure on right shows a typical p t phase diagram of a substance the binodal line or the coexistence curve is a thermodynamic state where at that specific temperature and pressure liquid and vapor can coexist the spinodal line on right is the boundary of absolute instability of a solution to decomposition into multiple phases a typical heating process is shown using red ink if the heating process is relatively slow the liquid has enough time to relax to an equilibrium state and the liquid follows the binodal curve the clausius clapeyron relation is still valid during this time heterogeneous evaporation occurs in the substance with bubbles nucleating from impurity sites surfaces grain boundaries etc on the other hand if the heating process is fast enough that the substance cannot reach binodal curve through heterogeneous boiling the liquid becomes superheated with its temperature above boiling point at a given pressure system then shifts away from the binodal and continues to follow the red curve and thus approaches towards spinodal near

it is named after norwegian mathematician niels henrik abel let be a power series with real coefficients a with radius of convergence 1 suppose that the series converges then g x is continuous from the left at formula 3 i e the same theorem holds for complex power series provided that formula 6 within a stolz sector that is a region of the open unit disk where for some m without this restriction the limit may fail to exist for example the power series converges to 0 at z 1 but is unbounded near any point of the form e so the value at z 1 is not the limit as z tends to 1 in the whole open disk note that g z is continuous on the real closed interval 0 t for t from below the theorem can also be generalized to account for sums which diverge to infinity if then however if the series is only known to be divergent the theorem fails take for example the power series for at formula 14 the series is equal to formula 15 but formula 16 we also remark the theorem holds for radii of convergence other than formula 17

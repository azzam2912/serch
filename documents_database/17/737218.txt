like monoterpenes sesquiterpenes may be acyclic or contain rings including many unique combinations biochemical modifications such as oxidation or rearrangement produce the related sesquiterpenoids sesquiterpenes are found naturally in plants and insects as semiochemicals e g defensive agents or pheromones the reaction of geranyl pyrophosphate with isopentenyl pyrophosphate results in the 15 carbon farnesyl pyrophosphate fpp which is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes such as farnesene cyclic sesquiterpenes are more common than cyclic monoterpenes because of the increased chain length and additional double bond in the sesquiterpene precursors in addition to common six membered ring systems such as is found in zingiberene a constituent of the oil from ginger cyclization of one end of the chain to the other end can lead to macrocyclic rings such as humulene the cadinenes contain two fused six membered rings caryophyllene a component of many essential oils such as clove oil contains a nine membered ring fused to a cyclobutane ring vetivazulene and guaiazulene are aromatic bicyclic sesquiterpenoids with the addition of a third ring the possible structures become increasingly varied examples include longifolene copaene and the alcohol patchoulol the fpp backbone can be rearranged in several different ways and further decorated

it encodes a protein which belongs to the cip kip family of cyclin dependent kinase cdk inhibitor proteins the encoded protein binds to and prevents the activation of cyclin e cdk2 or cyclin d cdk4 complexes and thus controls the cell cycle progression at g1 it is often referred to as a cell cycle inhibitor protein because its major function is to stop or slow down the cell division cycle the p27 gene has a dna sequence similar to other members of the cip kip family which include the p21 and p57 genes in addition to this structural similarity the cip kip proteins share the functional characteristic of being able to bind several different classes of cyclin and cdk molecules for example p27 binds to cyclin d either alone or when complexed to its catalytic subunit cdk4 in doing so p27 inhibits the catalytic activity of cdk4 which means that it prevents cdk4 from adding phosphate residues to its principal substrate the retinoblastoma prb protein increased levels of the p27 protein typically cause cells to arrest in the g1 phase of the cell cycle likewise p27 is able to bind other cdk proteins when complexed to cyclin subunits such as

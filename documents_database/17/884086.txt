sects of christianity that hold to a doctrine of communion under both kinds may believe that a eucharist which does not include both bread and wine as elements of the religious ceremony is not valid while others may consider the presence of both bread and wine as preferable but not necessary for the ceremony in some traditions water or grape juice may take the place of wine with alcohol content as the second element in reference to the eucharist as a sacrifice communion under both kinds belongs at least to the integrity and essence of the rite and may not be omitted without violating the precept of christ do this for a commemoration of me luke 22 19 this is mentioned implicitly by the council of trent sess xxi c i xxii c i and the general instruction of the roman missal states that the people should share the cup when it is permitted then communion is a clearer sign of sharing in the sacrifice that is actually being celebrated however catholicism teaches that christ is sacramentally and equally present under each species and therefore if a person receives only one species christ is fully present and nothing is lacking

in the past expert witnesses were allowed to give testimony on ultimate issues such as the applicability of the insanity defense to a particular defendant however after the 1982 trial of john hinckley jr the federal rules of evidence were changed now in the united states federal courts and some states have rules of evidence that specifically rule out legal conclusions drawn by expert witnesses in their testimony however a large amount of judicial discretion is allowed in how this rule is applied resulting in an uneven application of rules across jurisdictions the federal rules do not say what falls within the definition of an ultimate issue however a long history of case law on the subject suggests that an expert witness runs afoul if he uses the same words words with legal meaning that will ultimately be presented to the jury one court excluded a psychologist s evidence on the credibility of prosecution s witness on the grounds that it amounted to an ultimate opinion meaning this was an opinion that could only be properly reached by a jury the expert witness testimony is confined to giving an opinion on whether the defendant had a serious mental disorder at

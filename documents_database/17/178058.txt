brauer who studied it soon afterward and proved a weaker bound the conjecture states that where is the length of the shortest addition chain producing n here an addition chain is defined as a sequence of numbers starting with 1 such that every number after the first can be expressed as a sum of two earlier numbers which are allowed to both be equal its length is the number of sums needed to express all its numbers which is one less than the length of the sequence of numbers since there is no sum of previous numbers for the first number in the sequence 1 computing the length of the shortest addition chain that contains a given number can be done by dynamic programming for small numbers but it is not known whether it can be done in polynomial time measured as a function of the length of the binary representation of scholz s conjecture if true would provide short addition chains for numbers of a special form the mersenne numbers as an example it has a shortest addition chain of length three determined by the three sums also it has a shortest addition chain of length seven determined by

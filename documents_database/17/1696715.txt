the process involves the high pressure injection of fracing fluid primarily water containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep rock formations through which natural gas petroleum and brine will flow more freely when the hydraulic pressure is removed from the well small grains of hydraulic fracturing proppants either sand or aluminium oxide hold the fractures open hydraulic fracturing began as an experiment in 1947 and the first commercially successful application followed in 1950 as of 2012 2 5 million frac jobs had been performed worldwide on oil and gas wells over one million of those within the u s such treatment is generally necessary to achieve adequate flow rates in shale gas tight gas tight oil and coal seam gas wells some hydraulic fractures can form naturally in certain veins or dikes drilling and hydraulic fracing has made the united states a major exporter as of 2019 while helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions hydraulic fracturing is highly controversial in many countries its proponents advocate the economic benefits of more extensively accessible hydrocarbons as well as replacing coal with natural gas which burns cleaner and emits half

the freewheel was developed early in the history of bicycle design but the fixed gear bicycle remained the standard track racing design more recently the fixie has become a popular alternative among mainly urban cyclists offering the advantage of simplicity compared with the standard multi geared bicycle most bicycle hubs incorporate a freewheel to allow the pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion so that the rider can coast i e ride without pedalling using forward momentum a fixed gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket or cog threaded or bolted directly to the hub of the back wheel so that the pedals are directly coupled to the wheel during acceleration the pedal crank drives the wheel but in other situations the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks this direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight by resisting the rotation of the cranks it also makes it possible to cycle backwards as a general rule fixed gear bicycles are single speed a derailleur for gear selection would introduce chain slack which would interfere with braking gear selection can however be accomplished with the use of an internally geared hub

civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub disciplines it is considered the second oldest engineering discipline after military engineering and it is defined to distinguish non military engineering from military engineering civil engineering takes place in the public sector from municipal through to national governments and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society and its history is intricately linked to advances in the understanding of physics and mathematics throughout history because civil engineering is a wide ranging profession including several specialized sub disciplines its history is linked to knowledge of structures materials science geography geology soils hydrology environment mechanics and other fields throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans such as stonemasons and carpenters rising to the role of master builder knowledge was retained in guilds and seldom supplanted by advances structures roads and infrastructure that existed were repetitive and increases in scale were incremental one of the earliest examples of a scientific approach to physical and mathematical problems applicable to civil engineering is the work of archimedes in

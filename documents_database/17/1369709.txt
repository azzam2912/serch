it shows the change in the corresponding solution property for example volume when all of that component is added to the solution per mole of component added it is described as apparent because it appears to represent the molar property of that component in solution provided that the properties of the other solution components are assumed to remain constant during the addition however this assumption is often not justified since the values of apparent molar properties of a component may be quite different from its molar properties in the pure state for instance the volume of a solution containing two components identified as solvent and solute is given by where v is the volume of the pure solvent before adding the solute and formula 2 its molar volume at the same temperature and pressure as the solution n is the number of moles of solvent formula 3 is the apparent molar volume of the solute and n is the number of moles of the solute in the solution by dividing this relation to the molar amount of one component a relation between the apparent molar property of a component and the mixing ratio of components can be obtained this equation

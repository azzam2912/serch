this article will provide the background and history of this implementation into a commercial product line from solid modeling solutions sms sms is an independent supplier of source code for a powerful suite of 3d geometry kernels sms provides advanced nurbs based geometry libraries smlib tsnlib gsnlib nlib sdlib vslib and polymlib that encompass extensive definition and manipulation of nurbs curves and surfaces with the latest fully functional non manifold topology vslib provides deformable modeling as part of a library using the constrained optimization techniques of the calculus of variations the library supports several very different geometric operations polymlib is an object oriented software toolkit that provides a set of objects and corresponding methods to repair optimize review and edit triangle mesh models it can be used to analyze surface properties such as smoothness and curvature distribution as well as to repair and optimize surface meshes nurbs got started with seminal work at boeing and sdrc structural dynamics research corporation a leading company in mechanical computer aided engineering in the 1980s and 90 s the history of nurbs at boeing goes back to 1979 when boeing began to staff up for the purpose of developing their own comprehensive cad cam

every knot is either hyperbolic a torus or a satellite knot the class of satellite knots include composite knots cable knots and whitehead doubles see basic families below for definitions of the last two classes a satellite link is one that orbits a companion knot k in the sense that it lies inside a regular neighborhood of the companion a satellite knot formula 1 can be picturesquely described as follows start by taking a nontrivial knot formula 2 lying inside an unknotted solid torus formula 3 here nontrivial means that the knot formula 2 is not allowed to sit inside of a 3 ball in formula 3 and formula 2 is not allowed to be isotopic to the central core curve of the solid torus then tie up the solid torus into a nontrivial knot this means there is a non trivial embedding formula 7 and formula 8 the central core curve of the solid torus formula 3 is sent to a knot formula 10 which is called the companion knot and is thought of as the planet around which the satellite knot formula 1 orbits the construction ensures that formula 12 is a non boundary parallel incompressible torus in

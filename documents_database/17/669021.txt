it occurs as a proteoglycan hspg in which two or three hs chains are attached in close proximity to cell surface or extracellular matrix proteins it is in this form that hs binds to a variety of protein ligands including wnt and regulates a wide range of biological activities including developmental processes angiogenesis blood coagulation abolishing detachment activity by grb granzyme b and tumour metastasis hs has also been shown to serve as cellular receptor for a number of viruses including the respiratory syncytial virus the major cell membrane hspgs are the transmembrane syndecans and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi anchored glypicans other minor forms of membrane hspg include betaglycan and the v 3 isoform of cd44 present on keratinocytes and activated monocytes in the extracellular matrix especially basement membranes the multi domain perlecan agrin and collagen xviii core proteins are the main hs bearing species heparan sulfate is a member of the glycosaminoglycan family of carbohydrates and is very closely related in structure to heparin both consist of a variably sulfated repeating disaccharide unit the main disaccharide units that occur in heparan sulfate and heparin are shown below the most common disaccharide unit within heparan sulfate is composed of a glucuronic

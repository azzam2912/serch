the index often reveals surprising power distribution that is not obvious on the surface the constituents of a voting system such as legislative bodies executives shareholders individual legislators and so forth can be viewed as players in an n player game players with the same preferences form coalitions any coalition that has enough votes to pass a bill or elect a candidate is called winning and the others are called losing based on shapley value shapley and shubik concluded that the power of a coalition was not simply proportional to its size the power of a coalition or a player is measured by the fraction of the possible voting sequences in which that coalition casts the deciding vote that is the vote that first guarantees passage or failure the power index is normalized between 0 and 1 a power of 0 means that a coalition has no effect at all on the outcome of the game and a power of 1 means a coalition determines the outcome by its vote also the sum of the powers of all the players is always equal to 1 there are some algorithms for calculating the power index e g dynamic programming techniques enumeration

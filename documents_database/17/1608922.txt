stadium uses time step finite element analysis to simulate the progress of harmful ions including chloride sulphate and hydroxide through concrete by considering the chemical and physical properties of the concrete being analysed as the us navy needed a tool to accurately predict the degradation of waterfront concrete structures simco technologies and its u s partner the rjlee group were awarded small business innovative research sbir funds from the us navy for a phase i feasibility study in 2002 in 2003 phase ii funds were awarded to the team to fully integrate chloride ingress and corrosion initiation prediction in stadium several industrial partners also joined this effort lafarge holcim euclid basf sika mmfx and grace chemicals the consortium was called summa the main outcomes of this research phase were stadium development continued with the second phase of the summa research program summa2 leading to the commercialisation of stadium 2 9 to coincide with the specification of stadium service life modelling for new waterfront constructions for the us navy stadium 2 99 is currently the most recent build of the stadium client being a web based program a user s files are accessible from any other computer with the stadium 2

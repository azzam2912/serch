the first produces electrical energy similarly to a dye sensitized photovoltaic cell which meets the standard definition of a photovoltaic cell the second is a photoelectrolytic cell that is a device which uses light incident on a photosensitizer semiconductor or aqueous metal immersed in an electrolytic solution to directly cause a chemical reaction for example to produce hydrogen via the electrolysis of water both types of device are varieties of solar cell in that a photoelectrochemical cell s function is to use the photoelectric effect or very similarly the photovoltaic effect to convert electromagnetic radiation typically sunlight either directly into electrical power or into something which can itself be easily used to produce electrical power hydrogen for example can be burned to create electrical power see photohydrogen the standard photovoltaic effect as operating in standard photovoltaic cells involves the excitation of negative charge carriers electrons within a semiconductor medium and it is negative charge carriers free electrons which are ultimately are extracted to produce power the classification of photoelectrochemical cells which includes gr tzel cells meets this narrow definition albeit the charge carriers are often excitonic the situation within a photoelectrolytic cell on the other hand is quite different for

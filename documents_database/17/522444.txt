it states that a graph g is planar if and only if its graphic matroid is also cographic that is it is the dual matroid of another graphic matroid in purely graph theoretic terms this criterion can be stated as follows there must be another dual graph g v e and a bijective correspondence between the edges e and the edges e of the original graph g such that a subset t of e forms a spanning tree of g if and only if the edges corresponding to the complementary subset e t form a spanning tree of g an equivalent form of whitney s criterion is that a graph g is planar if and only if it has a dual graph whose graphic matroid is dual to the graphic matroid of g a graph whose graphic matroid is dual to the graphic matroid of g is known as an algebraic dual of g this whitney s planarity criterion can be expressed succinctly as a graph is planar if and only if it has an algebraic dual if a graph is embedded into a topological surface such as the plane in such a way that every face of the embedding

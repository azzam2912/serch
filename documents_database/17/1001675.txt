it has an apparent visual magnitude of 2 95 and is located at a distance of about from earth this is a spectroscopic binary star system with the presence of the secondary component being revealed by the shifts of absorption lines in the spectrum resulting from the doppler effect the two components orbit each other with a period of 1 066 0 days 2 9 years and a low eccentricity of 0 090 the primary component of this system has a stellar classification of k1 iii a luminosity class iii indicates this has expanded into a giant star after exhausting the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolving away from the main sequence of stars like the sun the interferometry measured angular diameter of this star after correcting for limb darkening is which at its estimated distance equates to a physical radius of about 27 times the radius of the sun it appears to be rotating slowly with a projected rotational velocity of this gives a lower bound on the azimuthal velocity of rotation along the star s equator tau puppis is radiating energy from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of around 4 500 giving it the

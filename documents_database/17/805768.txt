in the method a suspension of agrobacterium tumefaciens is introduced into a plant leaf by direct injection or by vacuum infiltration or brought into association with plant cells immobilised on a porous support plant cell packs whereafter the bacteria transfer the desired gene into the plant cells via transfer of t dna the main benefit of agroinfiltration when compared to the more traditional plant transformation is speed and convenience although yields of the recombinant protein are generally also higher and more consistent the first step is to introduce a gene of interest to a strain of agrobacterium tumefaciens subsequently the strain is grown in a liquid culture and the resulting bacteria are washed and suspended into a suitable buffer solution for injection this solution is then placed in a syringe without a needle the tip of the syringe is pressed against the underside of a leaf while simultaneously applying gentle counterpressure to the other side of the leaf the agrobacterium suspension is then injected into the airspaces inside the leaf through stomata or sometimes through a tiny incision made to the underside of the leaf vacuum infiltration is another way to introduce agrobacterium deep into plant tissue in this procedure

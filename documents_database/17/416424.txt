silicides are structurally closer to borides than to carbides similar to borides and carbides the composition of silicides cannot be easily specified as covalent molecules the chemical bonds in silicides range from conductive metal like structures to covalent or ionic silicides of all non transition metals with exception of beryllium have been described silicon atoms in silicides can have many possible organizations a silicide prepared by a self aligned process is called a salicide this is a process in which silicide contacts are formed only in those areas in which deposited metal which after annealing becomes a metal component of the silicide is in direct contact with silicon hence the process is self aligned it is commonly implemented in mos cmos processes for ohmic contacts of the source drain and poly si gate group 1 and 2 silicides e g nasi and casi react with water yielding hydrogen and or silanes at consumer electronics show ces 2012 a safe and eco friendly 1kwh or 3kwh capacity mobile phone charger with sodium silicide that runs on water has introduced for people who spend time away from the electricity grid any type of water can be used including salt water and it

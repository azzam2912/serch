eric drexler to describe the process of designing and analyzing detailed hypothetical models of systems that are not feasible with current technologies or methods but do seem to be clearly within the bounds of what science considers to be possible within the narrowly defined scope of operation of the hypothetical system model it usually results in paper or video prototypes or more likely nowadays computer models that are as convincing as possible to those that know the relevant science given the lack of experimental confirmation by analogy with protoscience it might be considered a form of protoengineering due to the difficulty and necessity of anticipating results in such areas as genetic modification climate change molecular engineering and megascale engineering parallel fields such as bioethics climate engineering and hypothetical molecular nanotechnology sometimes emerge to develop and examine hypotheses define limits and express potential solutions to the anticipated technological problems proponents of exploratory engineering contend that it is an appropriate initial approach to such problems engineering is concerned with the design of a solution to a practical problem a scientist may ask why and proceed to research the answer to the question by contrast engineers want to know how to solve a

the numbering scheme was distinct from both the numbering schemes used for standard receiving tubes and the existing transmitting tube numbering systems used previously such as the 800 series numbers originated by rca and adopted by many others the system assigned numbers with the base form 1a21 and this numbering scheme is occasionally referred to by tube collectors and historians as the 1a21 system the first digit of the type number was 1 9 providing a rough indication of the filament heater power rating and therefore the overall power handling capabilities of the tube the assigned numbers were as follows the second character was a letter broadly identifying the class of tube the last 2 digits were serially assigned beginning with 21 to avoid possible confusion with receiving tubes or crt phosphor designations multiple section tubes like the 3e29 or 8d21 are assigned a letter corresponding to one set of electrodes like all tube numbering systems there are many inconsistencies between theory and practice for example there is no assigned letter code for cathode ray tubes some unusual types received rather mundane sounding designations based solely on electrode count because there was no better place to put them for example

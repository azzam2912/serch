during early embryogenesis it consists of the extraembryonic coelom also called the chorionic cavity the gestational sac is normally contained within the uterus it is the only available structure that can be used to determine if an intrauterine pregnancy exists until the embryo is identified on obstetric ultrasound the gestational sac is a dark anechoic space surrounded by a white hyperechoic rim the gestational sac is spherical in shape and usually located in the upper part of the fundus of the uterus by approximately 9 weeks of gestational age the amniotic sac has expanded to occupy the majority of the volume of the gestational sac eventually expanding to reduce the extraembryonic coelom to a thin layer between the amnion membrane and the mesoderm by then the gestational sac is usually simply called the amniotic sac during embryogenesis the extraembryonic coelom or chorionic cavity that constitutes the gestational sac is a portion of the conceptus consisting of a cavity between heuser s membrane and the trophoblast during formation of the primitive yolk sac some of the migrating hypoblast cells differentiate into mesenchymal cells that fill the space between heuser s membrane and the trophoblast forming the extraembryonic mesoderm as development progresses

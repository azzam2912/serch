in particular finite degree galois extensions n of k are characterised by set of prime ideals which split completely in n an extension f k is bauerian if it obeys bauer s theorem that is for every finite extension l of k we have p f k p l k if and only if l contains a subfield k isomorphic to f all field extensions of degree at most 4 over q are bauerian an example of a non bauerian extension is the galois extension of q by the roots of 2 x 32 x 1 which has galois group s

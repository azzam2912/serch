it was initially detected in 2010 using the sunyaev zel dovich effect by the south pole telescope collaboration it is one of the most massive galaxy clusters known with the mass on the order of 2 most of the mass of the phoenix cluster is in the form of dark matter and its intracluster medium the vast stellar halo of the phoenix cluster central galaxy extends to over 1 1 million light years from the center making it one of the largest galaxies known it is 22 times the diameter of our galaxy and its starburst activity suggests that the galaxy is still growing larger the phoenix cluster is also producing more x rays than any other known massive cluster the central elliptical cd galaxy of this cluster hosts an active galactic nucleus which is powered by a central supermassive black hole the central black hole has an estimated mass on the order of 20 billion this makes it one of the most massive black holes known in the universe 5 000 times the mass of the black hole at the center of the milky way the diameter of the black hole s immense event horizon is on the order

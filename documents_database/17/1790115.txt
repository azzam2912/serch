most of its current limited wind production is located in agricultural areas with low population densities where connection to the main energy grid is difficult in 2006 russia had a total installed wind capacity of 15 mw russia is estimated to have a total potential of 80 000 twh yr for wind energy 6 218 twh yr of which is economically feasible most of this potential is found in the southern steppes and the seacoasts of the country although in many of these areas the population density is very low at less than this low population density means that there is little existing electricity infrastructure currently in place which hinders development of these resources current russian wind energy projects have a combined capacity of over 1 700 mw although less than 17 mw had been installed as of the end of 2010 the russian wind energy association predicts that if russia achieves its goal of having 4 5 of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020 the country will have a total wind capacity of 7 000 mw in 2010 plans for the construction of a wind power plant in yeisk on the sea of azov were announced it

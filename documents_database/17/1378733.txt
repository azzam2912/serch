dna binding sites are distinct from other binding sites in that 1 they are part of a dna sequence e g a genome and 2 they are bound by dna binding proteins dna binding sites are often associated with specialized proteins known as transcription factors and are thus linked to transcriptional regulation the sum of dna binding sites of a specific transcription factor is referred to as its cistrome dna binding sites also encompasses the targets of other proteins like restriction enzymes site specific recombinases see site specific recombination and methyltransferases dna binding sites can be thus defined as short dna sequences typically 4 to 30 base pairs long but up to 200 bp for recombination sites that are specifically bound by one or more dna binding proteins or protein complexes it has been reported that some binding sites have potential to undergo fast evolutionary change dna binding sites can be categorized according to their biological function thus we can distinguish between transcription factor binding sites restriction sites and recombination sites some authors have proposed that binding sites could also be classified according to their most convenient mode of representation on the one hand restriction sites can be generally represented

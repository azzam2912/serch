the central pattern generator cpg provides the basic locomotor rhythm and synergies by integrating commands from various sources that serve to initiate or modulate its output to meet the requirements of the environment cpg within the lumbosacral spinal cord segments represent an important component of the total circuitry that generates and controls posture and locomotion this spinal circuitry can function independently in the absence of descending input from the brain to generate stable posture and locomotion and even modulate activity to match changing conditions e g stepping over obstacles this capability improve with training spinal plasticity and therefore it is believed that spinal cord has the capability to learn and memorize the sensory feedback originates from muscles joints tendons and skin afferents as well as from special senses and dynamically adapts the locomotor pattern of spinal cord to the requirements of the environment these afferent sensory receptors perceive deformation of tissue the amount of pressure stretch or simply placement direction of movement speed and velocity at which movement is occurring the dynamic interactions between spinal cord and sensory input are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state and phase dependent manner for instance proprioceptive inputs from extensors

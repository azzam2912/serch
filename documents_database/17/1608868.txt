mldesigner speeds up modeling simulation and analysis of discrete event discrete time and continuous time systems concerning architecture function and performance the tools is based on ideas of the ptolemy project done at the university if california berkeley uc berkeley mldesigner is developed by mldesign technologies inc palo alto ca usa in collaboration with mission level design gmbh ilmenau germany system models are composed in a graphical editor these hierarchically structured block diagrams are stored in mml model markup language a dialect of xml models may therefore also be generated automatically by xml transformations from other xml based models descriptions e g uml via xml model interchance xmi bones cossap or opd opm object process diagram modeling models executable models systems are composed of modules and primitives which are connected via typed in and out put ports and or attributes parameters resources memories events modules can be composed of other modules and or primitives primitives are the smallest units in mldesigner models the behaviour of primitives is either coded in ansi c c or modeled using finite state machines fsm and or may exchange information with other simulators internet based systems or hardware all modules and primitives of a simulation

the questions of what such a world might look like and whether specific scenarios constitute utopias or dystopias are the subject of lively debate most scientists believe that ai research will at some point lead to the creation of machines that are as intelligent or more intelligent than human beings in every domain of interest there is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains therefore superintelligence is physically possible in addition to potential algorithmic improvements over human brains a digital brain can be many orders of magnitude larger and faster than a human brain which was constrained in size by evolution to be small enough to fit through a birth canal while there is no consensus on when artificial intelligence will outperform humans many scholars argue that whenever it does happen the introduction of a second species of intelligent life onto the planet will have far reaching implications scholars often disagree with one another both about what types of post ai scenarios are most likely and about what types of post ai scenarios would be most desirable finally some dissenters argue that ai

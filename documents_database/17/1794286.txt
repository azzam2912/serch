it has been suggested that sensory enhancement is an essential mechanism that underlies object based attention the sensory enhancement theory of object based attention proposes that when attention is directed to a cued object the quality of the object s physical representations improve because the spread of attention facilitates the efficiency of processing the features of the object as a whole the qualities of the cued object such as spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity are therefore more strongly represented in one s memory than the qualities of other objects or locations that received little or no attentional resource information processing of these objects also tends to be significantly faster and more accurate as the representations have become more salient single cell recordings experiments were the first experiments to support the presence of sensory enhancement v1 neurons in monkeys were measured for neural responses by roelfsema lamme spekreijse 1998 while the monkeys performed a curve tracing task the neurons were found to be more active when their receptor fields were on the target curve as opposed to when their receptor fields fell on the distractor curve furthermore enhancement was present in the neurons whose receptor fields were on segments of the

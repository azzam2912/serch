breakage of the tree bole trunk instead of uprooting is sometimes called windsnap windthrow is common in all forested parts of the world that experience storms or high wind speeds the risk of windthrow to a tree is related to the tree s size height and diameter the sail area presented by its crown the anchorage provided by its roots its exposure to the wind and the local wind climate a common way of quantifying the risk of windthrow to a forest area is to model the probability or return time of a wind speed that would damage those trees at that location tree senescence can also be a factor where multiple factors contributing to the declining health of a tree reduce its anchorage and therefore increase its susceptibility to windthrow the resulting damage can be a significant factor in the development of a forest windthrow can also increase following logging especially in young forests managed specifically for timber the removal of trees at a forest s edge increases the exposure of the remaining trees to the wind trees that grow adjacent to lakes or other natural forest edges or in exposed situations such as hill sides develop greater rooting

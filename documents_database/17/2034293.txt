this conjecture is named after heiko harborth and if true would strengthen f ry s theorem on the existence of straight line drawings for every planar graph for this reason a drawing with integer edge lengths is also known as an integral f ry embedding despite much subsequent research harborth s conjecture remains unsolved although harborth s conjecture is not known to be true for all planar graphs it has been proven for several special kinds of planar graph one class of graphs that have integral f ry embeddings are the graphs that can be reduced to the empty graph by a sequence of operations of two types for such a graph a rational f ry embedding can be constructed incrementally by reversing this removal process using the facts that the set of points that are at a rational distance from two given points are dense in the plane and that if three points have rational distance between one pair and square root of rational distance between the other two pairs then the points at rational distances from all three are again dense in the plane the distances in such an embedding can be made into integers by scaling the

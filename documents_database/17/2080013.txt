in the synergistic response the applied antibiotics work together to produce an effect more potent than if each antibiotic were applied singly compare to the additive effect where the potency of an antibiotic combination is roughly equal to the combined potencies of each antibiotic singly and antagonistic effect where the potency of the combination is less than the combined potencies of each antibiotic clinical interest in synergism dates back to the early 1950s when practitioners noted that patients with enterococcal endocarditis experienced a high relapse rate when penicillin g alone was used for treatment and a demonstrably lower relapse rate when streptomycin was combined with penicillin g to combat the infection since that time the research community has conducted numerous studies regarding the effects and possibilities of antibiotic combinations today combination therapy is recognized as providing a broad spectrum of antibiotic coverage effectively fighting polymicrobial infections minimizing selection for antibiotic resistant strains lowering dose toxicity where applicable and in some cases providing synergistic activity antibiotic synergy is desirable in a clinic sense for several reasons at the patient level the boosted antimicrobial potency provided by synergy allows the body to more rapidly clear infections resulting in shorter courses of antibiotic

one definition offered by pioneers in the field is that volumetric displays create 3d imagery via the emission scattering or relaying of illumination from well defined regions in x y z space a true volumetric display renders a digital representation of a real object in a physical space volume the resulting image displays similar characteristics to a real world object enabling an observer to view it from any direction focus a camera on a specific detail and see perspective meaning parts of the image closer to the viewer will appear bigger than parts that are further away volumetric 3d displays are autostereoscopic that is they create 3d imagery visible to the unaided eye volumetric 3d displays embody just one family of 3d displays in general other types of 3d displays are stereograms stereoscopes view sequential displays electro holographic displays parallax two view displays and parallax panoramagrams which are typically spatially multiplexed systems such as lenticular sheet displays and parallax barrier displays re imaging systems and others although first postulated in 1912 and a staple of science fiction volumetric displays are still not widely used in everyday life there are numerous potential markets for volumetric displays with uses cases including medical

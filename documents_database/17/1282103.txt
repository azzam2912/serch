it is named after the brinell scale of hardness in which a small ball is pushed against a hard surface at a preset level of force and the depth and diameter of the mark indicates the brinell hardness of the surface brinelling is a process of wear in which similar marks are pressed into the surface of a moving part such as bearings or hydraulic pistons the brinelling is usually undesirable as the parts often mate with other parts in very close proximity the very small indentations can quickly lead to improper operation like chattering or excess vibration which in turn can accelerate other forms of wear such as spalling and galling brinelling is a material surface failure caused by hertz contact stress that exceeds the material limit it usually occurs in situations where a significant load force is distributed over a relatively small surface area brinelling typically results from a heavy or repeated impact load either while stopped or during rotation though it can also be caused by just one application of a force greater than the material limit brinelling can be caused by a heavy load resting on a stationary bearing for an extended length of time the

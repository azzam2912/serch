developed in 1993 original genemark was used in 1995 as a primary gene prediction tool for annotation of the first completely sequenced bacterial genome of haemophilus influenzae and in 1996 for the first archaeal genome of methanococcus jannaschii the algorithm introduced inhomogeneous three periodic markov chain models of protein coding dna sequence that became standard in gene prediction as well as bayesian approach to gene prediction in two dna strands simultaneously species specific parameters of the models were estimated from training sets of sequences of known type protein coding and non coding the major step of the algorithm computes for a given dna fragment posterior probabilities of either being protein coding carrying genetic code in each of six possible reading frames including three frames in complementary dna strand or being non coding original genemark developed before the hmm era in bioinformatics is an hmm like algorithm it can be viewed as approximation to known in the hmm theory posterior decoding algorithm for appropriately defined hmm the genemark hmm algorithm 1998 was designed to improve gene prediction accuracy in finding short genes and gene starts the idea was to integrate the markov chain models used in genemark into a hidden markov

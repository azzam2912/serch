it is sometimes known as the thermal flywheel effect for example when outside temperatures are fluctuating throughout the day a large thermal mass within the insulated portion of a house can serve to flatten out the daily temperature fluctuations since the thermal mass will absorb thermal energy when the surroundings are higher in temperature than the mass and give thermal energy back when the surroundings are cooler without reaching thermal equilibrium this is distinct from a material s insulative value which reduces a building s thermal conductivity allowing it to be heated or cooled relatively separate from the outside or even just retain the occupants thermal energy longer scientifically thermal mass is equivalent to thermal capacitance or heat capacity the ability of a body to store thermal energy it is typically referred to by the symbol c and its si unit is j c or j k which are equivalent thermal mass may also be used for bodies of water machines or machine parts living things or any other structure or body in engineering or biology in those contexts the term heat capacity is typically used instead the equation relating thermal energy to thermal mass is where q is the

work on the program began in 1994 and was funded by darpa it was created with the initial goals of developing several key components for the system including a high capacity high bandwidth spatial light modulator used for data input optimised sensor arrays for data output and a high power red light semiconductor laser at the same time the hdss researchers were to explore issues relating to the optical systems architecture such as multiplexing schemes and access modes data encoding and decoding methods signal processing techniques and the requirements of target applications into the programme s final year progress has been such that consortium member ibm research division believes that holograms could hold the key to high capacity data storage in the next millennium large amounts of data can be stored holographically because lasers are able to store pages of electronic patterns within special optical materials as opposed to just on the surface in traditional holography each viewing angle gives a different aspect of the same object with holographic storage however a different page of information is accessed holographic storage uses two laser beams a reference and a data beam to create an interference pattern at a medium where the

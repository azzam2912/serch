gazebo integrated the ode physics engine opengl rendering and support code for sensor simulation and actuator control in 2011 gazebo became an independent project supported by willow garage in 2012 open source robotics foundation osrf became the steward of the gazebo project osrf changed its name to open robotics in 2018 gazebo can use multiple high performance physics engines such as ode bullet etc the default is ode it provides realistic rendering of environments including high quality lighting shadows and textures it can model sensors that see the simulated environment such as laser range finders cameras including wide angle kinect style sensors etc gazebo has been used as the simulation environment for a number of technology challenges and competitions 2012 to 2015 2016 to 2017 2016 to 2017 2016 to 2019 the national institute of standards and technology nist put on the first ariac competition in june 2017 the goal of the competition was to test the agility of industrial robot systems with the goal of enabling industrial robots on the shop floors to be more productive more autonomous and to require less time from shop floor workers 2016 to 2017 2018 to 2021 2019

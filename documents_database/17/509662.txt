through genetic engineering of the underlying dna the amino acid sequence of insulin can be changed to alter its adme absorption distribution metabolism and excretion characteristics officially the u s food and drug administration fda refers to these as insulin receptor ligands although they are more commonly referred to as insulin analogs these modifications have been used to create two types of insulin analogs those that are more readily absorbed from the injection site and therefore act faster than natural insulin injected subcutaneously intended to supply the bolus level of insulin needed at mealtime prandial insulin and those that are released slowly over a period of between 8 and 24 hours intended to supply the basal level of insulin during the day and particularly at nighttime basal insulin the first insulin analog approved for human therapy insulin lispro rdna was manufactured by eli lilly and company eli lilly and company developed and marketed the first rapid acting insulin analogue insulin lispro rdna humalog it was engineered through recombinant dna technology so that the penultimate lysine and proline residues on the c terminal end of the b chain were reversed this modification did not alter the insulin receptor binding but blocked

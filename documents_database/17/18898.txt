for long distance transmission hvdc systems may be less expensive and have lower electrical losses for underwater power cables hvdc avoids the heavy currents required to charge and discharge the cable capacitance each cycle for shorter distances the higher cost of dc conversion equipment compared to an ac system may still be justified due to other benefits of direct current links hvdc currently uses voltages between 100 kv and 800 kv with an 1 100 kv link in china that they just completed on the 1st of november 2019 hvdc allows power transmission between unsynchronized ac transmission systems since the power flow through an hvdc link can be controlled independently of the phase angle between source and load it can stabilize a network against disturbances due to rapid changes in power hvdc also allows transfer of power between grid systems running at different frequencies such as 50 hz and 60 hz this improves the stability and economy of each grid by allowing exchange of power between incompatible networks the modern form of hvdc transmission uses technology developed extensively in the 1930s in sweden asea and in germany early commercial installations included one in the soviet union in 1951 between moscow

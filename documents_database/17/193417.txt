aerozine continues in wide use as a rocket fuel typically with dinitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer with which it is hypergolic aerozine 50 is more stable than hydrazine alone and has a higher density and boiling point than udmh alone by mixing pure hydrazine with udmh hydrazine s inconveniently high freezing point of 2 c is lowered through freezing point depression in addition udmh is a more stable molecule this reduces the chances of straight hydrazine decomposing unexpectedly increasing safety and allowing the blend to be used as a coolant in regeneratively cooled engines hydrazine may also be mixed with monomethyl hydrazine mmh because mmh is slightly denser net performance is increased slightly this type of fuel is mainly used for interplanetary probes and spacecraft propulsion unlike other more common propellants like liquid oxygen or liquid hydrogen aerozine 50 is liquid at room temperature and can be stored in liquid state without significant boil off thus making it a storable propellant better suited for long term interplanetary missions aerozine 50 was largely used in icbms and in their derivative launchers such as the core stages of the titan ii iii iv rocket because an icbm requires long term storage and

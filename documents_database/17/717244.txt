these chemical compounds can have active metabolic functions however they are not just set apart for later use reserve differs from structure in the first place by its dynamics reserve has an implied turnover because it is synthesized from food or other substrates in the environment and used by metabolic processes occurring in cells the turnover of structure depends on the maintenance of an organism maintenance is not required for reserve a freshly laid egg consists almost exclusively of reserve and hardly respires the chemical compounds in the reserve have the same turnover while that in the structure can have a different turnover and so it depends on the compound reserves are synthesized from environmental substrates food for use by the metabolism for the purpose of somatic maintenance including protein turnover maintenance of concentration gradients across membranes activity and other types of work growth increase of structural mass maturity maintenance installation of regulation systems preparation for reproduction maintenance of defense systems such as the immune system maturation increase of the state of maturity and reproduction this organizational position of reserve creates a rather constant internal chemical environment with only an indirect coupling with the extra organismal environment reserves as well

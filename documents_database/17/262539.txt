especially when high speeds are involved as in motor racing and cycling drafting can significantly reduce the paceline s average energy expenditure required to maintain a certain speed and can also slightly reduce the energy expenditure of the lead vehicle or object drafting is used to reduce wind resistance and is seen most commonly in bicycle racing motorcycle racing car racing and speedskating though drafting is occasionally used even in cross country skiing downhill skateboarding and running some forms of triathlon allow drafting drafting occurs in swimming as well both in open water races occurring in natural bodies of water and in traditional races in competition pools in a competition pool a swimmer may hug the lane line that separates them from the swimmer they are abaft of thereby taking advantage of the liquid slipstream in the other swimmer s wake drafting also occurs in competitive longboarding it is believed but not yet conclusively proven that thoroughbred racing horses draft each other especially in longer races in cycling any time one bicyclist is riding behind another energy is conserved especially at higher speeds in road bicycle racing the main largest group of tightly packed cyclists in a race is called

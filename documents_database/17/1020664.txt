this is achieved by immersing both the objective lens and the specimen in a transparent oil of high refractive index thereby increasing the numerical aperture of the objective lens immersion oils are transparent oils that have specific optical and viscosity characteristics necessary for use in microscopy typical oils used have an index of refraction around 1 515 an oil immersion objective is an objective lens specially designed to be used in this way many condensers also give optimal resolution when the condenser lens is immersed in oil lenses reconstruct the light scattered by an object to successfully achieve this end ideally all the diffraction orders have to be collected this is related to the opening angle of the lens and its refractive index the resolution of a microscope is defined as the minimum separation needed between two objects under examination in order for the microscope to discern them as separate objects this minimum distance is labelled if two objects are separated by a distance shorter than they will appear as a single object in the microscope a measure of the resolving power r p of a lens is given by its numerical aperture na where is the wavelength of light

commonly known as the dog lichen lichens of peltigera are often terricolous growing on soil but can also occur on moss trees rocks and many other substrates in many parts of the world most peltigera species have the cyanobacterium nostoc as the dominant phytobiont but some have the chlorophyte coccomyxa in which case they also have small gall like growths containing nostoc because of their ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere such lichens are influential in soil composition and generation species of peltigera are foliose with broad lobed thalli although the size of the thalli is variable and species dependent in some species the thalli can grow quite large up to 30 cm in diameter the color of the upper surface may range from drab gray brown or greenish lower surfaces are typically without a cortex unlike other foliose lichens and cottony often with fungal hyphae fused to form a network of veins the reproductive structures isidia soredia or lobules may be present in some species all species of peltigera associate with the nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria nostoc p didactyla is a common pioneer species on disturbed soils and nutrient poor grasslands in western europe at deception island in the

it is a resident breeder in much of sub saharan africa although most common in the west it does not migrate but follows the rains to some extent in 1760 the french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson included a description of the mosque swallow in his ornithologie based on a specimen collected in senegal he used the french name l hirondelle du s n gal and the latin hirundo senegalensis although brisson coined latin names these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the international commission on zoological nomenclature when in 1766 the swedish naturalist carl linnaeus updated his systema naturae for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by brisson one of these was the mosque swallow linnaeus included a brief description and used brisson s latin name for his binomial name hirundo senegalensis formerly placed in the genus hirundo the mosque swallow and its relatives have been shown by molecular studies to be a separate clade and are now placed in the genus cecropis which was introduced by the german zoologist friedrich boie in 1826 there are three recognised subspecies the mosque swallow is the largest and heaviest species

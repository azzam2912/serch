it should not be confused with basicity which is an absolute measurement on the ph scale alkalinity is the strength of a buffer solution composed of weak acids and their conjugate bases it is measured by titrating the solution with a monoprotic acid such as hcl until its ph changes abruptly or it reaches a known endpoint where that happens alkalinity is expressed in units of meq l milliequivalents per liter which corresponds to the amount of monoprotic acid added as a titrant in millimoles per liter although alkalinity is primarily a term invented by oceanographers it is also used by hydrologists to describe temporary hardness moreover measuring alkalinity is important in determining a stream s ability to neutralize acidic pollution from rainfall or wastewater it is one of the best measures of the sensitivity of the stream to acid inputs there can be long term changes in the alkalinity of streams and rivers in response to human disturbances in 1884 professor wilhelm william dittmar of anderson college now the university of strathclyde analysed 77 pristine seawater samples from around the world brought back by the challenger expedition he found that in seawater the major ions were in a fixed

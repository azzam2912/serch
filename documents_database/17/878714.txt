the genus was named in 2005 by l junchang and zhang xingliao the type species is eopteranodon lii it is based on the type specimen or holotype bpv 078 an incomplete skeleton and skull its skull including a large crest was toothless and similar to that of pteranodon the skull lacks the point of the snout but it was in life less than 200 millimeters long 7 9 inches and the animal had a wingspan of about 1 1 meters 3 6 feet a second specimen d2526 described in 2006 had a larger wingspan despite its similarities to pteranodon eopteranodon was not placed into a family by its describers who put it into the clade pteranodontia as incertae sedis uncertain position shortly thereafter a phylogenetic study of all known yixian pterosaurs by the same scientists found it to be close to the azhdarchoids noted for the crested genera tapejara and tupuxuara and the giant long necked quetzalcoatlus a further analysis of other recently discovered forms in 2006 still considered basal to having split off earlier than azhdarchoids helped the original authors along with david unwin to place these species together with eopteranodon in a new clade chaoyangopteridae the possible sister

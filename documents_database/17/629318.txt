it was filip hammar and fredrik wikingsson first success and was the show that brought them to fame the concept involved filip and fredrik making fun of both famous and unknown people using a hidden camera and similar setups the jokes were of a rather unusual sometimes experimental nature and some viewers took offense feeling that the pair were humiliating innocent people the show made the headlines due to a segment called the swedish nazi reference championship where they fooled singer and former expedition robinson star emma andersson into an interview where they made as many nazi references as possible and observed her reactions this included jokes such as naming the show they claimed to work for treblinka claiming that leni riefenstahl was a modern director of music videos that joseph goebbels was a dj whose music resembled andersson s and dozens of other references to the third reich and the holocaust throughout the interview andersson wore a t shirt with the text treblinka class of 45 andersson didn t seem to react at all on tape she later claimed that her reactions were edited out in order to make fun of her a claim fredrik wikingsson has later refuted

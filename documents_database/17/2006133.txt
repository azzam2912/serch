as a state defense force the nsg served on as a component of the organized militia of nebraska serving as reservists who trained periodically but could be called up during an emergency however unlike the nebraska national guard the nebraska state guard could not be federalized or deployed outside the state rather when the national guard was deployed the purpose of the state guard was to assume the stateside duties of the national guard both the national guard and the various state defense forces trace their roots to organized militia units which composed the majority of american military forces before the creation of the modern national guard under the militia act of 1903 the first organized militia the nebraska volunteers was a division sized unit of volunteers created by an act of the nebraska territorial legislature in 1856 nebraska later created several multiple units during the american civil war following the american entrance into world war ii and federalization of all national guard units numerous states created state defense forces in order to protect their territory against invasion unrest insurrection and sabotage while their national guard units were deployed nebraska created the nebraska state guard in 1942 in april 1943

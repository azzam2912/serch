in some cases the order of magnitude may be implied usually 1 like a second or year in other cases the quantity name implies the base unit like century in most cases the base unit is seconds or years prefixes are not usually used with a base unit of years so we say a million years not a megayear clock time and calendar time have duodecimal or sexagesimal orders of magnitude rather than decimal i e a year is 12 months and a minute is 60 seconds the smallest meaningful increment of time is the planck time the time light takes to traverse the planck distance many decimal orders of magnitude smaller than a second the largest realized amount of time given known scientific data is the age of the universe about 13 8 billion years the time since the big bang as measured in the cosmic microwave background rest frame those amounts of time together span 60 decimal orders of magnitude metric prefixes are defined spanning 10 to 10 48 decimal orders of magnitude which may be used in conjunction with the metric base unit of second metric units of time larger than the second are most commonly seen

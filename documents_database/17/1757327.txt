the kvtk contains an rd 0146d engine and is designed for use on angara rockets kvtk would be the first hydrogen powered upper stage for use on a russian launch vehicle although khrunichev has previously produced a hydrogen powered upper stage kvd 1 for the indian gslv kvtk is designed to provide up to five ignitions allowing for complex orbital maneuvering and have an on orbit lifespan of up to nine hours kvtk would allow an increase in payload to gto of 20 50 compared to the angara a5 s standard briz m upper stage powered by udmh and no the kvtk was originally studied as an upper stage for the energia family of rockets but in 1987 was superseded by the rcs stage retro and corrections stage based loosely on the american s ivb in 1996 consideration was briefly given to constructing a kvtk derived russian propulsion module for the international space station most likely this module would have been transported to the iss by a space shuttle the kvsk rcaf would be a smaller cryogenic stage carrying of propellant for the proposed angara a3 while the kvsk a7 would be a larger stage loaded with for the proposed

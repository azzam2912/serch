fruits may also be damaged in the northern hemisphere it is also called southwest injury the reason the sun can cause so much damage to trees is because of dormancy when a tree is dormant in the winter it can be reactivated by warm weather in the northern woods trees are exposed to the most sunlight and heat on the southwest facing side so this side is heated during warm sunny winter days in the afternoon that s why westwards to the point that it can be awoken from dormancy the temperature required to wake up a tree depends on plant species and length of day but it is typically just above freezing once active the cells on the southwest side of the plant are unable to return to dormancy by nightfall at which time the temperature returns to levels capable of killing active cells fluctuating winter temperatures can also cause frost cracks which result from the expanding and contracting of the tree trunk when sun scald appears on trees it is most frequently a result of reflected light off the snow during winter months the damage in this case will appear as sunken or dead bark on the trunk

the volcanic chain intersects with the cord n chalviri volcanic chain both chains cover a surface area of and contain cones vents lava domes lava flows and maars including a lava dome and silicic flow with a surface area of puntas negras specifically covers an area of which runs from the chiliques volcano on the north to volc n puntas negras almost to the se the puntas negras volcano forms the common endpoint of two chains of volcanoes in a v shaped configuration the southern leg of the v is called cord n chalviri whose other extreme is the cerro tuyajto sw of puntas negras and at the same distance se of the mi iques volcano several small volcanic centres and lava flows are found here including aguas calientes cerros cenizas chinchilla and laguna escondida which have well preserved craters the volcanic chain is associated with a topographic anomaly in the region a property that other volcanoes in the area also have rocks in the chain are andesite basaltic andesite and dacite magmas from this volcanic chain have a calc alkaline composition formed by partial melting of a mantle wedge with research indicating a decrease in sio concentration over time

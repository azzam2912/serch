the morphological classification is sab s 0 which indicates a lenticular structure with a weak bar across the center and pure spiral arms without a ring it belongs to the virgo cluster and is one of the brightest known lenticular galaxies in the galaxy s outer halo globular cluster orbital velocities indicate abnormal poverty of dark matter only 43 18 of the mass within 5 effective radii the inner nucleus of this galaxy displays a rise in stellar orbital motion that indicates the presence of a central dark mass the best fit model for the motion of molecular gas in the core region suggests there is a supermassive black hole with about 450 million times the mass of the sun this is the first object to have its black hole mass estimated by measuring the rotation of gas molecules around its centre with an astronomical interferometer in this case the combined array for research in millimeter wave astronomy supernova sn 1969e was discovered in this galaxy in 1969 reaching a peak magnitude of 16 in 1994 a type 1a supernova was discovered about two weeks before reaching peak brightness designated sn 1994d it was caused by the explosion of a

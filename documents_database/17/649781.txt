it takes place when pigment cells slough off from the back of the iris and float around in the aqueous humor over time these pigment cells can accumulate in the anterior chamber in such a way that they begin to clog the trabecular meshwork the major site of aqueous humour drainage which can in turn prevent the aqueous humour from draining and therefore increases the pressure inside the eye with pds the intraocular pressure tends to spike at times and then can return to normal exercise has been shown to contribute to spikes in pressure as well when the pressure is great enough to cause damage to the optic nerve this is called pigmentary glaucoma as with all types of glaucoma when damage happens to the optic nerve fibers the vision loss that occurs is irreversible and painless this condition is rare but occurs most often in caucasians particularly men and the age of onset is relatively low mid 20s to 40s as the crystalline lens hardens with age the lens zonules pull away from the iris and the syndrome lessens and stops the main risk factor is nearsightedness genetic factors may also play a part in the transition from

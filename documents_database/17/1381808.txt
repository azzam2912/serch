they are thus accordingly sometimes called shriek maps with shriek being slang for an exclamation mark though other terms are used depending on context shriek notation is used in two senses in algebraic geometry these arise in image functors for sheaves particularly verdier duality where formula 1 is a less usual functor in algebraic topology these arise particularly in fiber bundles where they yield maps that have the opposite of the usual variance they are thus called wrong way maps gysin maps as they originated in the gysin sequence or transfer maps a fiber bundle formula 6 with base space b fiber f and total space e has like any other continuous map of topological spaces a covariant map on homology formula 7 and a contravariant map on cohomology formula 8 however it also has a covariant map on cohomology corresponding in de rham cohomology to integration along the fiber and a contravariant map on homology corresponding in de rham cohomology to pointwise product with the fiber the composition of the wrong way map with the usual map gives a map from the homology of the base to itself analogous to a unit counit of an adjunction compare also galois

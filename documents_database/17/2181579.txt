the theory of selection principles studies these principles and their relations to other mathematical properties selection principles mainly describe covering properties measure and category theoretic properties and local properties in topological spaces especially function spaces often the characterization of a mathematical property using a selection principle is a nontrivial task leading to new insights on the characterized property in 1924 karl menger introduced the following basis property for metric spaces every basis of the topology contains a sequence of sets with vanishing diameters that covers the space soon thereafter witold hurewicz observed that menger s basis property is equivalent to the following selective property for every sequence of open covers of the space one can select finitely many open sets from each cover in the sequence such that the selected sets cover the space topological spaces having this covering property are called menger spaces hurewicz s reformulation of menger s property was the first important topological property described by a selection principle let formula 1 and formula 2 be classes of mathematical objects in 1996 marion scheepers introduced the following selection hypotheses capturing a large number of classic mathematical properties in the case where the classes formula 1 and formula

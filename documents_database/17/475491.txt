the regiment is an australian light horse unit and has been widely romanticised and popularised in literature and poetry throughout the 20th century the unit sentimentally traces its lineage to 1860 and is the oldest australian regular army unit through antecedent units the 2nd moreton light horse qmi and the 14th west moreton light horse qmi the regiment is assigned to 7th brigade based in brisbane and is equipped with the m1a1 abrams tank and the aslav reconnaissance vehicle the lineage of what is now known as the queensland mounted infantry is quite convoluted and less linear than sentiment would suggest initially after the russian scare of the crimean war when every state in australia carried a paranoid belief that they were the secret targets of the russian invasion fleet the response was to establish militia units to confront this menace in queensland this culminated in a group of enthusiastic horsemen creating the queensland mounted rifles in 1860 with two troops formed at brisbane and ipswich this experiment lasted until 1863 when numbers dropped off and the brisbane troop was disbanded the ipswich troop was renamed the queensland light horse in 1864 and remained so until it too suffered declining

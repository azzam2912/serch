the dh 108 featured a tailless swept wing with a single vertical stabilizer similar to the layout of the wartime german messerschmitt me 163 komet rocket powered point defence interceptor initially designed to evaluate swept wing handling characteristics at low and high subsonic speeds for the proposed early tailless design of the comet airliner three examples of the dh 108 were built to air ministry specifications e 1 45 and e 11 45 with the adoption of a conventional tail for the comet the aircraft were used instead to investigate swept wing handling up to supersonic speeds all three prototypes were lost in fatal crashes employing the main fuselage section and engine of the de havilland vampire mated to a longer fuselage with a single tailfin and swept wings the de havilland dh 108 was proposed in 1944 as a test mule for the dh 106 comet which had initially been considered a tailless swept wing concept despite the comet design taking on more conventional features the value of testing the unique configuration to provide basic data for the dh 110 spurred de havilland to continue development of the dh 108 selecting two airframes from the english electric vampire f

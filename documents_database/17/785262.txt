in other words it is a compactness theorem for the space bv it is named for the austrian mathematician eduard helly the theorem has applications throughout mathematical analysis in probability theory the result implies compactness of a tight family of measures let u be an open subset of the real line and let f u r n n be a sequence of functions suppose that then there exists a subsequence f k n of f and a function f u r locally of bounded variation such that there are many generalizations and refinements of helly s theorem the following theorem for bv functions taking values in banach spaces is due to barbu and precupanu let x be a reflexive separable hilbert space and let e be a closed convex subset of x let x 0 be positive definite and homogeneous of degree one suppose that z is a uniformly bounded sequence in bv 0 t x with z t e for all n n and t 0 t then there exists a subsequence z and functions z bv 0 t x such that

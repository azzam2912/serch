the name crm chloroplast rna splicing and ribosome maturation has been suggested to reflect the functions established for four characterised members of the family zea mays maize crs1 caf1 and caf2 proteins and the escherichia coli protein yhby proteins containing the crm domain are found in eubacteria archaea and plants the crm domain is represented as a stand alone protein in archaea and bacteria and in single and multi domain proteins in plants it has been suggested that prokaryotic crm proteins existed as ribosome associated proteins prior to the divergence of archaea and bacteria and that they were co opted in the plant lineage as rna binding modules by incorporation into diverse protein contexts plant crm domains are predicted to reside not only in the chloroplast but also in the mitochondrion and the nucleo cytoplasmic compartment the diversity of the crm domain family in plants suggests a diverse set of rna targets the crm domain is a compact alpha beta domain consisting of a four stranded beta sheet and three alpha helices with an alpha beta alpha beta alpha beta beta topology the beta sheet face is basic consistent with a role in rna binding proximal to the basic beta

this condition often results in a failure to complete the operating cycle properly termed a malfunction but commonly and incorrectly termed a jam rifles and shotguns if fired without the stock in the shoulder may also be prone to limp wristing of the important variables involved in this type of malfunction bullet and gas momentum slide and barrel mass recoil spring pre load and spring rate and shooting hand and arm mass are much more important than the compliance limpness of the wrist the cycling of any type of semiautomatic firearm can be broken down into two phases the first is the rearward motion of the bolt or slide hereafter referred to only as slide which is the most common form in pistols the second is the forward motion of the slide the rearward motion of the slide is initiated by the force of firing and continues using the slide s inertia while the slide moves rearwards a spring called the recoil spring is compressed absorbing the energy of the slide while slowing it down approximately 50 of the momentum imparted by the bullet and gas is converted into kinetic energy of the slide relative to the frame this energy

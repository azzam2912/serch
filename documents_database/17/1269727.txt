in the first step the ions are separated according to their mobility through a buffer gas on a millisecond timescale using an ion mobility spectrometer the separated ions are then introduced into a mass analyzer in a second step where their mass to charge ratios can be determined on a microsecond timescale the effective separation of analytes achieved with this method makes it widely applicable in the analysis of complex samples such as in proteomics and metabolomics earl w mcdaniel has been called the father of ion mobility mass spectrometry in the early 1960s he coupled a low field ion mobility drift cell to a sector mass spectrometer the combination of time of flight mass spectrometry and ion mobility spectrometry was pioneered in 1963 at bell labs in 1963 mcafee and edelson published an ims tof combination in 1967 mcknight mcafee and sipler published an ims tof combination their instrument included an orthogonal tof in 1969 cohen et al filed a patent on an ims qms system the qms at that time was an improvement compared to the tofms because the tofms had a slow electronic data acquisition systems at that time in 1970 young edelson and falconer published an

when the plate is driven as an antenna by a driving frequency the slot radiates electromagnetic waves in a way similar to a dipole antenna the shape and size of the slot as well as the driving frequency determine the radiation pattern often the radio waves are provided by a waveguide and the antenna consists of slots in the waveguide an antenna consisting of multiple parallel slots in a waveguide is a widely used array antenna which radiates a narrow fan shaped beam of microwaves at right angles to the waveguide with its narrow axis in the plane of the waveguide and its wide axis perpendicular to the waveguide slot antennas are normally used at uhf and microwave frequencies where the waves are usually conducted by waveguide so a slot in the waveguide makes a simple antenna multiple slot versions are widely used in radar antennas particularly marine radar antennas on ships for the sector antennas used for cell phone base stations and are often found in standard desktop microwave sources used for research purposes a slot antenna s main advantages are its size design simplicity and convenient adaptation to mass production using either waveguide or pc board technology due

the centre was funded in the september 2016 arc linkage round fleet aims to develop a new generation of ultra low resistance electronic devices capitalising on australian research in atomically thin materials topological materials exciton superfluids and nanofabrication fleet is pursuing three broad research themes to develop devices in which electrical current can flow without resistance these approaches are enabled by the following two technologies fleet is an australian initiative headquartered at monash university and in conjunction with the australian national university the university of new south wales the university of queensland rmit university the university of wollongong and swinburne university of technology complemented by a group of australian and international partners it is funded by the australian research council and by the member universities fleet s director is michael fuhrer who is an arc laureate fellow in the school of physics and astronomy at monash university studying two dimensional materials of which graphene is the most well known example and topological insulators deputy director is alexander hamilton at the university of new south wales fleet partners include australian nuclear science and technology organisation the australian synchrotron california institute of technology columbia university in the city of new york johannes

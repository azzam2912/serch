the active site consists of residues that form temporary bonds with the substrate binding site and residues that catalyse a reaction of that substrate catalytic site although the active site is small relative to the whole volume of the enzyme it only occupies 10 20 of the total volume it is the most important part of the enzyme as it directly catalyzes the chemical reaction it usually consists of three to four amino acids while other amino acids within the protein are required to maintain the protein tertiary structure of the enzyme each active site is evolved to be optimised to bind a particular substrate and catalyse a particular reaction resulting in high specificity this specificity is determined by the arrangement of amino acids within the active site and the structure of the substrates sometimes enzymes also need to bind with some cofactors to fulfil their function the active site is usually a groove or pocket of the enzyme which can be located in a deep tunnel within the enzyme or between the interfaces of multimeric enzymes an active site can catalyse a reaction repeatedly as residues are not altered at the end of the reaction they may change during

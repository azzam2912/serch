the herbrand ribet theorem and the gras conjecture are both easy consequences of the main conjecture there are several generalizations of the main conjecture to totally real fields cm fields elliptic curves and so on was partly motivated by an analogy with weil s description of the zeta function of an algebraic curve over a finite field in terms of eigenvalues of the frobenius endomorphism on its jacobian in this analogy the main conjecture of iwasawa theory was formulated as an assertion that two methods of defining p adic l functions by module theory by interpolation should coincide as far as that was well defined this was proved by for q and for all totally real number fields by these proofs were modeled upon ken ribet s proof of the converse to herbrand s theorem the herbrand ribet theorem karl rubin found a more elementary proof of the mazur wiles theorem by using thaine s method and kolyvagin s euler systems described in and and later proved other generalizations of the main conjecture for imaginary quadratic fields the main conjecture of iwasawa theory proved by mazur and wiles states that if i is an odd integer not congruent to 1

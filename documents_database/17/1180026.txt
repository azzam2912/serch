it was the first soft gamma repeater discovered and as of 2015 the only known located outside our galaxy first detected in march 1979 it was located by using the measurement of the arrival time differences of the signal by the set of artificial satellites equipped with gamma ray detectors the association with n49 can only be indirect it seems clear that soft gamma repeaters form in young stellar clusters it is not certain that the explosion that gave birth to sgr 0525 66 is also the one that produced the remnant n49 on march 5 1979 two soviet spacecraft that were then drifting through the solar system were hit by a blast of gamma radiation at approximately 10 51 est this contact raised the radiation readings on both the probes from a normal 100 counts per second to over 200 000 counts a second in only a fraction of a millisecond this burst of gamma rays quickly continued to spread eleven seconds later helios 2 a nasa probe which was in orbit around the sun was saturated by the blast of radiation it soon hit venus and the pioneer venus orbiter s detectors were overcome by the wave seconds

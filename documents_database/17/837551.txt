genetic suppression therefore restores the phenotype seen prior to the original background mutation suppressor mutations are useful for identifying new genetic sites which affect a biological process of interest they also provide evidence between functionally interacting molecules and intersecting biological pathways intragenic suppression results from suppressor mutations that occur in the same gene as the original mutation in a classic study francis crick et al used intragenic suppression to study the fundamental nature of the genetic code from this study it was shown that genes are expressed as non overlapping triplets codons researchers showed that mutations caused by either a single base insertion or a single base deletion could be suppressed or restored by a second mutation of the opposite sign as long as the two mutations occurred in the same vicinity of the gene this led to the conclusion that genes needed to be read in a specific reading frame and a single base insertion or deletion would shift the reading frame frameshift mutation in such a way that the remaining dna would code for a different polypeptide than the one intended therefore researchers concluded that the second mutation of opposite sign suppresses the original mutation by restoring the

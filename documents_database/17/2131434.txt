the inequality was conjectured in 1963 by henryk minc and first proved in 1973 by lev m bregman further entropy based proofs have been given by alexander schrijver and jaikumar radhakrishnan the bregman minc inequality is used for example in graph theory to obtain upper bounds for the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph the permanent of a square binary matrix formula 1 of size formula 2 with row sums formula 3 for formula 4 can be estimated by the permanent is therefore bounded by the product of the geometric means of the numbers from formula 6 to formula 7 for formula 4 equality holds if the matrix is a block diagonal matrix consisting of matrices of ones or results from row and or column permutations of such a block diagonal matrix since the permanent is invariant under transposition the inequality also holds for the column sums of the matrix accordingly there is a one to one correspondence between a square binary matrix formula 9 of size formula 2 and a simple bipartite graph formula 11 with equal sized partitions formula 12 and formula 13 by taking this way each nonzero entry of the matrix formula 9 defines

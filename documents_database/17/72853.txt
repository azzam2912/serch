atsc and 8vsb modulation is used primarily in north america in contrast the dvb t standard uses cofdm a modulation method specifies how the radio signal fluctuates to convey information atsc and dvb t specify the modulation used for over the air digital television by comparison qam is the modulation method used for cable the specifications for a cable ready television then might state that it supports 8vsb for broadcast tv and qam for cable tv 8vsb is an 8 level vestigial sideband modulation in essence it converts a binary stream into an octal representation by amplitude shift keying a sinusoidal carrier to one of eight levels 8vsb is capable of transmitting three bits 2 8 per symbol in atsc each symbol includes two bits from the mpeg transport stream which are trellis modulated to produce a three bit figure the resulting signal is then band pass filtered with a nyquist filter to remove redundancies in the side lobes and then shifted up to the broadcast frequency vestigial sideband modulation vsb is a modulation method which attempts to eliminate the spectral redundancy of pulse amplitude modulation pam signals modulating a carrier by a real valued data sequence results in a

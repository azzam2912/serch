the value of each note is not determined by the form of the written note as is the case with more recent european musical notation but rather by its position within a group of notes written as a single figure called a ligature and by the position of the ligature relative to other ligatures modal notation was developed by the composers of the notre dame school from 1170 to 1250 replacing the even and unmeasured rhythm of early polyphony and plainchant with patterns based on the metric feet of classical poetry and was the first step towards the development of modern mensural notation the rhythmic modes of notre dame polyphony were the first coherent system of rhythmic notation developed in western music since antiquity though the use of the rhythmic modes is the most characteristic feature of the music of the late notre dame school especially the compositions of p rotin they are also predominant in much of the rest of the music of the ars antiqua until about the middle of the 13th century composition types which were permeated by the modal rhythm include notre dame organum most famously the organum triplum and organum quadruplum of p rotin conductus

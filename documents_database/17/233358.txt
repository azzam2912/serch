it can be used on many different computer components including the central processing unit cpu gpu ppu and northbridge chipset on the motherboard it consists of at least two main parts the base which is the area that makes contact with the device being cooled and is usually manufactured from metals with high thermal conductivity such as aluminum or copper the second part the top ensures the water is contained safely inside the water block and has connections that allow hosing to connect it with the water cooling loop the top can be made of the same metal as the base transparent perspex delrin nylon or hdpe most newer high end water blocks also contain mid plates which serve to add jet tubes nozzles and other flow altering devices the base top and mid plate s are sealed together to form a block with some sort of path for water to flow through the ends of the path have inlet outlet connectors for the tubing that connects it to the rest of the watercooling system early designs included spiral zig zag pattern or heatsink like fins to allow the largest possible surface area for heat to transfer from the device

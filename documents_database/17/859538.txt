it was patented in a series of patents from september 19 1995 to july 3 2001 and won 2001 asme thomas a edison patent award ght was invented by alexander m gorlov professor of northeastern university the physical principles of the ght work are the same as for its main prototype the darrieus turbine and for the family of similar vertical axis wind turbines which includes also turby wind turbine aerotecture turbine quietrevolution wind turbine etc ght turby and quietrevolution solved pulsatory torque issues by using the helical twist of the blades the original inventor of the helical turbine was ulrich stampa germany patent de2948060a1 1979 the term foil is used to describe the shape of the blade cross section at a given point with no distinction for the type of fluid thus referring to either an airfoil or hydrofoil in the helical design the blades curve around the axis which has the effect of evenly distributing the foil sections throughout the rotation cycle so there is always a foil section at every possible angle of attack in this way the sum of the lift and drag forces on each blade do not change abruptly with rotation angle the turbine

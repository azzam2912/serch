cubewanos have orbits with semi major axes in the 40 50 au range and unlike pluto do not cross neptune s orbit that is they have low eccentricity and sometimes low inclination orbits like the classical planets the name cubewano derives from the first trans neptunian object tno found after pluto and charon 15760 albion which until january 2018 had only had the provisional designation similar objects found later were often called qb1 o s or cubewanos after this object though the term classical is much more frequently used in the scientific literature objects identified as cubewanos include haumea was provisionally listed as a cubewano by the minor planet center in 2006 but turned out to be resonant there are two basic dynamical classes of classical kuiper belt bodies those with relatively unperturbed cold orbits and those with markedly perturbed hot orbits most cubewanos are found between the 2 3 orbital resonance with neptune populated by plutinos and the 1 2 resonance 50000 quaoar for example has a near circular orbit close to the ecliptic plutinos on the other hand have more eccentric orbits bringing some of them closer to the sun than neptune the majority of classical objects the

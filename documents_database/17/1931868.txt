the diameter of this comet is estimated at 3 22 km and its absolute magnitude at 11 reinmuth was discovered during a survey of small solar system bodies with the 40 cm bruce telescope at the lsw heidelberg observatory in heidelberg germany the absolute magnitude of the comet was estimated by karl reinmuth to be 13 two orders of magnitude smaller than the current estimate this comet was found to be a periodic comet by leland e cunningham in berkeley california who calculated an elliptical orbit with a 7 12 year orbital period he also predicted that it would come to perihelion again on october 3 1947 later this was revised to 6 59 years and august 19 1947 the comet ended up reaching perihelion nearly one month after the expected date and the calculations of its orbit was then refined further until the values were correct reinmuth makes many close approaches to jupiter these close approaches gradually change its orbit for example on july 16 2003 comet reinmuth came within 0 74 au of jupiter this increased its perihelion from 1 89 to 2 11 au and its orbital period from 6 63 to 7 07 years on february

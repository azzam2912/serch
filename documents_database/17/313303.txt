tftr was designed with the explicit goal of reaching scientific breakeven the point where the heat being released from the fusion reactions in the plasma is equal or greater than the heating being supplied to the plasma by external devices to warm it up the tftr never achieved this goal but it did produce major advances in confinement time and energy density it was the world s first magnetic fusion device to perform extensive scientific experiments with plasmas composed of 50 50 deuterium tritium d t the fuel mix required for practical fusion power production and also the first to produce more than 10 mw of fusion power it set several records for power output maximum temperature and fusion triple product tftr shut down in 1997 after fifteen years of operation pppl used the knowledge from tftr to begin studying another approach the spherical tokamak in their national spherical torus experiment the japanese jt 60 is very similar to the tftr both tracing their design to key innovations introduced by shoichi yoshikawa during his time at pppl in the 1970s in nuclear fusion there are two types of reactors stable enough to conduct fusion magnetic confinement reactors and inertial confinement

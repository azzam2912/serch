its name stands for simplified acute physiology score and is a supplement to the saps ii scoring system it has been designed to provide a real life predicted mortality for a patient by following a well defined procedure based on a mathematical model that needs calibration predicted mortalities are good when comparing groups of patients and having near real life mortalities means that this scoring system can answer questions like if the patients from hospital a had been in hospital b what would their mortality have been however in order to achieve this functionality you must calibrate the system which is additional effort and it is difficult to compare two groups of patients if they were not scored using the same calibration saps iii is therefore not suitable by itself for publishing data about the morbidity of a single group of patients the saps iii project is conducted by the saps iii outcomes research group sorg some shared calibrations make it possible to calculate a calibration specific saps iii score using paper forms the danish intensive care database did has a standard form to calculate saps iii scores for their specific purpose and require participating icus to provide each of

the energy change associated with this transition provides information on the structure of a molecule and determines many molecular properties such as colour the relationship between the energy involved in the electronic transition and the frequency of radiation is given by planck s relation the electronic transitions in organic compounds and some other compounds can be determined by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy provided that transitions in the ultraviolet uv or visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum exist for this compound electrons occupying a homo of a sigma bond can get excited to the lumo of that bond this process is denoted as a transition likewise promotion of an electron from a bonding orbital to an antibonding orbital is denoted as a transition auxochromes with free electron pairs denoted as n have their own transitions as do aromatic pi bond transitions sections of molecules which can undergo such detectable electron transitions can be referred to as chromophores since such transitions absorb electromagnetic radiation light which may be hypothetically perceived as color somewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum the following molecular electronic transitions exist in addition to these assignments electronic transitions also have so called bands associated with them the following bands are defined

each infinite cell consists of a heptagonal tiling whose vertices lie on a 2 hypercycle each of which has a limiting circle on the ideal sphere the schl fli symbol of the order 3 5 heptagonal honeycomb is 7 3 5 with five heptagonal tilings meeting at each edge the vertex figure of this honeycomb is an icosahedron 3 5 it is a part of a series of regular polytopes and honeycombs with p 3 5 schl fli symbol and icosahedral vertex figures in the geometry of hyperbolic 3 space the order 3 5 octagonal honeycomb a regular space filling tessellation or honeycomb each infinite cell consists of a octagonal tiling whose vertices lie on a 2 hypercycle each of which has a limiting circle on the ideal sphere the schl fli symbol of the order 3 5 heptagonal honeycomb is 8 3 5 with five octagonal tilings meeting at each edge the vertex figure of this honeycomb is an icosahedron 3 5 in the geometry of hyperbolic 3 space the order 3 5 apeirogonal honeycomb a regular space filling tessellation or honeycomb each infinite cell consists of an order 3 apeirogonal tiling whose vertices lie on a 2 hypercycle

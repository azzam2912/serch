27 kb and contains twelve exons interrupted by eleven introns the region flanking the 5 end of the gene lacks a tata box but contains many gc s and also has two caat boxes the gene also may have a binding site for the transcription factor sp1 and has sequences resembling the binding sites of several other transcription factors additionally there is a 101 bp dna fragment immediately upstream from the cap site that has promoter activity the human acat1 gene produces a chimeric mrna through trans splicing a process in which separate transcripts from chromosomes 1 and 7 are spliced together the chimeric mrna transcript uses two sections to initiate translation aug 1397 1399 and ggc 1274 1276 initiation of the first codon aug results in the translation of a 50 kda acat1 and initiation of the other ggc produces another enzymatically active 56 kda isoform respectively the 56kda isoform is naturally present in human cells including human monocyte derived macrophages the resulting transcript encodes acat1 which is a 45 1 kda protein composed of 427 amino acids it is also a homotetrameric protein that has nine transmembrane domains tmds one active residue is a histidine at the 460th

most common is the n channel native transistor historically native transistors were referred to as mosfets without specially grown oxide only natural thin oxide film formed over silicon during processing of other layers a native mosfet is a transistor with nearly zero threshold voltage native n channel transistors have a niche applications in low voltage operational amplifiers and in low voltage digital memory where it functions as the weak pull down it is also used in low voltage interface circuits in most cmos processes native n channel mosfets are fabricated on the native slightly p doped silicon that comprises the bulk region whereas a non native n channel mosfet is fabricated in a p well which has a higher concentration of positive charges due to the increased presence of holes the lower concentration of positive charges in the channel of a native device means that less voltage at the gate terminal is required to repel these positive charges and form a depletion region under the gate with a conducting channel which translates to the native device having a smaller threshold voltage the main disadvantages of the native transistor are the larger size due to additional doping mask and sometimes lower

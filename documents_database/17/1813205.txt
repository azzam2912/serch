although renal stones are routinely and successfully treated on earth the occurrence of these during space flight can prove to be problematic several factors contribute to the formation of renal stones in space dietary changes bone metabolism dehydration increased salt intake as well as decreased urine volumes and increased urine saturation are all possible causes of renal stone formation it has been noted that spaceflight induced changes in urine biochemistry are conducive for stone formation other possible causes include the most common renal stone is calcium oxalate and is usually caused by treatable metabolic disorders of hypercalcuria increased calcium levels in the urine these stones cause pain with passage and blockage and have been known to recur uric acid stones have similar characteristics as the calcium oxalate stones but occur much more rarely approximately 5 of all renal stones since they are translucent they cannot be seen by radiographs struvite stones are generated by infections of urease containing microorganisms that are capable of hydrolyzing the urea in the urine to carbon dioxide and ammonia struvite stones can form when urinary ph rises above 7 2 can fill the renal collection system and can erode into the renal tissue cystine stones

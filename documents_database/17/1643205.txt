equivalently it is the problem of testing whether a given semialgebraic set is non empty this decision problem is np hard and lies in pspace thus it has significantly lower complexity than alfred tarski s quantifier elimination procedure for deciding statements in the without the restriction to existential quantifiers however in practice general methods for the first order theory remain the preferred choice for solving these problems many natural problems in geometric graph theory especially problems of recognizing geometric intersection graphs and straightening the edges of graph drawings with crossings may be solved by translating them into instances of the existential theory of the reals and are complete for this theory the complexity class formula 3 which lies between np and pspace has been defined to describe this class of problems in mathematical logic a theory is a formal language consisting of a set of sentences written using a fixed set of symbols the first order theory of real closed fields has the following symbols a sequence of these symbols forms a sentence that belongs to the first order theory of the reals if it is grammatically well formed all its variables are properly quantified and when interpreted as a

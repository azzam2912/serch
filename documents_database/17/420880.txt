two twisted pairs are connected to these additional contacts while the other two twisted pairs remain connected to the original 8p8c connector s most distant pins 1 and 2 and 7 and 8 a category 6 or 6a plug uses the original contact positions but a category 7 or 7a plug instead uses the contacts located in the four corners and has a protrusion that activates a switch within the jack for the alternative contact positions this reduces crosstalk within the connector that higher speed data is sensitive to the key advantage is that the gg45 interface therefore has plenty of headroom combined with the ability to migrate to higher speed service by upgrading to category 7a patch cords that activate the switch in the jack

typical of heavy duty internal combustion engines used in industrial applications emd engines are designed to allow the cylinder liners pistons piston rings and connecting rods to be replaced at overhaul without removing the entire engine assembly from its application location this increases engine value reduces downtime and allows the engine to be returned to true new engine performance other terms such as cylinder pack liner pack cylinder assembly and cylinder kit are used in the engine industry to describe similar assemblies in the large engine industry the term power assembly has also become generic and is often used to refer to the assemblies used in non emd engines where power pack may be the preferred term although both terms are functionally the same because of the size and weight of the engine assembly and the difficulties of removing and transporting them for repair they are typically serviced on site in stationary applications and in the ship or locomotive in transportation applications designing the engine for easy service is done out of necessity rather than the desire to increase engine serviceability power assemblies are large and heavy and overhead lifting equipment sufficient to lift the fixture and assembly are required

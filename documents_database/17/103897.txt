the mountain is the location of an important silver copper and lead mine the only mine which had been working continuously for over 1 000 years when it finally closed in 1988 since 1992 the visitor mine of rammelsberg has become a unesco world heritage site according to legend the mountain was named after a knight called ramm who was a henchman of emperor otto the great in 968 whilst out hunting the knight tied his horse to a tree in order to pursue some deer through almost impassable terrain his charger impatiently pawed the ground with its hooves whilst waiting for his master to return and so exposed a vein of silver ore according to another explanation the name may be derived from the widespread ramsons found on the slopes it is most probably however that ram is a very old word explanation for ore with copper in italian today rame means copper unlike the mineral deposits of the upper harz the ore deposits at the rammelsberg were caused by the escape of hot metal bearing thermal springs on the sea floor in the devonian period this formation is referred to as a sedimentary exhalative deposit at the bottom

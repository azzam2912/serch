the battle was part of the hook and cod wars waged over control of the low countries and resulted in a significant victory for philip the good duke of burgundy the origins of the conflict lay in a succession dispute between jacqueline of hainaut and john iii duke of bavaria over the counties of hainaut holland and zeeland following the death of count william vi in 1417 jaqueline had originally been married to john iv duke of brabant but in complex circumstances had had this marriage set aside and in 1422 married humphrey duke of gloucester brother of henry v jaqueline s second marriage left hainaut in the hands of john of brabant who had reached a rapprochement with john of bavaria john had made philip of burgundy his heir and this led him to take a role in the dispute in 1424 jaqueline and humphrey had landed with english forces and quickly overrun hainaut the death of john of bavaria in january 1425 led to short campaign by burgundian forces in pursuit of philip s claim and the english were ousted jaqueline had ended the war in the custody of philip but in september 1425 escaped to gouda where

mathematically the instruction implements multiplication of polynomials over the finite field gf 2 where the bitstring formula 1 represents the polynomial formula 2 the clmul instruction also allows a more efficient implementation of the closely related multiplication of larger finite fields gf 2 than the traditional instruction set one use of these instructions is to improve the speed of applications doing block cipher encryption in galois counter mode which depends on finite field gf 2 multiplication another application is the fast calculation of crc values including those used to implement the lz77 sliding window deflate algorithm in zlib and pngcrush the instruction computes the 128 bit carry less product of two 64 bit values the destination is a 128 bit xmm register the source may be another xmm register or memory an immediate operand specifies which halves of the 128 bit operands are multiplied mnemonics specifying specific values of the immediate operand are also defined the presence of the clmul instruction set can be checked by testing one of the

the infrastructure carried water from various sources with the main reservoir located at mazarambroz to the south of the city in the montes de toledo comarca the romans captured toledo in 193 bc the aqueducts are difficult to date precisely they seem to have been built in the 1st or 2nd centuries a d at mazarambroz there is a ruined roman dam known as alcantarilla on the guajaraz a tributary of the tagus from mazarambroz the water was conveyed via layos where there is a modern dam on the guajaraz a pressure drop tower popularly known as the horno de vidrio survives in the final section of the aqueduct elsewhere the romans used drop towers to harness water power for mills but this structure functioned as a water energy dissipator the water entered the tower via an arcade the tower firstly facilitated the aqueduct a less steep path towards toledo secondly it allowed the aqueduct to lose height without excessive slope only the base of the aqueduct bridge by which water entered toledo survives from its position above the tagus gorge it has been suggested the romans used an inverted siphon to bring the water into the city such technology

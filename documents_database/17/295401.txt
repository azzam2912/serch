as a simple crater in a runway could be just filled in the durandal deliberately uses two explosions in order to displace the concrete slabs of a runway damage that is far harder to repair designed to be dropped from low altitudes the bomb s fall is slowed by a parachute the maximum release speed is and the minimum release altitude is when the bomb has reached a 40 angle due to the parachute s drag it fires a rocket booster that accelerates it into the runway surface the primary charge explodes once the weapon has penetrated the concrete and drives the secondary charge even deeper the secondary charge then explodes after a one second delay later production weapons have a programmable fuze that can delay the secondary detonation up to several hours the weapon can penetrate up to of concrete and creates a crater deep and approximately in diameter in addition concrete slabs around the crater are disturbed in an area approximately in diameter the disturbed slabs are displaced up to above the original surface making repair more difficult than the simple crater from a conventional bomb there is a persistent story that the first use of the current

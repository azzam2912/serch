in the equivalent wave picture of quantum mechanics a magnon can be viewed as a quantized spin wave magnons carry a fixed amount of energy and lattice momentum and are spin 1 indicating they obey boson behavior the concept of a magnon was introduced in 1930 by felix bloch in order to explain the reduction of the spontaneous magnetization in a ferromagnet at absolute zero temperature 0 k a heisenberg ferromagnet reaches the state of lowest energy so called ground state in which all of the atomic spins and hence magnetic moments point in the same direction as the temperature increases more and more spins deviate randomly from the alignment increasing the internal energy and reducing the net magnetization if one views the perfectly magnetized state at zero temperature as the vacuum state of the ferromagnet the low temperature state with a few misaligned spins can be viewed as a gas of quasiparticles in this case magnons each magnon reduces the total spin along the direction of magnetization by one unit of formula 1 reduced planck s constant and the magnetization by formula 2 where formula 3 is the gyromagnetic ratio this leads to bloch s law for the temperature

settlement panels made from a variety of substances have been used to monitor settlement patterns and to examine several community processes e g succession recruitment predation competition and invasion resistance these communities are characterized by the presence of a variety of sessile organisms including ascidians bryozoans mussels tube building polychaetes sea anemones sponges barnacles and more common predators on and around fouling communities include small crabs starfish fish limpets chitons other gastropods and a variety of worms fouling communities follow a distinct succession pattern in a natural environment fouling communities are a part of a healthy aquatic system helps test the ecological effectiveness of artificial coral reefs fouling communities can have a negative economic impact on humans such as by damaging the bottom of boats it can when attached to the bottoms of boats bring invasive species to locations where there use to be none fouling communities were highlighted particularly in the literature of marine ecology as a potential example of alternate stable states through the work of john sutherland in the 1970s at duke university although this was later called into question by connell and sousa

this is a clinical laboratory finding it is visualized by drawing blood from a patient and viewing the blood smeared on a slide under a microscope normal neutrophils are uniform in size with an apparent diameter of about 13 m in a film when stained neutrophils have a segmented nucleus and pink orange cytoplasm under light microscope the majority of neutrophils have three nuclear segments lobes connected by tapering chromatin strands a small percentage have four lobes and occasionally five lobes may be seen up to 8 of circulating neutrophils are unsegmented band forms the presence of hypersegmented neutrophils is an important diagnostic feature of megaloblastic anaemias hypersegmentation can also be seen in many other condition but with relatively less diagnostic significance hypersegmentation can sometimes be difficult to assert since interobserver variation is high and important to note is that blacks have a greater neutrophil segmentation than whites neutrophil hypersegmentation is one of the earliest most sensitive and specific signs of megaloblastic anemia mainly caused by hypovitaminosis of vitamin b12 folic acid nuclear hypersegmentation of dna in neutrophils strongly suggests megaloblastosis when associated with macro ovalocytosis if megaloblastosis is suspected a formal lobe count neutrophil i e lobe index above

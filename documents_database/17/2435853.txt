alternatively simulation of such a network will also produce a solution to the minimum s t cut problem this article gives basic definitions a statement of the theorem and a proof of the theorem the presentation in this article closely follows the presentation of the theorem in the original publication definitions in this article are consistent in all respects with those given in a discussion of the maximum flow minimum cut theorem cederbaum s theorem applies to a particular type of directed graph v is the set of nodes formula 1 is the a set of directed edges formula 2 a positive weight is associated with each edge two of the nodes must be s and t formula 3 and formula 4 flow is a positive quantity associated with each edge in the graph flow is constrained by the weight of the associated edge and by the conservation of flow at each vertex as described here current is defined as a map for each edge pair to the real numbers current maps from the voltage to a range that is determined by the weights of the respective forward and reverse edges each edge pair is the tuple consisting of the

the first laser pulses were produced in may 2017 and the facility started user operation in september 2017 the international project with twelve participating countries nine shareholders at the time of commissioning denmark france germany hungary poland russia slovakia sweden and switzerland later joined by three other partners italy spain and the united kingdom is located in the german federal states of hamburg and schleswig holstein a free electron laser generates high intensity electromagnetic radiation by accelerating electrons to relativistic speeds and directing them through special magnetic structures the european xfel is constructed such that the electrons produce x ray light in synchronisation resulting in high intensity x ray pulses with the properties of laser light and at intensities much brighter than those produced by conventional synchrotron light sources the long tunnel for the european xfel housing the superconducting linear accelerator and photon beamlines runs underground from the site of the desy research center in hamburg to the town of schenefeld in schleswig holstein where the experimental stations laboratories and administrative buildings are located electrons are accelerated to an energy of up to 17 5 gev by a long linear accelerator with superconducting rf cavities the use of superconducting acceleration

it is a piecewise defined function each of whose pieces is an affine function usually but not always the function is assumed to be continuous in that case its graph is a polygonal curve the function defined by is piecewise linear with four pieces the graph of this function is shown to the right since the graph of a linear function is a line the graph of a piecewise linear function consists of line segments and rays the x values in the above example 3 0 and 3 where the slope changes are typically called breakpoints changepoints threshold values or knots other examples of piecewise linear functions include the absolute value function the square wave the sawtooth function and the floor function an approximation to a known curve can be found by sampling the curve and interpolating linearly between the points an algorithm for computing the most significant points subject to a given error tolerance has been published if partitions and then breakpoints are already known linear regression can be performed independently on these partitions however continuity is not preserved in that case and also there is no unique reference model underlying the observed data a stable algorithm with this

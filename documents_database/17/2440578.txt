according to his account the term flat for example is an absolute term because a surface is either perfectly or absolutely flat or isn t flat at all the terms bumpy or curved on the other hand are relative terms because there is no such thing as absolute bumpiness or absolute curvedness a bumpy surface can always be made bumpier a truly flat surface however can never be made flatter colloquially he acknowledges we do say things like surface a is flatter than surface b but this is just a shorter way of saying surface a is closer to being flat than surface b this paraphrasing however doesn t work for relative terms another important aspect of absolute terms one that motivated this choice of terminology is that they can always be modified by the term absolutely for example it is quite natural to say this surface is absolutely flat but it would be very strange and barely even meaningful to say this surface is absolutely bumpy once the distinction is made it becomes apparent that the application of absolute terms to describe the real world objects is doubtful absolute terms describe properties that are ideal in a platonic sense

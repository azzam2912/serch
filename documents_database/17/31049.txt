a plane is the two dimensional analogue of a point zero dimensions a line one dimension and three dimensional space planes can arise as subspaces of some higher dimensional space as with a room s walls extended infinitely far or they may enjoy an independent existence in their own right as in the setting of euclidean geometry when working exclusively in two dimensional euclidean space the definite article is used so the plane refers to the whole space many fundamental tasks in mathematics geometry trigonometry graph theory and graphing are performed in a two dimensional space or in other words in the plane euclid set forth the first great landmark of mathematical thought an axiomatic treatment of geometry he selected a small core of undefined terms called common notions and postulates or axioms which he then used to prove various geometrical statements although the plane in its modern sense is not directly given a definition anywhere in the elements it may be thought of as part of the common notions euclid never used numbers to measure length angle or area in this way the euclidean plane is not quite the same as the cartesian plane a plane is a ruled

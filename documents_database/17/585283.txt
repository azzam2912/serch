the simplest is as equal floorspace for male and female washrooms since men s and boys bathrooms include urinals which take up less space than stalls this still results in more facilities for males an alternative parity is by number of fixtures within washrooms however since females on average spend more time in washrooms more males are able to use more facilities per unit time more recent parity regulations therefore require more fixtures for females to ensure that the average time spent waiting to use the toilet is the same for females as for males or to equalise throughputs of male and female toilets women and girls often spend more time in washrooms than men and boys for both physiological and cultural reasons the requirement to use a cubicle rather than a urinal means urination takes longer and hand washing must be done more thoroughly females also make more visits to washrooms urinary tract infections and incontinence are more common in females pregnancy menstruation breastfeeding and diaper changing increase usage the elderly who are disproportionately female take longer and more frequent bathroom visits a variety of female urinals and personal funnels have been invented to make it easier for females

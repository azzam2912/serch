the underlying phenomenon is a consequence of the strong tendency of a magnetic field to enhance binding of oppositely charged particles into bound states the catalyzing effect comes from a partial restriction dimensional reduction of the motion of charged particles in the directions perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field commonly the magnetic catalysis is specifically associated with spontaneous breaking of flavor or chiral symmetry in quantum field theory which is enhanced or triggered by the presence of an external magnetic field the underlying mechanism behind magnetic catalysis is the dimensional reduction of low energy charged spin 1 2 particles as a result of such a reduction there exists a strong enhancement of the particle antiparticle pairing responsible for symmetry breaking for gauge theories in 3 1 space time dimensions such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics the dimensional reduction leads to an effective 1 1 dimensional low energy dynamics here the dimensionality of space time is written as d 1 for d spatial directions in simple terms the dimensional reduction reflects the fact that the motion of charged particles is partially restricted in the two space like directions perpendicular to the magnetic field however this orbital motion constraint

the general first order linear only with respect to the term involving derivative integro differential equation is of the form as is typical with differential equations obtaining a closed form solution can often be difficult in the relatively few cases where a solution can be found it is often by some kind of integral transform where the problem is first transformed into an algebraic setting in such situations the solution of the problem may be derived by applying the inverse transform to the solution of this algebraic equation consider the following first order problem where is the heaviside step function the laplace transform is defined by upon taking term by term laplace transforms and utilising the rules for derivatives and integrals the integro differential equation is converted into the following algebraic equation thus inverting the laplace transform using contour integral methods then gives alternatively one can complete the square and use a table of laplace transforms exponentially decaying sine wave or recall from memory to proceed integro differential equations model many situations from science and engineering such as in circuit analysis by kirchhoff s second law the net voltage drop across a closed loop equals the voltage impressed formula 9

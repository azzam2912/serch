these are part of a family of related braille alphabets known as bharati braille there are apparently some differences between the nepali braille alphabet of india and that of nepal although basically alphabetic devanagari braille retains one aspect of indian abugidas in that the default vowel a is not written unless it occurs at the beginning of a word or before a vowel for example braille the consonant k renders print ka and braille th print tha to indicate that a consonant is not followed by a vowel as when followed by another consonant or at the end of a syllable a halant vowel cancelling prefix is used k is k and th is th when writing in hindi the halant is generally omitted at the end of a word following the convention in print however unlike in an abugida there are no vowel diacritics in devanagari braille vowels are written with full letters following the consonant regardless of their order in print for example in print the vowel i is prefixed to a consonant in a reduced diacritic form ki but in braille it follows in its full form k i equivalent to writing for ki in print thus

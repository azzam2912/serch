it is a very long sloping subduction zone where the explorer juan de fuca and gorda plates move to the east and slide below the much larger mostly continental north american plate the zone varies in width and lies offshore beginning near cape mendocino northern california passing through oregon and washington and terminating at about vancouver island in british columbia the explorer juan de fuca and gorda plates are some of the remnants of the vast ancient farallon plate which is now mostly subducted under the north american plate the north american plate itself is moving slowly in a generally southwest direction sliding over the smaller plates as well as the huge oceanic pacific plate which is moving in a northwest direction in other locations such as the san andreas fault in central and southern california tectonic processes active in the cascadia subduction zone region include accretion subduction deep earthquakes and active volcanism of the cascades this volcanism has included such notable eruptions as mount mazama crater lake about 7 500 years ago the mount meager massif bridge river vent about 2 350 years ago and mount st helens in 1980 major cities affected by a disturbance in this subduction

different specific values or ratings of the components are regarded as being the same topology topology is not concerned with the physical layout of components in a circuit nor with their positions on a circuit diagram similarly to the mathematic concept of topology it is only concerned with what connections exist between the components there may be numerous physical layouts and circuit diagrams that all amount to the same topology strictly speaking replacing a component with one of an entirely different type is still the same topology in some contexts however these can loosely be described as different topologies for instance interchanging inductors and capacitors in a low pass filter results in a high pass filter these might be described as high pass and low pass topologies even though the network topology is identical a more correct term for these classes of object that is a network where the type of component is specified but not the absolute value is prototype network electronic network topology is related to mathematical topology in particular for networks which contain only two terminal devices circuit topology can be viewed as an application of graph theory in a network analysis of such a circuit from

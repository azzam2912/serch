it is the lithium salt of nitric acid an alkali metal nitrate the salt is deliquescent absorbing water to form the hydrated form lithium nitrate trihydrate its eutectics are of interest for heat transfer fluids it is made by treating lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide with nitric acid this deliquescent colourless salt is an oxidizing agent used in the manufacture of red colored fireworks and flares the hydrated form lithium nitrate trihydrate has an extremely high specific heat of fusion 287 7 j g and hence can be used for thermal energy storage at its melt temperature of 303 3 k lithium nitrate has been proposed as a medium to store heat collected from the sun for cooking a fresnel lens would be used to melt solid lithium nitrate which would then function as a solar battery allowing heat to be redistributed later by convection lithium nitrate can be synthesized by reacting nitric acid and lithium carbonate generally when forming lino a ph indicator is used to determine when all of the acid has been neutralized however this neutralization can also be recognized with the loss of carbon dioxide production in order to rid the final product of excess water

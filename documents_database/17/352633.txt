it is named after guy macdonald morton who first applied the order to file sequencing in 1966 the z value of a point in multidimensions is simply calculated by interleaving the binary representations of its coordinate values once the data are sorted into this ordering any one dimensional data structure can be used such as binary search trees b trees skip lists or with low significant bits truncated hash tables the resulting ordering can equivalently be described as the order one would get from a depth first traversal of a quadtree the figure below shows the z values for the two dimensional case with integer coordinates 0 x 7 0 y 7 shown both in decimal and binary interleaving the binary coordinate values yields binary z values as shown connecting the z values in their numerical order produces the recursively z shaped curve two dimensional z values are also called as quadkey ones the z values of x s are described as binary numbers from the moser de bruijn sequence having nonzero bits only in their even positions the sum and difference of two x s are calculated by using bitwise operations this property can be used to offset a

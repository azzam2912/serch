ocean current and tidal are the less challenging sources of ocean kinetic energy ocean waves may be characterized as what is described in oceanography literature chaotic waves waves come from various directions representing a range of wave heights and wavelengths additionally the amount of energy in waves rises exponentially as we move upwards through the circular motions of water particles towards the crest of waves this creates a challenging environment both in terms of withstanding the raw forces of nature but also in terms of reliably converting and utilizing the available energy there has been a handful of commercial projects exploring technologies to utilize renewable ocean energy such as wave tidal and ocean current power e g sotenas wave farm in sweden ada foah wave farm in ghana some solutions may choose to focus the design around conversion of a single source of energy e g wave power while tricuspidal turbines have the ability to convert energy from more than one source tricuspidal turbines simultaneously convert three types of ocean kinetic energy wave tidal and current maximizing output under the shifting conditions of water movement and available energy content in currents tide and ocean waves thus floating power plants based

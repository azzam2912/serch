the player wins if two of their numbers on a given ticket are among the random ones the problem of how many tickets the player must buy in order to be certain of winning can be solved by the use of the fano plane the solution is to buy a total of 14 tickets in two sets of seven one set of seven is every line of a fano plane with the numbers 1 7 the other with 8 14 i e 1 2 5 1 3 6 1 4 7 2 3 7 2 4 6 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 12 8 10 13 8 11 14 9 10 14 9 11 13 10 11 12 12 13 14 because at least two of the winning numbers must be either high 8 14 or low 1 7 and every high and low pair is represented by exactly one ticket you would be guaranteed at least two correct numbers on one ticket with these 14 purchases 21 26 of the time you will have one ticket with two numbers matched if all three winning numbers are either high or low you would either have one ticket

research by r f johnson in 2011 has shown that cadlina does not belong to the family chromodorididae she has therefore brought back the name cadlinidae from synonymy with chromodorididae the chromodorid nudibranchs without cadlina are now monophyletic and turn out to be a possible sister to the actinocyclidae the next families are considered synonyms but these names can still be found in many publications and on the internet cryptobranch dorid nudibranchs previously known as the taxon cryptobranchia are nudibranch sea slugs within the clade doridacea these slugs are called cryptobranch meaning hidden gill because they are able to retract their gills into a gill pocket in contrast to nudibranchs in the traditional group phanerobranchs or phanerobranchia which taxon is probably paraphyletic in other words composed of more than one evolutionary lineage a vald s distinguishes two major clades within the cryptobranchia the dorids that have no radula the porostomata and those with a radula the labiostomata the labiostomata include the monophyletic families actinocyclidae chromodorididae dorididae and discodorididae the cryptobranchs include the following genera that are regarded as valid

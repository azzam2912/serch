it is the conjunction of all the unique literals of the terms excluding the literal that appears unnegated in one term and negated in the other if formula 5 includes a term which is negated in formula 6 or vice versa the consensus term formula 4 is false in other words there is no consensus term the conjunctive dual of this equation is the consensus or consensus term of two conjunctive terms of a disjunction is defined when one term contains the literal formula 10 and the other the literal formula 11 an opposition the consensus is the conjunction of the two terms omitting both formula 10 and formula 11 and repeated literals for example the consensus of formula 14 and formula 15 is formula 16 the consensus is undefined if there is more than one opposition for the conjunctive dual of the rule the consensus formula 17 can be derived from formula 18 and formula 19 through the resolution inference rule this shows that the lhs is derivable from the rhs if a b then a ab replacing a with rhs and b with y z the rhs can be derived from the lhs simply through the conjunction elimination

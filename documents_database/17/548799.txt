people normally have two copies of this chromosome chromosome 5 spans about 181 million base pairs the building blocks of dna and represents almost 6 of the total dna in cells chromosome 5 is the 5th largest human chromosome yet has one of the lowest gene densities this is partially explained by numerous gene poor regions that display a remarkable degree of non coding and syntenic conservation with non mammalian vertebrates suggesting they are functionally constrained because chromosome 5 is responsible for many forms of growth and development cell divisions changes may cause cancers one example would be acute myeloid leukemia aml the following are some of the gene count estimates of human chromosome 5 because researchers use different approaches to genome annotation their predictions of the number of genes on each chromosome varies for technical details see gene prediction among various projects the collaborative consensus coding sequence project ccds takes an extremely conservative strategy so ccds s gene number prediction represents a lower bound on the total number of human protein coding genes the following is a partial list of genes on human chromosome 5 for complete list see the link in the infobox on the right the following

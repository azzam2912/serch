caldicot is a small town in monmouthshire south wales it is located between chepstow and the city of newport on the gloucester line the line to bristol via the severn tunnel runs just to the north but there are no platforms here however severn tunnel junction station is within walking distance for those wanting to travel to bristol the railway line through caldicot was built as the broad gauge south wales railway in 1850 although the nearest station was at portskewett two miles to the east in 1861 a private siding was opened to serve the caldicot iron wire works from 1880 the severn tinplate works on what is now the industrial estate on the sudbrook road south of the castle in typical broad gauge fashion these works lines used two short hand worked turntables to move wagons between the lines rather than points in 1872 the south wales railway was re gauged from broad gauge to standard gauge by 1875 the wire works was also served by a level crossing and a crossover between the two running lines controlled by a signal box it is likely that this relaying was carried out earlier as part of the re gauging

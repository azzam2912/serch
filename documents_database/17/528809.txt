for example the lava fields of eldgj in iceland where laki and katla fissures erupted in the year 935 and the solidified lava has over time begun to form a lithosere pioneer species are the first organisms that colonise an area of which lithoseres are an example they will typically be very hardy i e they will be xerophytes wind resistant or cold resistant in the case of a lithosere the pioneer species will be cyanobacteria and algae which create their own food and water i e they are autotrophic and so do not require any external nutrition except sunlight for example the first lithosere observed after the volcanic explosion of krakatoa was algae other examples of lithoseres include communities of mosses and lichens as they are extremely resilient and are capable of surviving in areas without soil as more mosses and lichens colonize the area they along with natural elements such as wind and frost shattering begin to weather the rock down this over time creates more soil leading to increased water retention early on when there is little water lichens dominate as they are more suited to a lack of water but as water retention increases mosses become

in 1841 delaunay proved that the only surfaces of revolution with constant mean curvature were the surfaces obtained by rotating the roulettes of the conics these are the plane cylinder sphere the catenoid the unduloid and nodoid let formula 1 represent the normal jacobi sine function and formula 2 be the normal jacobi elliptic function and let formula 3 represent the normal elliptic integral of the first kind and formula 4 represent the normal elliptic integral of the second kind let a be the length of the ellipse s major axis and e be the eccentricity of the ellipse let k be a fixed value between 0 and 1 called the modulus given these variables the formula for the surface of revolution that is the unduloid is then one interesting property of the unduloid is that the mean curvature is constant in fact the mean curvature across the entire surface is always the reciprocal of twice the major axis length 1 2 a also geodesics on an unduloid obey the clairaut relation and their behavior is therefore predictable

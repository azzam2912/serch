by constantly monitoring phosphate nucleotide levels inside the cell adk plays an important role in cellular energy homeostasis the reaction catalyzed is atp amp 2 adp the equilibrium constant varies with condition but it is close to 1 thus g for this reaction is close to zero in muscle from a variety of species of vertebrates and invertebrates the concentration of atp is typically 7 10 times that of adp and usually greater than 100 times that of amp the rate of oxidative phosphorylation is controlled by the availability of adp thus the mitochondrion attempts to keep atp levels high due to the combined action of adenylate kinase and the controls on oxidative phosphorylation to date there have been nine human adk protein isoforms identified while some of these are ubiquitous throughout the body some are localized into specific tissues for example adk7 and adk8 are both only found in the cytosol of cells and adk7 is found in skeletal muscle whereas adk8 is not not only do the locations of the various isoforms within the cell vary but the binding of substrate to the enzyme and kinetics of the phosphoryl transfer are different as well adk1 the most abundant

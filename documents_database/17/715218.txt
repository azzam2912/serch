for dairy cows for example the output is milk whereas in animals raised for meat such as beef cows pigs chickens and fish the output is the flesh that is the body mass gained by the animal represented either in the final mass of the animal or the mass of the dressed output fcr is the mass of the input divided by the output thus mass of feed per mass of milk or meat in some sectors feed efficiency which is the output divided by the input i e the inverse of fcr is used these concepts are also closely related to efficiency of conversion of ingested foods eci feed conversion ratio fcr is the ratio of inputs to outputs it is the inverse of feed efficiency which is the ratio of outputs to inputs fcr is widely used in hog and poultry production while fe is used more commonly with cattle being a ratio the fcr is dimensionless that is it is not affected by the units of measurement used to determine the fcr fcr a function of the animal s genetics and age the quality and ingredients of the feed and the conditions in which the animal is

the game is part of the scienceathome umbrella project developed by au ideas center for community driven research coder coder aims to merge theoretical and experimental quantum research with online community efforts to explore the potential for online citizen science in this otherwise highly specialized field the objective of the game is to complete challenges that are simulations of logical operations in a quantum computer the team behind the game are building a scalable quantum computer with a processor consisting of 300 atoms logical operations are performed by moving the atoms with optical tweezers moving atoms in a controlled way is a difficult task because the atom becomes excited and the atomic wave function delocalises approaching the presumed quantum speed limit is a huge challenge for quantum algorithms and the task that quantum moves players are asked to tackle in quantum moves the atomic wave function is represented as a sloshy liquid in an energy potential well created by the optical tweezers players control the depth and the horizontal location of the well simulating the path on the optical tweezers the wave function reacts to changes in the potential function as dictated by the schr dinger equation leading to sloshing

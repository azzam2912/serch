it is the parent compound of the carbynes which can be seen as obtained from it by substitution of other functional groups for the hydrogen the carbon atom is left with either one or three unpaired electrons unsatisfied valence bonds depending on the molecule s excitation state making it a radical accordingly the chemical formula can be ch or ch also written as ch each dot representing an unpaired electron the corresponding systematic names are methylylidene or hydridocarbon and methanetriyl or hydridocarbon 3 however the formula is often written simply as ch methylidyne is a highly reactive gas that is quickly destroyed in ordinary conditions but is abundant in the interstellar medium and was one of the first molecules to be detected there the trivial name carbyne is the preferred iupac name following the substitutive nomenclature the molecule is viewed as methane with three hydrogen atoms removed yielding the systematic name methylidyne following the additive nomenclature the molecule is viewed as a hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom yielding the name hydridocarbon by default these names pay no regard to the excitation state of the molecule when that attribute is considered the states with one unpaired electron are named

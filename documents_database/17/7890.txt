it is an application of the general truth that if a statement is true then so is its contrapositive the inference rule modus tollens asserts that the inference from p implies q to the negation of q implies the negation of p is valid the modus tollens rule can be stated formally as where formula 2 stands for the statement p implies q formula 3 stands for it is not the case that q or in brief not q then whenever formula 2 and formula 5 each appear by themselves as a line of a proof then formula 6 can validly be placed on a subsequent line the history of the inference rule modus tollens goes back to antiquity modus tollens is closely related to modus ponens there are two similar but invalid forms of argument affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent see also contraposition and proof by contrapositive the first to explicitly describe the argument form modus tollens was theophrastus the modus tollens rule may be written in sequent notation where formula 8 is a metalogical symbol meaning that formula 6 is a syntactic consequence of formula 2 and formula 5 in some logical system or as the

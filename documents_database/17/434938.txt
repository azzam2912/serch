it was formerly classified in the family monotropaceae but is now included within the ericaceae it is of ephemeral occurrence depending on the right conditions moisture after a dry period to appear full grown within a couple of days unlike most plants it is white and does not contain chlorophyll instead of generating energy from sunlight it is parasitic more specifically a mycoheterotroph its hosts are certain fungi that are mycorrhizal with trees meaning it ultimately gets its energy from photosynthetic trees since it is not dependent on sunlight to grow it can grow in very dark environments as in the understory of dense forest it is often associated with beech trees the complex relationship that allows this plant to grow also makes propagation difficult the plant is sometimes completely waxy white but often has black flecks or pale pink coloration rare variants may have a deep red color the stems reach heights of sheathed with highly reduced leaves long best identified as scales or bracts these structures are small thin and translucent they do not have petioles but instead extend in a sheath like manner out of the stem as its scientific name suggests and unlike the related monotropa

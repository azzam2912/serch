the most common wdm candidates are sterile neutrinos and gravitinos the wimps weakly interacting massive particles when produced non thermally could be candidates for warm dark matter in general however the thermally produced wimps are cold dark matter candidates one possible wdm candidate particle with a mass of a few kev comes from introducing two new zero charge zero lepton number fermions to the standard model of particle physics kev mass inert fermions kevins and gev mass inert fermions gevins kevins are overproduced if they reach thermal equilibrium in the early universe but in some scenarios the entropy production from the decays of unstable heavier particles can suppresses their abundance to the correct value these particles are considered inert because they only have suppressed interactions with the z boson sterile neutrinos with masses of a few kev are possible candidates for kevins at temperatures below the electroweak scale their only interactions with standard model particles are weak interactions due to their mixing with ordinary neutrinos due to the smallness of the mixing angle they are not overproduced because they freeze out before reaching thermal equilibrium their properties are consistent with astrophysical bounds coming from structure formation and the pauli principle

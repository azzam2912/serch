an inviscid fluid is a theoretical fluid having zero viscosity the primary flow of a fluid particularly in the majority of the flow field remote from solid surfaces immersed in the fluid is usually very similar to what would be predicted using the basic principles of physics and assuming the fluid is inviscid however in real flow situations there are regions in the flow field where the flow is significantly different in both speed and direction to what is predicted for an inviscid fluid using simple analytical techniques the flow in these regions is the secondary flow these regions are usually in the vicinity of the boundary of the fluid adjacent to solid surfaces where viscous forces are at work such as in the boundary layer the basic principles of physics and the coriolis effect satisfactorily explain that the direction of the wind in the atmosphere is parallel to the isobars measurements of wind speed and direction at heights well above ground level confirm that the speed of the wind matches that predicted by considerations of gradient flow and the direction of the wind is indeed parallel to the isobars in the region however from ground level up to heights

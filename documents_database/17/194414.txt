while all modern dictyoptera have short ovipositors the oldest fossils of dictyoptera have long ovipositors much like members of the orthoptera the use of the term dictyoptera has changed over the years and while largely out of use for much of the last century it is becoming more widely used it has usually been considered a superorder with isoptera blattodea and mantodea being its three orders in some classifications however dictyoptera is shifted to order status and in others the class isoptera has been subsumed under blattodea while retaining dictyoptera as a superorder regardless in all classifications the constituent groups are the same just treated at different rank termites and cockroaches are very closely related with ecological and molecular data pointing to a relationship with the cockroach genus cryptocercus based on genetic evidence the closest living relatives of the dictyoptera are the phasmids and the enigmatic groups mantophasmatodea and grylloblattodea if the dictyoptera are considered a superorder these three orders might be included in it evolutionary relationships based on eggleton beccaloni inward 2007 are shown in the cladogram the cockroach families lamproblattidae and tryonicidae are not shown but are placed within the superfamily blattoidea the cockroach families corydiidae and ectobiidae

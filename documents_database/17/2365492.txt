then is called a filtration if formula 11 for all formula 12 so filtrations are families of algebras that are ordered non decreasingly if formula 13 is a filtration then formula 14 is called a filtered probability space let formula 15 be a stochastic process on the probability space formula 16 then is a algebra and formula 18 is a filtration here formula 19 denotes the algebra generated by the random variables formula 20 formula 13 really is a filtration since by definition all formula 22 are algebras and if formula 24 is a filtration then the corresponding right continuous filtration is defined as with the filtration formula 13 itself is called right continuous iff formula 28 let be the set of all sets that are contained within a formula 30 null set a filtration formula 24 is called a complete filtration if every formula 8 contains formula 33 this is equivalent to formula 34 being a complete measure space for every formula 35 a filtration is called an augmented filtration if it is complete and right continuous for every filtration formula 13 there exists a smallest augmented filtration formula 37 of formula 13 if a filtration is an augmented

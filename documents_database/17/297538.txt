desmin is a muscle specific type iii intermediate filament that integrates the sarcolemma z disk and nuclear membrane in sarcomeres and regulates sarcomere architecture desmin is a 53 5 kd protein composed of 470 amino acids there are three major domains to the desmin protein a conserved alpha helix rod a variable non alpha helix head and a carboxy terminal tail desmin as all intermediate filaments shows no polarity when assembled the rod domain consists of 308 amino acids with parallel alpha helical coiled coil dimers and three linkers to disrupt it the rod domain connects to the head domain the head domain 84 amino acids with many arginine serine and aromatic residues is important in filament assembly and dimer dimer interactions the tail domain is responsible for the integration of filaments and interaction with proteins and organelles desmin is only expressed in vertebrates however homologous proteins are found in many organisms desmin is a subunit of intermediate filaments in cardiac muscle skeletal muscle and smooth muscle tissue in cardiac muscle desmin is present in z discs and intercalated discs desmin has been shown to interact with desmoplakin and b crystallin desmin was first described in 1976 first purified in

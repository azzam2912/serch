most of tasmania s rainforests occur in the north west and throughout the north east highlands cool temperate rainforests typically have a heavy rainfall cool climate favor high altitudes and have a limited availability of light the diversity of vascular plants in cool temperate rainforests is unquestionably lower than in tropical rainforests as a result of the cooler climates and other various factors that reduce the growth rate of plants such as the availability of light many of the species that are present in tasmania s cool temperate rainforests are endemic this has been attributed to the isolation of tasmania from the mainland during interglacial periods which restricted the dispersal of many species between the two land masses this high level of endemism results in tasmania s cool temperate rainforests being characterized by a community of rainforest species unique to the state portions of the species that have managed to dominate these unique forests are ferns there is a diverse range of ferns present within these forests which vary in form size substrate preference and habit the following describes some of the major fern species to grow in tasmania s cool temperate rainforests commonly known as batswing fern its abundant

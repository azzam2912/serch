it can result from physical trauma or from hemorrhaging in stroke 30 of intraventricular hemorrhage ivh are primary confined to the ventricular system and typically caused by intraventricular trauma aneurysm vascular malformations or tumors particularly of the choroid plexus however 70 of ivh are secondary in nature resulting from an expansion of an existing intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage intraventricular hemorrhage has been found to occur in 35 of moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries thus the hemorrhage usually does not occur without extensive associated damage and so the outcome is rarely good symptoms of ivh are similar to other intracerebral hemorrhages and include sudden onset of headache nausea and vomiting together with an alteration of the mental state and or level of consciousness focal neurological signs are either minimal or absent but focal and or generalized seizures may occur xanthochromia yellow tinged csf is the rule diagnosis can be confirmed by the presence of blood inside the ventricles on ct brain contusions and subarachnoid hemorrhages are commonly associated with ivh the bleeding can involve the anterior communicating artery or the posterior communicating artery in both adults and infants ivh can cause dangerous increases in icp damage to the brain tissue

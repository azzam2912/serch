it is one among the three negative regulatory elements found in plasmids which control its copy number the others include antisense rnas and ctrnas iterons complex with cognate replication rep initiator proteins to achieve the required regulatory effect iterons have an important role in plasmid replication an iteron containing plasmid origin of replication can be found containing about five iterons about 20 base pairs in length total these iterons provide a saturation site for initiator receptor proteins and promote replication thus increasing plasmid copy number in a given cell there are 4 main limiting factors leading to no initiation of replication in iterons transcriptional auto repression is thought to reduce initiator synthesis by repressing the formation of the rep proteins since these proteins work to promote binding of replication machinery replication can be halted in this form another factor used to stop replication is known as dimerization it works to dimerize these rep proteins and as a result monomers of these proteins are no longer in a high enough concentration to initiate replication another limiting factor titration occurs after replication and works to prevent saturation by distributing monomers to daughter origins so that no are fully saturated finally handcuffing refers

the mca is the most common site for the occurrence of ischemic stroke depending upon the location and severity of the occlusion signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with mca syndrome more distal blockages tend to produce milder deficits due to more extensive branching of the artery and less ischemic response in contrast the most proximal occlusions result in widespread effects that can lead to significant cerebral edema increased intracranial pressure loss of consciousness and could even be fatal in such occasions mannitol osmotic diuretic or hypertonic saline are given to draw fluid out of the edematous cerebrum to minimise secondary injury hypertonic saline is better than mannitol as mannitol being a diuretic will decrease the mean arterial pressure and since cerebral perfusion is mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure mannitol will also cause a decrease in cerebral perfusion contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss of the face upper and lower extremities is the most common presentation of mca syndrome lower extremity function is more spared than that of the faciobrachial region the majority of the primary motor and somatosensory cortices are supplied by the mca and the cortical homunculus can therefore be used to localize the defects

in some contexts the term has been restricted to salts whose melting point is below some arbitrary temperature such as while ordinary liquids such as water and gasoline are predominantly made of electrically neutral molecules ionic liquids are largely made of ions and short lived ion pairs these substances are variously called liquid electrolytes ionic melts ionic fluids fused salts liquid salts or ionic glasses ionic liquids are described as having many potential applications they are powerful solvents and electrically conducting fluids electrolytes salts that are liquid at near ambient temperature are important for electric battery applications and have been considered as sealants due to their very low vapor pressure any salt that melts without decomposing or vaporizing usually yields an ionic liquid sodium chloride nacl for example melts at into a liquid that consists largely of sodium cations and chloride anions conversely when an ionic liquid is cooled it often forms an ionic solid which may be either crystalline or glassy the ionic bond is usually stronger than the van der waals forces between the molecules of ordinary liquids for that reason common salts tend to melt at higher temperatures than other solid molecules some salts are liquid at

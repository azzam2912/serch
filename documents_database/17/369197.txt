dlc is usually applied as coatings to other materials that could benefit from some of those properties dlc exists in seven different forms all seven contain significant amounts of sp hybridized carbon atoms the reason that there are different types is that even diamond can be found in two crystalline polytypes the more common one has its carbon atoms arranged in a cubic lattice while the less common one lonsdaleite has a hexagonal lattice by mixing these polytypes in various ways at the nanoscale level of structure dlc coatings can be made that at the same time are amorphous flexible and yet purely sp bonded diamond the hardest strongest and slickest is such a mixture known as tetrahedral amorphous carbon ta c for example a coating of only 2 m thickness of ta c increases the resistance of common e g type 304 stainless steel against abrasive wear changing its lifetime in such service from one week to 85 years such ta c can be considered to be the pure form of dlc since it consists only of sp bonded carbon atoms fillers such as hydrogen graphitic sp carbon and metals are used in the other 6 forms to reduce

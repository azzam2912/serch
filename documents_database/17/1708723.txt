these baskets were made by weaving together reeds or twigs they were typically used by women to store skeins of wool but they had other uses in the household in roman times there are reports for baskets of these sorts to be used in agricultural activities like bringing in the fruits from the fields the word was also used to describe ceramic vases designed in the shape of the calathus basket which is the usual application in archaeology since vases have survived while baskets have not the calathus usually had a narrow base and a flared top the decoration on some of the ceramic calathi is taken to imitate the woven texture of a basket this can be achieved by a painted design but many calathi have open work cut into their sides and some have impressed decoration calathi may occur with or without handles in both the greek and roman worlds these baskets had many uses but were especially associated with wool working and the harvest the calathus is principally a multifunctional basket literary sources report that depending on the context the calathus could contain wool but also food bread cheese milk fruits and vegetables small animals or flowers

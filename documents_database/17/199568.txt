the character carries the essential information about the representation in a more condensed form georg frobenius initially developed representation theory of finite groups entirely based on the characters and without any explicit matrix realization of representations themselves this is possible because a complex representation of a finite group is determined up to isomorphism by its character the situation with representations over a field of positive characteristic so called modular representations is more delicate but richard brauer developed a powerful theory of characters in this case as well many deep theorems on the structure of finite groups use characters of modular representations characters of irreducible representations encode many important properties of a group and can thus be used to study its structure character theory is an essential tool in the classification of finite simple groups close to half of the proof of the feit thompson theorem involves intricate calculations with character values easier but still essential results that use character theory include burnside s theorem a purely group theoretic proof of burnside s theorem has since been found but that proof came over half a century after burnside s original proof and a theorem of richard brauer and michio suzuki stating

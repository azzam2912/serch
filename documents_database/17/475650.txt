based upon an annual parallax shift of 3 56 mas as seen from earth it is located approximately 920 light years from the sun the primary component has an apparent visual magnitude of 4 22 and is radiating about 1 270 times the luminosity of the sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 4 622 k this yellow hued star is a g type bright giant with a stellar classification of g4 iia this is a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 2 3 years and eccentricity around 0 35 the secondary is about 3 3 magnitudes dimmer than the primary and estimated as type b9 based on the flux of far ultraviolet radiation the secondary was directly detected with a magnitude difference of 3 6 at a separation of about 17 milli arcseconds using observations from the navy precision optical interferometer this detection was significant as observations with the hubble space telescope which indicated a companion star was present were not definitive with an orbit and a parallax the sum of the masses of the two stars can be determined via a dynamical parallax this eventually can yield a precise mass for the evolved giant

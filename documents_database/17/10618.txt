it was the first probe to encounter saturn and the second to fly through the asteroid belt and by jupiter thereafter pioneer 11 became the second of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the solar system due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe the last routine contact with the spacecraft was on september 30 1995 and the last good engineering data was received on november 24 1995 approved in february 1969 pioneer 11 and its twin probe pioneer 10 were the first to be designed for exploring the outer solar system yielding to multiple proposals throughout the 1960s early mission objectives were defined as subsequent planning for an encounter with saturn added many more goals pioneer 11 was built by trw and managed as part of the pioneer program by nasa ames research center a backup unit pioneer h is currently on display in the milestones of flight exhibit at the national air and space museum in washington d c many elements of the mission proved to be critical in the planning of the voyager program the pioneer 11 bus measures deep and with six panels forming the

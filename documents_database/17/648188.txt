it has a built in cds exposure meter with a circular window on the right hand camera front the canon fp without exposure meter was added later the same year the cameras were well built but the metering technology was several years behind the minolta sr 7 which pioneered that technology in 1962 then just half a year later in the spring of 1965 canon surprised the camera community with the remarkable pellix the new camera featured the much expected ttl exposure metering facility albeit employing the stop down metering method however what makes the pellix special is that the ttl metering is accomplished using a stationary semitransparent pellicle reflex mirror instead of the traditional moving slr mirror and placing a cds meter cell behind it for the ttl exposure measurement the cell attached to an arm is swung up in front of the film gate using the stop down lever on the right hand camera front reading the light projected from the camera lens after passing through the semitransparent mirror very few alternative locations inside the camera were available for picking up light rays from the camera lens the topcon re super has its meter cell placed directly behind

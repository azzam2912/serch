in each case a mathematical function called the lagrangian is a function of the generalized coordinates their time derivatives and time and contains the information about the dynamics of the system no new physics are necessarily introduced in applying lagrangian mechanics compared to newtonian mechanics it is however more mathematically sophisticated and systematic newton s laws can include non conservative forces like friction however they must include constraint forces explicitly and are best suited to cartesian coordinates lagrangian mechanics is ideal for systems with conservative forces and for bypassing constraint forces in any coordinate system dissipative and driven forces can be accounted for by splitting the external forces into a sum of potential and non potential forces leading to a set of modified euler lagrange el equations generalized coordinates can be chosen for convenience to exploit symmetries in the system or the geometry of the constraints which may simplify solving for the motion of the system lagrangian mechanics also reveals conserved quantities and their symmetries in a direct way as a special case of noether s theorem lagrangian mechanics is important not just for its broad applications but also for its role in advancing deep understanding of physics although lagrange

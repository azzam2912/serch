most commonly used for ar ff operations and in industrial areas with high class b hazards the dry chemical usually purple k and in some applications abc dry chemical knocks down the fire rapidly while the foam secures the hazard by laying a vapor suppressing blanket on the fuel and helping to cool the fuel in skin fires in pressurized gas fires the foam is applied to extinguish the fuel fires around the blowout and cool heated metal the purple k stream is then discharged into the blowout to snuff it out these systems can be mounted on vehicles skid mounts or permanent stations application is from twin hose lines connected together at the nozzle one flows the dry chemical agent and the other foam twin agent systems are also used in fixed nozzles off vehicles i e ar ff vehicles or ground mounted monitors in high hazard locations in facilities storing or producing flammable liquids see airport crash tender dry chemical tank capacities range from afff solution capacity ranges from dry chemical flow rates vary from per second and per minute for the foam for handline application

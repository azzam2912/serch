the main difference centres on the quranic term khatam an nabiyyin arabic lit seal of prophets with reference to muhammad which is understood by ahmadis in terms of perfection and testification of prophethood instead of chronological finality as understood within mainstream islam accordingly muhammad is held to be the last prophet to deliver a religious law to humanity in the form of the quran whose teachings embody a perfected and universal message although in principle prophets can appear within islam their prophethood is dependent upon and reflective of that of muhammad that is within his seal and their role is merely that of reviving and purifying the faith they cannot be prophets in their own right and cannot change add to or subtract from the religious law of islam as such ahmadis regard their founder mirza ghulam ahmad as a prophet who appeared as the promised messiah and mahdi in accordance with islam s eschatological prophecies in contrast to mainstream muslims who believe jesus to be still alive and one who would return himself towards the end of time ahmadis believe jesus to have died a natural death and view the coming of such an independent israelite prophet from outside

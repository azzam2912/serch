the complex wishart distribution was extensively investigated by goodman while the derivation of the inverse is shown by shaman and others it has greatest application in least squares optimization theory applied to complex valued data samples in digital radio communications systems often related to fourier domain complex filtering letting formula 6 be the sample covariance of independent complex p vectors formula 7 whose hermitian covariance has complex wishart distribution formula 8 with mean value formula 9 degrees of freedom then the pdf of formula 10 follows the complex inverse wishart distribution if formula 11 is a sample from the complex wishart distribution formula 12 such that in the simplest case formula 13 then formula 14 is sampled from the inverse complex wishart distribution formula 15 the density function of formula 16 is where formula 18 is the complex multivariate gamma function the variances and covariances of the elements of the inverse complex wishart distribution are shown in shaman s paper above while maiwald and kraus determine the 1 st through 4 th moments the joint distribution of the real eigenvalues of the inverse complex and real wishart are found in edelman s paper who refers back to an earlier paper

it occurs in relatively high concentrations in archaea that are thought to be involved in reverse methanogenesis organisms that promote this remarkable reaction contain 7 by weight nickel protein the structure of f430 was deduced by x ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy coenzyme f features the most reduced tetrapyrroles in addition it possesses two additional rings in comparison to the standard tetrapyrrole ring scaffold rings a d with a lactam ring e and a keto containing carbocyclic ring f it is the only natural tetrapyrrole containing nickel nickel is relatively infrequent in terms of metals in biology the biosynthesis begins with uroporphyrinogen iii the progenitor of all natural tetrapyrroles including chlorophyll vitamin b phycobilins siroheme heme and heme d uroporphyrinogen iii is converted to sirohydrochlorin insertion of nickel into this tetrapyrrole is catalysed by a class ii chelatase cfba generating nickel ii sirohydrochlorin an atp dependent amidase converts the a and c acetate side chains to acetamide generating nickel ii sirohydrochlorin a c diamide a two component complex cfbcd carries out a 6 electron and 7 proton reduction of the ring system to generate the 15 17 seco f 17 acid seco f intermediate reduction involves atp hydrolysis and electrons

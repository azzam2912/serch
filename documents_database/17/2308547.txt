seascape ecology the application of landscape ecology concepts to the marine environment has been slowly emerging since the 1970s yielding new ecological insights and showing growing potential to support the development of ecologically meaningful science based management practices for marine systems the application of landscape ecology came about through a recognition that many of the concepts developed in the theory of island biogeography and the study of patch dynamics precursors to modern landscape ecology could be applicable to a range of marine environments from plankton patches to patch reefs intertidal mussel beds and seagrasses meadows progress in the ecological understanding of spatial patterning was not confined to shallow seafloor environments for the open ocean advances in ocean observing systems since the 1970s have allowed scientists to map classify quantify and track dynamic spatial structure in the form of eddies surface roughness currents runoff plumes ice temperature fronts and plankton patches using oceanographic technologies a theme increasingly referred to as pelagic seascape ecology subsurface structures too such as internal waves thermoclines haloclines boundary layers and stratification resulting in distinct layering of organisms is increasingly being mapped and modelled in multiple dimensions like landscape ecologists seascape ecologists are interested in the spatially

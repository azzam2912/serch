by knowing two angles such as 32 and 64 degrees we know that the next angle is 84 because 180 32 64 84 this is sometimes referred to as the aaa postulate which is true in all respects but two angles are entirely sufficient the postulate can be better understood by working in reverse order the two triangles on grids a and b are similar by a 1 5 dilation from a to b if they are aligned as in grid c it is apparent that the angle on the origin is congruent with the other d we also know that the pair of sides opposite the origin are parallel we know this because the pairs of sides around them are similar stem from the same point and line up with each other we can then look at the sides around the parallels as transversals and therefore the corresponding angles are congruent using this reasoning we can tell that similar triangles have congruent angles

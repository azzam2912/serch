it is based around the use of reusable cathode starter sheets for copper electrorefining and the automated stripping of the deposited cathode copper from them the current isakidd technology represents the merger of the copper refining technologies developed by the two different organisations the initial isa process development in the late 1970s with its reusable stainless steel cathode starter sheets represented an advance on the previous technology of single use starter sheets of pure copper the production of which was a labour intensive process the production of the single use starter sheets involved laying down a sheet of copper by electrolysis on each side of a mother plate generating the sheet took a day and thousands of sheets could be needed every day originally the copper starter sheets were separated from the mother plate manually but over time the process was automated in addition limitations associated with the use of copper starter sheets meant that it was difficult to meet the purity specifications of some new copper applications that were in the 1970s and 1980s demanding higher quality copper the development of the isa process tank house technology at crl eliminated the whole process and cost of producing the starter

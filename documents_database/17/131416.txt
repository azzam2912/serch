he worked in algebraic topology in the theory of lie groups and was one of the creators of the contemporary theory of linear algebraic groups he studied at the eth z rich where he came under the influence of the topologist heinz hopf and lie group theorist eduard stiefel he was in paris from 1949 he applied the leray spectral sequence to the topology of lie groups and their classifying spaces under the influence of jean leray and henri cartan with hirzebruch he significantly developed the theory of characteristic classes in the early 1950s he collaborated with jacques tits in fundamental work on algebraic groups and with harish chandra on their arithmetic subgroups in an algebraic group g a borel subgroup h is one minimal with respect to the property that the homogeneous space g h is a projective variety for example if g is gl then we can take h to be the subgroup of upper triangular matrices in this case it turns out that h is a maximal solvable subgroup and that the parabolic subgroups p between h and g have a combinatorial structure in this case the homogeneous spaces g p are the various flag manifolds both

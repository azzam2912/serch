evidence from eyetracking event related potentials and other experimental methods indicates that in addition to integrating each subsequent word into the context formed by previously encountered words language users may under certain conditions try to predict upcoming words in particular prediction seems to occur regularly when the context of a sentence greatly limits the possible words that have not yet been revealed for instance a person listening to a sentence like in the summer it is hot and in the winter it is would be highly likely to predict the sentence completion cold in advance of actually hearing it a form of prediction is also thought to occur in some types of lexical priming a phenomenon whereby a word becomes easier to process if it is preceded by a related word linguistic prediction is an active area of research in psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience in the eyetracking visual world paradigm experimental subjects listen to a sentence while staring at an array of pictures on a computer monitor their eye movements are recorded allowing the experimenter to understand how language influences eye movements toward pictures related to the content of the sentence experiments of this type have shown that while listening

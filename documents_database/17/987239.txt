other n terminal residues can also be cleaved however laps have been found across superkingdoms identified laps include human lap bovine lens lap porcine lap escherichia coli e coli lap also known as pepa or xerb and the solanaceous specific acidic lap lap a in tomato solanum lycopersicum the active sites in pepa and in bovine lens lap have been found to be similar shown in the picture below is the proposed model for the active site of lap a in tomato based on the work of strater et al it is also known that the biochemistry of the laps from these three kingdoms is very similar pepa bovine lens lap and lap a preferentially cleave n terminal leucine arginine and methionine residues these enzymes are all metallopeptidases requiring divalent metal cations for their enzymatic activity enzymes are active in the presence of mn mg and zn these enzymes are also known to have high ph ph 8 and temperature optima at ph 8 the highest enzymatic activity is seen at 60 c pepa bovine lens lap and lap a are also known to form hexamers in vivo the gu et al from 1999 demonstrated that six 55kda enzymatically inactive

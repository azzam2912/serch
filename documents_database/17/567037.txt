a computer program would record the aircraft s velocity and use it to pinpoint their location in relationship with the target s location early integrated nav attack systems suffered from poor reliability improvements in digital computing technology advent of the microchip have resulted in substantially more sophisticated and effective equipment a typical modern nav attack system is based around an inertial navigation system ins that allows the aircrew to locate the target area without relying on active sensors such as radar that might alert enemy combatants ins can help calculate drift changes in course that deviate from the target the nav attack system can guide the aircraft to the target or be used as a tool to help guide the pilot to the target modern systems typically provide an automatic weapons release the aircraft can be programmed to release the ordnance before it misses the target the aircraft s computer system will release the ordnance unless the pilot chooses to override that command and release it instead the navigation program accounts for factors such as wind and velocity early nav attack systems were primitive but paved the way for the systems we have today today s systems give pilots deadlier

its name comes from the process of potting or encapsulation of the conductors inside the terminal s insulating bushing potheads are used where higher voltage power lines go underground generally voltages of 600 volts or greater they are used mostly for service drops for commercial and industrial buildings for lower voltages such as those used for residential service drops another weather seal called a weatherhead is used the device consists of a molded plastic housing that attaches to the end of an electrical conduit that carries the underground cables up the utility pole to the crossarm multiple bushing insulators project from the plastic body each ending at an electrical terminal each overhead wire is connected to a bushing terminal from which the current passes through a rod down the center of the bushing to the interior of the housing where it is connected to a wire from the conduit thus the device allows the overhead conductors to pass into the conduit while serving as a seal to keep out water the purpose of the bushings which have corrugations moulded into their surfaces is to provide enough creepage distance along their surface to prevent leakage current from the high voltage terminal

it depicts the collapse of william pitt 1st earl of chatham on 7 april 1778 during a debate in the house of lords on the american war of independence chatham is surrounded by peers of the realm and the painting contains fifty five portraits copley s painting is a visual record of the appearance of the armada tapestries which were destroyed in the 1834 burning of parliament lord chatham was the architect of the british victory in the seven years war 1757 1763 in which britain won supremacy in america although sympathetic to american grievances and against the use of force to subdue the americans he was opposed to american independence on 23 march 1778 the duke of richmond proposed in the lords to withdraw all british troops from america this was defeated by 56 votes to 28 on 5 april he sent chatham a draft of the address in which he argued for entreating his majesty to dismiss his ministers and withdraw his forces by sea and land from the revolted provinces i am willing to hope that differences of opinion were more apparent than real and arose only from want of opportunities to communicate and to explain chatham

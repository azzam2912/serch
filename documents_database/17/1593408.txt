the difference between manufacturing and process is typically the types of control involved discrete control or continuous control aka process control many plants offer a hybrid of both discrete and continuous control the underlying commonality between them all is that the automation systems are often an integration of multi vendor products to form one system each vendor product typically offers communication capability for programming maintaining and collecting data from their products a properly orchestrated plant floor environment will likely include a variety of communications some for machine to machine m2m communications to facilitate efficient primary control over the process and some for machine to enterprise m2e communications to facilitate connectivity with business systems that provide overall reporting scheduling and inventory management functions automation controllers typically offer communication modules to enable them to support a variety of industrial protocols to facilitate machine to machine communications these modules are often special designed for the protocol a new class of module the universal gateway is becoming more prevalent as it offers the ability for an automation controller to communicate over one or more protocols simultaneously and can be reconfigured for additional protocols without a module change few automation controllers offer direct connectivity to

abc proteins transport various molecules across extra and intra cellular membranes abc genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies abc1 mdr tap mrp ald oabp gcn20 white more specifically this protein is a member of the mrp subfamily which is involved in multi drug resistance this protein is expressed in the canalicular apical part of the hepatocyte and functions in biliary transport substrates include anticancer drugs such as vinblastine therefore this protein appears to contribute to drug resistance in mammalian cells mrp2 is also expressed in the apical membrane of proximal renal tubule endothelial cells where they are involved in the excretion of small organic anions several different mutations in this gene have been observed in patients with dubin johnson syndrome djs an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia many negatively charged metabolic waste products are eliminated from the body by the kidneys these organic anions are transported from the blood into the endothelial cells of the renal proximal tubules by the oat1 transporter from there these waste molecules are transported into the lumen of the tubule by the mrp2 transporter many drugs are eliminated from the body by this mechanism some of these drugs pass through the mrp2

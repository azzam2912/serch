suppose a c are respectively p p q q positive semidefinite complex matrices and b is a p q complex matrix let so that m is a p q p q matrix then fischer s inequality states that if m is positive definite equality is achieved in fischer s inequality if and only if all the entries of b are 0 inductively one may conclude that a similar inequality holds for a block decomposition of m with multiple principal diagonal blocks considering 1 1 blocks a corollary is hadamard s inequality assume that a and c are positive definite we have formula 3 and formula 4 are positive definite let we note that applying the am gm inequality to the eigenvalues of formula 7 we see by multiplicativity of determinant we have in this case equality holds if and only if m d that is all entries of b are 0 for formula 10 as formula 11 and formula 12 are positive definite we have taking the limit as formula 14 proves the inequality from the inequality we note that if m is invertible then both a and c are invertible and we get the desired equality condition if m

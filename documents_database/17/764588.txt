solid gallium trichloride exists as a dimer with the formula gacl it is colourless and soluble in virtually all solvents even alkanes which is truly unusual for a metal halide it is the main precursor to most derivatives of gallium and a reagent in organic synthesis as a lewis acid gacl is milder than aluminium trichloride gallium iii is easier to reduce than al iii so the chemistry of reduced gallium compounds is more extensive than for aluminium gacl is known whereas the corresponding alcl is not the coordination chemistry of ga iii and fe iii are similar and gallium iii compounds have been used as diamagnetic analogues of ferric compounds gallium trichloride can be prepared from the elements heating gallium metal in a stream of chlorine and purifying the product by sublimation under vacuum it can also be prepared from by heating gallium oxide with thionyl chloride gallium metal reacts slowly with hydrochloric acid this reaction produces hydrogen gas slowly as a solid it adopts a bitetrahedral structure with two bridging chlorides its structure resembles that of aluminium tribromide in contrast alcl and incl feature contain 6 coordinate metal centers as a consequence of its molecular nature and associated

this coating allowed aluminium cylinders and pistons to work directly against each other with low wear and friction unlike other methods including cast iron cylinder liners nikasil allowed very large cylinder bores with tight tolerances and thus allowed existing engine designs to be expanded easily the aluminium cylinders also gave a much better heat conductivity than cast iron liners an important attribute for a high output engine the coating was further developed as a replacement for hard chrome plated cylinder bores for mercury marine racing kohler engines and as a repair replacement for factory chromed snowmobiles dirt bikes atvs watercraft and automotive v8 liners bores nikasil is short for nickel silicon carbide silicon carbide is a very hard ceramic much harder than steel that can be dissolved in nickel the nickel solution can then be electroplated onto the aluminium cylinder bore the piston rings will then rub off the exposed nickel leaving a very hard layer of silicon carbide to prevent the cast iron steel piston rings directly contacting the aluminium cylinder with this setup the engine tolerances can be much tighter for better performance the cylinder must be re plated after it is re bored but nikasil is extremely

carriers are however able to pass the allele onto their offspring who may then express the genetic autosomal dominant recessive inheritance is made possible by the fact that the individuals of most species including all higher animals and plants have two alleles of most hereditary predispositions because the chromosomes in the cell nucleus are usually present in pairs diploid carriers can be female or male as the autosoms are homologous indepentantly from the sex in carriers the expression of a certain characteristic is recessive from latin recedere withdraw the individual has both a genetic predisposition for the dominant trait and a genetic predisposition for the recessive trait and the dominant expression prevails in the phenotype in an individual which is heterozygous regarding a certain allele it is not externally recognizable that it also has the recessive allele but if the carrier has offspring the recessive trait appeares in the phenotye in case the descendant receives the recessive allele from both parents and therefore does not possess the dominant allele that would cover the recessive trait according to mendelian law of segregation of genes an average of 25 of the offspring become homozygous and express the recessive trait carriers can either

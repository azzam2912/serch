the term is a pun on the name of werner heisenberg the physicist who first asserted the observer effect of quantum mechanics which states that the act of observing a system inevitably alters its state in electronics the traditional term is probe effect where attaching a test probe to a device changes its behavior similar terms such as bohrbug mandelbug hindenbug and schr dinbug see the section on related terms have been occasionally proposed for other kinds of unusual software bugs sometimes in jest however unlike the term heisenbug they are not widely known or used heisenbugs occur because common attempts to debug a program such as inserting output statements or running it in a debugger usually modify the code changing the memory addresses of variables and the timing of its execution one common example of a heisenbug is a bug that appears when the program is compiled with an optimizing compiler but not when the same program is compiled without optimization as is often done for the purpose of examining it with a debugger while debugging values that an optimized program would normally keep in registers are often pushed to main memory this may affect for instance the result

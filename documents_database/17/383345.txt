a high output 1 results only if all the inputs to the and gate are high 1 if none or not all inputs to the and gate are high a low output results the function can be extended to any number of inputs there are three symbols for and gates the american ansi or military symbol and the iec european or rectangular symbol as well as the deprecated din symbol additional inputs can be added as needed for more information see logic gate symbols the and gate with inputs a and b and output c implements the logical expression formula 1 an and gate is usually designed using n channel pictured or p channel mosfets the digital inputs a and b cause the output f to have the same result as the and function formula 2 is the analytical representation of and gate if no specific and gates are available one can be made from nand or nor gates because nand and nor gates are considered the universal gates meaning that they can be used to make all the others and gates are available in ic packages the 7408 ic is a well known quad 2 input and gates and

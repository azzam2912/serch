at that time saqlain played for the lahore badshahs the first person to face the teesra or jalebi was russel arnold of sri lanka when he was correctly given lbw by the umpire he was also the first person to get out at the hands of the teesra he got out the fourth time a teesra had ever been bowled the teesra made the news in the build up to the first test between england and pakistan in 2012 when saeed ajmal claimed he would introduce the delivery into his repertoire saeed ajmal took a match haul of 10 for 97 and became the fifth bowler to pick up seven leg before wicket dismissals in a match the delivery is similar to a slider which is used by a wrist spinner the ball is held by an off spinner in his normal action but instead of twisting the arm at the point of the delivery the bowler simply does not roll his fingers down the back of the ball the delivery looks like it will turn a lot but it doesn t turn at all this is a good way of deceiving the batsman the name teesra is commonly used

unlike traditional structures such as bulkheads or seawalls that worsen erosion living shorelines incorporate as many natural elements as possible which create more effective buffers in absorbing wave energy and protecting against shoreline erosion the process of creating a living shoreline is referred to as soft engineering which utilizes techniques that incorporate ecological principles in shoreline stabilization the natural materials used in the construction of living shorelines create and maintain valuable habitats structural and organic materials commonly used in the construction of living shorelines include sand wetland plants sand fill oyster reefs submerged aquatic vegetation stones and coir fiber logs many factors need to be addressed when preparing a living shoreline project permitting requirements and appropriate restoration strategies for a particular habitat are two critical topics for consideration before construction begins 1 analysis of the site the bank erosion rate elevation level vegetation wave energy wind patterns wave activity and soil type of the proposed site need to be examined to determine if it is an appropriate area for living shoreline stabilization restoration plans of stabilization activities are designed upon completion of the initial site analysis 2 permitting before any implementation begins permits should be applied for and obtained through

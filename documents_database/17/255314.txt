it is not any particular taxonomic group and includes species in several families of non mosquito nematoceran diptera midges are found seasonally or otherwise on practically every land area outside permanently arid deserts and the frigid zones some midges such as many phlebotominae sand fly and simuliidae black fly are vectors of various diseases many others play useful roles as prey items for insectivores such as various frogs and swallows others are important as detritivores participating in various nutrient cycles the habits of midges vary greatly from species to species though within any particular family midges commonly have similar ecological roles examples of families that include species of midges include the ceratopogonidae biting midges include serious blood sucking pests feeding both on humans and other mammals some of them spread the livestock diseases blue tongue and african horse sickness other species though are at least partly nectar feeders and some actually suck insect bodily fluids most other midge families are not bloodsuckers but it is not possible to generalise rigidly because of the vagueness of the term midge there is for example no objective basis for excluding the psychodidae from the list and some of them or midge like taxa

their loudspeaker technology was conceived and implemented by engineer jim winey in 1969 magnepan s speaker design sold under the brand name magneplanar often referred to as maggies differs from that of conventional speakers in relying not on cones mounted in an enclosure but on a planar driver system mounted in a panel a magneplanar s reproducing mechanism comprises thin conductive wires and or foil strips attached to a thin sheet of mylar residing in a magnetic field created by a vertical array of permanent strip magnets when an amplified signal is applied to the conductors the resultant electrical forces react with the magnetic field to excite the mylar film sheet which projects sound as a dipole in principle this approach relies on the same concept as a voice coil driven cone speaker but in a magneplanar speaker the voice coils are attached glued directly to the radiating surface sound is projected from both the front and back of the radiating surface the sound from the back of the speaker is reflected from the front wall of the listening area this is said to effectively enhance the soundstage the sense of space and realism of the speaker the magneplanar design

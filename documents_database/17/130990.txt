here easy and hard are to be understood in the sense of computational complexity theory specifically the theory of polynomial time problems not being one to one is not considered sufficient for a function to be called one way see theoretical definition below the existence of such one way functions is still an open conjecture in fact their existence would prove that the complexity classes p and np are not equal thus resolving the foremost unsolved question of theoretical computer science the converse is not known to be true i e the existence of a proof that p np would not directly imply the existence of one way functions in applied contexts the terms easy and hard are usually interpreted relative to some specific computing entity typically cheap enough for the legitimate users and prohibitively expensive for any malicious agents one way functions in this sense are fundamental tools for cryptography personal identification authentication and other data security applications while the existence of one way functions in this sense is also an open conjecture there are several candidates that have withstood decades of intense scrutiny some of them are essential ingredients of most telecommunications e commerce and e banking systems

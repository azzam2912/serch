this is in contrast to the effective rate of interest which expresses the amount of interest as a percentage of the balance at the start of the period the discount rate is commonly used for u s treasury bills and similar financial instruments for example consider a government bond that sells for 95 and pays 100 in a year s time the discount rate is the interest rate is calculated using 95 as the base for every effective interest rate there is a corresponding effective discount rate given by or inversely given the above equation relating formula 5 to formula 6 it follows that or equivalently since formula 10 it can readily be shown that this relationship has an interesting verbal interpretation a person can either borrow 1 and repay 1 i at the end of the period or borrow 1 d and repay 1 at the end of the period the expression i d is the difference in the amount of interest paid this difference arises because the principal borrowed differs by d interest on amount d for one period at rate i is id a discount rate applied formula 12 times over equal subintervals of a year is

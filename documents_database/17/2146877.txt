kompass acted as a whistleblower when he advised french authorities about a report on child sexual abuse carried out by french peacekeepers in the central african republic between december 2013 and july 2014 the french authorities rapidly took action to investigate the allegations in the report the investigations of fourteen soldiers are still ongoing however the ohchr chief prince zeid bin ra ad found that anders kompass had breached the ohchr rules of conduct by not seeking the approval of his superior prior to passing on the report to the french prince zeid also stated that the report included names and addresses of victims of the abuse thereby putting them at risk for stigma and retaliation in their home communities therefore he suspended kompass from his position however the suspension was found to be unlawful by the united nations dispute tribunal on 6 may 2015 prince zeid then proposed to dismantle the field operations unit of the ohchr which effectively would have removed kompass position from the organization meanwhile the united states and other member states criticized the un leadership for seeming to spend more efforts on discrediting kompass for disclosing the sexual abuses rather than on holding the abusers

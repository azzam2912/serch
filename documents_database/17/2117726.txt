deep drawing is a widely used cold sheet metal forming process to draw the sheet metal in forming dye of desirable cross section using mechanical force of the punch dfm refers to design for manufacturability dfa refers to design for assembly dfma stands for design for manufacture and assembly it is a practice for designing the engineering components keeping manufacturing and assembly aspects in mind dfma tries to tackle the problems that may come during the manufacturing and assembly at the design stage itself changes in the parts design to remove these problems while keeping the functionality of the parts intact this is done to reduce the cost of iterations thus making the manufacturing of components more efficient and economical in the deep drawing process a blank of sheet metal usually circular is placed on the die the die is fixed to the base the metal blank is held in position on the die using blank holder mechanical force is applied on the part of the metal blank above the die cavity through a punch as the punch force increases the metal flows from the flange region in to the die cavity here is the rule based dfm analysis for

ratchets are widely used in machinery and tools the word ratchet is also used informally to refer to a ratcheting socket wrench a rachet consists of a round gear or a linear rack with teeth and a pivoting spring loaded finger called a pawl or click in clocks and watches that engages the teeth the teeth are uniform but asymmetrical with each tooth having a moderate slope on one edge and a much steeper slope on the other edge when the teeth are moving in the unrestricted i e forward direction the pawl easily slides up and over the gently sloped edges of the teeth with a spring forcing it often with an audible click into the depression between the teeth as it passes the tip of each tooth when the teeth move in the opposite backward direction however the pawl will catch against the steeply sloped edge of the first tooth it encounters thereby locking it against the tooth and preventing any further motion in that direction because the ratchet can only stop backward motion at discrete points i e at tooth boundaries a ratchet does allow a limited amount of backward motion this backward motion which is limited

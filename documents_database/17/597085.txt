they are divided into posterior and anterior divisions the lumbar nerves are five spinal nerves which arise from either side of the spinal cord below the thoracic spinal cord and above the sacral spinal cord they arise from the spinal cord between each pair of lumbar spinal vertebrae and travel through the intervertebral foramina the nerves then split into an anterior branch which travels forward and a posterior branch which travels backwards and supplies the area of the back the middle divisions of the posterior branches run close to the articular processes of the vertebrae and end in the multifidus muscle the outer branches supply the erector spinae muscles the nerves give off branches to the skin these pierce the aponeurosis of the greater trochanter the anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves increase in size from above downward the anterior divisions communicate with the sympathetic trunk near the origin of the divisions they are joined by gray rami communicantes from the lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic trunk these rami consist of long slender branches which accompany the lumbar arteries around the sides of the vertebral bodies beneath the psoas major their arrangement is somewhat irregular one ganglion may give rami

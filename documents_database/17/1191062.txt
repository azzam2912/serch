the aim of most protein structure databases is to organize and annotate the protein structures providing the biological community access to the experimental data in a useful way data included in protein structure databases often includes three dimensional coordinates as well as experimental information such as unit cell dimensions and angles for x ray crystallography determined structures though most instances in this case either proteins or a specific structure determinations of a protein also contain sequence information and some databases even provide means for performing sequence based queries the primary attribute of a structure database is structural information whereas sequence databases focus on sequence information and contain no structural information for the majority of entries protein structure databases are critical for many efforts in computational biology such as structure based drug design both in developing the computational methods used and in providing a large experimental dataset used by some methods to provide insights about the function of a protein the protein data bank pdb was established in 1971 as the central archive of all experimentally determined protein structure data today the pdb is maintained by an international consortia collectively known as the worldwide protein data bank wwpdb the mission of

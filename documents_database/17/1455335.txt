they provide elasticity by allowing the stomach to expand when a bolus enters it these folds stretch outward through the action of mechanoreceptors which respond to the increase in pressure this allows the stomach to expand therefore increasing the volume of the stomach without increasing pressure these folds provide the stomach with increased surface area for nutrient absorption during digestion gastric folds may be seen during esophagogastroduodenoscopy or in radiological studies this layer releases stomach acid it is the innermost layer of the stomach affected by the hormone histamine which signals it to release hydrocholoric acid hcl this layer consists of different vessels and nerves ganglion neurons and adipose tissue it is the second layer of the stomach and supports the mucosa thickening of the gastric folds may be observed by endoscopy or radiography and may aid in the differential diagnosis of many disease processes including the folds become very thick due to inflammation ulcers cause breaks in the mucosa and cause erosion of the submucosa gastrin levels increase due to tumors which cause an increase in the gastric fold size the mucosa pits are in excess causing thickening of the folds causes inflammation of the folds mucosa change shape

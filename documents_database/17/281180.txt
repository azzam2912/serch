this enables the device to be bent or rolled while still operating currently the focus of research in industrial and academic groups flexible oleds form one method of fabricating a rollable display an oled emits light due to the electroluminescence of thin films of organic semiconductors approximately 100 nm thick regular oleds are usually fabricated on a glass substrate but by replacing glass with a flexible plastic such as polyethylene terephthalate pet among others oleds can be made both bendable and lightweight such materials may not be suitable for comparable devices based on inorganic semiconductors due to the need for lattice matching and the high temperature fabrication procedure involved in contrast flexible oled devices can be fabricated by deposition of the organic layer onto the substrate using a method derived from inkjet printing allowing the inexpensive and roll to roll fabrication of printed electronics flexible oleds may be used in the production of rollable displays electronic paper or bendable displays which can be integrated into clothing wallpaper or other curved surfaces prototype displays have been exhibited by companies such as sony which are capable of being rolled around the width of a pencil both flexible substrate itself as well as

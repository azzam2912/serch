by contrast if someone dies and a funeral prayer is said on his or her behalf no other prayer is necessary the hadith or traditions of muhammad approve of offering funeral prayers for an absent person abu hurayrah reports the prophet informed his companions about the death of negus najashi the king of abyssinia the day that he died and then the prophet led them to the prayer ground where he lined them up and offered funeral prayer for him with four takbirs the time for offering a funeral prayer for an absent person should be within one month after his death this rule is deduced from the mursal hadith stating that muhammad performed a funeral prayer on the grave of a woman one month after her death as sayeed ibn al musayyab reports saad bin ubadh s mother died while the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him was absent when he came to madinah one month later he offered the funeral prayer on her grave tirmizi muslim scholars have different opinions regarding the funeral prayer on the absentee this is the opinion of a great number of eminent muslim scholars including al khattaby and al rawiyani

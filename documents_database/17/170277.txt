they are known as homofermenters meaning that they produce a single product lactic acid in this case as the major or only product of glucose fermentation their homofermentative character can be altered by adjusting environmental conditions such as ph glucose concentration and nutrient limitation they are gram positive catalase negative non motile cocci that are found singly in pairs or in chains the genus contains strains known to grow at or below 7 c twelve species of lactococcus are currently recognized they are these organisms are commonly used in the dairy industry in the manufacture of fermented dairy products such as cheeses they can be used in single strain starter cultures or in mixed strain cultures with other lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus and streptococcus special interest is placed on the study of l lactis subsp lactis and l lactis subsp cremoris as they are the strains used as starter cultures in industrial dairy fermentations their main purpose in dairy production is the rapid acidification of milk this causes a drop in the ph of the fermented product which prevents the growth of spoilage bacteria the bacteria also play a role in the flavor of the final product lactococci

examples are the relationship of voltage and current across a resistor ohm s law or the mass and weight of an object proportionality implies linearity but linearity does not imply proportionality in mathematics a linear map or linear function f x is a function that satisfies the following two properties the homogeneity and additivity properties together are called the superposition principle it can be shown that additivity implies homogeneity in all cases where is rational this is done by proving the case where is a natural number by mathematical induction and then extending the result to arbitrary rational numbers if f is assumed to be continuous as well then this can be extended to show homogeneity for any real number using the fact that rationals form a dense subset of the reals in this definition x is not necessarily a real number but can in general be a member of any vector space a more specific definition of linear function not coinciding with the definition of linear map is used in elementary mathematics the concept of linearity can be extended to linear operators important examples of linear operators include the derivative considered as a differential operator and many constructed from

it is half a degree from the faint ic 447 reflection nebula hd 259431 is seen against ngc 2247 a small reflection nebula and star forming region it has been considered to be the illuminating source for the nebula although it is uncertain if they are at the same distance the hipparcos annual parallax gives a distance of 170 parsecs while ngc 2247 is thought to be at about 800 parsecs although both distances are somewhat uncertain many of its properties have been calculated assuming a distance of 800 parsecs which means they are also highly uncertain hd 259431 is classed as a herbig haro be star and has been instrumental in helping astronomers understand the formation of stars a large star with a large surrounding dust cloud mwc 147 has given astronomers a clear picture of the mechanics of the accretion processes that form stars star mwc 147 was observed in the near and mid infrared the near infrared studies showed dust matter at a temperature of several thousand kelvins in the innermost regions of the protoplanetary disk in the mid ir were lower temperatures these observations showed that the disk around the star disk extends over 100 au

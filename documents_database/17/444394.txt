it is occasionally spelled leukism unlike albinism it can cause a reduction in multiple types of pigment not just melanin leucism is a general term for the phenotype that results from defects in pigment cell differentiation and or migration from the neural crest to skin hair or feathers during development this results in either the entire surface if all pigment cells fail to develop or patches of body surface if only a subset are defective having a lack of cells that can make pigment since all pigment cell types differentiate from the same multipotent precursor cell type leucism can cause the reduction in all types of pigment this is in contrast to albinism for which leucism is often mistaken albinism results in the reduction of melanin production only though the melanocyte or melanophore is still present thus in species that have other pigment cell types for example xanthophores albinos are not entirely white but instead display a pale yellow colour more common than a complete absence of pigment cells is localized or incomplete hypopigmentation resulting in irregular patches of white on an animal that otherwise has normal colouring and patterning this partial leucism is known as a pied or piebald

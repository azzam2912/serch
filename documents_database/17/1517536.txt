cas allows an attacker to insert data that modifies the behaviour of a particular desktop application this makes it possible to extract data from inside of the users systems attackers may gain the full privileges of the attacked application when exploiting cas vulnerabilities the attack is to some degree independent of the underlying operating system and hardware architecture initially discovered by emanuele gentili and presented with two other researchers alessandro scoscia and emanuele acri that had participated in the study of the technique and its implications it was presented for the first time during the security summit 2010 in milan the format string attack is very similar in concept to this attack and cas could be considered as a generalization of this attack method some aspects of this technique have been previously demonstrated in clickjacking techniques like web interfaces modern frameworks for the realization of graphical applications in particular gtk and qt allow the use of tags inside their own widgets if an attacker gains the possibility to inject tags he gains the ability to manipulate the appearance and behaviour of the application exactly the same phenomenon was seen with the use of cross site scripting xss in web pages

the serotype is determined by the antibody recognition of subset of hla a chains for a1 the alpha a chain are encoded by the hla a allele group and the chain are encoded by b2m locus this group currently is dominated by a 0101 a1 and a are almost synonymous in meaning a1 is more common in europe than elsewhere it is part of a long haplotype that appears to have been frequent in the ancient peoples of northwestern europe a1 is a frequent component of the ah8 1 haplotype a1 serotype positivity is roughly linked to a large number of inflammatory diseases and conditions believed to have immune system involvement because of its linkage within the ah8 1 haplotype many studies showed association with a1 or a1 b8 only later to show the association drift toward the class ii region gene alleles dr3 and dq2 5 while it is not clear what role a1 has in infectious disease some linkage with infection rates in hiv remain associated within the a1 region of the haplotype in all instances so far hla a1 has been found to be linked to disease by association but there are few that define hla a1

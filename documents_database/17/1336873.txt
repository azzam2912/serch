middleware products rely on a wide range of different standards technologies and approaches that make their use and interoperation difficult and some developers may prefer to integrate their system themselves the player project formerly the player stage project is a project to create free software for research into robotics and sensor systems its components include the player network server and the stage robot platform simulators although accurate statistics are hard to obtain player is one of the most popular open source robot interfaces in research and post secondary education most of the major intelligent robotics journals and conferences regularly publish papers featuring real and simulated robot experiments using player and stage rt middleware is a common platform standards for robots based on distributed object technology rt middleware supports the construction of various networked robotic systems by the integration of various network enabled robotic elements called rt components the specification standard of rt components is discussed and defined by the object management group omg urbi is an open source cross platform software platform in c used to develop applications for robotics and complex systems it is based on the uobject distributed c component architecture it also includes the urbiscript orchestration language

in older operating system s with cooperative multitasking infinite loops normally caused the entire system to become unresponsive with the now prevalent preemptive multitasking model infinite loops usually cause the program to consume all available processor time but can usually be terminated by the user busy waiting busy wait loops are also sometimes called infinite loops infinite loops are one possible cause for a computer hang computing freezing others include thrashing computer science thrashing deadlock and segmentation fault access violation s looping is repeating a set of instructions until a specific condition is met an infinite loop occurs when the condition will never be met due to some inherent characteristic of the loop there are a few situations when this is desired behavior for example the games on cartridge based game consoles typically have no exit condition in their main loop as there is no operating system for the program to exit to the loop runs until the console is powered off modern interactive computers require that the computer constantly be monitoring for user input or device activity so at some fundamental level there is an infinite processing idle loop that must continue until the device is turned off or

for example if x is a variable then a change in the value of x is often denoted x pronounced delta x the differential dx represents an infinitely small change in the variable x the idea of an infinitely small or infinitely slow change is extremely useful intuitively and there are a number of ways to make the notion mathematically precise using calculus it is possible to relate the infinitely small changes of various variables to each other mathematically using derivatives if y is a function of x then the differential dy of y is related to dx by the formula where dy dx denotes the derivative of y with respect to x this formula summarizes the intuitive idea that the derivative of y with respect to x is the limit of the ratio of differences y x as x becomes infinitesimal there are several approaches for making the notion of differentials mathematically precise these approaches are very different from each other but they have in common the idea to be quantitative i e to say not just that a differential is infinitely small but how small it is infinitesimal quantities played a significant role in the development of calculus

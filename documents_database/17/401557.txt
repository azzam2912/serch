it provides developers with a common layer to create their own gnutella or gnutella2 client or network as a separate component gnucdna can be updated independently of the client passing down improvements to the applications already using it gnucdna is a widespread and established library which can be extended by programmers it includes the capability of forming a decentralized network between peers with integrated ultrapeer support allowing the network to avoid bottlenecks of low bandwidth nodes however the ultrapeer respectively hub on g2 support is outdated compared to modern implementations by clients like gtk gnutella and shareaza the library gives programs which link to it the ability to share files with built in support for uploading downloading file queuing and partial file sharing the ability to upload verified chunks of a file while it is downloading hash those files extract meta data to be shared through the network and the ability to perform advanced searching by specific hash and meta data parameters gnucdna also offers applications the ability to update their software easily through the same p2p network that they create the gnucdna component is com based to inherit the advantage of language independence and versatility applications in c visual

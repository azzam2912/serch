absorbance is dimensionless and in particular is not a length though it is a monotonically increasing function of path length and approaches zero as the path length approaches zero the use of the term optical density for absorbance is discouraged in physics a closely related quantity called optical depth is used instead of absorbance the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material the optical depth equals the absorbance times ln 10 the term absorption refers to the physical process of absorbing light while absorbance does not always measure absorption it measures attenuation of transmitted radiant power attenuation can be caused by absorption but also reflection scattering and other physical processes absorbance of a material denoted a is given by where absorbance is related to optical depth by where is the optical depth spectral absorbance in frequency and spectral absorbance in wavelength of a material denoted a and a respectively are given by where spectral absorbance is related to spectral optical depth by where although absorbance is properly unitless it is sometimes reported in arbitrary units or au many people including scientific researchers wrongly state the results from absorbance measurement experiments in terms of

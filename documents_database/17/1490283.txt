in general this problem is extremely hard and to tackle it with computer algorithms certain assumptions are made about admissible placements and about operations allowed in placement modifications constraint graphs capture the restrictions of relative movements of the objects placed in the plane these graphs while sharing common idea have different definition depending on a particular design task or its model in floorplanning the model of a floorplan of an integrated circuit is a set of isothetic rectangles called blocks within a larger rectangle called boundary e g chip boundary cell boundary a possible definition of constraint graphs is as follows the constraint graph for a given floorplan is a directed graph with vertex set being the set of floorplan blocks and there is an edge from block b1 to b2 called horizontal constraint if b1 is completely to the left of b2 and there is an edge from block b1 to b2 called vertical constraint if b1 is completely below b2 if only horizontal constraints are considered one obtains the horizontal constraint graph if only vertical constraints are considered one obtains the vertical constraint graph under this definition the constraint graph can have as many as formula 1 edges

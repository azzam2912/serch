the overall growth habit of the plant is difficult to construct some stems reached 2 5 mm in diameter but their height is unknown branching was possibly pseudomonopodial i e one arm of a dichotomous branch continued as a main stem uniquely among the rhynie chert plants aerial stems bore rigid hairs or spines made up of single cells stems appear to have grown from coiled circinnate tips in a manner similar to modern ferns stems contained circular exarch xylem strands with tracheids showing both annular and spiral thickening the upright spore forming organs or sporangia were made up of two valves the larger one facing away from the stem and bearing hairs the smaller facing towards the stem and apparently not bearing hairs the precise arrangement of the sporangia on the stems cannot be determined there may have been zones of sporangia spores were released through a slit opening along the margins of the two valves of a sporangium the trilete spores were about 55 m in diameter hairless stems bearing rhizoids but with a similar anatomy to the aerial stems are possibly the rhizomes of trichopherophyton some actually grow through stems bearing hairs the internal structure of stems

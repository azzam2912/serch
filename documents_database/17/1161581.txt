the hofmann l ffler freytag reaction proceeds via an intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer to a nitrogen centered radical and is an example of a remote intramolecular free radical c h functionalization in 1878 the structure of piperidine was still unknown and a w hofmann made attempts to add hydrogen chloride or bromine to it in the belief that the compound possessed unsaturation i e he performed standard alkene classification test reactions in the course of his studies a w hofmann synthesized a number of n haloamines and n haloamides and investigated their reactions under acidic and basic conditions he reported that the treatment of 1 bromo 2 propylpiperidine 3 with hot sulfuric acid followed by basic work up resulted in the formation of a tertiary amine which was later shown to be coneceine 4 although the hofmann l ffler freytag reaction was to become a general and expeditious process for the formation of pyrrolidines it was not until about 25 years after hofmann s work that further examples of the reaction were reported in 1909 k l ffler and c freytag extended the scope of this transformation to simple secondary amines and demonstrated the synthetic utility of the process as

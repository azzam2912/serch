the fluorescence pattern a different color for each of the four dna bases can then be captured in an image and processed to determine the dna sequence a recently developed alternative is the nanopore technology in which dna molecules are passed through a nano scale pore under the control of a ratcheting enzyme the passage of the dna molecules causes small change in electrical current that can be measured the main advantage of the nanopore technology is that it can be read in real time however the read accuracy of this technology is currently insufficient for data storage the genetic code within living organisms can potentially be co opted to store information furthermore synthetic biology can be used to engineer cells with molecular recorders to allow the storage and retrieval information stored in the cell s genetic material crispr gene editing can also be used to insert artificial dna sequences into the genome of the cell the idea of dna digital data storage dates back to 1959 when the physicist richard p feynman in there s plenty of room at the bottom an invitation to enter a new field of physics outlined the general prospects for the creation of artificial

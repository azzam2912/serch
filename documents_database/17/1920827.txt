some see this as a new technology however in some parts of the world the application of such products has been around since the 1990s electricity from solar panels is generated only during the day with peak generation around midday generation fluctuates and may not be synchronized with a load s electricity consumption to overcome this gap between what is produced and what is consumed during the evening when there is no solar electricity production it is necessary to store energy for later use and manage energy storage and consumption with an intelligent hybrid smart grid inverter with the development of systems that include renewable energy sources and rising electricity prices private companies and research laboratories have developed smart inverters for synchronizing energy production and consumption the function of a smart grid is enabling selection and orientation of renewable energy energy from the grid and energy storage based on consumption unlike conventional inverters rather than systematically storing energy in batteries with significant loss of yield 20 hybrid inverters store energy only when necessary e g when there is more production than consumption this system also allows choosing whether electricity from photovoltaic panels should be stored or consumed through an internal

first described in nebraska in 1922 stunted growth and the eponymous streaks of yellowed non uniform discoloration are characteristic of wsmv infection as it has been known to cause 100 crop mortality wsmv is a subject of ongoing scientific research wsmv is a flexible rod shaped virus composed of a positive sense single strand rna genome approximately 8 5 to 12 kilobases in length and can be either mono or bipartite the rna serves as both the genome and viral messenger the genomic rna or its segments is translated into polyprotein s which are transformed by virus encoded proteases into functional products wsmv is semi persistently transmitted by the wheat curl mite aceria tosichella a small cigar shaped insect that can produce a single generation within 10 days under optimum temperature approximately 27 c wheat curl mites are slow crawlers and depend on wind to disperse to other plants they can also overwinter in abandoned infected wheat or corn heads the mites also have the ability to transfer wsmv in between wheat and corn crops allowing the virus to persist year round one of the most important management techniques to controlling wsmv is by eliminating volunteer or seedlings from the

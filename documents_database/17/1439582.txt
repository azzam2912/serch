it is the most likely origin of the rostral cranial mesoderm stage 6 the prechordafl plate is a thickening of the endoderm at the cranial end of the primitive streak seen in embryo beneke by hill j p florian j 1963 stage 7 the prechordal plate is described as a median mass of cells located at the anterior end of the notochord which appears in early embryos as an integral part of the roof of the foregut e g embryos bi 24 and manchester 1285 o rahilly r m ller f 1987 p 55 and gilbert p w 1957 stage 8 o rahilly r m ller f 1987 present a detailed discussion of the term prechordal plate and its relation to the prochordal plate these essentially synonymous terms refer to the horseshoe shaped band of thickened endoderm rostral to the notochord but not quite reaching the rostral extremity of the embryo it reaches its maximum state of development at about this stage and contributes mesodermal type cells to the surrounding tissue cells derived from the prechordal plate become incorporated into the cephalic mesenchyme including the premandibular condensation described by gilbert p w 1957 and some of the foregut endoderm stage

in 2006 guitarist larry hibbitt stated that there were a lot of things that were wrong with the album a lot of it was to do with the fact that we had absolutely no working relationship with the label by the time it came out there was loads of pressure to get shatterproof out and get the ball rolling again they just wanted a record any record it just got put out and forgotten about it still sold 65 000 but nobody quite seems to realise that on the official hundred reasons message board guitarist paul townsend responded to a poll asking which of the band s first albums were better i think this topic might be easier to answer if i wasn t in the band both albums had there ups and downs good and bad memories i was much more confident with shatterproof with ideas we were doing everything for the first time we learned a lot with shatterproof we were so keen to move forward we never really focused on the things we got right silly buggers i think we got bits right on both albums but naturally not everything so again we learned a lot still

the astroscan had a newtonian reflector layout with a 4 clear inch 105mm diameter f 4 2 aluminized and overcoated borosilicate glass parabolic primary mirror with a focal length of 17 inches 445mm the telescope s secondary mirror was mounted on a flat optical window at the front of the tube edmund designer norman sperling and optical engineer mike simmons came up with the basic design and peter bressler design associates did the detailed work on this simple introductory telescope rather than using a more traditional equatorial or altazimuth mount the astroscan features a spherical housing around the primary reflector which sat in a cast aluminum cradle the design was durable and allowed for simple operation by novice amateur astronomers it won an industrial design award in 1976 the telescope body was made from high impact acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs plastic and was equipped with a carrying strap to aid portability because it was targeted at the novice market the telescope had its limitations the general design was for low power hand held or wide angle work the short f 4 focal ratio did not allow for high magnification without the image degrading and the primary mirror was factory aligned

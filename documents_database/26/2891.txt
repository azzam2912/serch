their beneficial medical uses are as treatments for congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias however their relative toxicity prevents them from being widely used most commonly found as secondary metabolites in several plants such as foxglove plants these compounds nevertheless have a diverse range of biochemical effects regarding cardiac cell function and have also been suggested for use in cancer treatment the general structure of a cardiac glycoside consists of a steroid molecule attached to a sugar glycoside and an r group the steroid nucleus consists of four fused rings to which other functional groups such as methyl hydroxyl and aldehyde groups can be attached to influence the overall molecule s biological activity cardiac glycosides also vary in the groups attached at either end of the steroid specifically different sugar groups attached at the sugar end of the steroid can alter the molecule s solubility and kinetics however the lactone moiety at the r group end only serves a structural function in particular the structure of the ring attached at the r end of the molecule allows it to be classified as either a cardenolide or bufadienolide cardenolides differ from bufadienolides due to the presence of an enolide a five

this type of emulsion was named after s u pickering who described the phenomenon in 1907 although the effect was first recognized by walter ramsden in 1903 if oil and water are mixed and small oil droplets are formed and dispersed throughout the water eventually the droplets will coalesce to decrease the amount of energy in the system however if solid particles are added to the mixture they will bind to the surface of the interface and prevent the droplets from coalescing making the emulsion more stable properties such as hydrophobicity shape and size of the particle can have an effect on the stability of the emulsion the particle s contact angle to the surface of the droplet is a characteristic of the hydrophobicity if the contact angle of the particle to the interface is low the particle will be mostly wetted by the droplet and therefore will not be likely to prevent coalescence of the droplets particles that are partially hydrophobic i e contact angle of approximately 90 are better stabilizers because they are partially wettable by both liquids and therefore bind better to the surface of the droplets the stabilization energy is given by where r is the

aicar is an analog of adenosine monophosphate amp that is capable of stimulating amp dependent protein kinase ampk activity aicar has been used clinically to treat and protect against cardiac ischemic injury the drug was first used in the 1980s as a method to preserve blood flow to the heart during surgery currently the drug has also been shown as a potential treatment for diabetes by increasing the metabolic activity of tissues by changing the physical composition of muscle the nucleoside form of aicar acadesine is an analog of adenosine that enters cardiac cells to inhibit adenosine kinase and adenosine deaminase it enhances the rate of nucleotide re synthesis increasing adenosine generation from adenosine monophosphate only during conditions of myocardial ischemia in cardiac myocytes acadesine is phosphorylated to aicar to activate ampk without changing the levels of the nucleotides aicar is able to enter the de novo synthesis pathway for adenosine synthesis to inhibit adenosine deaminase causing an increase in atp levels and adenosine levels a brief period of coronary arterial occlusion followed by reperfusion prior to prolonged ischemia is known as preconditioning it has been shown that this is protective preconditioning preceded myocardial infarction may delay cell death and

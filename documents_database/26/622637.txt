it is a spectral type b1iab star with an apparent magnitude of 12 2 its initial main sequence mass is calculated at 60 times the mass of our sun but a star of this type will have already lost a substantial fraction of that mass it is unclear whether sher 25 has been through a red supergiant phase or has just evolved from the main sequence so the current mass is very uncertain the name derives from the original cataloguing of stars in ngc 3603 by david sher this catalogue entry is more properly referred to as ngc 3603 sher 25 to distinguish it from stars numbered 25 by sher in other clusters the same star was numbered 13 by melnick tapia and terlevich ngc 3603 mtt 13 and 5 in a hubble space telescope survey by moffat drissen and shara ngc 3603 mds 5 it is speculated that sher 25 is near the point of going supernova as it has recently thrown off matter in a pattern similar to that of supernova 1987a in the large magellanic cloud with a circumstellar ring and bipolar outflow filaments regular variations in the doppler shift of the star s spectral lines with

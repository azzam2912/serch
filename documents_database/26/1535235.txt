for example in an economy with two goods formula 1 homothetic preferences can be represented by a utility function formula 2 that has the following property for every formula 3 in mathematics a homothetic function is a monotonic transformation of a function which is homogeneous however since ordinal utility functions are only defined up to a monotonic transformation there is little distinction between the two concepts in consumer theory in a model where competitive consumers optimize homothetic utility functions subject to a budget constraint the ratios of goods demanded by consumers will depend only on relative prices not on income or scale this translates to a linear expansion path in income the slope of indifference curves is constant along rays beginning at the origin this is to say the engel curve for each good is linear furthermore the indirect utility function can be written as a linear function of wealth formula 5 which is a special case of the gorman polar form hence if all consumers have homothetic preferences with the same coefficient on the wealth term aggregate demand can be calculated by considering a single representative consumer who has the same preferences and the same aggregate income utility functions

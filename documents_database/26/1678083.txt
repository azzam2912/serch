the term orbital distinguishes it from the contribution of spin degrees of freedom m to the total magnetization a nonzero orbital magnetization requires broken time reversal symmetry which can occur spontaneously in ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials or can be induced in a non magnetic material by an applied magnetic field the orbital magnetic moment of a finite system such as a molecule is given classically by where j r is the current density at point r here si units are used in gaussian units the prefactor would be 1 2 c instead where c is the speed of light in a quantum mechanical context this can also be written as where e and m are the charge and mass of the electron is the ground state wave function and l is the angular momentum operator the total magnetic moment is where the spin contribution is intrinsically quantum mechanical and is given by where g is the electron spin g factor is the bohr magneton is the reduced planck constant and s is the electron spin operator the orbital magnetization m is defined as the orbital moment density i e orbital moment per unit volume for a crystal of volume v

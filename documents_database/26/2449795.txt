he was a postdoctoral researcher at the scripps institute of oceanography san diego united states until 1995 a researcher at the cnrs nice france until 2001 a professor of geophysics at purdue university united states until 2012 when he joined the cole normale sup rieure as a professor and head of the earth sciences department he received the jacob fallot j r mine prize from the french academy of sciences in 2008 and the frank press prize from the american seismological society in 2012 he is a member of the french academy of sciences and a senior member of the institut universitaire de france eric calais research interests are in the physics of geological processes in seismically active regions at the edge of tectonic plates or in their interior he uses high precision spatial geodetic techniques such as gps and radar interferometry which it combines with seismology and physical models of rock deformation he has conducted field experiments around the world for example in the caribbean central asia and east africa where he has deployed networks of geodetic sensors to study active deformation processes on spatial and temporal scales ranging from individual earthquakes or volcanic events to plate boundary deformation

the process consumes the anode at a rate of roughly 450 kg of anode per metric tonne of aluminium produced spent anodes have little industrial use and are generally discarded however anodes that have been used to process aluminium fluoride may contain some amount of hydrogen fluoride and require hazardous waste disposal procedures efforts to find industrial use for spent anodes have led to proposals to use the anodes as a cost effective alternative for coke in small scale foundries that lack a ready supply of coke and cannot afford modern electric furnaces the properties of the anode are largely set during the baking process and must be carefully controlled to ensure an acceptable output efficiency and reduce the amount of undesirable byproduct produced to that end the aluminium smelting industry has settled on a range of acceptable values for commercial mass produced anodes for the purpose of consistent optimal performance higher baking temperatures result in higher density anodes which exhibit reduced permeability and therefore extend the operational life of the anode however excessive density will result in thermal shock and fracturing of the anode upon first use in an electrolysis cell efficient aluminium smelting requires low resistance on the

the two ways in which glucose uptake can take place are facilitated diffusion a passive process and secondary active transport an active process which on the ion gradient which is established through the hydrolysis of atp known as primary active transport active transport is the movement of ions or molecules going against the concentration gradient there are over 10 different types of glucose transporters however the most significant for study are glut1 4 glut1 and glut3 are located in the plasma membrane of cells throughout the body as they are responsible for maintaining a basal rate of glucose uptake basal blood glucose level is approximately 5mm 5 millimolar the km value an indicator of the affinity of the transporter protein for glucose molecules a low km value suggests a high affinity of the glut1 and glut3 proteins is 1mm therefore glut1 and glut3 have a high affinity for glucose and uptake from the bloodstream is constant glut2 in contrast has a high km value 15 20mm and therefore a low affinity for glucose they are located in the plasma membranes of hepatocytes and pancreatic beta cells in mice but glut1 in human beta cells see reference 1 the high km

the protein encoded is predicted to be a nuclear protein however its exact function is currently unknown c3orf70 can be identified with known aliases chromosome 3 open reading frame 70 ak091454 upf0524 and loc285382 in humans c3orf70 is located on the reverse strand of chromosome 3 at 3q27 2 see figure 1 this identifies its location starting 184 795 838 base pairs and ending 184 870 802 base pairs from pter the terminus of the short arm on chromosome 3 c3orf70 spans 74 964 bases containing two exons and two introns the transcribed mrna is a 5 901 base pair transcript c3orf70 consists of one known splice variant with two exons of 388 base pairs and 5 512 base pairs respectively see figure 2 location of junction occurs at 67aa c a single 5 cap and three possible 3 polyadenylation signals have been identified the translated protein is a 250 amino acid product the precursor protein has been predicted with a molecular weight of 27 8kdal and an isoelectric point of 4 67 with 33 serines and 8 glysines the c3orf70 protein is both serine rich and glycine poor c3orf70 protein has no known signal peptides or domains c3orf70 has

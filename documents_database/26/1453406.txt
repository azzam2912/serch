the graph is named after otto schreier who used the term nebengruppenbild an equivalent definition was made in an early paper of todd and coxeter the vertices of the graph are the right cosets hg hg h in h for g in g the edges of the graph are of the form hg hgx the cayley graph of the group g with x i in i is the schreier coset graph for h 1 a spanning tree of a schreier coset graph corresponds to a schreier transversal as in schreier s subgroup lemma the book categories and groupoids listed below relates this to the theory of covering morphisms of groupoids a subgroup h of a group g determines a covering morphism of groupoids formula 1 and if x is a generating set for g then its inverse image under p is the schreier graph of g x the graph is useful to understand coset enumeration and the todd coxeter algorithm coset graphs can be used to form large permutation representations of groups and were used by graham higman to show that the alternating groups of large enough degree are hurwitz groups every vertex transitive graph is a coset graph

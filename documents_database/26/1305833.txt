it consists of power stations may be located for example near a fuel source or at a dam site to take advantage of renewable energy sources and are often located away from heavily populated areas the electric power which is generated is stepped up to a higher voltage at which it connects to the electric power transmission net the bulk power transmission network will move the power long distances sometimes across international boundaries until it reaches its wholesale customer usually the organisation that owns the local electric power distribution network on arrival at a substation the power will be stepped down from a transmission level voltage to a distribution level voltage as it exits the substation it enters the distribution wiring finally upon arrival at the service location the power is stepped down again from the distribution voltage to the required service voltage s electrical grids vary in size from covering a single building through national grids which cover whole countries to transnational grids which can cross continents although electrical grids are widespread 1 4 billion people were not connected to an electricity grid electrical grids can be prone to malicious intrusion or attack thus there is a need for

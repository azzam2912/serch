the site contains unusual inca ruins mostly consisting of several terraced circular depressions the largest of which is approximately deep as with many other inca sites it also has an irrigation system the purpose of these depressions is uncertain but their depth design and orientation with respect to wind and sun creates a temperature difference of as much as 15 c 27 f between the top and the bottom during the rainy season of 2009 2010 the region of cusco received high levels of precipitation that are atypical which caused permanent damage to the ruins of moray the terraced levels of the complex which are constructed from stone and compacted earth were damaged extensively as the excessive rain waters undermined the ground beneath the structure the eastern side of the principal circle collapsed during february 2010 causing concerns about the permanence of the site as a top tourist attraction in peru a temporary wooden support structure was erected to prevent further collapse until reconstruction work could begin according to travel writer paul jones although repair work at moray continues to restore the site to its original state lack of funds and continuing annual rainfall hinder progress this interesting archaeological site

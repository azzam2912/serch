thus there are terms like polyclonal derived from many clones oligoclonal derived from a few clones and monoclonal derived from one clone these terms are most commonly used in context of antibodies or immunocytes this concept of clone assumes importance as all the cells that form a clone share common ancestry which has a very significant consequence shared genotype most other cells cannot divide indefinitely as after a few cycles of cell division the cells stop expressing an enzyme telomerase the genetic material in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid dna continues to shorten with each cell division and cells eventually stop dividing when they sense that their dna is critically shortened however this enzyme in youthful cells replaces these lost bits nucleotides of dna thus making almost unlimited cycles of cell division possible it is believed that the above mentioned tissues have a constitutional elevated expression of telomerase when ultimately many cells are produced by a single cell clonal expansion is said to have taken place a somewhat similar concept is that of a clonal colony also called a genet wherein the cells usually unicellular also share a common ancestry but which also requires the products of clonal expansion to

it seems probable that he is the same person mentioned by curtius as one of those rewarded by the king at babylon 331 bc for their distinguished services there is little doubt also that he is the same to whom the government of cilicia was assigned in the distribution of the provinces after the death of alexander 323 bc in 321 bc he was deprived of his government by perdiccas and replaced by philoxenus but it would seem that this was only in order to employ him elsewhere as we find him still closely attached to the party of perdiccas and after the death of the regent united with alcetas attalus and their partisans in the contest against antigonus he was taken prisoner together with attalus docimus and polemon in 320 bc and shared with them their imprisonment as well as the daring enterprise by which they for a time recovered their liberty when they took possession of their prison overpowering their guards he again fell into the power of antigonus in 316 bc

the genus is monotypic known only from the type species gorgodon minutus from the early permian of the southwestern united states the only known remains of gorgodon are two fossils consisting of fragments of the skull gorgodon was described and named by paleontologist everett c olson in 1962 from the san angelo formation in knox county texas based on what is known of gorgodon the squamosal quadrate and pterygoid bones of the back of the skull the maxilla and premaxilla bones that make up the front of the skull and several teeth gorgodon had a relatively large temporal fenestra and a pair large conical caniniform teeth at the front of the jaw other distinguishing features of gorgodon include the fused connection between the quadrate and squamosal bones and a long transverse process of the pterygoid a projection extending from the pterygoid bone on the underside of the skull olson classified gorgodon as a very early therapsid because it had a heterodont dentition and large temporal fenestra not seen in the most basal synapsids but present in therapsids he placed it in the family phthinosuchidae because its teeth seemed similar to those of phthinosaurus an enigmatic therapsid from the middle permian

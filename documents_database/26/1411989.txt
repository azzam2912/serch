it was unsuccessful only two examples being built in 1916 the british admiralty placed a contract with frederick sage co a peterborough based woodworking company which had become an aircraft contractor for the royal navy to design and build a primary trainer for the royal naval air service it was required to be robust with a low landing speed and good visibility the resultant design the sage type 3 was a two bay tractor biplane powered by a rolls royce hawk engine in order to prevent the aircraft overturning during landing it was fitted with an additional pair of wheels ahead of the mainwheels the first prototype type 3 flew on 5 january 1917 it proved to be slow even for a trainer and was modified with smaller tail surfaces and reduced weight becoming the type 3b with the original design retrospectively designated type 3a which slightly improved performance however after a second aircraft was built the contract was cancelled and the remaining aircraft of the contract for 30 type 3s were unbuilt the type did form the basis for the sage type 4 floatplane which was ordered into production but cancelled due to the end of the war

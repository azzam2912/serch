it is a subtype of the adrenergic receptor family the human gene encoding this receptor has the symbol adra2b adra2b orthologs have been identified in several mammals adrenergic receptors include 3 highly homologous subtypes and these receptors have a critical role in regulating neurotransmitter release from sympathetic nerves and from adrenergic neurons in the central nervous system this gene encodes the subtype which was observed to associate with eif 2b a guanine nucleotide exchange protein that functions in regulation of translation a polymorphic variant of the subtype which lacks 3 glutamic acids from a glutamic acid repeat element was identified to have decreased g protein coupled receptor kinase mediated phosphorylation and desensitization this polymorphic form is also associated with reduced basal metabolic rate in obese subjects and may therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity this gene contains no introns in either its coding or untranslated sequences a deletion variant of the adrenergic receptor has been shown to be related to emotional memory in europeans and africans this variant also predisposed people who had it to focus more on negative aspects of a situation this predisposition remained present in people with the variant gene who took a single dose of

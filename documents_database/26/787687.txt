the role of jurors and juries however has changed over the centuries and have generally been moulded by social and cultural forces embedded in the wider communities in which they have evolved although the role of juries and jurors has a somewhat chequered history the jury in one form or the other became the formal method of proof of the guilt or otherwise of a person on trial and juries remain one of the cornerstones of the criminal justice system in many countries there are however many debates about the efficacy of the jury system and the ability of jurors to adequately determine the guilt or otherwise of the accused some argue that lay individuals are incapable of digesting the often complex forensic evidence presented during a trial others argue that any misunderstanding of the evidence is a flaw in legal cross examination and summing up many observe that the juror and the accused seldom can be considered peers which is historically considered a fundamental precept of jury makeup others consider the jury system to be inherently flawed as a result of the humanity of jurors they cite incidents in which the judiciary have become aware of juror assumptions made

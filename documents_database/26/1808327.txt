the origin of these structures is currently unknown chondrites is found in marine sediments from the cambrian period of the paleozoic onwards it is especially common in sediments that were deposited in reduced oxygen environments there are four recognized chondrites ichnospecies however aberrant forms of unknown taxonomic affinity have been discovered the fossils are made of infilled dendritic rootlike burrows the branching angles are 30 to 40 while a shaft diameter varies between 0 1 mm and 10 mm remaining constant within a single system chondrites is classified as a fodinichnion first appearing during the cambrian chondrites is still produced today it is one of the most common ichnotaxa throughout the fossil record and is widely distributed in all types of marine sedimentary rocks including sandstone shale limestone and marl that formed in environments ranging from subtidal shelves to the abyssal zone the tracemaker has been able to tolerate highly variable redox conditions for example chondrites is abundant almost to the exclusion of other ichnogenera in posidonia shale formed from laminated black carbonaceous clay deposited in an anoxic reducing environment in the oxic extensively bioturbated units of austin chalk the fossil is very common as well though the characteristic burrows

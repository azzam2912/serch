rgd is responsible for attaching biological information to the rat genome via structured vocabulary or ontology annotations assigned to genes and quantitative trait loci qtl and for consolidating rat strain data and making it available to the research community rgd is working with groups such as the programs for genomic applications at mcw and the national bioresource project for the rat nbpr rat in japan to collect and make available comprehensive physiologic data for a variety of rat strains they are also developing a suite of tools for mining and analyzing genomic physiologic and functional data for the rat and comparative data for rat mouse and human rgd began as a collaborative effort between leading research institutions involved in rat genetic and genomic research its goal as stated in rfa hl 99 013 was the establishment of a rat genome database to collect consolidate and integrate data generated from ongoing rat genetic and genomic research efforts and make these data widely available to the scientific community a secondary but critical goal was to provide curation of mapped positions for quantitative trait loci known mutations and other phenotypic data the rat continues to be extensively used by researchers as a model

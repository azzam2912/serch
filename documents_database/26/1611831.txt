in october 2010 euopisthobranchia is a monophyletic portion of the opisthobranchia as that taxon was traditionally defined but is not a replacement name for that group as several marine opisthobranch orders including nudibranchia sacoglossa and acochlidiacea are not included euopisthobranchia consist of the following taxa previous studies discussed the gizzard i e a muscular oesophageal crop lined with cuticula with gizzard plates as homologous apomorphic structures supporting a clade composed of cephalaspidea s s pteropoda and anaspidea a gizzard with gizzard plates probably originated in herbivorous taxa in which it worked like a grinding mill thus might be secondarily reduced in carnivorous groups within cephalaspidea s s and gymnosomata klussmann kolb and dinapoli considered the gizzard in umbraculoidea as non homologous with the one in the previous groups on account of the absence of gizzard plates or spines this contradicted salvini plawen and steiner who had proposed the gizzard to be a synapomorphy of the larger clade of paratectibranchia pteropoda cephalaspidea and anaspidea and eleutherobranchia secondarily lost in nudipleura but still present in umbraculoidea as coded in w gele and klussmann kolb phylogenetic hypothesis by j rger et al 2010 supports homology of the gizzard in umbraculoidea with the gizzard

due to massive financial problems the station was built in a very simple way without any artwork the walls are covered only in plaster and many columns are left as exposed painted steel in 1951 the station was renamed walter ulbricht stadion after the stadium nearby in 1961 the station was closed due to the building of the berlin wall rendering it a so called ghost station trains then passed through the station without stopping in 1973 despite having been closed for over 11 years the station was renamed stadion der weltjugend to reflect the change in name of the stadium this change was visible only to east german guards patrolling the platform and west berliners passing through the closed station as ghost stations were not printed on east german city maps it was secured with utmost care the station entrances were walled and equipped with observation points and a locked access door rolls of barbed wire were installed to prevent people from crawling onto the tracks all these measures were removed by 30 june 1990 and the station was reopened on 1 july 1990 as a result of the demolition of the stadium the station s name was changed

it is illustrated with a schematic map of the tongue with certain parts of the tongue labeled for each taste although widely taught in schools this was scientifically disproven by later research all taste sensations come from all regions of the tongue although different parts are more sensitive to certain tastes the theory behind this map originated from a paper written by harvard psychologist dirk p hanig which was a translation of a german paper zur psychophysik des geschmackssinnes which was written in 1901 the unclear representation of data in the former paper suggested that each part of the tongue tastes exactly one basic taste the paper showed minute differences in threshold detection levels across the tongue but these differences were later taken out of context and the minute difference in threshold sensitivity was misconstrued in textbooks as a difference in sensation while some parts of the tongue may be able to detect a taste before the others do all parts are equally capable of conveying the qualia of all tastes threshold sensitivity may differ across the tongue but intensity of sensation does not the same paper included a taste bud distribution diagram that showed a taste belt in 1974

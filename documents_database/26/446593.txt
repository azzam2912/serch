this approach greatly improves the signal to noise ratio polonies can be generated using several techniques that include solid phase polymerase chain reaction pcr in polyacrylamide gels however other earlier patented technologies such as that from manteia predictive medicine acquired by solexa which generate dna on a solid phase surface by bridge amplification are generally referred to as clusters the terminology and distinction between polony and cluster have become confused recently growth of clonal copies of dna on bead surfaces remains to be generically named although some also seek to name this technique as a polony method the concept of localizing and analyzing regions containing clonal nucleic acid populations was first described in patents by brown et al assigned to genomic nanosystems however these are in liquid phase clusters are distinct in that they are based on solid phase amplification of single dna molecules where the dna has been covalently attached to a surface this technology initially coined dna colony generation had been invented and developed in late 1996 at glaxo welcome s geneva biomedical research institute gbri by dr pascal mayer and dr laurent farinelli and was publicly presented for the first time in 1998 it was finally brought

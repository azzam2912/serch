the united earth space alliance uesa was able to fully concentrate on space exploration in the year 2147 the first colony ship was launched towards the asteroid theta 2 however the second vessel carrying the colonists encountered a terrifying disturbance in space alien ships emerged from what later became known as the void and attacked the colony ship the subsequent fate of ten thousand people on board was unknown humans constructed the inter dimensional starfighter radix and sent it through the void in a desperate attempt to face the alien threat in the mid 1990s the popularity of doom led to many shareware doom clones with radix being one of the few first person shooters which takes place in a zero gravity environment and where the player controls a ship rather than a human in some sense radix is superficially similar to descent however while descent had full 3d maps with six degrees of motion radix uses the earlier 2 5d map designs of doom clones these are characterized by flat levels with no rooms over rooms albeit with slopes of various degrees despite being a spacecraft freedom of motion is limited it is impossible to turn fully vertically upwards

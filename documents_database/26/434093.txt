their function however is subject to fine tuning by various regulatory proteins collectively referred to as snare masters in the q r nomenclature for organizing snare proteins vamp synaptobrevin family members are classified as r snares so named for the presence of an arginine at a specific location within the primary sequence of the protein as opposed to the snares of the target membrane which contain a glutamine and are so named q snares synaptobrevin is classified as a v snare in the v t nomenclature an alternative classification scheme in which snares are classified as v snares and t snares for their localization to vesicles and target membranes respectively synaptobrevin is degraded by tetanospasmin a protein derived from the bacterium clostridium tetani which causes tetanus a related bacterium clostridium botulinum produces the botulinum toxin various botulinum toxin serotypes exist that each cleave specific peptide bonds of specific neuronal snare proteins and synaptobrevin is this target protein for several of the serotypes sec22a sec22b sybl1 vamp1 vamp2 vamp3 vamp4 vamp5 vamp8 ykt6

it is also known as focal glomerular sclerosis or focal nodular glomerulosclerosis it accounts for about a sixth of the cases of nephrotic syndrome minimal change disease mcd is by far the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children mcd and primary fsgs may have a similar cause depending on the cause it is broadly classified as there are many other classification schemes also five mutually exclusive variants of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis may be distinguished by the pathologic findings seen on renal biopsy recognition of these variants may have prognostic value in individuals with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis i e where no underlying cause is identified the collapsing variant is associated with higher rate of progression to end stage renal disease whereas glomerular tip lesion variant has a low rate of progression to end stage renal disease in most patients cellular variant shows similar clinical presentation to collapsing and glomerular tip variant but has intermediate outcomes between these two variants however because collapsing and glomerular tip variant show overlapping pathologic features with cellular variant this intermediate difference in clinical outcomes may reflect a sampling bias in cases of cellular focal segmental glomerulosclerosis i e unsampled collapsing variant or glomerular

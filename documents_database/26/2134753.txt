it tracks the trajectory of electrons protons nuclei and gamma rays and measures their direction charge and energy which may help understand the nature of dark matter or nearby sources of high energy particle acceleration the mission was developed and sponsored by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa involving teams from japan italy and the united states calet was launched aboard jaxa s h ii transfer vehicle kounotori 5 htv 5 on 19 august 2015 and was placed on the international space station s japanese kibo module calet is an astrophysics mission that searches for signatures of dark matter and provides the highest energy direct measurements of the cosmic ray electron spectrum in order to observe discrete sources of high energy particle acceleration in our local region of the galaxy the mission was developed and sponsored by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa involving teams from japan italy and the united states it seeks to understand the mechanisms of particle acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays in our galaxy to identify their sources of acceleration their elemental composition as a function of energy and possibly to unveil the nature of dark matter such sources seem to be able to accelerate

this white material crystallizes in cubes like rock salt cas has been studied as a component in a process that would recycle gypsum a product of flue gas desulfurization like many salts containing sulfide ions cas typically has an odour of hs which results from small amount of this gas formed by hydrolysis of the salt in terms of its atomic structure cas crystallizes in the same motif as sodium chloride indicating that the bonding in this material is highly ionic the high melting point is also consistent with its description as an ionic solid in the crystal each s ion is surrounded by an octahedron of six ca ions and complementarily each ca ion surrounded by six s ions cas is produced by carbothermic reduction of calcium sulfate which entails the conversion of carbon usually as charcoal to carbon dioxide and can react further in the second reaction the sulfate 6 oxidation state oxidizes the sulfide 2 oxidation state to sulfur dioxide 4 oxidation state while it is being reduced to sulfur dioxide itself 4 oxidation state cas is also a byproduct in the leblanc process a once major industrial process for producing sodium carbonate in that process sodium

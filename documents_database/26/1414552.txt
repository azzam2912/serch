it was used in the s and in most cruisers including the and heavy cruisers after refits during the 1930s it was superseded by the type 93 oxygen powered torpedo commonly called the long lance as oxygen generating equipment was installed aboard the cruisers the torpedo was based on a newly developed british whitehead torpedo this weapon used a new double action two cylinder engine rather than the four cylinder radial engine used by world war i era british torpedoes it was significantly faster although it had a much shorter range only than the japanese 6th and 8th year torpedoes twenty of these were bought with training warheads in 1926 for 30 000 each the british allowed japanese technicians to observe the manufacturing process and launch trials japan bought a manufacturing license in 1928 for 150 000 the japanese did not actually manufacture any of these torpedoes but combined their technology with the results of independent japanese research to produce the 61 cm type 90 testing of the prototypes was prolonged by the need to correct a number of design errors and manufacturing defects but two prototypes were turned over to the underwater school in 1931 for practical use it

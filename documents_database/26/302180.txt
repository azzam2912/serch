a number of different classification schemes have arisen and though they share some similarities there are differences due in part to the different purposes they serve in addition as mathematics continues to be developed these classification schemes must change as well to account for newly created areas or newly discovered links between different areas classification is made more difficult by some subjects often the most active which straddle the boundary between different areas a traditional division of mathematics is into pure mathematics mathematics studied for its intrinsic interest and applied mathematics mathematics which can be directly applied to real world problems this division is not always clear and many subjects have been developed as pure mathematics to find unexpected applications later on broad divisions such as discrete mathematics and computational mathematics have emerged more recently an ideal system of classification permits adding new areas into the organization of previous knowledge and fitting surprising discoveries and unexpected interactions into the outline for example the langlands program has found unexpected connections between areas previously thought unconnected at least galois groups riemann surfaces and number theory number theory is the study of numbers and the properties of operations between them number theory is

these transformations are named after heinrich franz friedrich tietze who introduced them in a paper in 1908 a presentation is in terms of generators and relations formally speaking the presentation is a pair of a set of named generators and a set of words in the free group on the generators that are taken to be the relations tietze transformations are built up of elementary steps each of which individually rather evidently takes the presentation to a presentation of an isomorphic group these elementary steps may operate on generators or relations and are of four kinds if a relation can be derived from the existing relations then it may be added to the presentation without changing the group let g x x 1 be a finite presentation for the cyclic group of order 3 multiplying x 1 on both sides by x we get x x 1 so x 1 is derivable from x 1 hence g x x 1 x 1 is another presentation for the same group if a relation in a presentation can be derived from the other relations then it can be removed from the presentation without affecting the group in g x x 1 x

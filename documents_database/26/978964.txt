in humans it is made in the liver found mainly in blood plasma and encoded by the bche gene it is very similar to the neuronal acetylcholinesterase which is also known as rbc or erythrocyte cholinesterase the term serum cholinesterase is generally used in reference to a clinical test that reflects levels of both of these enzymes in the blood assay of butyrylcholinesterase activity in plasma can be used as a liver function test as both hypercholinesterasemia and hypocholinesterasemia indicate pathological processes the half life of bche is approximately 10 to 14 days butyrylcholine is a synthetic compound that does not occur in the body naturally it is used as a tool to distinguish between acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase butyrylcholinesterase may be a physiological ghrelin regulator pseudocholinesterase deficiency results in delayed metabolism of only a few compounds of clinical significance including the following succinylcholine mivacurium procaine heroin and cocaine of these its most clinically important substrate is the depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent succinylcholine which the pseudocholinesterase enzyme hydrolyzes to succinylmonocholine and then to succinic acid in individuals with normal plasma levels of normally functioning pseudocholinesterase enzyme hydrolysis and inactivation of approximately 90 95 of an intravenous dose of succinylcholine occurs before

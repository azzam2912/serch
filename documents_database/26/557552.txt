the mannheim furnace is also used to produce potassium sulfate from potassium chloride the mannheim process is a stage in the leblanc process for the production of sodium carbonate the process is conducted in a mannheim furnace a large cast iron kiln sodium chloride and sulfuric acid are first fed onto a stationary reaction plate where an initial reaction takes place the stationary plate is up to in diameter rotating rabble arms constantly turn over the mixture and move the intermediate product to a lower plate the kiln portion of the furnace is constructed with bricks that have high resistance to direct flame temperature and acid the other parts of the furnace are heat and acid resistant hot flue gas passes up over the plates carrying out liberated hydrogen chloride gas the intermediate product reacts with more sodium chloride in the lower hotter section of the kiln producing sodium sulfate this exits the furnace and passes through cooling drums before being milled screened and sent to product storage facilities the process involves intermediate formation of sodium bisulfate an exothermic reaction that occur at room temperature the second step of the process is endothermic requiring energy input temperatures in the range

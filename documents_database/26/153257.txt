in a belt drive turntable the motor is located off center from the platter either underneath it or entirely outside of it and is connected to the platter or counter platter by a drive belt made from elastomeric material the design of the belt drive turntable allows the use of a less expensive motor than the direct drive turntable also the elastomeric belt absorbs motor vibrations which would otherwise be picked up by the stylus rotational stability is a key goal for turntable design that produces quality output many belt drive turntables with multiple speeds have mechanical devices or rely on manual effort to move the belt between different sized pulleys on the motor shaft due to difficulties in designing multiple speed synchronous motors whose speed can be controlled electronically such turntables frequently have dc servomotors the disadvantage of dc servomotors is that they rotate in steps rather than continuously the resulting cogging can add noise during playback helical armature motors can be used to overcome this problems with belt instability and deterioration in the past have largely been solved by use of modern elastic polymers since the 1970s dc motors have declined in popularity high end audiophile turntable designs

residual stresses are caused by rapid unequal cooling as opposed to the stresses caused by external loading this unequal cooling occurs during welding casting forging rough machining or hot rolling these stresses often lead to distortion or warping of the structure during machining assembly testing transport field use or over time in extreme cases residual stress can cause structural failure almost all vibratory stress relief equipment manufacturers and procedures use the workpiece s own resonant frequency to boost the loading experienced by induced vibration so to maximize the degree of stress relief achieved some equipment and procedures are designed to operate near but not at workpiece resonances perhaps to extend equipment life example wiap research but independent research has consistently shown resonant frequency vibration to be more effective see references 4 6 and 9 the effectiveness of vibratory stress relief is highly questionable in general the strain amplitudes achieved during vibratory stress relief are too low to exceed the critical stress required to activate mechanical relaxation during the induced low amplitude high cycle fatigue excitation of the transducer vibrations if the strain amplitudes were increased to a level sufficient to cause instability in the residual stresses fatigue damage would occur

in csrz the field intensity drops to zero between consecutive bits rz and the field phase alternates by radians between neighbouring bits so that if the phase of the signal is e g 0 in even bits bit number 2 n the phase in odd bit slots bit number 2 n 1 will be the phase alternation amplitude in its standard form csrz is generated by a single mach zehnder modulator mzm driven by two sinusoidal waves at half the bit rate b and in phase opposition this gives rise to characteristically broad pulses duty cycle 67 the signal format alternate phase return to zero aprz can be viewed as a generalisation of csrz in which the phase alternation can take up any value and not necessarily only and the duty cycle is also a free parameter csrz can be used to generate specific optical modulation formats e g csrz ook in which data is coded on the intensity of the signal using a binary scheme light on 1 light off 0 or csrz dpsk in which data is coded on the differential phase of the signal etc csrz is often used to designate aprz ook the characteristic properties of

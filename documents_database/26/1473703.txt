this group of minerals contains approximately thirteen complex metal titanates the structures of minerals of this group is complicated by frequent fine scale twinning and metamictization due to radioactive elements the crichtonite group consists of members of related mineral species of the type a bcde o which are characterized by their predominant cations as seen in crichtonite sr senaite pb davidite ree u landauite na loveringite ca lindsleyite ba and mathiasite k the chemical formula of cleusonite is pb sr u u fe zn ti fe fe o oh the following minerals are also found in the veins of cleusonite quartz chlorite calcite albite microcline tourmaline fluorapatite zircon ilmenite hematite titanite pyrite chalcopyrite tennantite rutile crichtonite monazite ce and native gold clausthalite chalcopyrite and uraninite are also found in the form of inclusions in cleusonite the structure of the lead end member senaite of the crichtonite group was determined in 1976 by grey lloyd the structure of the other members of the crichtonite group is similar and corresponds to the formula amo the crystals of cleusonite consist of multiple rhombohedra and hexagonal prisms that are twinned the crystal system is a trigonal rhombohedral class 3 and has space group of

the tadf process involves an excited molecular species in a triplet state which commonly has a forbidden transition to the ground state termed phosphorescence by absorbing nearby thermal energy the triplet state can undergo reverse intersystem crossing risc converting it to a singlet state which can then de excite to the ground state and emit light in a process termed fluorescence along with fluorescent and phosphorescent compounds tadf compounds are one of the three main light emitting materials used in organic light emitting diodes oleds the first evidence of thermally activated delayed fluorescence in a fully organic molecule was discovered in 1961 using the compound eosin the emission that was detected was termed e type delayed fluorescence and the mechanism was not completely understood in 1986 the tadf mechanism was further investigated and described in detail using aromatic thiones but it was not until much later that a practical application was identified from 2009 to 2012 adachi and coworkers published a series of papers reporting effective tadf molecular design strategies and competitive external quantum efficiencies eqe for green orange and blue oleds these publications spiked interest in the topic and tadf compounds were soon considered a possible higher efficiency alternative

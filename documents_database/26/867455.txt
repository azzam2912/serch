this results in a high electric field which can result in ionization of gaseous molecules of the analyte mass spectra produced by fd have little or no fragmentation because fd is a soft ionization method they are dominated by molecular radical cations m and less often protonated molecules m h the technique was first reported by beckey in 1969 it is also the first ionization method to ionize nonvolatile and thermally labile compounds one major difference of fd with other ionization methods is that it does not need a primary beam to bombard a sample in fd the analyte is applied as a thin film directly to the emitter or small crystals of solid materials are placed onto the emitter slow heating of the emitter then begins by passing a high current through the emitter which is maintained at a high potential e g 5 kilovolts as heating of the emitter continues low vapor pressure materials get desorbed and ionized by alkali metal cation attachment different analytes involve different ionization mechanisms in fd ms and four mechanisms are commonly observed including field ionization cation attachment thermal ionization and proton abstraction in field ionization electrons are removed from a species by

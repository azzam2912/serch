the projection maps meridians to vertical straight lines of constant spacing for meridional intervals of constant spacing and circles of latitude to horizontal straight lines of constant spacing for constant intervals of parallels the projection is neither equal area nor conformal because of the distortions introduced by this projection it has little use in navigation or cadastral mapping and finds its main use in thematic mapping in particular the plate carr e has become a standard for global raster datasets such as celestia and nasa world wind because of the particularly simple relationship between the position of an image pixel on the map and its corresponding geographic location on earth the forward projection transforms spherical coordinates into planar coordinates the reverse projection transforms from the plane back onto the sphere the formulae presume a spherical model and use these definitions the french for flat square is the special case where formula 3 is zero this projection maps x to be the value of the longitude and y to be the value of the latitude and therefore is sometimes called the latitude longitude or lat lon g projection or is said erroneously to be unprojected while a projection with equally spaced

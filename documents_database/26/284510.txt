they use electromagnetic forces instead of a logic gate a device used to perform solely on specified inputs to switch the forces of electrons the unique design of this transistor includes individual electrons bouncing from wedge shaped obstacles called deflectors initially accelerated by electric field electrons are then guided on their respective paths by electromagnetic deflection electrons are therefore able to travel without being scattered by atoms or defects thus resulting in improved speed and reduced power consumption a ballistic deflection transistor would be significant in acting as both a linear amplifier and a switch for current flow on electronic devices which could be used to maintain digital logic and memory a transistor switching speed is greatly affected by how fast charge carriers typically electrons can cross from one region to the next for this reason researchers want to use ballistic conduction to improve the charge carrier traveling time the conventional mos transistors also dissipate a lot of heat due inelastic collisions of electrons and must switch fast in order to reduce time intervals when the heat is generated reducing their utility in linear circuits one advantage of the ballistic deflection transistor is that because such device will use very

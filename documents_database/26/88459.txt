the itn makes particular use of lagrange points as locations where trajectories through space are redirected using little or no energy these points have the peculiar property of allowing objects to orbit around them despite lacking an object to orbit while it would use little energy transport along the network would take a long time interplanetary transfer orbits are solutions to the gravitational restricted three body problem which for the general case does not have exact solutions and is addressed by numerical analysis approximations however a small number of exact solutions exist most notably the five orbits referred to as lagrange points which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one body is significantly more massive the key to discovering the interplanetary transport network was the investigation of the nature of the winding paths near the earth sun and earth moon lagrange points they were first investigated by jules henri poincar in the 1890s he noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle for a time on an orbit about that point there are in fact an infinite number of paths taking one to the point and away from

equivalently a graph is aperiodic if the greatest common divisor of the lengths of its cycles is one this greatest common divisor for a graph g is called the period of g in any directed bipartite graph all cycles have a length that is divisible by two therefore no directed bipartite graph can be aperiodic in any directed acyclic graph it is a vacuous truth that every k divides all cycles because there are no directed cycles to divide so no directed acyclic graph can be aperiodic and in any directed cycle graph there is only one cycle so every cycle s length is divisible by n the length of that cycle suppose that g is strongly connected and that k divides the lengths of all cycles in g consider the results of performing a depth first search of g starting at any vertex and assigning each vertex v to a set v where i is the length taken mod k of the path in the depth first search tree from the root to v it can be shown that this partition into sets v has the property that each edge in the graph goes from a set v to

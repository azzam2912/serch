it can be intentionally imposed in a controlled process using an abrasive abrasion can be an undesirable effect of exposure to normal use or exposure to the elements ancient artists working in stone used abrasion to create sculptures the artist selected dense stones like carbonite and emery and rubbed them consistently against comparatively softer stones like limestone and granite the artist used different sizes and shapes of abrasives or turned them in various ways as they rubbed to create effects on the softer stone s surface water was continuously poured over the surface to carry away particles abrasive technique in stone shaping was a long tedious process that with patience resulted in eternal works of art in stone the archard equation is a simple model used to describe sliding wear and is based on the theory of asperity contact the resistance of materials and structures to abrasion can be measured by a variety of test methods these often use a specified abrasive or other controlled means of abrasion under the conditions of the test the results can be reported or can be compared items subjected to similar tests such standardized measurements can produce two quantities abrasion rate and normalized abrasion

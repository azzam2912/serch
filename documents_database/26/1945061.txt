trifallax has two different types of nuclei macronuclei which are the site of transcription and gene expression and micronuclei which are only active during sexual reproduction but are otherwise transcriptionally inactive macronuclei are formed by the differentiation of micronuclei which usually involves some degree of rna mediated dna editing o trifallax is the first species sequenced with an unusually high degree of fragmentation in its macronuclear genome up to 96 of the micronuclear genome is eliminated during the differentiation into a macronucleus in comparison in other ciliates like paramecium only about 30 is eliminated the macronuclear genome has a haploid size of about 50 mbp the chromosomes of the macronucleus are also unusually short the macronuclear genome encodes about 18 500 genes but these are distributed on 16 000 chromosomes which are called nanochromosomes due to their length because of their unusually short nanochromosomes most of which contain only a single gene they have been used as a model organism to study telomeres and to screen for non coding rna genes the micronuclear genome has also been sequenced and contains about 3 500 scrambled genes scrambled genes are genes whose individual segments are located in different parts of the micronuclear

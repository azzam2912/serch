the thickness of such a layer is several debye lengths thick a value whose size depends on various characteristics of plasma e g temperature density etc a debye sheath arises in a plasma because the electrons usually have a temperature on the order of magnitude or greater than that of the ions and are much lighter consequently they are faster than the ions by at least a factor of formula 1 at the interface to a material surface therefore the electrons will fly out of the plasma charging the surface negative relative to the bulk plasma due to debye shielding the scale length of the transition region will be the debye length formula 2 as the potential increases more and more electrons are reflected by the sheath potential an equilibrium is finally reached when the potential difference is a few times the electron temperature the debye sheath is the transition from a plasma to a solid surface similar physics is involved between two plasma regions that have different characteristics the transition between these regions is known as a double layer and features one positive and one negative layer sheaths were first described by american physicist irving langmuir in 1923 he

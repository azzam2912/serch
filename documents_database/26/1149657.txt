visible light optical systems use either lenses or mirrors aligned for nearly normal incidence that is the light waves travel nearly perpendicular to the reflecting or refracting surface conventional mirror telescopes work poorly with x rays since x rays that strike mirror surfaces nearly perpendicularly are either transmitted or absorbed not reflected lenses for visible light are made of transparent materials with an index of refraction substantially different from 1 but all known x ray transparent materials have index of refraction essentially the same as 1 so x ray lenses are not practical x ray mirrors can be built but only if the angle from the plane of reflection is very low typically 10 arc minutes to 2 degrees these are called glancing or grazing incidence mirrors in 1952 hans wolter outlined three ways a telescope could be built using only this kind of mirror these are called wolter telescopes of type i ii and iii each has different advantages and disadvantages wolter s key innovation was that by using two mirrors it is possible to create a telescope with a usably wide field of view in contrast a grazing incidence telescope with just one parabolic mirror could focus x

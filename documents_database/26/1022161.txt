glycoproteins ribonucleate 3 pyrimidino oligonucleotidohydrolase are pyrimidine specific endonucleases found in high quantity in the pancreas of certain mammals and of some reptiles specifically the enzymes are involved in endonucleolytic cleavage of 3 phosphomononucleotides and 3 phosphooligonucleotides ending in c p or u p with 2 3 cyclic phosphate intermediates ribonuclease can unwind the rna helix by complexing with single stranded rna the complex arises by an extended multi site cation anion interaction between lysine and arginine residues of the enzyme and phosphate groups of the nucleotides bovine pancreatic ribonuclease is the best studied member of the family and has served as a model system in work related to protein folding disulfide bond formation protein crystallography and spectroscopy and protein dynamics human genome contains 8 genes that share the structure and function with bovine pancreatic ribonuclease with 5 additional pseudo genes these structure and dynamics of these enzymes are related to their diverse biological functions other proteins belonging to the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily include bovine seminal vesicle and brain ribonucleases kidney non secretory ribonucleases liver type ribonucleases angiogenin which induces vascularisation of normal and malignant tissues eosinophil cationic protein a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin with ribonuclease activity and frog liver ribonuclease

it has a short half life 0 5 and 20 ms in solution and in the gas phase respectively although highly reactive difluorocarbene is an intermediate in the production of tetrafluoroethylene which is produced on an industrial scale as the precursor to teflon ptfe in general carbenes exist in either singlet or triplet states which are often quite close in energy singlet carbenes have spin paired electrons and a higher energy empty 2p orbital in a triplet carbene one electron occupies the hybrid orbital and the other is promoted to the 2p orbital for most carbenes the triplet state is more stable than the corresponding singlet in the case of fluorinated carbenes however the singlet is lower energy than the triplet the difference in energy between the singlet ground state and the first excited triplet state is 56 6 kcal per mol in singlet difluorocarbene the c f bond length is measured as 1 300 and f c f bond angle is measured as 104 94 almost tetrahedral on the other hand for the triplet state the c f bond length is measured as 1 320 and f c f bond angle is measured as 122 3 slightly more due

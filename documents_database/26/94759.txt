except for the north american virginia opossum which is a metatherian all post miocene mammals indigenous to europe africa asia and north america north of mexico are eutherians extant eutherians their last common ancestor and all extinct descendants of that ancestor are members of placentalia eutherians are distinguished from noneutherians by various phenotypic traits of the feet ankles jaws and teeth all extant eutherians lack epipubic bones which are present in all other living mammals marsupials and monotremes this allows for expansion of the abdomen during pregnancy the oldest known eutherian species is juramaia sinensis dated at from the jurassic in china eutheria was named in 1872 by theodore gill in 1880 thomas henry huxley defined it to encompass a more broadly defined group than placentalia distinguishing features are eutheria contains several extinct genera as well as larger groups many with complicated taxonomic histories still not fully understood members of the adapisoriculidae cimolesta and leptictida have been previously placed within the out dated placental group insectivora while zhelestids have been considered primitive ungulates however more recent studies have suggested these enigmatic taxa represent stem group eutherians more basal to placentalia the weakly favoured cladogram favours boreoeuthearia as a basal eutherian

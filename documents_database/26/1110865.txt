this may be due to normal biological processes that take place during the life of an organism such as the formation of bones egg shells teeth coral and other exoskeletons this term may also refer to abnormal processes that result in kidney and gall stones mineralization can be subdivided into different categories depending on the following the organisms or processes that create chemical conditions necessary for mineral formation the origin of the substrate at the site of mineral precipitation and the degree of control that the substrate has on crystal morphology composition and growth these subcategories include biomineralization organomineralization and inorganic mineralization which can be subdivided further however usage of these terms vary widely in scientific literature because there are no standardized definitions the following definitions are based largely on a paper written by dupraz et al 2009 which provided a framework for differentiating these terms biomineralization biologically controlled mineralization occurs when crystal morphology growth composition and location is completely controlled by the cellular processes of a specific organism examples include the shells of invertebrates such as molluscs and brachiopods additionally mineralization of collagen provides the crucial compressive strength for the bones cartilage and teeth of vertebrates this type of

the most common organic acids are the carboxylic acids whose acidity is associated with their carboxyl group cooh sulfonic acids containing the group sooh are relatively stronger acids alcohols with oh can act as acids but they are usually very weak the relative stability of the conjugate base of the acid determines its acidity other groups can also confer acidity usually weakly the thiol group sh the enol group and the phenol group in biological systems organic compounds containing these groups are generally referred to as organic acids a few common examples include in general organic acids are weak acids and do not dissociate completely in water whereas the strong mineral acids do lower molecular mass organic acids such as formic and lactic acids are miscible in water but higher molecular mass organic acids such as benzoic acid are insoluble in molecular neutral form on the other hand most organic acids are very soluble in organic solvents p toluenesulfonic acid is a comparatively strong acid used in organic chemistry often because it is able to dissolve in the organic reaction solvent exceptions to these solubility characteristics exist in the presence of other substituents that affect the polarity of the compound

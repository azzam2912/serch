a golden yellow solid with high electrical conductivity it belongs to a group of compounds called transition metal dichalcogenides which consist of the stoichiometry me tis has been employed as a cathode material in rechargeable batteries tis adopts a hexagonal close packed hcp structure analogous to cadmium iodide cdi in this motif half of the octahedral holes are filled with a cation in this case ti each ti centre is surrounded by six sulfide ligands in an octahedral structure each sulfide is connected to three ti centres the geometry at s being pyramidal several metal dichalcogenides adopt similar structures but some notably mos do not the layers of tis consist of covalent ti s bonds the individual layers of tis are bound together by van der waals forces which are relatively weak intermolecular forces it crystallises in the space group pm1 the ti s bond lengths are 2 423 the single most useful and most studied property of tis is its ability to undergo intercalation upon treatment with electropositive elements the process is a redox reaction illustrated in the case of lithium litis is generally described as li tis during the intercalation and deintercalation a range of stiochimetries are produced

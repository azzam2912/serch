this generally happens when the rear wheel loses traction skids and then suddenly regains traction creating a large torque which flips the rider head first off the side of the motorcycle or over the handlebars the initial traction loss may be caused by highsides differ from lowsides as follows during a lowside the rear wheel slips laterally and continuously until the bike falls onto its side the side that s inside the corner while during a highside the rear wheel slips laterally only briefly before suddenly regaining traction and flipping the bike onto its other side the side that s outside the corner and therefore the higher side of the motorbike as a result highsides happen very quickly with little if any warning and are very violent if the wheels are not aligned in the direction of travel when traction is suddenly restored and the rear tire stops slipping then a highside is likely depending on how much the bike is turned across the direction of travel and how fast the bike is traveling when the rear tire stops slipping if the angle is high enough the bike is moving fast enough and the rear tire slips and regains traction

under standard conditions fept nps exist in the face centered cubic phase but can change to a chemically ordered face centered tetragonal phase as a result of thermal annealing currently there are many synthetic methods such as water in oil microemulsion one step thermal synthesis with metal precursors and exchanged coupled assembly for making fept nps an important property of fept nps is their superparamagnetic character below 10 nanometers the superparamagnetism of fept nps has made them attractive candidates to be used as mri ct scanning agents and a high density recording material the various properties of iron platinum nanoparticles allow them to function in multiple ways in standard conditions fept nps exist in the face centered cubic phase with a 3 to 10 nanometer diameter however once heat is added the structure becomes a face centered tetragonal and superparamagnetic the nanoparticles become superparamagnetic because the addition of heat makes the particle smaller and iron rich since it removes any impurities in the particles as a result the nanoparticles are used in ct or mri scans plant viruses known as cowpea mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus enlarge the average radius of the fept nps through direct mineralization the virus

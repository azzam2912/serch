its fossils are found in rocks dating from the campanian and maastrichtian stages it thus lived between about and million years ago its mesozoic suborder the sclerorhynchoidea cannot be unequivocally assigned to the rajiformes skate and ray or to the pristiformes sawfish order due to its unique rostral teeth schizorhiza is placed in the monotypic subfamily schizorhizinae like all sclerorhynchoidea it probably did not survive the cretaceous paleogene extinction event there are a few remains from the paleogene but these seem to have been reworked from late cretaceous deposits schizorhiza is unique among all saw snouted elasmobranchii in that its rostral teeth did not fall off as they are replaced rather they remain in place with the new teeth under them until they are worn off thus the rostrum s edge had a continuous serrated cover of tooth enamel full grown rostral teeth measured less than in other sclerorhynchoidea let alone sawfishes at 1 2 cm tall and 4 8 mm wide they had a small triangular or rhomboidal shape at the tip with sharp cutting edges and a long forked peduncle each lobe of which divides into four lobelets proximally the new teeth developed inside the peduncular fork the

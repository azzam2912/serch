the patient is localized in the treatment room in the same position as planned from the reference imaging dataset an example of igrt would include localization of a cone beam computed tomography cbct dataset with the planning computed tomography ct dataset from planning igrt would also include matching planar kilovoltage kv radiographs or megavoltage mv images with digital reconstructed radiographs drrs from the planning ct these two methods comprise the bulk of igrt strategies currently employed circa 2013 this process is distinct from the use of imaging to delineate targets and organs in the planning process of radiation therapy however there is clearly a connection between the imaging processes as igrt relies directly on the imaging modalities from planning as the reference coordinates for localizing the patient the variety of medical imaging technologies used in planning includes x ray computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri and positron emission tomography pet among others the precision of igrt is significantly improved when n localizer technology is used in conjunction with these medical imaging technologies through advancements in imaging technology combined with a further understanding of human biology at the molecular level the impact of igrt on radiotherapy treatment continues to evolve

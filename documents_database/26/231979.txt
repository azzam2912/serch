let l be a variable line passing through o and intersecting c at p and c at p let p be the point on l so that op p p there are actually two such points but p is chosen so that p is in the same direction from o as p is from p then the locus of such points p is defined to be the cissoid of the curves c c relative to o slightly different but essentially equivalent definitions are used by different authors for example p may be defined to be the point so that op op op this is equivalent to the other definition if c is replaced by its reflection through o or p may be defined as the midpoint of p and p this produces the curve generated by the previous curve scaled by a factor of 1 2 the word cissoid comes from the from ivy and having the likeness of if c and c are given in polar coordinates by formula 1 and formula 2 respectively then the equation formula 3 describes the cissoid of c and c relative to the origin however because a point may be represented in multiple

his brother gary taubes is a science writer taubes received his ph d in physics in 1980 under the direction of arthur jaffe having proven results collected in about the existence of solutions to the landau ginzburg vortex equations and the bogomol nyi monopole equations soon he began applying his gauge theoretic expertise to pure mathematics his work on the boundary of the moduli space of solutions to the yang mills equations was used by simon donaldson in his proof of donaldson s theorem he proved in that r has an uncountable number of smooth structures see also exotic r and with raoul bott in proved witten s rigidity theorem on the elliptic genus in a series of four long papers in the 1990s collected in taubes proved that on a closed symplectic four manifold the gauge theoretic seiberg witten invariant is equal to an invariant which enumerates certain pseudoholomorphic curves and is now known as taubes s gromov invariant this fact has transformed mathematicians understanding of the topology of symplectic four manifolds more recently in by using seiberg witten floer homology as developed by peter kronheimer and tomasz mrowka together with some new estimates on the spectral flow of

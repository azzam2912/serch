state of florida before drainage the everglades were an interwoven mesh of marshes and prairies covering the everglades is simultaneously a vast watershed that has historically extended from lake okeechobee south to florida bay around one third of the southern florida peninsula and many interconnected ecosystems within a geographic boundary it is such a unique meeting of water land and climate that the use of either singular or plural to refer to the everglades is appropriate when marjory stoneman douglas wrote her definitive description of the region in 1947 she used the metaphor river of grass to explain the blending of water and plant life although sawgrass and sloughs are the enduring geographical icons of the everglades other ecosystems are just as vital and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs the trees rooted in soil inches above the peat marl or water support a variety of wildlife the oldest and tallest trees are cypresses whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater for months at a time the big cypress swamp is well known for its 500 year old cypresses though cypress domes can appear throughout the everglades

halberstam richert write diamond halberstam attribute the terminology fundamental lemma to jonas kubilius we use these notations this formulation is from tenenbaum other formulations are in halberstam richert in greaves and in friedlander iwaniec we make the assumptions there is a parameter u 1 that is at our disposal we have uniformly in a x z and u that in applications we pick u to get the best error term in the sieve it represents the number of levels of the inclusion exclusion principle this formulation is from halberstam richert another formulation is in diamond halberstam we make the assumptions the fundamental lemma has almost the same form as for the combinatorial sieve write u ln x ln z the conclusion is note that u is no longer an independent parameter at our disposal but is controlled by the choice of z note that the error term here is weaker than for the fundamental lemma of the combinatorial sieve halberstam richert remark thus it is not true to say as has been asserted from time to time in the literature that selberg s sieve is always better than brun s

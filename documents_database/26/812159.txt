in technical terms the process is a photomechanical rather than a photographic one because sensitivity to light plays no role in the actual printing the process produces very high quality continuous tone images in monochrome with surfaces that show a slight relief effect essentially a woodburytype is a molded copy of an original photographic carbon print the process was introduced by the english photographer walter b woodbury and was in use during the final third of the 19th century most commonly for illustrating fine books with photographic portraits it was ultimately displaced by halftone processes that produced prints of lower quality but were much cheaper a dichromate sensitized sheet of gelatin is exposed to uv rich light through a photographic negative causing each area of the gelatin to harden to a depth proportional to the amount of exposure it is then soaked in warm water to dissolve the unhardened portion of the gelatin the resulting relief image is pressed into a thick sheet of lead under about 5000 pounds per square inch of pressure this creates an intaglio metal printing plate which is used as a mold it is filled with liquid pigmented gelatin and a sheet of paper is

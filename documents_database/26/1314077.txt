it is a redox titration that involves the use of permanganates to measure the amount of analyte present in unknown chemical samples it involves two steps namely the titration of the analyte with potassium permanganate solution and then the standardization of potassium permanganate solution with standard sodium oxalate solution the titration involves volumetric manipulations to prepare the analyte solutions depending on how the titration is performed the permanganate ion is reduced to mn where x is 2 3 4 or 6 using permanganometry we can estimate the quantitative presence of fe mn fe and mn when they are both present in a mixture co no ho etc in most cases permanganometry is performed in a very acidic solution in which the following reaction occurs mno4 8h 5e mn 2 4h2o the standard potential of this electrochemical reaction is e 1 51 v which shows that kmno in an acidic medium is a very strong oxidizing agent with this method we can oxidize and even in weak acidic medium mno can not accept 5 electrons to form mn this time it accepts only 3 electrons and forms mno s by the following electrochemical reaction mno4 4h 3e mno2 2h2o the standard

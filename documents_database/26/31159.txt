programming started in 1978 and the first version was delivered in 1982 it was never widely used and essentially disappeared soon after the division was shut down in 1985 possibly because ibm and other companies settled on sql as the standard bs12 s lasting contribution to history was the use of a new query language based on isbl created at ibm s uk scientific centre developers of the famous system r underway in the us at the same time were also consulted on certain matters concerning the engine but the bs12 team rejected sql unequivocally being convinced that this apparently unsound and difficult to use language which at that time was also relationally incomplete would never catch on bs12 included a number of interesting features that have yet to appear on most sql based systems some a consequence of following the isbl precedent others due to deliberate design for instance a view could be parameterised and parameters could be of type table thus a view could in effect be a new relational operator defined in terms of the existing operators codd s divide operator was in fact implemented that way another feature that could have easily been included in sql

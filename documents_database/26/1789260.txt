it was named by the english anatomist and paleontologist thomas henry huxley in 1871 as an order other names which were once considered equivalent to protorosauria include prolacertiformes and prolacertilia protorosaurs are distinguished by their long necks formed by elongated cervical vertebrae which have ribs that extend backward to the vertebrae behind them protorosaurs also have a gap between the quadrate bones and the jugal bones in the back of the skull near the jaw joint making their skulls resemble those of lizards protorosauria was considered to be a synonym of prolacertiformes for many years since 1998 many phylogenetic analyses have found protorosauria as used in its widest sense to be a polyphyletic or paraphyletic taxon protorosaurus macrocnemus tanystropheids and various other protorosaurs are usually placed near the base of archosauromorpha while prolacerta and pamelaria two gondwanan triassic protorosaurs are now thought to be in a more derived position as close relatives of archosauriformes most phylogenetic analyses since 1998 have found a strongly supported clade that includes only the genus prolacerta and the archosauriformes for this reason prolacerta pamelaria and several other related forms collectively called prolacertids have been removed from protorosauria because the name prolacertiformes is defined based on

it is similar to fiberglass having better physicomechanical properties than fiberglass but being significantly cheaper than carbon fiber it is used as a fireproof textile in the aerospace and automotive industries and can also be used as a composite to produce products such as camera tripods the technology of production of bcf basalt continuous fiber is a one stage process melting homogenization of basalt and extraction of fibers basalt is heated only once further processing of bcf into materials is carried out using cold technologies with low energy costs basalt fiber is made from a single material crushed basalt from a carefully chosen quarry source basalt of high acidity over 46 silica content and low iron content is considered desirable for fiber production unlike with other composites such as glass fiber essentially no materials are added during its production the basalt is simply washed and then melted the manufacture of basalt fiber requires the melting of the crushed and washed basalt rock at about the molten rock is then extruded through small nozzles to produce continuous filaments of basalt fiber the basalt fibers typically have a filament diameter of between 10 and 20 m which is far enough above the

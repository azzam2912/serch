usually this problem is studied with the hamming distance in mind more formally given n length m strings s s s the closest string problem seeks for a new length m string s such that d s s k for all i where d denotes the hamming distance and where k is as small as possible a decision problem version of the closest string problem which is np complete instead takes k as another input and questions whether there is a string within hamming distance k of all the input strings the closest string problem can be seen as a special case of the generic 1 center problem in which the distances between elements are measured using hamming distance in bioinformatics the closest string problem is an intensively studied facet of the problem of finding signals in dna instances of closest string may contain information that is not essential to the problem in some sense the usual input of closest string contains information that does not contribute to the hardness of the problem for example if some strings contain the character a but none contains the character z replacing all a s with z s would yield an essentially equivalent

cd14 exists in two forms one anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol tail mcd14 the other a soluble form scd14 soluble cd14 either appears after shedding of mcd14 48 kda or is directly secreted from intracellular vesicles 56 kda the x ray crystal structure of human cd14 4glp pdb reveals a monomeric bent solenoid structure containing a hydrophobic amino terminal pocket cd14 was the first described pattern recognition receptor cd14 acts as a co receptor along with the toll like receptor tlr 4 and md 2 for the detection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide lps cd14 can bind lps only in the presence of lipopolysaccharide binding protein lbp although lps is considered its main ligand cd14 also recognizes other pathogen associated molecular patterns such as lipoteichoic acid cd14 is expressed mainly by macrophages and at 10 times lesser extent by neutrophils it is also expressed by dendritic cells the soluble form of the receptor scd14 is secreted by the liver and monocytes and is sufficient in low concentrations to confer lps responsiveness to cells not expressing cd14 mcd14 and scd14 are also present on enterocytes reference 12 is incomplete scd14 is also present in human milk where it is believed to

this type of modifying rna is usually located in the nucleolus of the eukaryotic cell which is a major site of snrna biogenesis it is known as a small nucleolar rna snorna and also often referred to as a guide rna snord116 belongs to the c d box class of snornas which contain the conserved sequence motifs known as the c box ugauga and the d box cuga most of the members of the box c d family function in directing site specific 2 o methylation of substrate rnas in the human genome there are 29 tandemnly repeated copies of snord116 followed by 48 copies of another c d box snorna snord115 in the prader willi syndrome pws region of chromosome 15 unlike most other snornas snord116 is expressed prevalently in the brain but is absent in pws patients and lacks any significant complementarity with ribosomal rna mouse models of pws show similar symptoms to humans hyperphagia and growth deficiency providing further evidence that pws is directly linked to the deletion of snord116 more evidence comes from the discovery of two individuals that share many traits of pws sufferers both have atypical microdeletions on chromosome 15q11 13 the intersection of

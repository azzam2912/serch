the original fossils were ascribed to a new species meganthropus palaeojavanicus and while it is commonly considered invalid today the genus name has survived as an informal name for the fossils as of 2005 the taxonomy and phylogeny for the specimens are still uncertain although most paleoanthropologists consider them related to homo erectus in some way however the names homo palaeojavanicus and even australopithecus palaeojavanicus are sometimes used as well indicating the classification uncertainty after the discovery of a robust skull in swartkrans in 1948 sk48 the name meganthropus africanus was briefly applied however that specimen is now formally known as paranthropus robustus and the earlier name is a junior synonym some of these finds were accompanied by evidence of tool use similar to that of homo erectus this is the reason meganthropus is often linked with that species as h e palaeojavanicus the number of fossil finds has been relatively small and it is a distinct possibility that they are a paraphyletic assemblage due to this they will be discussed in detail separately this large jaw fragment was first found in 1941 by gustav von koenigswald koenigswald was captured by the japanese in world war ii but managed to

the simplest case in euclidean geometry is the intersection of two distinct lines which either is one point or does not exist if the lines are parallel determination of the intersection of flats linear geometric objects embedded in a higher dimensional space is a simple task of linear algebra namely the solution of a system of linear equations in general the determination of an intersection leads to non linear equations which can be solved numerically for example using newton iteration intersection problems between a line and a conic section circle ellipse parabola etc or a quadric sphere cylinder hyperboloid etc lead to quadratic equations that can be easily solved intersections between quadrics lead to quartic equations that can be solved algebraically for the determination of the intersection point of two non parallel lines one gets from cramer s rule or by substituting out a variable the coordinates of the intersection point formula 2 for two non parallel line segments formula 5 and formula 6 there is not necessarily an intersection point see diagram because the intersection point formula 7 of the corresponding lines need not to be contained in the line segments in order to check the situation one uses

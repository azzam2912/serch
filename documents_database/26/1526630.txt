species of typhula are saprotrophic mostly decomposing leaves twigs and herbaceous material basidiocarps fruit bodies are club shaped or narrowly cylindrical and are simple not branched often arising from sclerotia the anamorphic genus sclerotium is in its modern sense a synonym of typhula a few species are facultative plant pathogens causing a number of commercially important crop and turfgrass diseases the genus was first introduced as a section of clavaria by south african born mycologist christiaan hendrik persoon in 1801 he differentiated typhula from clavaria on the basis of fruitbody shape typhula having a distinct head and stem the name was taken up at generic level by elias magnus fries in 1818 fries described four species in the genus including the type species typhula phacorrhiza subsequent authors described another 150 or so species in typhula the genus was revised in 1950 by e j h corner who characterized typhula species as having fruit bodies arising from sclerotia the genera pistillaria and pistillina accommodating similar species lacking sclerotia a later and more specialist revision by jacques berthier 1976 placed both these latter genera in synonymy no later taxonomic studies have been published though dna sequences of the type species have indicated

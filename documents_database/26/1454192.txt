this uranium actually makes up the bulk of the material separated during reprocessing commercial lwr spent nuclear fuel contains on average excluding cladding only four percent plutonium minor actinides and fission products by weight reuse of reprocessed uranium has not been common because of low prices in the uranium market of recent decades and because it contains undesirable isotopes of uranium given sufficiently high uranium prices it is feasible for reprocessed uranium to be re enriched and reused a higher enrichment level is required to compensate for the u which is lighter than u and therefore concentrates in the enriched product also if fast breeder reactors ever come into commercial use reprocessed uranium like depleted uranium will be usable in their breeding blankets there have been some studies involving the use of reprocessed uranium in candu reactors candu is designed to use natural uranium as fuel the u 235 content remaining in spent pwr bwr fuel is typically greater than that found in natural uranium which is about 0 72 u 235 allowing the re enrichment step to be skipped fuel cycle tests also have included the dupic direct use of spent pwr fuel in candu fuel cycle where used

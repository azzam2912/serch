some dependoparvoviruses are also known as adeno associated viruses because they cannot replicate productively in their host cell without the cell being coinfected by a helper virus such as an adenovirus a herpesvirus or a vaccinia virus there are currently seven recognized species in the genus dependoparvoviruses have an icosahedral shape measure 22 nm is composed of 60 wedge shaped proteins triangulation number 1 three proteins vp1 vp2 and vp3 are present in each capsomere each capsid is made from 5 vp1 5 vp2 and 50 vp3 proteins the capsid does not have an envelope the genome is a single molecule of single stranded with a length of 4 7 kilobases it has only two open reading frames the 3 open reading frame is the structural capsid protein cap which can be spliced to form two rnas one for virion protein 1 vp1 and the other goes on to eventually make vp2 and vp3 the second gene rep can be spliced into four different nonstructural regulatory proteins that all aid in the genome replication these proteins are named rep 78 rep68 rep 52 and rep 40 based on their molecular weight due to inverted terminal repeats itrs at each end

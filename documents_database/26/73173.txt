at the speed of sound in air is about or a kilometre in or a mile in it depends strongly on temperature but also varies by several metres per second depending on which gases exist in the medium through which a soundwave is propagating the speed of sound in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature and composition the speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air deviating slightly from ideal behavior in common everyday speech speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air however the speed of sound varies from substance to substance sound travels most slowly in gases it travels faster in liquids and faster still in solids for example as noted above sound travels at in air it travels at in water 4 3 times as fast as in air and at in iron about 15 times as fast as in air in an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond sound travels at about 35 times as fast as in airwhich is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions sound waves in solids are composed of compression waves just as in gases and liquids

the technique involves cutting the long wire into one or more short wires and inserting a repeater between each new pair of short wires the time it takes for a signal to travel from one end of a wire to the other end is known as wire line delay or just delay in an integrated circuit this delay is characterized by rc the resistance of the wire r multiplied by the wire s capacitance c thus if the wire s resistance is 100 ohms and its capacitance is 0 01 microfarad f the wire s delay is one microsecond s to first order the resistance of a wire on an integrated circuit is directly proportional or linear according to the wire s length if a 1 mm length of the wire has 100 ohms resistance then a 2 mm length will have 200 ohms resistance for the purposes of our highly simplified discussion the capacitance of a wire also increases linearly along its length if a 1 mm length of the wire has 0 01 f capacitance a 2 mm length of the wire will have 0 02 f a 3 mm wire will have 0 03 f and so

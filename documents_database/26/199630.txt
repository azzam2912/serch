when the tube narrows the fluid pressure decreases in this narrow area the fluid velocity must increase to conserve mass continuity where the tube narrows a vacuum is drawn because of the venturi effect the cheap and simple water aspirator is the most common type of aspirator it is used in chemistry and biology laboratories and consists of a tee fitting attached to a tap and has a hose barb at one side the flow of water passes through the straight portion of the tee which has a restriction at the intersection where the hose barb is attached the vacuum hose should be connected to this barb in the past water aspirators were common for low strength vacuums in chemistry benchwork however they are water intensive and depending on what the vacuum is being used for i e solvent removal they can violate environmental protection laws such as the rcra by mixing potentially hazardous chemicals into the water stream then flushing them down a drain that often leads directly to the municipal sewer if a liquid is used as the working fluid the strength of the vacuum produced is limited by the vapor pressure of the liquid for water or

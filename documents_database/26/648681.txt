the minerals are removed by a process known as leaching when organic material is broken down nutrients are released but at the same time organic acids are released these organic acids are known as chelating agents many podsol soils form underneath coniferous forests the fact that pine trees are evergreen causes a very thin litter layer inhibiting the production of humus as a result an acidic ph 4 5 mor humus is produced which provides a greater amount of chelating agents in podsolisation chelating agents break down clay and release minerals such as iron and aluminium when iron and aluminium are hydrated they become sesquioxides the sesquioxides are translocated from the a horizon a zone of out washing to the b horizon a zone of illuviation many bases such as calcium and potassium are also leached from the zone along with organic matter and silica often minerals like quartz and silica are left behind in the a horizon what is significantly different about podsols in comparison to other soils is that the bottom of a horizon is known as the ae horizon which is an eluviated area which has lost sesquioxides it tends to be an ash gray colour the

the operating system had logic to queue pending i o on each channel and to handle selection of alternate channels initiating an i o to a channel on a different processor required causing a shoulder tap interrupt on the other processor so that it could initiate the i o starting with the ibm 3081 and ibm 4381 in s 370 extended architecture mode ibm changed the i o architecture to allow the channel subsystem to handle the channel scheduling that the operating system had to handle in s 370 mode the new i o architecture used a 16 bit channel path id chpid the channel subsystem was responsible for mapping the chpid to the channel and device numbers for queuing i o requests and for selecting from the available paths the installation was responsible for defining the input output configuration data sets iocds s and the operator could select a specific iocds as part of a power on reset por input output configuration program iocp is a program for ibm mainframes that compiles a description of the channel subsystem and lpar configuration optionally loading it into an input output configuration data set iocds it recognizes the syntax of mvs configuration

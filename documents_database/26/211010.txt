from satellites pmcs are most frequently observed above 70 75 in latitude and have a season of 60 to 80 days duration centered about a peak which occurs about 20 days after the summer solstice this holds true for both hemispheres great variability in scattering is observed from day to day and year to year but averaging over large time and space scales reveals a basic underlying symmetry and pattern the long term behaviour of polar mesospheric cloud frequency has been found to vary inversely with solar activity pmc s have four major types based on physical structure and appearance type i veils are very tenuous and lack well defined structure somewhat like cirrostratus or poorly defined cirrus type ii bands are long streaks that often occur in groups arranged roughly parallel to each other they are usually more widely spaced than the bands or elements seen with cirrocumulus clouds type iii billows are arrangements of closely spaced roughly parallel short streaks that mostly resemble cirrus type iv whirls are partial or more rarely complete rings of cloud with dark centres when mesospheric clouds are viewed above the atmosphere the geometrical limitations of observing from the ground are significantly reduced

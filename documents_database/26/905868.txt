among sauropods camarasaurids are small to medium sized with relatively short necks they are visually identifiable by a short skull with large nares and broad spatulate teeth filling a thick jaw based on cervical vertebrae and cervical rib biomechanics camarasaurids most likely moved their necks in a vertical rather than horizontal sweeping motion in contrast to most diplodocids cladistically they are defined to be all sauropods more closely related to camarasaurus supremus than to saltasaurus loricatus several skeletal features have been used to characterize the camarasaurids in the skull these include an external narial diameter approximately 40 of the long axis length of the skull an arched internarial bar a short muzzle anterior to the nares and maxillary shelf in the rest of the axial skeleton these include flat ventral faces on the cervical vertebrae a triangular flare to the neural spines of the middle and posterior dorsal vertebrae and a concave posterior surface to the anterior thoracic ribs as well as an external haemal canal across the anterior vertebrae of the tail a reduction to two carpals long metacarpals relative to the radius and a twisted ischial shaft serve to identify the appendicular skeleton broadly speaking camarasaurids occupied a

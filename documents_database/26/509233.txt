it has been described by ingo wegener as the most important result in complexity theory since cook s theorem and by oded goldreich as a culmination of a sequence of impressive works rich in innovative ideas the pcp theorem states that an alternative formulation of the pcp theorem states that the maximum fraction of satisfiable constraints of a constraint satisfaction problem is np hard to approximate within some constant factor formally for some constants k and promise problem l l is an np hard decision problem where is a constraint satisfaction problem over boolean alphabet with at most k variables per constraint as a consequence of this theorem it can be shown that the solutions to many natural optimization problems including maximum boolean formula satisfiability maximum independent set in graphs and the shortest vector problem for lattices cannot be approximated efficiently unless p np these results are sometimes also called pcp theorems because they can be viewed as probabilistically checkable proofs for np with some additional structure a proof of a weaker result np pcp n 1 is given in one of the lecture of dexter kozen the pcp theorem is the culmination of a long line of work on

older equipment may be difficult to replace or upgrade because of cost requirement for continuous availability or unavailable upgrades proper operation may require operating system software and data to be read and written from and to floppies forcing users to maintain floppy drives on supporting systems floppy disks and floppy drives are gradually going out of production and replacement of malfunctioning drives and the systems hosting them is becoming increasingly difficult floppy disks themselves are fragile or may need to be replaced often an alternative is to use a floppy disk hardware emulator a device which appears to be a standard floppy drive to the old equipment by interfacing directly to the floppy disk controller while storing data in another medium such as a usb thumb drive secure digital card or a shared drive on a computer network emulators can also be used as a higher performance replacement for mechanical floppy disk drives a typical floppy disk controller sends an mfm fm gcr encoded signal to the drive to write data and expects a similar signal returned when reading the drive on a write a hardware pll or a software based filter component undoes the encoding and stores the sector

now the machine starts simulating m 3 transitions of m using six of its own transitions in this concrete case there will be no speed up but in general m can be much larger than six let the configurations of m and n be where the bold symbols indicate the head position the state of n is formula 8 now the following happens thus the state of n becomes formula 11 initialization requires 2n 3 steps in the simulation 6 steps of n simulate m steps of m choosing m 6c produces the running time formula 12

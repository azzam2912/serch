the exact interpretation depends upon the use instructions is traditionally taken to mean machine code instructions for a physical cpu in some contexts a file containing bytecode or scripting language instructions may also be considered executable executable files can be hand coded in machine language although it is far more convenient to develop software as source code in a high level language that can be easily understood by humans in some cases source code might be specified in assembly language instead which remains human readable while being closely associated with machine code instructions the high level language is compiled into either an executable machine code file or a non executable machine code object file of some sort the equivalent process on assembly language source code is called assembly several object files are linked to create the executable object files executable or not are typically in a container format such as executable and linkable format elf this structures the generated machine code for example dividing it into sections such as the text executable code data static variables and rodata static constants in order to be executed by the system such as an operating system firmware or boot loader an executable file

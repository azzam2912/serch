polling is most often used in terms of input output and is also referred to as polled or software driven polling is the process where the computer or controlling device waits for an external device to check for its readiness or state often with low level hardware for example when a printer is connected via a parallel port the computer waits until the printer has received the next character these processes can be as minute as only reading one bit his is sometimes used synonymously with busy wait polling in this situation when an operation is required the computer does nothing other than check the status of the device until it is ready at which point the device is accessed in other words the computer waits until the device is ready polling also refers to the situation where a device is repeatedly checked for readiness and if it is not the computer returns to a different task although not as wasteful of cpu cycles as busy waiting this is generally not as efficient as the alternative to polling interrupt driven in a simple single purpose system even busy wait is perfectly appropriate if no action is possible until the access

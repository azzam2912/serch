the boat is capable of a certain maximum speed and the goal is to derive the best possible control to reach formula 2 in the least possible time without considering external forces such as current and wind the optimal control is for the boat to always head towards formula 2 its path then is a line segment from formula 1 to formula 2 which is trivially optimal with consideration of current and wind if the combined force applied to the boat is non zero the control for no current and wind does not yield the optimal path in his 1931 article ernst zermelo formulates the following problem this is an extension of the classical optimisation problem for geodesics minimising the length of a curve formula 7 connecting points formula 8 and formula 9 with the added complexity of considering some wind velocity although it is usually impossible to find an exact solution in most cases the general case was solved by zermelo himself in the form of a partial differential equation known as zermelo s equation which can be numerically solved the case of constant wind is easy to solve exactly let formula 10 and suppose that to minimise the

members of the pcdd family bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife because of their lipophilic properties and may cause developmental disturbances and cancer dioxins occur as by products in the manufacture of some organochlorides in the incineration of chlorine containing substances such as polyvinyl chloride pvc in the chlorine bleaching of paper and from natural sources such as volcanoes and forest fires there have been many incidents of dioxin pollution resulting from industrial emissions and accidents the earliest such incidents were in the mid 19th century during the industrial revolution the word dioxins may also refer to other similarly acting chlorinated compounds see dioxins and dioxin like compounds the structure of dibenzo 1 4 dioxin consists of two benzene rings joined by two oxygen bridges this makes the compound an aromatic diether the name dioxin formally refers to the central dioxygenated ring which is stabilized by the two flanking benzene rings in pcdds chlorine atoms are attached to this structure at any of 8 different places on the molecule at positions 1 4 and 6 9 there are 75 different pcdd congeners that is related dioxin compounds the toxicity of pcdds depends on the number and positions of the chlorine atoms

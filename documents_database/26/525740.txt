each of these courts has a moderator and a clerk the moderator presides over the meeting of the court much as a convener presides over the meeting of a church committee the moderator is thus the chairperson and is understood to be a member of the court acting primus inter pares the moderator calls and constitutes meetings presides at them and closes them in prayer the moderator has a casting vote but not a deliberative vote during a meeting the title moderator is used by all other members of the court as a form of address but this is not done outwith the meetings this convention expresses deference to the authority of the court rather than an honour for the moderator as an individual the kirk session is the governing court of a parish the moderator is usually the parish minister during a vacancy the presbytery appoints an interim moderator usually the minister of a neighbouring parish or a retired minister although suitably trained elders may also moderate kirk sessions the moderator is answerable to the presbytery not to the kirk session for his or her conduct in the court the presbytery is the governing court of the local area

since 2007 fermilab has been operated by the fermi research alliance a joint venture of the university of chicago and the universities research association ura fermilab is a part of the illinois technology and research corridor fermilab s tevatron was a landmark particle accelerator until the startup in 2008 of the large hadron collider lhc near geneva switzerland it was the most powerful particle accelerator in the world accelerating antiprotons to energies of 500 gev and producing proton proton collisions with energies of up to 1 6 tev the first accelerator to reach one tera electron volt energy at it was the world s fourth largest particle accelerator in circumference one of its most important achievements was the 1995 discovery of the top quark announced by research teams using the tevatron s cdf and d detectors it was shut down in 2011 in addition to high energy collider physics fermilab hosts fixed target and neutrino experiments such as microboone micro booster neutrino experiment no a numi off axis appearance and seaquest completed neutrino experiments include minos main injector neutrino oscillation search minos miniboone and sciboone scibar booster neutrino experiment the miniboone detector was a diameter sphere containing 800 tons of

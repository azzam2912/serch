if there exists a point x y on the projectivized curve there is a corresponding pair b c of rational numbers such that the trinomial polynomial either factors or has galois group psl 2 7 the finite simple group of order 168 the curve has genus two and so by faltings theorem there are only a finite number of rational points on it these rational points were proven by nils bruin using the computer program kash to be the only ones on c and they give only four distinct trinomial polynomials with galois group psl 2 7 x 7x 3 the trinks polynomial 1 11 x 14x 3 the erbach fisher mckay polynomial and two new polynomials with galois group psl 2 7 and on the other hand the equation of curve c is once again the genus is two and by faltings theorem the list of rational points is finite it is thought the only rational points on it correspond to polynomials x 16x 28 x 576x 1008 1953x 19x 2 which have galois group al 8 and x 324x 567 which comes from two different rational points and has galois group psl 2 7 again this time as

the song was written by alan parsons and eric woolfson and features chris rainbow on lead vocals the lyrics are from the perspective of a compulsive gambler playing craps who doesn t intend to stop until he wins in an interview eric woolfson said of the song i ve often in common with many other writers been inspired at the oddest moments and one of the things that did start the creative juices flowing was actually sitting in casinos in monte carlo with the din going on of people with machines people talking people moving about and all the hustle and bustle that goes on there the joke about the lyric of snake eyes is that he s betting on something that you can t possibly win because snake eyes is a bet which loses if seven or eleven comes up and seven or eleven is a bet which loses if snake eyes comes up so he s yelling snake eyes seven eleven he wants any one of the three and any of the three is gonna wipe him out

translation of this fusion gene results in a single or multiple polypeptides with functional properties derived from each of the original proteins recombinant fusion proteins are created artificially by recombinant dna technology for use in biological research or therapeutics chimeric or chimera usually designate hybrid proteins made of polypeptides having different functions or physico chemical patterns chimeric mutant proteins occur naturally when a complex mutation such as a chromosomal translocation tandem duplication or retrotransposition creates a novel coding sequence containing parts of the coding sequences from two different genes naturally occurring fusion proteins are commonly found in cancer cells where they may function as oncoproteins the bcr abl fusion protein is a well known example of an oncogenic fusion protein and is considered to be the primary oncogenic driver of chronic myelogenous leukemia some fusion proteins combine whole peptides and therefore contain all functional domains of the original proteins however other fusion proteins especially those that occur naturally combine only portions of coding sequences and therefore do not maintain the original functions of the parental genes that formed them many whole gene fusions are fully functional and can still act to replace the original peptides some however experience interactions between

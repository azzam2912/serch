it is related to and anticipated by a number of years the google tensor processing unit it is designed to run as a co processor with another controller such as a cpu x86 or an arm mips tensilica core it was developed as the culmination of darpa s analog logic program the gp5 has a fairly exotic architecture resembling neither a gpu nor a dsp and leverages massive fine grained and coarse grained parallelism it is deeply pipelined the different algorithmic tasks involved in performing belief propagation updates are performed by independent heterogeneous compute units the performance of the chip is governed by the structure of the machine learning workload being evaluated in typical cases the gp5 is roughly 100 times faster and 100 times more energy efficient than a single core of a modern core i7 performing a comparable task it is roughly 10 times faster and 1000 times more energy efficient than a state of the art gpu it is roughly 1000 times faster and 10 times more energy efficient than a state of the art arm processor it was benchmarked on typical machine learning and inference workloads that included protein side chain folding turbo error correction decoding

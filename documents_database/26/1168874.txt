it was constructed by the brothers armand and henri dufaux who had previously experimented with a model helicopter this new aircraft incorporated a feature far ahead of its time the concept of a tiltrotor based on what they had learned from their helicopter the dufaux brothers hoped to generate vertical as well as horizontal thrust from their engine installation and conceived of an aircraft where the engine and propeller would be mounted at the centre of the airframe and would be able to pivot 180 to provide forward upward and even backward thrust the latter to assist in braking experiments with a boxkite fitted with an engine in 1905 proved promising so construction of a full scale aircraft proceeded the resulting machine featured two sets of triplane wings in tandem with the engine installation between them followed by a biplane tail unit with a span almost equal to that of the wings there was no fin but all eight flying surfaces had a marked dihedral and the fuselage was open framework a large and heavy aircraft for its day it immediately posed a problem to the brothers in trying to find a field large enough to test it in since

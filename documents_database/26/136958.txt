family members have very small fore limbs and lack hind limbs altogether in one species the skeleton in their fore limbs is made of only cartilage in contrast to most other salamanders they have external gills bunched together on the neck in both larval and adult states sirens are found only in the southeastern united states and northern mexico although they are primarily carnivorous they are the only salamanders observed eating plant material sirens are quite distinct from other salamanders and in some classifications they form their own suborder sirenoidea or as a completely distinct order meantes or trachystomata genetic analysis variously places them as the sister to other salamandroidea or as sister to all other salamanders many of their unique characteristics seem to be partly primitive and partly derivative sirens are generally eel like in form with two tiny but otherwise fully developed fore limbs they range from in length they are neotenic although the larval gills are small and functionless at first and only adults have fully developed gills because of this sirens most likely have evolved from a terrestrial ancestor that still had an aquatic larval stage like amphiumas they are able to cross land on rainy

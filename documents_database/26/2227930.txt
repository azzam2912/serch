trifluoramine oxide was first discovered in 1966 independently by two different groups one way to produce it was by an electric discharge in a mixture of oxygen on nitrogen trifluoride another even less yielding method is by reacting noble metal fluorides irf or ptf with nitric oxide it is separated by distillation and can be purified by treating it with potassium hydroxide solution which reacts with the other fluorine containing molecules produced an alternate way to produce it is by burning nitric acid in fluorine followed by rapid cooling yet another way is the photochemical reaction of fluorine and nitrosyl fluoride f fno fno this reaction can also happen with heat but hot fluorine is hard to contain without a reaction with the container yet another production route is to thermally decompose nitrosyl hexafluoronickelate no nif onf onf fno is a colourless gas at standard conditions it has a critical temperature of 29 5 c where the density is 0 593 g cm critical pressure is about 64 atmospheres trifluoramine oxide has a trouton s constant of 20 7 heat of vapourisation at the boiling point is 3 85 kcal mol the fno molecule has c symmetry with all the

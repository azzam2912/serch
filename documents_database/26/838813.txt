they are of interest in transcendental number theory and are more special than g functions a function f x is called of type e or an e function if the power series satisfies the following three conditions where the left hand side represents the maximum of the absolute values of all the algebraic conjugates of c the second condition implies that f is an entire function of x e functions were first studied by siegel in 1929 he found a method to show that the values taken by certain e functions were algebraically independent this was a result which established the algebraic independence of classes of numbers rather than just linear independence since then these functions have proved somewhat useful in number theory and in particular they have application in transcendence proofs and differential equations perhaps the main result connected to e functions is the siegel shidlovsky theorem also known as the shidlovsky and shidlovskii theorem named after carl ludwig siegel and andrei borisovich shidlovskii suppose that we are given n e functions e x e x that satisfy a system of homogeneous linear differential equations where the f are rational functions of x and the coefficients of each e

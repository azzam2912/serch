this can arise as a result of a mutation in a gene encoding a synaptic protein such as an ion channel neurotransmitter receptor or a protein involved in neurotransmitter release it can also arise as a result of an autoantibody targeting a synaptic protein synaptopathies caused by ion channel mutations are also known as synaptic channelopathies an example is episodic ataxia myasthenia gravis is an example of an autoimmune synaptopathy some toxins also affect synaptic function tetanus toxin and botulinum toxin affect neurotransmitter release tetanus toxin can enter the body via a wound and botulinum toxin can be ingested or administered therapeutically to alleviate dystonia or as cosmetic treatment another example of synaptopathy occurs in the auditory system this cochlear synaptopathy has been seen after prolonged noise exposure in both primate and non primate models two possible reasons for this neuronal death are both glutamate mediated excitotoxicity in the postsynaptic terminal and presynaptic ribbon damage which occurs by an unknown mechanism synaptopathies are attracting research interest because they provide an insight into fundamental mechanisms of synaptic transmission and because an improved understanding of disease mechanisms may lead to new treatments some diseases of unknown etiology have been proposed to be

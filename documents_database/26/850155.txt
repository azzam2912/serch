the species is poorly studied and the species risk of extinction has not been evaluated by the world conservation union and does not appear in any cites appendix the skink has developed setae on its toe pads or digit pads for climbing analogous to those of geckos and anoles but the trait is believed to have evolved independently to these groups so is an example of convergent evolution with regards to the trait other species in the genus p flavipes and p prehensicauda have the primitive character and lack the setae other skinks within the genus lipinia have also evolved toe pad setae and within the skink family four morphologically distinct adhesive microstructures have evolved possibly all with independent evolutionary origins by contrast anoles and geckos each use a single common structure although it appears to have evolved independently in the two groups as in other lizards of the genus prasinohaema the blood of p virens is green rather than the usual red coloration of most vertebrates the green blood pigmentation results in a strikingly bright lime green coloration of muscles bones tongue and mucosal tissue and is the result of the accumulation of the bile pigment biliverdin in levels

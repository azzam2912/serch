it is a combination of an exhaust driven turbocharger and a mechanically driven supercharger each mitigating the weaknesses of the other a mechanically driven supercharger offers exceptional response and low rpm performance as it does not rely on pressurization of the exhaust manifold assuming that it is a positive displacement supercharger such as a roots type or twin screw and not a centrifugal compressor supercharger which does not provide substantial boost in the lower rpm range a turbocharger sized to move a large volume of air tends to respond slowly to throttle input while a smaller faster responding turbo may fail to deliver suffcient volume through an engines upper rpm range the unacceptable lag time endemic to a large turbocharger is effectively neutralized when combined with a supercharger which tends to generate substantial boost pressure much faster in response to throttle input the end result being a zero lag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the upper end twincharging is therefore desirable for small displacement motors such as vw s 1 4tsi especially those with a large operating rpm since they can take advantage of an artificially broad torque band over a large speed

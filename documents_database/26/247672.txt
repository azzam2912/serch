interior algebras are to topology and the modal logic s4 what boolean algebras are to set theory and ordinary propositional logic interior algebras form a variety of modal algebras an interior algebra is an algebraic structure with the signature where is a boolean algebra and postfix designates a unary operator the interior operator satisfying the identities x is called the interior of x the dual of the interior operator is the closure operator defined by x x x is called the closure of x by the principle of duality the closure operator satisfies the identities if the closure operator is taken as primitive the interior operator can be defined as x x thus the theory of interior algebras may be formulated using the closure operator instead of the interior operator in which case one considers closure algebras of the form s 0 1 where s 0 1 is again a boolean algebra and satisfies the above identities for the closure operator closure and interior algebras form dual pairs and are paradigmatic instances of boolean algebras with operators the early literature on this subject mainly polish topology invoked closure operators but the interior operator formulation eventually became the norm following the

the actinides derive their name from the group 3 element actinium the informal chemical symbol an is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide all but one of the actinides are f block elements corresponding to the filling of the 5f electron shell lawrencium a d block element is also generally considered an actinide in comparison with the lanthanides also mostly f block elements the actinides show much more variable valence the actinide series encompasses the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from 89 to 103 actinium through lawrencium in contrast to the relatively early flowering of organotransition metal chemistry 1955 to the present the corresponding development of actinide organometallic chemistry has taken place largely within the past 15 or so years during this period 5f organometallic science has blossomed and it is now apparent that the actinides have a rich intricate and highly informative organometallic chemistry intriguing parallels to and sharp differences from the d block elements have emerged actinides can coordinate the organic active groups or bind to carbon by the covalent bonds the necessity of obtaining accurate thermodynamic quantities for the actinide elements and their compounds was recognized at the outset

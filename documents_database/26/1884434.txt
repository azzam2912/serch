however this link has been quickly proven false by other researchers in fact in december 2016 the original paper by melton and yi was retracted putting the link between betatrophin and islets cells to rest given the status of betatrophin and taking into account that betatrophin is a member of the angiopoietin like gene family and shares extensive homology with angptl4 and angptl3 the name betatrophin should be abandoned in favor of angptl8 other names for betatrophin include td26 rifl and lipasin betatrophin is a putative peptide hormone found in mice that was proposed to increase the rate at which beta cells undergo cell division injection of mice with betatrophin cdna lowered blood sugar i e hypoglycemia presumably due to action at the pancreas however treatment of human islets with betatrophin is unable to increase beta cell division furthermore studies in betatrophin angptl8 knock out mice do not support a role of betatrophin in controlling beta cell growth yet point to a clear role in regulating plasma triglyceride levels based on these studies it is fairly safe to say that the notion that betatrophin promotes beta cell expansion is dead which was made official by the retraction of the original

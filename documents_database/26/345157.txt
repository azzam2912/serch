it is an area of applied micro labor economics but there are a few key distinctions one distinction not always clearcut is that studies in personnel economics deal with the personnel management within firms and thus internal labor markets while those in labor economics deal with labor markets as such whether external or internal in addition personnel economics deals with issues related to both managerial supervisory and non supervisory workers the subject has been described as significant and different from sociological and psychological approaches to the study of organizational behavior and human resource management in various ways it analyzes labor use which accounts for the largest part of production costs for most firms by formulation of relatively simple but generalizable and testable relationships it also situates analysis in the context of market equilibrium rational maximizing behavior and economic efficiency which may be used for prescriptive purposes as to improving performance of the firm for example an alternate compensation package that provided a risk free benefit might elicit more work effort consistent with psychologically oriented prospect theory but a personnel economics analysis in its efficiency aspect would evaluate the package as to cost benefit analysis rather than work effort benefits alone

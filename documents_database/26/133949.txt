two x ray beams with different energy levels are aimed at the patient s bones when soft tissue absorption is subtracted out the bone mineral density bmd can be determined from the absorption of each beam by bone dual energy x ray absorptiometry is the most widely used and most thoroughly studied bone density measurement technology the dxa scan is typically used to diagnose and follow osteoporosis as contrasted to the nuclear bone scan which is sensitive to certain metabolic diseases of bones in which bones are attempting to heal from infections fractures or tumors one type of dxa scanner uses a cerium filter with a tube voltage of 80 kv resulting in effective photon energies of about 40 and 70 kev there is also a dxa scanner type using a samarium filter with a tube voltage of 100 kv resulting in effective energies of 47 and 80 kev also the tube voltage can be continuously switched between a low for example 70 kv and high for example 140 kv value in synchronism with the frequency of the electrical mains resulting in effective energies alternating between 45 and 100 kev the combination of dual x ray absorptiometry and laser uses

the joule second describes the amount of action occurring in a physical system through a summation of energy or heat or work over time in mathematical terms this summation of energy means that the quantity of energy becomes integrated over time to give a number an answer to the question in si base units the joule second becomes kilogram meters squared per second or kg m s dimensional analysis of the joule second yields m l t note the denominator of seconds s in the base units the joule second should not be confused with the physical process of joules per second j s in physical processes when the unit of time appears in the denominator of a ratio the described process occurs at a rate for example in discussions about speed an object like a car travels a known distance of kilometers spread over a known number of seconds and the car s rate of speed becomes kilometers per second km s in physics work per time describes a system s power defined by the units of watts j s or joules per second other uses the joule second also appears as the unit of measure in classical mechanics

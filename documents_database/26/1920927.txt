many of the details can be analyzed much easier when this transformation is done to waveform when it goes to another domain different methods are present to do transformation from time domain to frequency domain one of them is the blackman tukey transformation method that also uses fast fourier transform to meet the filter specification according to the requirements several methods are used including windowing effect statistical estimation is to determine the expected value s of statistical expected values of statistical quantities statistical estimation also tries to find the expected values the expected values are those values that we expect among the random values derived from samples of population in probability group of subset because we have problem here and in time series analysis discrete data obtained as a function of time is usually available rather than samples of population or group of subsets taken simultaneously the difficulty is commonly avoided by the process which is named ergodic process that changes with time and probability gets involved with it and it s not always periodic at all portions of time this method has some procedures such as autocorrelation function makes the wave smoothed rather than the averaging several waveforms this

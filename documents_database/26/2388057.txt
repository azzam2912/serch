lagrange s work focuses on the research and study of extrasolar planetary systems from the 1990s she began to search for exoplanets using direct imaging using novel adaptive optics in the 2000s her research became focused on the study of giant planets around young stars in 2005 she made the first direct observation of an exoplanet around a brown dwarf using deep adaptive optics lagrange also investigates the impact of stellar activity on the detectability of planets lagrange is the holder of numerous scientific awards and honorary decorations including knight of the legion of honour the highest french order of merit and is a member of the french academy of sciences since 2013 lagrange has devoted much of her career to the analysis of the star beta pictoris in the constellation pictor during her thesis in the 1980s she studied the disc of debris that had just been discovered around this star several elements indicated the presence of a massive planet but the scientific community remained skeptical however in the 2000s lagrange made several observations of the debris disc using adaptive optics coupled with direct imaging using a near infrared spectrometer mounted on the very large telescope vlt of the

the algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory in 2016 the scrypt algorithm was published by ietf as rfc 7914 a simplified version of scrypt is used as a proof of work scheme by a number of cryptocurrencies first implemented by an anonymous programmer called artforz in tenebrix and followed by fairbrix and litecoin soon after a password based key derivation function password based kdf is generally designed to be computationally intensive so that it takes a relatively long time to compute say on the order of several hundred milliseconds legitimate users only need to perform the function once per operation e g authentication and so the time required is negligible however a brute force attack would likely need to perform the operation billions of times at which point the time requirements become significant and ideally prohibitive previous password based kdfs such as the popular pbkdf2 from rsa laboratories have relatively low resource demands meaning they do not require elaborate hardware or very much memory to perform they are therefore easily and cheaply implemented in hardware for instance on an asic or even an fpga this

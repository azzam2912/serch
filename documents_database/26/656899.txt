the onboard receiver compares the current gps derived position with the local correction signal deriving a highly accurate three dimensional position capable of being used for all weather approaches via an instrument landing system style display while jpals is similar to local area augmentation system but intended primarily for use by the military some elements of jpals may eventually see their way into civilian use to help protect high value civilian operations against unauthorized signal alteration the development of jpals was the result of two main military requirements first the military needs an all service highly mobile all weather precision approach system tailorable to a wide range of environments from shipboard use to rapid installation at makeshift airfields second they need a robust system that can maintain a high level of reliability in combat operations particularly in its ability to effectively resist jamming jpals encompasses two main categories srgps shipboard relative gps and ldgps land local differential gps srgps provides highly accurate approach positioning for operations aboard ship including aircraft carriers helo and sto vl carriers and other shipboard operations primarily helicopter operations ldgps is further divided into three sub categories fixed base tactical and special missions fixed base is

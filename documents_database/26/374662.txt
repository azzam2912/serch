because of the relative simplicity of olefin metathesis it often creates fewer undesired by products and hazardous wastes than alternative organic reactions for their elucidation of the reaction mechanism and their discovery of a variety of highly active catalysts yves chauvin robert h grubbs and richard r schrock were collectively awarded the 2005 nobel prize in chemistry the reaction requires metal catalysts most commercially important processes employ heterogeneous catalysts but well defined homogeneous catalysts are also active the heterogeneous catalysts are often prepared by in situ activation of a metal halide using organoaluminium or organotin compounds e g combining wcl etoh etalcl a typical catalyst support is alumina commercial catalysts are often based on molybdenum and ruthenium well defined organometallic compounds have mainly been investigated for small scale reactions or academic research the homogeneous catalysts are often classified as schrock catalysts and grubbs catalysts schrock catalysts feature molybdenum vi and tungsten vi based centers supported by alkoxide and imido ligands grubbs catalysts on the other hand are ruthenium ii carbenoid complexes many variations of grubbs catalysts are known some have been modified with a chelating isopropoxystyrene ligand to form the related hoveyda grubbs catalyst olefin metathesis has several industrial applications

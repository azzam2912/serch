in addition its intact fc part can bind to an fc receptor on accessory cells like conventional monospecific antibodies the net effect is that this type of drug links t cells via cd3 and monocytes macrophages natural killer cells dendritic cells or other fc receptor expressing cells to the tumor cells leading to their destruction at an equivalent dose a trifunctional antibody is more potent more than 1 000 fold in eliminating tumor cells than conventional antibodies these drugs evoke the removal of tumor cells by means of i antibody dependent cell mediated cytoxicity a process also described for conventional antibodies and more importantly by ii polyclonal cytotoxic t cell responses with emphasis on cd8 t cells these trifunctional antibodies also elicit individual anti tumor immune responses in cancer patients treated with e g catumaxomab i e autologous antibodies as well as cd4 and cd8 t cells directed against the tumor were detected furthermore putative cancer stem cells from malignant ascites fluid were eliminated due to catumaxomab treatment catumaxomab was the first to be approved for clinical use in 2009 for the treatment of malignant ascites in cancer patients examples include catumaxomab epcam cd3 ertumaxomab her2 neu cd3 fbta05 cd20

unlike early genetic engineering techniques that randomly inserts genetic material into a host genome genome editing targets the insertions to site specific locations in 2018 the common methods for such editing used engineered nucleases or molecular scissors these nucleases create site specific double strand breaks dsbs at desired locations in the genome the induced double strand breaks are repaired through nonhomologous end joining nhej or homologous recombination hr resulting in targeted mutations edits as of 2015 four families of engineered nucleases were used meganucleases zinc finger nucleases zfns transcription activator like effector based nucleases talen and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr cas9 system nine genome editors were available as of 2017 genome editing with engineered nucleases i e all three major classes of these enzymes zinc finger nucleases zfns transcription activator like effector nucleases talens and engineered meganucleases were selected by nature methods as the 2011 method of the year the crispr cas system was selected by science as 2015 breakthrough of the year in may 2019 lawyers in china reported in light of the purported creation by chinese scientist he jiankui of the first gene edited humans see lulu and nana controversy the drafting of regulations

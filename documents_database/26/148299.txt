its value is now known to be exactly 1 examination of available numerical evidence for known primes led legendre to suspect that formula 1 satisfies an approximate formula legendre conjectured in 1808 that where formula 4 or similarly where b is legendre s constant he guessed b to be about 1 08366 but regardless of its exact value the existence of b implies the prime number theorem pafnuty chebyshev proved in 1849 that if the limit b exists it must be equal to 1 an easier proof was given by pintz in 1980 it is an immediate consequence of the prime number theorem under the precise form with an explicit estimate of the error term for some positive constant a where o is the big o notation as proved in 1899 by charles de la vall e poussin that b indeed is equal to 1 the prime number theorem had been proved in 1896 independently by jacques hadamard and la vall e poussin but without any estimate of the involved error term being evaluated to such a simple number has made the term legendre s constant mostly only of historical value with it often technically incorrectly being used to refer

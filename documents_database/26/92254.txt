this light is measured through a telescope using a photometer often made using electronic devices such as a ccd photometer or a photoelectric photometer that converts light into an electric current by the photoelectric effect when calibrated against standard stars or other light sources of known intensity and colour photometers can measure the brightness or apparent magnitude of celestial objects the methods used to perform photometry depend on the wavelength regime under study at its most basic photometry is conducted by gathering light and passing it through specialized photometric optical bandpass filters and then capturing and recording the light energy with a photosensitive instrument standard sets of passbands called a photometric system are defined to allow accurate comparison of observations a more advanced technique is spectrophotometry that is measured with a spectrophotometer and observes both of the amount of radiation and its detailed spectral distribution photometry is also used in the observation of variable stars by various techniques such as differential photometry that simultaneously measuring the brightness of a target object and nearby stars in the starfield or relative photometry by comparing the brightness of the target object to stars with known fixed magnitudes using multiple bandpass filters with relative

all known modern forms are shell less only some extinct primitive forms possessed valves the group comprises the two clades solenogastres neomeniomorpha and caudofoveata chaetodermomorpha which between them contain 28 families and about 320 species the aplacophorans are traditionally considered ancestral to the other mollusc classes however the relationship between the two aplacophoran groups and to the other molluscan classes and to each other is as yet unclear aplacophorans are cylindrical and worm like in form and most very small being no longer than some species however can reach a length of caudofoveates generally burrow into the substrate while solenogasters are usually epibenthic both taxa are most common in water regions deeper than where some species may reach densities up to four or five specimens per square metre three or four per square yard solenogasters are typically carnivores feeding on cnidarians or sometimes annelids or other taxa while caudofoveates are mostly detritovores or feed on foraminiferans aplacophorans are worm like animals with little resemblance to most other molluscs they have no shell although small calcified spicules are embedded in the skin these spicules are occasionally coated with an organic pellicle that is presumably secreted by microvilli caudofoveates lack a foot

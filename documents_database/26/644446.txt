his research is in topology in 1975 he earned his ph d from the university of california berkeley as a student of robion kirby in topology he has worked on handlebody theory low dimensional manifolds symplectic topology g2 manifolds in the topology of real algebraic sets he and henry c king proved that every compact piecewise linear manifold is a real algebraic set they discovered new topological invariants of real algebraic sets he was a visiting scholar several times at the institute for advanced study in 1975 76 1980 81 2002 and 2005 he has developed 4 dimensional handlebody techniques settling conjectures and solving problems about 4 manifolds such as a conjecture of christopher zeeman the harer kas kirby conjecture a problem of martin scharlemann and problems of sylvain cappell and julius shaneson he constructed an exotic compact 4 manifold with boundary from which he discovered akbulut corks his most recent results concern the 4 dimensional smooth poincar conjecture he has supervised 14 ph d students as of 2019 he has more than 100 papers and three books published and several books edited

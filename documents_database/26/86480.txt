that is g is a primitive root mod n if for every integer a coprime to n there is an integer k such that g a mod n such a value k is called the index or discrete logarithm of a to the base g modulo n note that g is a primitive root mod n if and only if g is a generator of the multiplicative group of integers modulo n gauss defined primitive roots in article 57 of the disquisitiones arithmeticae 1801 where he credited euler with coining the term in article 56 he stated that lambert and euler knew of them but he was the first to rigorously demonstrate that primitive roots exist for a prime n in fact the disquisitiones contains two proofs the one in article 54 is a nonconstructive existence proof while the other in article 55 is constructive the number 3 is a primitive root modulo 7 because here we see that the period of 3 modulo 7 is 6 the remainders in the period which are 3 2 6 4 5 1 form a rearrangement of all nonzero remainders modulo 7 implying that 3 is indeed a primitive root modulo 7 this

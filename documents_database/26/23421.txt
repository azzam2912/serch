the pressure volume product rather than energy per temperature increment per particle the constant is also a combination of the constants from boyle s law charles s law avogadro s law and gay lussac s law it is a physical constant that is featured in many fundamental equations in the physical sciences such as the ideal gas law and the nernst equation physically the gas constant is the constant of proportionality that relates the energy scale in physics to the temperature scale when a mole of particles at the stated temperature is being considered thus the value of the gas constant ultimately derives from historical decisions and accidents in the setting of the energy and temperature scales plus similar historical setting of the value of the molar scale used for the counting of particles the last factor is not a consideration in the value of the boltzmann constant which does a similar job of equating linear energy and temperature scales the gas constant r is defined as the avogadro constant n multiplied by the boltzmann constant k since the 2019 redefinition of si base units which came into effect on 20 may 2019 both n and k are defined with

it is a specialized form of a wave tank the ripple tank is usually illuminated from above so that the light shines through the water some small ripple tanks fit onto the top of an overhead projector i e they are illuminated from below the ripples on the water show up as shadows on the screen underneath the tank all the basic properties of waves including reflection refraction interference and diffraction can be demonstrated ripples may be generated by a piece of wood that is suspended above the tank on elastic bands so that it is just touching the surface screwed to wood is a motor that has an off centre weight attached to the axle as the axle rotates the motor wobbles shaking the wood and generating ripples a number of wave properties can be demonstrated with a ripple tank these include plane waves reflection refraction interference and diffraction when the rippler is attached with a point spherical ball and lowered so that it just touches the surface of the water circular waves will be produced when the rippler is lowered so that it just touches the surface of the water plane waves will be produced in the illustration

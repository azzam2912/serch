this highly soluble blue coloured salt is a common source of the ni ion for electroplating approximately 40 000 tonnes were produced in 2005 it is mainly used for electroplating of nickel in 2005 06 nickel sulfate was the top allergen in patch tests 19 0 at least seven sulfate salts of nickel ii are known these salts differ in terms of their hydration or crystal habit the common tetragonal hexahydrate crystallizes from aqueous solution between 30 7 and 53 8 c below these temperatures a heptahydrate crystallises and above these temperatures an orthorhombic hexahydrate forms the yellow anhydrous form niso is a high melting solid that is rarely encountered in the laboratory this material is produced by heating the hydrates above 330 c it decomposes at still higher temperatures to nickel oxide x ray crystallography measurements show that niso 6ho consists of the octahedral ni ho ions these ions in turn are hydrogen bonded to sulfate ions dissolution of the salt in water gives solutions containing the aquo complex ni ho all nickel sulfates are paramagnetic the salt is usually obtained as a by product of copper refining it is also produced by dissolution of nickel metal or nickel

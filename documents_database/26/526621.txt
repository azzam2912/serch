csps implement encoding and decoding functions which computer application programs may use for example to implement strong user authentication or for secure email csps are independent modules that can be used by different applications a user program calls cryptoapi functions and these are redirected to csps functions since csps are responsible for implementing cryptographic algorithms and standards applications do not need to be concerned about security details furthermore one application can define which csp it is going to use on its calls to cryptoapi in fact all cryptographic activity is implemented in csps cryptoapi only works as a bridge between the application and the csp csps are implemented basically as a special type of dll with special restrictions on loading and use every csp must be digitally signed by microsoft and the signature is verified when windows loads the csp in addition after being loaded windows periodically re scans the csp to detect tampering either by malicious software such as computer viruses or by the user him herself trying to circumvent restrictions for example on cryptographic key length that might be built into the csp s code to obtain a signature non microsoft csp developers must supply paperwork to microsoft

it is the lowermost formation of the adelaide subgroup of the beaufort group a major geological group that forms part of the greater karoo supergroup it represents the first fully terrestrial geological deposits of the karoo basin outcrops of the abrahamskraal formation are found from the small town middelpos in its westernmost localities then around sutherland the moordenaarskaroo north of laingsburg williston fraserburg leeu gamka loxton and victoria west in the western cape and northern cape in the eastern cape outcrops are known from rietbron north of klipplaat and grahamstown and also southwest of east london the abrahamskraal formation comprises the majority of the middle permian beaufort sequence and are thought to range between 268 259 million years in age the lowermost deposits of the abrahamskraal formation found in the eastern cape until recently were named the koonap formation but these outcrops have been amalgamated into the abrahamskraal formation due to recent stratigraphic and biostratigraphic research the abrahamskraal formation incorporates the entire tapinocephalus assemblage zone in its upper sections and the entire eodicynodon assemblage zone its lowermost southern deposits in the west and northerly deposits the abrahamskraal formation overlies the waterford formation and the middleton formation in the south both

overheating causes potential damage to the circuit components and can cause fire explosion or injury damage caused by overheating is commonly irreversible i e the only way to repair is to replace some components on overheating the temperature of the part rises above the operating temperature overheating can take place overheating may be caused from any accidental fault of the circuit such as short circuit or spark gap or may be caused from a wrong design or manufacture such as the lack of a proper heat dissipation system due to accumulation of heat the system reaches to an equilibrium of heat accumulation vs dissipation at a much higher temperature than expected circuit breakers placed at different portions of circuit in series to the path of current it will affect if more current than expected goes through the circuit breaker the circuit breaker opens the circuit and stops all current a fuse is a kind of widely used circuit breaker that involves direct effect of joule overheating a fuse is always placed in series with the path of current it will affect depending upon work inside a fuse there is a narrow often a hairline wire of definite material in the

in the cytoplasm it spontaneously polymerizes forming short strands that either bind to parr or hydrolyze parr stabilizes parm and prevents it from hydrolyzing once bound by parr at both ends monomer units continue to attach to the ends of the parm and the resulting reaction pushes r1 plasmids to opposite ends of the cell parms from different bacterial plasmids can form astonishingly diverse helical structures comprising two or four strands to maintain faithful plasmid inheritance in vitro the parm monomer has been observed polymerizing both with atp and with gtp but experiments by popp et al seem to indicate that the reaction prefers gtp and that gtp is the nucleotide that most likely makes the significant contributions in the cell for the remainder of this article gtp will be assumed to be the active nucleotide although many experiments have used atp instead parm binds and hydrolyzes gtp as it polymerizes the current dominant belief is that a cap of gtp is required at the ends of the parm polymer strands to prevent them from hydrolyzing although gtp is hydrolyzed by the parm units after attachment it is believed that the energy that drives the plasmids is derived from the

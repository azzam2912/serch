the species is known from a group of late oligocene to early miocene locations in southern mexico it is one of two extinct hymenaea species placed close to the living species hymenaea verrucosum and along with hymenaea allendis is one of the two extinct species which have been found in mexican amber hymenaea mexicana is known from a series of fossil flowers and leaves which are inclusions in transparent chunks of mexican amber the specimens were collected over the course of twenty five years with a total of thirty amber specimens being examined for the description of the species mexican amber is recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the simojovel region of chiapas mexico the amber dates from between 22 5 million years old for the youngest sediments of the balumtun sandstone and 26 million years old for the oldest la quinta formation this age range straddles the boundary between the late oligocene and early miocene and is complicated by both formations being secondary deposits for the amber the age range is therefore only the youngest that it might be the fossils were examined by paleobotanists george poinar jr of oregon state university and alex brown of berkeley california poinar

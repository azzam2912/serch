it was proposed by scott cotton in his paper two techniques for minimizing resolution proof the splitting algorithm is based on the following observation given a proof of unsatisfiability formula 1 and a variable formula 2 it is easy to re arrange split the proof in a proof of formula 2 and a proof of formula 4 and the recombination of these two proofs by an additional resolution step may result in a proof smaller than the original note that applying splitting in a proof formula 1 using a variable formula 2 does not invalidates a latter application of the algorithm using a differente variable formula 7 actually the method proposed by cotton generates a sequence of proofs formula 8 where each proof formula 9 is the result of applying splitting to formula 10 during the construction of the sequence if a proof formula 11 happens to be too large formula 12 is set to be the smallest proof in formula 13 for achieving a better compression time ratio a heuristic for variable selection is desirable for this purpose cotton defines the additivity of a resolution step with antecedents formula 14 and formula 15 and resolvent formula 16 then for

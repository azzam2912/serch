specific sound frequencies map precisely onto the auditory cortex this auditory or tonotopic map is similar to the homunculus map of the primary motor cortex some areas of the superior temporal gyrus are specialized for processing combinations of frequencies and other areas are specialized for processing changes in amplitude or frequency the superior temporal gyrus also includes the wernicke s area which in most people is located in the left hemisphere it is the major area involved in the comprehension of language the superior temporal gyrus is involved in auditory processing including language but also has been implicated as a critical structure in social cognition the superior temporal gyrus has been involved in the perception of emotions in facial stimuli furthermore the superior temporal gyrus is an essential structure involved in auditory processing as well as in the function of language in individuals who may have an impaired vocabulary or are developing a sense of language the superior temporal gyrus has been discovered to be an important structure in the pathway consisting of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex which are all involved in social cognition processes including the superior temporal gyrus areas more anterior and dorsal within the temporal lobe

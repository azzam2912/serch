he has contributed in the field of atomic and molecular physics nonlinear dynamics and chaos significantly his research on interplay between quantum dynamics and classical mechanics in the context of chaos is considered to be novel in molecular and theoretical physics and chemistry turgay uzer completed his bachelor s degree at turkey s prestigious middle east technical university according to harvard university library his doctoral thesis was entitled photon and electron interactions with diatomic molecules he defended his dissertation and graduated from harvard university in 1979 before joining georgia tech in 1985 as an associate professor he worked as a research fellow at university of oxford 1979 81 caltech 1982 1983 and as a research associate at university of colorado 1983 85 currently he is a faculty member with the center for nonlinear science and full professor of physics at georgia tech his research areas are quite broad but he has focused on the dynamics of intermolecular energy transfer reaction dynamics quantal manifestations of classical mechanics quantization of nonlinear systems computational physics molecular physics applied mathematics uzer was alexander von humboldt stiftung foundation fellow in 1993 1994 at max planck institute munich uzer is of turkish origin and was also

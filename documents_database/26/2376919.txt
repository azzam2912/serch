in materials science nanoscience and nanotechnology it is desirable to measure electrical properties at a particular position of the sample for this purpose multi tip stms in which several tips are operated independently have been developed apart from imaging the sample the tips of a multi tip stm are used to form contacts to the sample at desired locations and to perform local electrical measurements as microelectronics evolves into nanoelectronics it is essential to perform electronic transport measurements at the nanoscale the standard approach is to use lithographic methods in order to contact nanostructures as it is also used in the final nanoelectronic device however in research and development stages other methods to contact nanoelectronic devices or generally nanostructures may be more suitable an alternative approach for the contacting of nanostructures is to use the tips of a multi tip scanning tunneling microscope in analogy to the test leads of a multimeter used at the macroscale the advantages of this approach are a in situ contacting of as grown nanostructures still under vacuum allows to keep delicate nanostructures free from contamination which can be induced by lithography steps performed for contacting b flexible positioning of the contacting tips and different

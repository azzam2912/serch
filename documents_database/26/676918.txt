examples of virtual power plants exist in the united states europe and australia a virtual power plant is a system that integrates several types of power sources to give a reliable overall power supply the sources often form a cluster of different types of dispatchable and non dispatchable controllable or flexible load cl or fl distributed generation dg systems that are controlled by a central authority and can include microchps natural gas fired reciprocating engines small scale wind power plants wpp s photovoltaics pvs run of river hydroelectricity plants small hydro biomass backup generators and energy storage systems ess this system has benefits such as the ability to deliver peak load electricity or load following power generation on short notice such a vpp can replace a conventional power plant while providing higher efficiency and more flexibility more flexibility allows the system to react better to fluctuations but whose complexity requires complicated optimization control and secure communications an interactive simulation on the website of the vpp operator next kraftwerke illustrates how the technology works according to a 2012 report by pike research vpp capacity would from 2011 to 2017 increase by 65 from 55 6 gigawatts gw to 91 7 gw

it is located at a distance of circa 50 million light years from earth which given its apparent dimensions means that ngc 3893 is about 70 000 light years across it was discovered by william herschel on february 9 1788 ngc 3893 interacts with its satellite ngc 3896 ngc 3893 is a grand design spiral galaxy it has two main arms with high surface brightness and numerous hii regions a faint spiral arm extends from the south to the north side making an arc on the east side of ngc 3893 the galaxy is categorised as sab in ned but hern ndez toledo and puerari didn t detect a bar in their observations the stellar disk of ngc 3893 is estimated to have a mass of 2 3x10 and dominates gas dynamics in the optical radius the star formation rate in ngc 3893 is about 5 62 year ngc 3893 interacts with ngc 3896 a smaller galaxy lying at an angular distance of 3 9 arcminutes and this results in a number of tidal features like warps and bridges a bridge of material is observed in hi imaging connecting the two galaxies a stellar debris bridge is observed at the

for many years any small jurassic or cretaceous theropod that did not belong to one of the more specialized families recognized at the time was classified with the coelurids creating a confusing array of coelurid theropods that were not closely related although they have been traditionally included in this family there is no evidence that any of these primitive coelurosaurs form a natural group with coelurus the namesake of coeluridae to the exclusion of other traditional coelurosaur groups before the use of phylogenetic analyses coeluridae and coelurosauria were taxonomic wastebaskets used for small theropods that did not belong to other groups thus they accumulated many dubious genera as late as the 1980s popular books recognized over a dozen coelurids including such disparate forms as the noasaurid laevisuchus and the oviraptorosaurian microvenator and considered them descendants of the coelophysids a wastebasket coeluridae lingered into the early 1990s in some sources and appears in at least one 2006 source but since then it has only been recognized in a much reduced form in 2003 o w m rauhut using a cladistic analysis found coeluridae to include coelurus late jurassic north america compsognathus late jurassic europe sinosauropteryx early cretaceous asia and an unnamed

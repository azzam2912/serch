hydrostatics are categorized as a part of the fluid statics which is the study of all fluids incompressible or not at rest hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics the engineering of equipment for storing transporting and using fluids it is also relevant to geophysics and astrophysics for example in understanding plate tectonics and the anomalies of the earth s gravitational field to meteorology to medicine in the context of blood pressure and many other fields hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena of everyday life such as why atmospheric pressure changes with altitude why wood and oil float on water and why the surface of still water is always level some principles of hydrostatics have been known in an empirical and intuitive sense since antiquity by the builders of boats cisterns aqueducts and fountains archimedes is credited with the discovery of archimedes principle which relates the buoyancy force on an object that is submerged in a fluid to the weight of fluid displaced by the object the roman engineer vitruvius warned readers about lead pipes bursting under hydrostatic pressure the concept of pressure and the way it is transmitted by fluids was formulated by the french mathematician and philosopher blaise pascal

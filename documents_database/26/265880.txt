it is also called phosphabenzene and belongs to the phosphaalkene class it is a colorless liquid that is mainly of interest in research phosphorine is an air sensitive oil but is otherwise stable when handled using air free techniques however substituted derivatives can often be handled under air without risk of decomposition in contrast silabenzene a related heavy element analogue of benzene is not only air and moisture sensitive but also thermally unstable without extensive steric protection the first phosphorine to be isolated is 2 4 6 triphenylphosphorine it was synthesized by gottfried m rkl in 1966 by condensation of the corresponding pyrylium salt and phosphine or its equivalent p choh and p sime the parent unsubstituted phosphorine was reported by arthur j ashe iii in 1971 ring opening approaches have been developed from phospholes structural studies by electron diffraction reveal that phosphorine is a planar aromatic compound with 88 of the aromaticity of that of benzene potentially relevant to its high aromaticity are the well matched electronegativities of phosphorus 2 1 and carbon 2 5 the p c bond length is 173 pm and the c c bond lengths center around 140 pm and show little variation although phosphorine

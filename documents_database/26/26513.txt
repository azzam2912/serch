in addition just as with pure relational systems it supports extension of the data model with custom data types and methods an object relational database can be said to provide a middle ground between relational databases and object oriented databases in object relational databases the approach is essentially that of relational databases the data resides in the database and is manipulated collectively with queries in a query language at the other extreme are oodbmses in which the database is essentially a persistent object store for software written in an object oriented programming language with a programming api for storing and retrieving objects and little or no specific support for querying the basic need of object relational database arises from the fact that both relational and object database have their individual advantages and drawbacks the isomorphism of the relational database system with a mathematical relation allows it to exploit many useful techniques and theorems from set theory but these types of databases are not useful when the matter comes to data complexity and mismatch between application and the dbms an object oriented database model allows containers like sets and lists arbitrary user defined datatypes as well as nested objects this brings

state of ohio located west of elizabethtown in hamilton county the site is composed of one native american mound and the remnants of two others spread out over an area of the central part of the district is the rennert mound also known as the minnie rennert mound which retains its original shape despite digging by locals in the past because the mound has never been excavated professionally no significant artifacts have been recovered from it consequently the culture of the builders is unknown the surrounding field has yielded plentiful lithic cores of white and tan chert but too few cores have been found to justify classification of the fields as a village site due to its location and shape the mound is believed to have been built by adenan or hopewellian peoples both of which typically buried many bodies and large numbers of grave goods within mounds of this size another mound was once located approximately to the west but it has been destroyed the preservation of the one mound despite the destruction of the other is likely due to recent intervention in the early twentieth century landowner john rennert planted trees all around this mound to preserve it

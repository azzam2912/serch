when these emissions are detected and analyzed with a spectroscopy system a gamma ray energy spectrum can be produced a detailed analysis of this spectrum is typically used to determine the identity and quantity of gamma emitters present in a gamma source and is a vital tool in radiometric assay the gamma spectrum is characteristic of the gamma emitting nuclides contained in the source just as in optical spectroscopy the optical spectrum is characteristic of the material contained in a sample gamma rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation being physically the same as all other forms e g x rays visible light infrared radio but having in general higher photon energy due to their shorter wavelength because of this the energy of gamma ray photons can be resolved individually and a gamma ray spectrometer can measure and display the energies of the gamma ray photons detected radioactive nuclei radionuclides commonly emit gamma rays in the energy range from a few kev to 10 mev corresponding to the typical energy levels in nuclei with reasonably long lifetimes such sources typically produce gamma ray line spectra i e many photons emitted at discrete energies whereas much higher energies upwards

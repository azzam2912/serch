hayflick demonstrated that a normal human fetal cell population will divide between 40 and 60 times in cell culture before entering a senescence phase this finding refuted the contention by nobel laureate alexis carrel that normal cells are immortal each time a cell undergoes mitosis the telomeres on the ends of each chromosome shorten slightly cell division will cease once telomeres shorten to a critical length hayflick interpreted his discovery to be aging at the cellular level the aging of cell populations appears to correlate with the overall physical aging of an organism australian nobel laureate sir macfarlane burnet coined the name hayflick limit in his book intrinsic mutagenesis a genetic approach to ageing published in 1974 prior to leonard hayflick s discovery it was believed that vertebrate cells had an unlimited potential to replicate alexis carrel a nobel prize winning surgeon had stated that all cells explanted in tissue culture are immortal and that the lack of continuous cell replication was due to ignorance on how best to cultivate the cells he claimed to have cultivated fibroblasts from the hearts of chickens which typically live 5 to 10 years and to have kept the culture growing for 34 years

limited supply of at least one resource such as food water and territory used by both can be a factor competition both within and between species is an important topic in ecology especially community ecology competition is one of many interacting biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure competition among members of the same species is known as intraspecific competition while competition between individuals of different species is known as interspecific competition competition is not always straightforward and can occur in both a direct and indirect fashion according to the competitive exclusion principle species less suited to compete for resources should either adapt or die out although competitive exclusion is rarely found in natural ecosystems according to evolutionary theory this competition within and between species for resources is important in natural selection however competition may play less of a role than expansion among larger clades this is termed the room to roam hypothesis competition occurs by various mechanisms which can generally be divided into direct and indirect these apply equally to intraspecific and interspecific competition biologists typically recognize two types of competition interference and exploitative competition during interference competition organisms interact directly by fighting for scarce resources for example

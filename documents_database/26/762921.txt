such a diversity is chiefly conditioned by the presence of the andes mountains and the cold humboldt current the climate on the coast is arid and semi arid with high temperatures and very little rainfall the andes mountains observe a cool to cold climate with rainy summers and very dry winter the eastern lowlands present an equatorial climate with hot weather and rain distributed all year long the climate of the coast ranges from warm semiarid north of 10 s and thus very close to the equator to a climate which is a bit like the mediterranean k ppen csb climate with an important difference the winter although cloudy and cool does not have sufficient rainfall to be considered a k ppen c climate the high coastal climate is mostly determined by the influence of the cold humboldt current which runs parallel to the peruvian coast blocking the possibility of precipitation coming from the ocean should this current be warm instead the presence of the andes would suffice for high amounts of orographic precipitation such as registered in the top north and south part of the south american coastal andes the temperature extremes of the northern coast 3 s 6

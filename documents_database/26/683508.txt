such ecosystems have been studied primarily in europe similar conditions and effects appear also by roads used by vehicles railroads along with roads canals and power lines are examples of linear infrastructure intrusions railroad beds like road beds are designed to drain water away from the tracks so there is usually a bed of rock and gravel resulting in fast drainage away from the tracks at the same time this drainage often accumulates in areas fairly near the tracks where drainage is poor forming small artificial wetlands these unnatural conditions combine to form different zones some in which water is scarce others in which water is abundant railroad companies routinely clear cut and or spray with herbicide any vegetation that grows too close to the tracks this favors vegetation that is able to respond favorably to clearcutting and or resist herbicides on overhead electrified railroad lines clear cutting must be more extensive vertically as well as horizontally in order to prevent vegetation especially tree limbs from interfering with the pantographs on a moving train breaking off and falling on the wires or simply from arcing in proximity to high voltage transmission cables the same vegetative selection processes described in the

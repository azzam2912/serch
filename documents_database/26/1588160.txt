the velocity metric is used for planning sprints and measuring team performance there is no scientific evidence that measuring velocity improves planning effectiveness or team performance furthermore the metric can be misleading the following terminology is used in velocity tracking velocity always involves counting the number of units of work completed in a certain interval however units of work can be measured in many different units the main idea behind velocity is to help teams estimate how much work they can complete in a given time period based on how quickly similar work was previously completed velocity is relative measure in other words the raw numbers mean little it is the trend that matters one problem with velocity is that it conflates work done with planning accuracy in other words a team can inflate velocity by estimating tasks more conservatively if a team says that a task will take four hours or is worth 4 points instead of taking two hours or being worth two points their velocity will look better sometimes called point inflation velocity should not be used as a performance metric a second problem with velocity is that it does not take quality alignment with user goals

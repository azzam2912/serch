gh igf 1 are responsible for increasing overall body size longitudinal bone size and height especially during puberty estrogens cause the hips to widen and become rounded during puberty in females and androgens cause the shoulders to broaden in males estrogens mediate epiphyseal closure in both males and females other hormones implicated in control of bone growth include thyroid hormone parathyroid hormone calcitonin glucocorticoids such as cortisol and vitamin d calcitriol fibroblast growth factors fgfs are peptides that exists in two different forms one acid and the other basic having between them 55 homology these factors are not proteins secreted into the environment since they lack a signal peptide which means that they are only released into the extracellular when the cell membrane is reorganized transforming growth factor beta tgf is a physiological regulator of osteoblast differentiation and acts as a central component in the coupling of bone formation and its resorption during bone remodeling fibroblast growth factors fgfs and transforming growth factor beta tgf have been successfully stimulated using extracorporeal shock wave therapy eswt human fibroblasts and osteoblasts were shown to be capable of producing bone growth factors after stimulation this method was researched as a solution for nonunion

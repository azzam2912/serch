it is found in the intestinal systems of humans and animals research is being conducted to better understand the relationship bacteroides dorei has on the human intestinal system and the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes t1d b dorei is an gram negative rod shaped bacteria that contributes to normal intestinal functionality it was isolated and differentiated from bacteroides vulgatus by using 16s rrna sequencing and phenotypic tests b dorei is a non spore forming non motile and anaerobic bacterium with a dna g c content of 43 growth occurs optimally at 37 c with individual cell size between 1 6 4 2 m by 0 8 1 2 m in addition colonies streaked on eggerth gagnon eg agar with 5 horse blood plate and incubated over 48 hours in 100 co gas at 37 c resulted in colony size of 2 0 mm and individual colony morphology of circular white raised and convexed b dorei has been tested for numerous different metabolic test looking at different sugars growth of cells was seen via production of acid occurred on the following sugars glucose sucrose xylose rhamnose lactose maltose arabinose mannose and raffinose while no growth and no acid production occurred on

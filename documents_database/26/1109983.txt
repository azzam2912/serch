this enzyme participates in gibberellin biosynthesis this enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases specifically the class of intramolecular lyases the systematic name of this enzyme class is ent copalyl diphosphate lyase decyclizing other names in common use include ent kaurene synthase a and ent kaurene synthetase a ent copalyl diphosphate synthases from fungi and mosses also have a distinct ent kaurene synthase activity associated with the same protein molecule the reaction catalyzed by ent kaurene synthase is the next step in the biosynthetic pathway to gibberellins the two types of enzymic activity are distinct and site directed mutagenesis to suppress the ent kaurene synthase activity of the protein leads to build up of ent copalyl pyrophosphate inhibition of ent kaurene synthase activity by replacing mg in the growth medium with ni has the same effect higher plants typically have separate proteins for ent copalyl diphosphate synthase and ent kaurene synthase although these may be associated as weakly bound dimers or enzyme complexes rice oryza sativa has two distinct ent copalyl diphosphate synthases which participate in distinct metabolic pathways only one ent copalyl diphosphate synthase has been isolated from a bacterial species streptomyces sp strain ko 3988 it is also

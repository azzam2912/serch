the direction of rotation of the inner part is opposite to the direction of rotation of the radial force fretting between the part and the hole is often a result of this motion in machinery fretting is the micro motion of tightly fitting parts that superficially appear immobile with respect to each other for a pedal a rotating load arises from downward pedaling force on a spindle rotating with its crank making the predominantly downward force effectively rotate about the pedal spindle what may be less evident is that even tightly fitting parts have relative clearance due to their elasticity metals not being rigid materials as is evident from steel springs under load micro deformations enough to cause motion occur in such joints this can be seen from wear marks where pedal spindles seat on crank faces this precession is a process purely due to contact forces and does not depend on inertia and is not inversely proportional to spin rate it is completely unrelated to torque free and torque induced precession precession caused by fretting can cause fastenings under large torque loads to unscrew themselves automobiles have also used left threaded lug nuts on left side wheels but now

the name of the expression stems from the fact that it is the quotient of the difference of values of the function by the difference of the corresponding values of its argument the latter is x h x h in this case the difference quotient is a measure of the average rate of change of the function over an interval in this case an interval of length h the limit of the difference quotient i e the derivative is thus the instantaneous rate of change by a slight change in notation and viewpoint for an interval a b the difference quotient is called the mean or average value of the derivative of f over the interval a b this name is justified by the mean value theorem which states that for a differentiable function f its derivative f reaches its mean value at some point in the interval geometrically this difference quotient measures the slope of the secant line passing through the points with coordinates a f a and b f b difference quotients are used as approximations in numerical differentiation but they have also been subject of criticism in this application the difference quotient is sometimes also called the

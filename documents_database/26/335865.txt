bacteria and archaea serve as natural hosts there are currently 93 species in this family divided among four subfamilies and 30 genera the subfamily tevenvirinae synonym teequatrovirinae is named after its type species enterobacteria phage t4 members of this subfamily are morphologically indistinguishable and have moderately elongated heads of about 110 nanometers nm in length 114 nm long tails with a collar base plates with short spikes and six long kinked tail fibers the genera within this subfamily are divided on the basis of head morphology with the genus t4virus having a head length of 137 nm and those in the genus schizot4virus being 111 nm in length within the genera on the basis of protein homology the species have been divided into a number of groups the subfamily peduovirinae have virions with heads of 60 nm in diameter and tails of 135 18 nm these phages are easily identified because contracted sheaths tend to slide off the tail core the p phage is the type species the subfamily spounavirinae are all virulent broad host range phages that infect members of the firmicutes they possess isometric heads of 87 94 nm in diameter and conspicuous capsomers striated 140 219 nm

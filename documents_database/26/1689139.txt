it has also been called sen s slope estimator slope selection the single median method the kendall robust line fit method and the kendall theil robust line it is named after henri theil and pranab k sen who published papers on this method in 1950 and 1968 respectively and after maurice kendall because of its relation to the kendall tau rank correlation coefficient this estimator can be computed efficiently and is insensitive to outliers it can be significantly more accurate than non robust simple linear regression least squares for skewed and heteroskedastic data and competes well against least squares even for normally distributed data in terms of statistical power it has been called the most popular nonparametric technique for estimating a linear trend as defined by the theil sen estimator of a set of two dimensional points is the median of the slopes determined by all pairs of sample points extended this definition to handle the case in which two data points have the same coordinate in sen s definition one takes the median of the slopes defined only from pairs of points having distinct coordinates once the slope has been determined one may determine a line from the sample

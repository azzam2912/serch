parallel compression a form of upward compression is achieved by mixing an unprocessed dry or lightly compressed signal with a heavily compressed version of the same signal rather than bringing down the highest peaks for the purpose of dynamic range reduction it reduces the dynamic range by bringing up the softest sounds adding audible detail it is most often used on stereo percussion buses in recording and mixdown on electric bass and on vocals in recording mixes and live concert mixes the internal circuitry of dolby a noise reduction introduced in 1965 contained parallel buses with heavy compression on one of them the two mixed in a flexible ratio in october 1977 an article by mike beville was published in studio sound magazine describing the technique as applied to classical recordings many citations of this article claim that beville called it side chain compression most likely due to a misquoting of a citation of the article in roey izhaki s book mixing audio concepts practices and tools however beville used the term side chain to describe the internal electronics and signal flow of compressors not to describe a technique for using compressors his discussion of parallel compression technique occurs in

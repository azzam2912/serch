it was published by the press of vilnius jesuit academy in 1595 with financial support of bishop merkelis giedraitis the catechism is not an original work but a translation as such the work holds little value in terms of content but is extremely valuable to the study of the lithuanian language due to its lexical richness the sole surviving copy is kept at vilnius university library there were earlier publications in lithuanian but they were published by protestants in the duchy of prussia including catechism of martynas ma vydas in 1547 and postil of jonas bretk nas in 1591 earlier researchers including vaclovas bir i ka and zenonas ivinskis claimed that a translation of the catechism by peter canisius was published in vilnius around 1585 that would put dauk a s catechism only as the first surviving lithuanian language book printed in the grand duchy of lithuania the claim was based on two documents a 1589 letter to albert frederick duke of prussia and foreword of the 1605 catechism printed in vilnius upon careful analysis it is likely that the letter referred to latvian translation of canisius catechism instigated by papal legate antonio possevino translated by and published in vilnius

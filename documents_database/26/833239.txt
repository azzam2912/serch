a point source has negligible extent distinguishing it from other source geometries sources are called point sources because in mathematical modeling these sources can usually be approximated as a mathematical point to simplify analysis the actual source need not be physically small if its size is negligible relative to other length scales in the problem for example in astronomy stars are routinely treated as point sources even though they are in actuality much larger than the earth in three dimensions the density of something leaving a point source decreases in proportion to the inverse square of the distance from the source if the distribution is isotropic and there is no absorption or other loss in mathematics a point source is a singularity from which flux or flow is emanating although singularities such as this do not exist in the observable universe mathematical point sources are often used as approximations to reality in physics and other fields generally a source of light can be considered a point source if the resolution of the imaging instrument is too low to resolve the source s apparent size there are two types and sources of light a point source and an extended source mathematically

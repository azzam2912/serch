the point estimators yield single valued results although this includes the possibility of single vector valued results and results that can be expressed as a single function this is in contrast to an interval estimator where the result would be a range of plausible values or vectors or functions estimation theory is concerned with the properties of estimators that is with defining properties that can be used to compare different estimators different rules for creating estimates for the same quantity based on the same data such properties can be used to determine the best rules to use under given circumstances however in robust statistics statistical theory goes on to consider the balance between having good properties if tightly defined assumptions hold and having less good properties that hold under wider conditions an estimator or point estimate is a statistic that is a function of the data that is used to infer the value of an unknown parameter in a statistical model the parameter being estimated is sometimes called the estimand it can be either finite dimensional in parametric and semi parametric models or infinite dimensional semi parametric and non parametric models if the parameter is denoted formula 1 then the

neither denotes a particular range of focal lengths the difference is only whether distortion is present or not however the shorter the focal length the more difficult it is to implement rectilinear correction in fisheye lenses the visual angle is close to or more than 180 degrees in at least one direction for example a diagonal fish eye would have a viewing angle of at least 180 degrees within the diagonals of the frame a circular fisheye would represent the image in the form of a circle rectilinear ultra wide angle lenses are used in photography and cinematography sometimes to achieve three dimensional perspective distortion instead of simply two dimensional barrel distortion a notable signature employment for this purpose is frequently seen in the films of terry gilliam for instance the dof afforded by an ultra wide angle lens is very great therefore the photographer has the ability to keep much or almost all of the scene in focus with respect to the hyperfocal distance of the lens thanks to the small focal length these lenses can shoot longer exposures without fear of camera shake in the image in longer lenses camera shake is multiplied by the zoom factor but

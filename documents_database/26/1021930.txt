the following is a partial list of skype s features skype allows users to send instant messages to other users in their contact list messages sent to offline users are stored on skype servers and will be delivered to their recipients as soon as they come online on skype chat history along with the message status will be synchronized across all user devices supported by skype whenever the user signs in with the same skype account although skype allows sending sms messages it is not possible to receive sms messages on skype so users need a different way to receive responses to the messages they send using skype this has been a cause of angst among user who purchase skype as an alternative to a mobile phone because microsoft will not refund any purchases even for users who discover this missing feature only after purchasing multi year contracts other than in user complaints on the microsoft skype forums there is no mention on microsoft or skype websites that when they say send sms messages that is just what they mean users can send but they cannot receive sms messages skype keeps user instant messaging history on user s local computer

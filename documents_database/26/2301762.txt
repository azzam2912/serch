the spacecraft is being developed by the japanese space agency jaxa and will demonstrate advanced technologies for future deep space exploration as of 2017 destiny is planned to be launched in 2022 destiny will be launched from uchinoura space center by an epsilon rocket in 2022 into low earth orbit and will spend 1 5 years raising its orbit with ion engines a lunar flyby will accelerate the probe into an interplanetary orbit during this cruise time it will flyby a few near earth objects for study including the transition body 3200 phaethon as well as measure interplanetary and interstellar dust the probe s ion engines have the capability to perform another orbit transfer to study additional objects destiny will be a technology demonstrator to further improve operations of low cost solar electric propulsion in deep space it will also demonstrate innovative light weight solar array panel technology the scientific aspect of this mission is to understand origin and nature of dusts which are key sources of organic compounds to earth it will also observe dusts from comet asteroid 3200 phaethon using a dust analyzer and will map its surface using a multiband telescopic camera to understand the mechanisms of

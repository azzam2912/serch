it is a kac moody algebra for which the generalized cartan matrix is positive semi definite and has corank 1 from purely mathematical point of view affine lie algebras are interesting because their representation theory like representation theory of finite dimensional semisimple lie algebras is much better understood than that of general kac moody algebras as observed by victor kac the character formula for representations of affine lie algebras implies certain combinatorial identities the macdonald identities affine lie algebras play an important role in string theory and two dimensional conformal field theory due to the way they are constructed starting from a simple lie algebra formula 1 one considers the loop algebra formula 2 formed by the formula 1 valued functions on a circle interpreted as the closed string with pointwise commutator the affine lie algebra formula 4 is obtained by adding one extra dimension to the loop algebra and modifying a commutator in a non trivial way which physicists call a quantum anomaly in this case the anomaly of the wzw model and mathematicians a central extension more generally if is an automorphism of the simple lie algebra formula 1 associated to an automorphism of its dynkin diagram the

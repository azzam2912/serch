it is the third book in the stone dance of the chameleon trilogy which concerns the harrowing experiences of the young and inexperienced heir to a ruling dynasty who is suddenly taken from his protected childhood and thrust into a cruel society where he must fight for his family honour his position and his life the third god continues the story of chameleon and the would be god emperor osidian who has raised a barbarian army and now seeks revenge on those who stripped him of his rightful inheritance and left him for dead pinto said that though the novel had been published in the united kingdom and portugal he had been bitterly disappointed when both his us and german publishers had decided not to publish it he noted when it came out it was barely reviewed and it felt to me as if after spending years creating a ship it had slid down the slipway and sank with barely a trace i had hoped for more this is the final book in a series of three some series become formulaic with the same characters going over the same ground on the way to a final victory but not this

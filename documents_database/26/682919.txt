h berlin and m kac it has the remarkable property that for linear dimension d greater than four the critical exponents that govern the behaviour of the system near the critical point are independent of d and the geometry of the system it is one of the few models of ferromagnetism that can be solved exactly in the presence of an external field the model describes a set of particles on a lattice formula 1 containing n sites for each site j of formula 1 a spin formula 3 which interacts only with its nearest neighbours and an external field h it differs from the ising model in that the formula 3 are no longer restricted to formula 5 but can take all real values subject to the constraint that which in a homogeneous system ensures that the average of the square of any spin is one as in the usual ising model the partition function generalizes from that of the ising model to where formula 8 is the dirac delta function formula 9 are the edges of the lattice and formula 10 and formula 11 where t is the temperature of the system k is boltzmann s constant and

this term is also used for a stream or river with meanders that obviously are not proportional in size to the meanders of the valley or meander scars cut into its valley walls if the misfit stream is too large for either its valley or meanders it is known as an overfit stream if the misfit stream is too small for either its valley or meanders it is known as an underfit stream the term misfit stream is often incorrectly used as a synonym for an underfit stream an underfit stream is a type of misfit stream whose discharge is too small to be correlated with either existing channel characteristics i e meander radius wavelength and channel width or valley size an underfit stream can result when glaciation modifies the landscape by creating glacial troughs the rivers that occupy such valleys after the ice has retreated are not in proportion with the size of the valley given the scale of most glacial troughs almost all of them contain misfit streams misfit streams can also be caused by reductions in the discharge of the stream channel size responds rapidly to variations in discharge but valley size responds over much longer timescales

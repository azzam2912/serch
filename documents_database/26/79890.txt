the law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant energy can be transformed from one form to another but can be neither created nor destroyed the first law is often formulated it states that the change in the internal energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of heat supplied to the system minus the amount of work done by the system on its surroundings an equivalent statement is that perpetual motion machines of the first kind are impossible investigations into the nature of heat and work and their relationship began with the invention of the first engines used to extract water from mines improvements to such engines so as to increase their efficiency and power output came first from mechanics that worked with such machines but only slowly advanced the art deeper investigations that placed those on a mathematical and physics basis came later the first law of thermodynamics was developed empirically over about half a century the first full statements of the law came in 1850 from rudolf clausius and from william rankine rankine s statement is considered less distinct relative to clausius a main aspect of the

in formulas this can be expressed as follows for a function f defined on formula 3 the definition can be expressed in terms of the halo as follows f is microcontinuous at formula 4 if and only if formula 5 where the natural extension of f to the hyperreals is still denoted f alternatively the property of microcontinuity at c can be expressed by stating that the composition formula 6 is constant of the halo of c where st is the standard part function the modern property of continuity of a function was first defined by bolzano in 1817 however bolzano s work was not noticed by the larger mathematical community until its rediscovery in heine in the 1860s meanwhile cauchy s textbook cours d analyse defined continuity in 1821 using infinitesimals as above the property of microcontinuity is typically applied to the natural extension f of a real function f thus f defined on a real interval i is continuous if and only if f is microcontinuous at every point of i meanwhile f is uniformly continuous on i if and only if f is microcontinuous at every point standard and non standard of the natural extension i of

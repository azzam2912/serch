this type of plastic is formed by dissolving gas under high pressure into various polymers relying on thermodynamic instability phenomena to cause the uniform arrangement of the gas bubbles otherwise known as nucleation its main purpose was to reduce material usage while maintaining valuable mechanical properties the main room for variance in these foams is the gas used to create them the density of the finished product is determined by the gas used depending on the gas used the density of the foam can lie between 5 and 99 that of the pre processed plastic design parameters focused more on the final form of the foam and the molding process afterward include the type of die or mold to be used as well as the dimensions of the bubbles or cells that classify this material as a foam since the size of cells is close to the wavelength of light to the casual observer this foam retains the appearance of a solid light colored plastic recent developments at the university of washington have produced nanocellular foams these foams are characterized by cell sizes in the 20 100 nanometer range also at indian institute of technology delhi new technologies are being

it may be embedded in 4 dimensional euclidean space as the set of points equidistant from a fixed central point analogous to how the boundary of a ball in three dimensions is an ordinary sphere or 2 sphere a two dimensional surface the boundary of a ball in four dimensions is a 3 sphere an object with three dimensions a 3 sphere is an example of a 3 manifold and an n sphere in coordinates a 3 sphere with center and radius is the set of all points in real 4 dimensional space such that the 3 sphere centered at the origin with radius 1 is called the unit 3 sphere and is usually denoted it is often convenient to regard as the space with 2 complex dimensions or the quaternions the unit 3 sphere is then given by or this description as the quaternions of norm one identifies the 3 sphere with the versors in the quaternion division ring just as the unit circle is important for planar polar coordinates so the 3 sphere is important in the polar view of 4 space involved in quaternion multiplication see polar decomposition of a quaternion for details of this development of

peptide yy is a short 36 amino acid peptide released from cells in the ileum and colon in response to feeding in the blood gut and other elements of periphery pyy acts to reduce appetite similarly when injected directly into the central nervous system pyy is also anorexigenic i e it reduces appetite dietary fibers from fruits vegetables and whole grains consumed increase the speed of transit of intestinal chyme into the ileum to raise pyy and induce satiety peptide yy can be produced as the result of enzymatic breakdown of crude fish proteins and ingested as a food product peptide yy is related to the pancreatic peptide family by having 18 of its 36 amino acids located in the same positions as pancreatic peptide the two major forms of peptide yy are pyy and pyy which have pp fold structural motifs however the most common form of circulating pyy immunoreactivity is pyy which binds to the y receptor y2r of the y family of receptors peptide yy pyy is a linear polypeptide consisting of 34 amino acids with structural homology to npy and pancreatic polypeptide pyy is found in l cells in the mucosa of gastrointestinal tract especially in

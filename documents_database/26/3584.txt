they thus contain two alk ene units with the standard prefix di of systematic nomenclature as a subunit of more complex molecules dienes occur in naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals and are used in organic synthesis conjugated dienes are widely used as monomers in the polymer industry polyunsaturated fats are of interest to nutrition dienes can be divided into three classes depending on the relative location of the double bonds according to the gold book definition a diene could include one or more heteroatoms which replace unsaturated carbon atoms giving structures that could more specifically be called heterodienes compounds that contain more than two double bonds are called polyenes polyenes and dienes share many properties on an industrial scale butadiene is prepared by thermal cracking of butanes in a similarly non selective process dicyclopentadiene is obtained from coal tars in the laboratory more directed and more delicate processes are employed such as dehydrohalogenations and condensations myriad methods have been developed such as the whiting reaction families of nonconjugated dienes are derived from the oligomerization and dimerization of conjugated dienes for example 1 5 cyclooctadiene and vinylcyclohexene are produced by dimerization of 1 3 butadiene diene containing fatty acids are biosynthesized

it is a special case of the more generally stated principle of least action using the calculus of variations it results in an integral equation formulation of the equations of motion for the system maupertuis s principle states that the true path of a system described by formula 1 generalized coordinates formula 2 between two specified states formula 3 and formula 4 is an extremum i e a stationary point a minimum maximum or saddle point of the abbreviated action functional where formula 6 are the conjugate momenta of the generalized coordinates defined by the equation where formula 8 is the lagrangian function for the system in other words any first order perturbation of the path results in at most second order changes in formula 9 note that the abbreviated action formula 9 is a functional i e a function from a vector space into its underlying scalar field which in this case takes as its input a function i e the pathes between the two specified states for many systems the kinetic energy formula 11 is quadratic in the generalized velocities formula 12 although the mass tensor formula 14 may be a complicated function of the generalized coordinates formula

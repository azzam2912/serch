the xpd protein contains 760 amino acids and is a polypeptide with a size of 87kda defects in this gene can result in three different disorders the cancer prone syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group d photosensitive trichothiodystrophy and cockayne syndrome just like xpb xpd is a part of human transcriptional initiation factor tfiih and has atp dependent helicase activity it belongs to the rad3 xpd subfamily of helicases xpd is essential for the viability of cells deletion of xpd in mice is lethal for developing embryos the ercc2 xpd protein participates in nucleotide excision repair ner and is employed in unwinding the dna double helix after damage is initially recognized ner is a multi step pathway that removes a wide range of different damages that distort normal base pairing such damages include bulky chemical adducts uv induced pyrimidine dimers and several forms of oxidative damage mutations in the ercc2 xpd gene can lead to various syndromes either xeroderma pigmentosum xp trichothiodystrophy ttd or a combination of xp and ttd xpttd or a combination of xp and cockayne syndrome xpcs ttd and cs both display features of premature aging these features may include sensorineural deafness retinal degeneration white matter hypomethylation central

this particular class of concrete was developed with the goal of solving the structural problems inherent with today s typical concrete such as its tendency to fail in a brittle manner under excessive loading and its lack of long term durability because of their design and composition hpfrccs possess the remarkable ability to plastically yield and harden under excessive loading so that they flex or deform before fracturing a behavior similar to that exhibited by most metals under tensile or bending stresses because of this capability hpfrccs are more resistant to cracking and last considerably longer than normal concrete another extremely desirable property of hpfrccs is their low density a less dense and hence lighter material means that hpfrccs could eventually require much less energy to produce and handle deeming them a more economic building material because of hpfrccs lightweight composition and ability to strain harden it has been proposed that they could eventually become a more durable and efficient alternative to typical concrete hpfrccs are simply a subcategory of ductile fiber reinforced cementititous composites dfrccs that possess the ability to strain harden under both bending and tensile loads not to be confused with other dfrccs that only strain harden

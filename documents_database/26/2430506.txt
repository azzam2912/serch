the word synthesis refers to combining parts to form a whole hartenberg and denavit describe kinematic synthesis as the earliest machines were designed to amplify human and animal effort later gear trains and linkage systems captured wind and flowing water to rotate millstones and pumps now machines use chemical and electric power to manufacture transport and process items of all types and kinematic synthesis is the collection of techniques for designing those elements of these machines that achieve required output forces and movement for a given input applications of kinematic synthesis include determining kinematic synthesis for a mechanical system is described as having three general phases known as type synthesis number synthesis and dimensional synthesis type synthesis matches the general characteristics of a mechanical system to the task at hand selecting from an array of devices such as a cam follower mechanism linkage gear train a fixture or a robotic system for use in a required task number synthesis considers the various ways a particular device can be constructed generally focussed on the number and features of the parts finally dimensional synthesis determines the geometry and assembly of the components that form the device a linkage is an assembly of

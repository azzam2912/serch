its principal role is reducing neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system in humans gaba is also directly responsible for the regulation of muscle tone gaba is sold as a dietary supplement in vertebrates gaba acts at inhibitory synapses in the brain by binding to specific transmembrane receptors in the plasma membrane of both pre and postsynaptic neuronal processes this binding causes the opening of ion channels to allow the flow of either negatively charged chloride ions into the cell or positively charged potassium ions out of the cell this action results in a negative change in the transmembrane potential usually causing hyperpolarization two general classes of gaba receptor are known neurons that produce gaba as their output are called gabaergic neurons and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the adult vertebrate medium spiny cells are a typical example of inhibitory central nervous system gabaergic cells in contrast gaba exhibits both excitatory and inhibitory actions in insects mediating muscle activation at synapses between nerves and muscle cells and also the stimulation of certain glands in mammals some gabaergic neurons such as chandelier cells are also able to excite their glutamatergic counterparts gaba receptors are ligand activated chloride channels when activated

there are five fundamental symmetry classes which have triangular fundamental domains dihedral cyclic tetrahedral octahedral and icosahedral symmetry this article lists the groups by schoenflies notation coxeter notation orbifold notation and order john conway uses a variation of the schoenflies notation based on the groups quaternion algebraic structure labeled by one or two upper case letters and whole number subscripts the group order is defined as the subscript unless the order is doubled for symbols with a plus or minus prefix which implies a central inversion hermann mauguin notation international notation is also given the crystallography groups 32 in total are a subset with element orders 2 3 4 and 6 there are four involutional groups no symmetry c reflection symmetry c 2 fold rotational symmetry c and central point symmetry c there are four infinite cyclic symmetry families with n 2 or higher n may be 1 as a special case as no symmetry there are three infinite dihedral symmetry families with n 2 or higher n may be 1 as a special case there are three types of polyhedral symmetry tetrahedral symmetry octahedral symmetry and icosahedral symmetry named after the triangle faced regular polyhedra with these symmetries

with a binding affinity k of 55 nm at dat and 28 4 nm at sert but only 4030 nm at net rti 83 has reasonable selectivity for dat sert over net however further research has shown that by extending the ethyl chain even better selectivity can be achieved with the 4 cis propenyl analogue having k values of 15 nm at dat and 7 1 nm at sert vs 2800 nm at net however rti 436 has an even better selectivity for dat over net 3 09nm dat 1 960nm net or a net dat ratio of 634 3 but with lesser dat sert equivalent potency with a ratio between them of 108 and rti 88 has a still better ratio 984 net dat with additionally having less selectivity than the former compound between dat sert and having a more even spread of potency with the ratio between dat sert being 88 such drugs are speculated to be useful as potential antidepressants but few examples have been reported in the literature as yet however while rti 83 has been used for binding studies to model the monoamine transporter proteins its pharmacology in vivo has not been studied in detail

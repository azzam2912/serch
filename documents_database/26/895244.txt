abcb5 is an abc transporter and p glycoprotein family member principally expressed in physiological skin and human malignant melanoma abcb5 has been suggested to regulate skin progenitor cell fusion and mediate chemotherapeutic drug resistance in stem like tumor cell subpopulations in human malignant melanoma it is commonly over expressed on circulating melanoma tumour cells furthermore the abcb5 melanoma initiating cells were demonstrated to express flt1 vegfr1 receptor tyrosine kinase which was functionally required for efficient xenograft tumor formation as demonstrated by shrna knockdown experiments in colorectal cancer abcb5 was shown to act as a mediator of 5 fu patient chemoresistance and had a further direct role in tumorigenesis shown by shrna mediated colorectal cancer cell line abcb5 knockdowns that impeded tumorigenesis in human to mouse xenografts in melanoma abcb5 contributes to multi drug chemotherapy resistance and tumor growth controlling a proinflammatory signaling circuit utilizing tlr4 il 1 il8 and cxcr1 signaling involving reciprocal paracrine interactions between the melanoma stem cell and tumor bulk population in a rheostat manner termed cancer stem cell rheostasis abcb5 was shown to maintain the slow cycling melanoma stem cells using this cytokine signaling loop which became more differentiated upon abcb5 interference e g wfdc1 melanocyte

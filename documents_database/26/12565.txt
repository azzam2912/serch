this subject is of great interest to biologists because macromolecules carry out most of the functions of cells and it is only by coiling into specific three dimensional shapes that they are able to perform these functions this architecture the tertiary structure of molecules depends in a complicated way on each molecule s basic composition or primary structure biomolecules are too small to see in detail even with the most advanced light microscopes the methods that structural biologists use to determine their structures generally involve measurements on vast numbers of identical molecules at the same time these methods include most often researchers use them to study the native states of macromolecules but variations on these methods are also used to watch nascent or denatured molecules assume or reassume their native states see protein folding a third approach that structural biologists take to understanding structure is bioinformatics to look for patterns among the diverse sequences that give rise to particular shapes researchers often can deduce aspects of the structure of integral membrane proteins based on the membrane topology predicted by hydrophobicity analysis see protein structure prediction in the past few years it has become possible for highly accurate physical molecular models

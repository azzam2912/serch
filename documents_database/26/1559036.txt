usaturated borates as well as borates with a leaving group at the position are highly susceptible to intramolecular 1 2 migration of a group from boron to the electrophilic position oxidation or protonolysis of the resulting organoboranes may generate a variety of organic products including alcohols carbonyl compounds alkenes and halides organoboranes rb and borates rb generated via addition of r to rb possess boron carbon bonds that are polarized toward carbon thus the carbon attached to boron is nucleophilic and in borates this property may be harnessed to transfer one of the r groups to an electrophilic center either inter or more often intramolecularly in the latter case the nucleophilic r group is able to undergo 1 2 migration towards an electrophilic carbon attached to boron the resulting reorganized borane can then be oxidized or subjected to protonolysis to afford organic products examples covered in this article are shown below hydroboration of alkenes or alkynes is an efficient method for the generation of boranes however the use of borane bh or borane equivalents leads to the conversion of only 33 of the starting olefin to product after oxidation or protonolysis the remaining olefin is incorporated into boron containing byproducts

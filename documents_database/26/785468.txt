smf provides full instrumentation of all baseline activities running on that ibm mainframe operating system including i o network activity software usage error conditions processor utilization etc one of the most prominent components of z os that uses smf is the ibm resource measurement facility rmf rmf provides performance and usage instrumentation of resources such as processor memory disk cache workload virtual storage xcf and coupling facility rmf is technically a priced extra cost feature of z os bmc sells a competing alternative cmf smf forms the basis for many monitoring and automation utilities each smf record has a numbered type e g smf 120 or smf 89 and installations have great control over how much or how little smf data to collect records written by software other than ibm products generally have a record type of 128 or higher some record types have subtypes for example type 70 subtype 1 records are written by rmf to record cpu activity here is a list of the most common smf record types the major record types especially those created by rmf continue to evolve at a rapid pace each release of z os brings new fields different processor families and coupling

46 in b major hoboken i 46 was composed in 1772 during his sturm und drang period the work is scored for two oboes bassoon two horns and strings the work is written in standard four movement format the key of b major which is highly unusual sets the tone of the work which is one of unease restlessness and searching the high pitched horns add a touch of eeriness the first movement starts with a four note motif in unison reminiscent of the symphony no 44 trauer but quasi inverted it is developed in various keys with frequent modulations into the minor and to other remote keys in a deliberate surprise the movement seems to enter the recapitulation seconds after the development begins before jumping back to a dramatic development passage the recapitulation continues the development still further moving into dissonance before an abrupt ending the second movement is in b minor it is a rhapsodic pastorale rocking along over a running figure in the bass with a syncopated figure in the muted violins maintaining the tension the minuet is more assertive in tone but its confidence is undermined by a plaintive almost solemn trio again in b minor

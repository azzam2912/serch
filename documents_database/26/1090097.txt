it is an important part of dirac s development of hamiltonian mechanics to elegantly handle more general lagrangians specifically when constraints are at hand so that the number of apparent variables exceeds that of dynamical ones more abstractly the two form implied from the dirac bracket is the restriction of the symplectic form to the constraint surface in phase space this article assumes familiarity with the standard lagrangian and hamiltonian formalisms and their connection to canonical quantization details of dirac s modified hamiltonian formalism are also summarized to put the dirac bracket in context the standard development of hamiltonian mechanics is inadequate in several specific situations an example in classical mechanics is a particle with charge and mass confined to the plane with a strong constant homogeneous perpendicular magnetic field so then pointing in the direction with strength the lagrangian for this system with an appropriate choice of parameters is where is the vector potential for the magnetic field is the speed of light in vacuum and is an arbitrary external scalar potential one could easily take it to be quadratic in and without loss of generality we use as our vector potential this corresponds to a uniform and constant

a large proportion of block ciphers use the scheme including the data encryption standard des the feistel structure has the advantage that encryption and decryption operations are very similar even identical in some cases requiring only a reversal of the key schedule therefore the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved a feistel network is an iterated cipher with an internal function called a round function feistel networks were first seen commercially in ibm s lucifer cipher designed by horst feistel and don coppersmith in 1973 feistel networks gained respectability when the u s federal government adopted the des a cipher based on lucifer with changes made by the nsa like other components of the des the iterative nature of the feistel construction makes implementing the cryptosystem in hardware easier particularly on the hardware available at the time of des s design many modern and also some old symmetric block ciphers are based on feistel networks e g gost 28147 89 block cipher and the structure and properties of feistel ciphers have been extensively explored by cryptographers specifically michael luby and charles rackoff analyzed the feistel cipher construction and proved that if

photosystems are found in the thylakoid membranes of plants algae and cyanobacteria they are located in the chloroplasts of plants and algae and in the cytoplasmic membrane of photosynthetic bacteria there are two kinds of photosystems ii and i at the heart of a photosystem lies the reaction center which is an enzyme that uses light to reduce molecules provide with electrons this reaction center is surrounded by light harvesting complexes that enhance the absorption of light two families of reaction centers in photosystems exist type i reaction centers such as photosystem i p700 in chloroplasts and in green sulphur bacteria and type ii reaction centers such as photosystem ii p680 in chloroplasts and in non sulphur purple bacteria each of the photosystem can be identified by the wavelength of light to which it is most reactive 700 and 680 nanometers respectively for psi and psii in chloroplasts the amount and type of light harvesting complex present and the type of terminal electron acceptor used type i photosystems use ferredoxin like iron sulfur cluster proteins as terminal electron acceptors while type ii photosystems ultimately shuttle electrons to a quinone terminal electron acceptor both reaction center types are present in chloroplasts

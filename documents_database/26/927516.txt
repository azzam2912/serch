it is common especially in algebraic topology for example serre spectral sequence can be constructed by first constructing an exact couple for the definition of an exact couple and the construction of a spectral sequence from it which is immediate see spectral sequence exact couples for a basic example see bockstein spectral sequence the present article covers additional materials let r be a ring which is fixed throughout the discussion note if r is z then modules over r are the same thing as abelian groups each filtered chain complex of modules determines an exact couple which in turn determines a spectral sequence as follows let c be a chain complex graded by integers and suppose it is given an increasing filtration for each integer p there is an inclusion of complexes from the filtration one can form the associated graded complex which is doubly graded and which is the zero th page of the spectral sequence to get the first page for each fixed p we look at the short exact sequence of complexes from which we obtain a long exact sequence of homologies p is still fixed with the notation formula 6 the above reads which is precisely

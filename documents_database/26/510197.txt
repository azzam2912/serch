it can be used to entangle and disentangle epr states any quantum circuit can be simulated to an arbitrary degree of accuracy using a combination of cnot gates and single qubit rotations the cnot gate operates on a quantum register consisting of 2 qubits the cnot gate flips the second qubit the target qubit if and only if the first qubit the control qubit is formula 1 if one allows only formula 2 and formula 3 terms over while leaving the formula 4 and formula 5 terms alone this is equivalent to a cnot gate where qubit 2 is the control qubit and qubit 1 is the target qubit formula 6 a common application of the c gate is to maximally entangle two qubits into the formula 7 bell state this forms part of the setup of the superdense coding quantum teleportation and entangled quantum cryptography algorithms to construct formula 7 the inputs a control and b target to the c gate are formula 10 and formula 11 after applying c the resulting bell state formula 12 has the property that the individual qubits can be measured using any basis and will always present a 50 50 chance of resolving

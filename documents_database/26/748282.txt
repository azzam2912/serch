rural is not a strict division but rather a continuum within which several distinct settlement patterns and several competing interpretations of the distinction may exist for example a community may fit a strictly statistical definition of an urban area but may not be commonly thought of as urban because it has a smaller population or because it functions socially and economically as a suburb of another urban area rather than as a self contained urban entity or because it is geographically remote from other urban communities accordingly the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres small population 1 000 to 29 999 medium population 30 000 to 99 999 and large population 100 000 or greater despite the change in terminology however the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area a population of at least 1 000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per square km a population centre does not necessarily correspond to the boundaries of a municipality or of a census division for example a less densely populated area within a city s municipal boundaries may not be included as part of its population

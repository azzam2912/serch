it is known from the middle ordovician to the early upper triassic carnian reaching its largest diversity during the carboniferous many hundreds of species have been described from marine sediments all over the world fenestella is latin meaning little window from fenestra window for the window like openings in the mesh of the skeleton of its colonies the skeleton of fenestella colonies consists of stiff branches that are interconnected by narrower crossbars or dissepiments between two and eight individuals of the colony inhabit each of the opposing front sides of the approximately rectangular openings between the branches or fenestule in one row and the void they left when they died can be recognized as two rows of small rimmed pores or apertures on the front of each branch in well preserved specimens these are closed by centrally perforated lids in fenestella the front of the branches may carry small nodes in a row in the middle branches split or bifurcate from time to time giving the colonies a fan shaped appearance the internal structure of the branches is of decisive importance in the assignment of specimens to genera and species which greatly hampers identification of intact fossils compared to other

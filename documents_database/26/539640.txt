it has the appearance of grey cubic crystals with a melting point of 942 c indium arsenide is used for construction of infrared detectors for the wavelength range of 1 3 8 m the detectors are usually photovoltaic photodiodes cryogenically cooled detectors have lower noise but inas detectors can be used in higher power applications at room temperature as well indium arsenide is also used for making of diode lasers indium arsenide is similar to gallium arsenide and is a direct bandgap material indium arsenide is sometimes used together with indium phosphide alloyed with gallium arsenide it forms indium gallium arsenide a material with band gap dependent on in ga ratio a method principally similar to alloying indium nitride with gallium nitride to yield indium gallium nitride inas is well known for its high electron mobility and narrow energy bandgap it is widely used as terahertz radiation source as it is a strong photo dember emitter quantum dots can be formed in a monolayer of indium arsenide on indium phosphide or gallium arsenide the mismatches of lattice constants of the materials create tensions in the surface layer which in turn leads to formation of the quantum dots quantum dots can

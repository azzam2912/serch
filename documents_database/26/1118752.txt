large aerospace corporations may also developed their own internal standards these standards exist in order to specify requirements for the verification of a space system product such as verification or qualification is one main reason that costs for space systems are high all data are to be documented and to stay accessible for potential later failure analyses in previous times that approach was executed down to piece parts level resistors switches etc whereas nowadays it is tried to reduce cost by usage of cam commercial avionics military equipment for non safety relevant units qualification is the formal proof that the design meets all requirements of the specification and the parameters agreed in the interface control documents icd requirements with adequate margin including tolerances due to manufacturing imperfections wear out within specified life time faults etc the end of the qualification process is the approval signature of the customer on the certificate of qualification coq or qualification description document qdd agreeing that all the requirements are met by the product to be delivered under the terms of a contract acceptance is the formal proof that the product identified is free of workmanship defects and meets preset performance requirements with adequate margin

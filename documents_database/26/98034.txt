more generally one can look at the question of defining a linear functional for every real number in such a way that when takes an integer value it coincides with the usual fold differentiation if and with the th power of when one of the motivations behind the introduction and study of these sorts of extensions of the differentiation operator is that the sets of operator powers defined in this way are continuous semigroups with parameter of which the original discrete semigroup of for integer is a denumerable subgroup since continuous semigroups have a well developed mathematical theory they can be applied to other branches of mathematics fractional differential equations also known as extraordinary differential equations are a generalization of differential equations through the application of fractional calculus in applied mathematics and mathematical analysis fractional derivative is a derivative of any arbitrary order real or complex its first appearance is in a letter written to guillaume de l h pital by gottfried wilhelm leibniz in 1695 as far as the existence of such a theory is concerned the foundations of the subject were laid by liouville in a paper from 1832 the autodidact oliver heaviside introduced the practical use of

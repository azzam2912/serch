historically it was a lower cost alternative to a fabric topology it allowed connection of many servers and computer storage devices without using then very costly fibre channel switches the cost of the switches dropped considerably so by 2007 fc al had become rare in server to storage communication it is however still common within storage systems arbitrated loop can be physically cabled in a ring fashion or using a hub the physical ring ceases to work if one of the devices in the chain fails the hub on the other hand while maintaining a logical ring allows a star topology on the cable level each receive port on the hub is simply passed to next active transmit port bypassing any inactive or failed ports fibre channel hubs therefore have another function they provide bypass circuits that prevent the loop from breaking if one device fails or is removed if a device is removed from a loop for example by pulling its interconnect plug the hub s bypass circuit detects the absence of signal and immediately begins to route incoming data directly to the loop s next port bypassing the missing device entirely this gives loops at least a measure

notionally cru bourgeois is a level below cru class but still of high quality formerly there were additional grades of cru artisan and cru paysan many wine writers consider that there is some overlap in quality between the classed growths and the cru bourgeois although also saying that by and large the classed growths still represent the best wines the first cru bourgeois list was drawn up by the bordeaux chamber of commerce and chamber of agriculture in 1932 selecting 444 estates for the classification the words cru bourgeois were widely used on labels by the ch teaux so listed although the classification was never officially ratified a substantial revision of the classification dividing it into three tiers was initiated in 2000 and finalised in 2003 this reduced the number of ch teaux listed to 247 following several legal turns the 2003 cru bourgeois classification was annulled by the french court in 2007 and shortly afterwards all use of the term was banned in 2010 the cru bourgeois label was reintroduced but in a significantly revised form it now consists of only one level and is awarded annually as a mark of quality to wines rather than to ch teaux

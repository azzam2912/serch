it is considered the transitional work between the music he made with dizzy mizz lizzy and his solo music before its release christensen described the album as a rock album with material that is more timeless rather than time typical as was the case with dizzy mizz lizzy with room for solid rock a glittery edge and some ballads the vinyl edition of the album was re released through the record label parlophone on april 19 2014 christensen went through a difficult time in 1998 99 dealing with the break ups with dizzy mizz lizzy and with singer pernille rosendahl with whom he had been in a relationship since 1995 he used songwriting as a form of therapy to overcome this putting his feelings and thoughts to words as one normally would do in a diary but instead of lying hidden in a drawer somewhere his secrets are literally on display since his songwriting was derived from these personal experiences the lyrics are rather direct christensen says i simply think it was written in a simple and straightforward way almost bordering to banal the songs are rather ambiguous as to whether they refer to dizzy mizz lizzy or pernille rosendahl

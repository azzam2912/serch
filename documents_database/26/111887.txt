their usual purpose is to briefly power a high voltage flash tube used to illuminate a photographic subject or optically pump a laser rod as flash tubes require very high current for a very short time to operate photoflash capacitors are designed to supply high discharge current pulses without excessive internal heating the principal properties of a capacitor are capacitance working voltage equivalent series resistance esr equivalent series inductance esl and working temperature compared with electrolytic capacitors usually used for power supply filtering at power frequency a photoflash capacitor is designed to have lower esr esl and capacitance manufacturing tolerance but does not need as high a working temperature the light energy emitted by a flash is supplied by the capacitor and is proportional to the product of the capacitance and the voltage squared photoflash capacitors have capacitance in the range 80 160 microfarads f and voltages from 180 330 volts for flash units built into small disposable and compact cameras increasing for units delivering higher light energy a typical manufacturer s range includes capacitors operating at 330 380v with capacitance from 80 to 1 500 f while normal electrolytic capacitors are often operated at not more than half their

three phosphofructokinase isozymes exist in humans muscle liver and platelet these isozymes function as subunits of the mammalian tetramer phosphofructokinase which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose 6 phosphate to fructose 1 6 bisphosphate tetramer composition varies depending on tissue type this gene encodes the muscle type isozyme mutations in this gene have been associated with glycogen storage disease type vii also known as tarui disease alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described provided by refseq nov 2009 this gene is found on chromosome 12 the coding region in pfkm only shares a 68 similarity with that of the liver type pfkl this 85 kda protein is one of two subunit types that comprise the seven tetrameric pfk isozymes the muscle isozyme pfk 1 is composed solely of pfkm the liver pfk pfk 5 contains solely the second subunit type pfkl while the erythrocyte pfk includes five isozymes composed of different combinations of pfkm and pfkl these subunits evolved from a common prokaryotic ancestor via gene duplication and mutation events generally the n terminal of the subunits carries out their catalytic activity while the c terminal contains allosteric ligand binding sites in particular the binding site for the pfk inhibitor citrate

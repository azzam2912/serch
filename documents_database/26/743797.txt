a biofuel is a fuel produced from living organisms biofuels include bioethanol an alcohol made by fermentation often used as a gasoline additive and biodiesel which is usually used as a diesel additive specific energy is energy per unit mass which is used to describe the energy content of a fuel expressed in si units as joule per kilogram j kg or equivalent units energy density is the amount of energy stored in a fuel per unit volume expressed in si units as joule per litre j l or equivalent units the table below includes entries for popular substances already used for their energy or being discussed for such use the second column shows specific energy the energy content in megajoules per unit of mass in kilograms useful in understanding the energy that can be extracted from the fuel the third column in the table lists energy density the energy content per liter of volume which is useful for understanding the space needed for storing the fuel the final two columns deal with the carbon footprint of the fuel the fourth column contains the proportion of co released when the fuel is converted for energy with respect to its starting

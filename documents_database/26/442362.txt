lba arises when the amount of molecular or morphological change accumulated within a lineage is sufficient to cause that lineage to appear similar thus closely related to another long branched lineage solely because they have both undergone a large amount of change rather than because they are related by descent such bias is more common when the overall divergence of some taxa results in long branches within a phylogeny long branches are often attracted to the base of a phylogenetic tree because the lineage included to represent an outgroup is often also long branched the frequency of true lba is unclear and often debated and some authors view it as untestable and therefore irrelevant to empirical phylogenetic inference although often viewed as a failing of parsimony based methodology lba could in principle result from a variety of scenarios and be inferred under multiple analytical paradigms lba was first recognized as problematic when analyzing discrete morphological character sets under parsimony criteria however maximum likelihood analyses of dna or protein sequences are also susceptible a simple hypothetical example can be found in felsenstein 1978 where it is demonstrated that for certain unknown true trees some methods can show bias for grouping long

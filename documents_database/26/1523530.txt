one by which one of the players white or black can always force a victory or both can force a draw see solved game it also means more generally solving chess like games i e combinatorial games of perfect information such as infinite chess according to zermelo s theorem a hypothetically determinable optimal strategy does exist for chess and chess like games in a weaker sense solving chess may refer to proving which one of the three possible outcomes white wins black wins draw is the result of two perfect players without necessarily revealing the optimal strategy itself see indirect proof no complete solution for chess in either of the two senses is known nor is it expected that chess will be solved in the near future there is disagreement on whether the current exponential growth of computing power will continue long enough to someday allow for solving it by brute force i e by checking all possibilities endgame tablebases have solved chess to a limited degree determining perfect play in a number of endgames including all non trivial endgames with no more than seven pieces or pawns including the two kings one consequence of developing the 7 piece endgame

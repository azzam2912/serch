2006 found that the most primitive known euornithians the yanornithiformes had a mosaic of advanced and primitive features these species retained primitive features like gastralia belly ribs and a pubic symphysis they also showed the first fully modern pygostyles and the type specimen of yixianornis ivpp 13631 preserves eight elongated rectrices tail feathers in a modern arrangement no earlier pygostylians are known which preserve a fan of tail feathers of this sort instead they show only paired plumes or a tuft of short feathers the name euornithes has been used for a wide variety of avialan groups since it was first named by edward drinker cope in 1889 it was first defined as a clade in 1998 by paul sereno who made it the group of all animals closer to birds than to enantiornithes represented by sinornis this definition currently includes similar content as another widely used name ornithuromorpha named and defined by luis chiappe in 1999 as the common ancestor of patagopteryx vorona and ornithurae plus all of its descendants because one definition is node based and the other branch based ornithuromorpha is a slightly less inclusive group the cladogram below follows the results of a phylogenetic analysis by

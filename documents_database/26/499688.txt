the pressure gradient is a dimensional quantity expressed in units of pascals per metre pa m mathematically it is obtained by applying the del operator to a pressure function of position the negative gradient of pressure is known as the force density in petroleum geology and the petrochemical sciences pertaining to oil wells and more specifically within hydrostatics pressure gradients refer to the gradient of vertical pressure in a column of fluid within a wellbore and are generally expressed in pounds per square inch per foot psi ft this column of fluid is subject to the compound pressure gradient of the overlying fluids the path and geometry of the column is totally irrelevant only the vertical depth of the column has any relevance to the vertical pressure of any point within its column and the pressure gradient for any given true vertical depth the concept of a pressure gradient is a local characterisation of the air more generally of the fluid under investigation the pressure gradient is defined only at thse spatial scales at which pressure more generally fluid dynamics itself is defined within planetary atmospheres including the earth s the pressure gradient is a vector pointing roughly downwards because

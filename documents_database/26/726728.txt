phase locked loop frequency synthesizers make use of frequency dividers to generate a frequency that is a multiple of a reference frequency frequency dividers can be implemented for both analog and digital applications analog frequency dividers are less common and used only at very high frequencies digital dividers implemented in modern ic technologies can work up to tens of ghz a regenerative frequency divider also known as a miller frequency divider mixes the input signal with the feedback signal from the mixer the feedback signal is formula 4 this produces sum and difference frequencies formula 4 formula 6 at the output of the mixer a low pass filter removes the higher frequency and the formula 4 frequency is amplified and fed back into mixer a free running oscillator which has a small amount of a higher frequency signal fed to it will tend to oscillate in step with the input signal such frequency dividers were essential in the development of television it operates similarly to an injection locked oscillator in an injection locked frequency divider the frequency of the input signal is a multiple or fraction of the free running frequency of the oscillator while these frequency dividers tend to

it has the opposing effect of both hydrostatic blood pressure pushing water and small molecules out of the blood into the interstitial spaces within the arterial end of capillaries and interstitial colloidal osmotic pressure these interacting factors determine the partition balancing of total body extracellular water between the blood plasma and the larger extracellular water volume outside the blood stream it has a major effect on the pressure across the glomerular filter however this concept has been strongly criticised and attention has been shifted to the impact of the intravascular glycocalyx layer as the major player throughout the body dissolved compounds have an osmotic pressure because large plasma proteins cannot easily cross through the capillary walls their effect on the osmotic pressure of the capillary interiors will to some extent balance out the tendency for fluid to leak out of the capillaries in other words the oncotic pressure tends to pull fluid into the capillaries in conditions where plasma proteins are reduced e g from being lost in the urine proteinuria there will be a reduction in oncotic pressure and an increase in filtration across the capillary resulting in excess fluid buildup in the tissues edema the large majority of

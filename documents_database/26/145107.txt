it was one of a series of three prototypes falcon dp2 and lion eventually leading to the class 47 and class 50 a requirement was expressed by the btc at a meeting on 15 january 1960 for new type 4 designs of co co arrangement which would be lighter than the earlier 1co co1 locomotives such as the peak classes produced under the pilot scheme brush had a licence to build the maybach md655 engine as already used in the western region diesel hydraulics although their licence limited them to diesel electric locomotives these engines are of lower weight than their competitors which led brush to consider using a pair of them like the western hydraulics design work began in 1959 under contract n 04 20600 before the btc requirement had been issued british rail later assigned class 53 and the running number 1200 while not in any sense a failure the design was the victim of advances in locomotive technology specifically the power obtainable from single medium speed diesel engines and was never duplicated the falcon project began in 1959 to design a new lightweight diesel electric type 4 locomotive to meet a british railways requirement for second generation

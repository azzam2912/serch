it is a generalization of constructible topology in classical algebraic geometry in tale cohomology constructible sheaves are defined in a similar way a sheaf of abelian groups on a noetherian scheme is called constructible if the scheme has a finite cover by subschemes on which the sheaf is locally constant constructible meaning represented by an tale cover for the derived category of constructible sheaves see a section in adic sheaf the finiteness theorem in tale cohomology states that the higher direct images of a constructible sheaf are constructible most examples of constructible sheaves come from intersection cohomology sheaves or from the derived pushforward of a local system on a family of topological spaces parameterized by a base space one nice set of examples of constructible sheaves come from the derived pushforward with or without compact support of a local system on formula 2 since any loop around formula 3 is homotopic to a loop around formula 4 we only have to describe the monodromy around formula 5 and formula 6 for example we can set the monodromy operators to be where the stalks of our local system formula 8 are isomorphic to formula 9 then if we take the derived

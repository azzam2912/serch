various measures are taken for optical overheating protection stagnation temperatures are encountered under conditions of high radiation while no heat transfer fluid is flowing through the collector for example during power failures component failures servicing energy storage capacity limitations or periods when little hot water is extracted from the system more generally stagnation conditions can be considered to be any situation under which the solar collector cannot adequately dispatch the absorbed solar heat to the heat transfer fluid besides any damaging effects to the system high stagnation temperatures also place constraints on collector materials these materials must retain their important properties during and after exposure to the high stagnation temperatures this implies that solar collectors are generally built from high temperature resistant materials these materials are usually expensive heavy and have an overall high environmental impact polymeric materials offer a significant cost reduction and environmental improvement potential for solar thermal collectors and may thus benefit a broader utilization of solar energy for various heating purposes however the long term service temperature of plastics is limited thus for potential applications of plastics in solar absorbers an appropriate design including overheating protection is essential feasible ways would be a reduction in optical

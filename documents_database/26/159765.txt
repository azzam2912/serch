when done per function procedure the calling convention may require insertion of save restore around each call site in many programming languages the programmer may use any number of variables the computer can quickly read and write registers in the cpu so the computer program runs faster when more variables can be in the cpu s registers also sometimes code accessing registers is more compact so the code is smaller and can be fetched faster if it uses registers rather than memory however the number of registers is limited therefore when the compiler is translating code to machine language it must decide how to allocate variables to the limited number of registers in the cpu not all variables are in use or live at the same time so over the lifetime of a program a given register may be used to hold different variables however two variables in use at the same time cannot be assigned to the same register without corrupting one of the variables if there are not enough registers to hold all the variables some variables may be moved to and from ram this process is called spilling the registers over the lifetime of a program a

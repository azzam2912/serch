the main use for the chemical is as an antioxidant or chemical sterilant it is a disulfite and is chemically very similar to sodium metabisulfite with which it is sometimes used interchangeably potassium metabisulfite is generally preferred out of the two as it does not contribute sodium to the diet potassium metabisulfite has a monoclinic crystal structure which decomposes at 190 c yielding potassium sulfite and sulfur dioxide it is used as a food additive also known as e224 it is restricted in use and may cause allergic reactions in some sensitive persons potassium metabisulfite is an inhibitor of the polyphenol oxidase enzyme potassium metabisulfite is a common wine or must additive in which it forms sulfur dioxide gas so this both prevents most wild microorganisms from growing and it acts as a potent antioxidant protecting both the color and delicate flavors of wine a high dose would be 3 grams of potassium metabisulfite per six gallon bucket of must yielding roughly 75 ppm of so prior to fermentation then 6 grams per six gallon bucket 150 ppm of so at bottling most commercial wineries do not add more than 30 ppm at bottling some countries impose regulations on how

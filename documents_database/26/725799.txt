it has been treated as a subgenus within the genus cyathea but is accepted in the pteridophyte phylogeny group classification of 2016 ppg i species of sphaeropteris have a treelike habit usually with a single tall stem and large fronds to or more in length the stalk stipe of the frond is strawlike or purple in colour with pale to brown scales the sori spore bearing structures are rounded with or without indusia covers sphaeropteris is now separated from the other genera in the family cyatheaceae primarily on the basis of molecular phylogenetic studies however the scales on the stalks petioles provide a morphological distinction sphaeropteris has scales without distinct margins whereas the other genera have scales with distinct margins the genus sphaeropteris was erected by johann jakob bernhardi in 1801 it is placed in the family cyatheaceae the division of the family into genera has had a long and controversial history three or four clades have been suggested based on molecular phylogenetic studies the pteridophyte phylogeny group classification of 2016 ppg i accepts three genera related as shown in the cladogram below sphaeropteris is sister to the remaining members of the family older sources such as the new zealand

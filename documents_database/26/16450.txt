this is an unwanted phenomenon as the previous symbols have similar effect as noise thus making the communication less reliable the spreading of the pulse beyond its allotted time interval causes it to interfere with neighboring pulses isi is usually caused by multipath propagation or the inherent linear or non linear frequency response of a communication channel causing successive symbols to blur together the presence of isi in the system introduces errors in the decision device at the receiver output therefore in the design of the transmitting and receiving filters the objective is to minimize the effects of isi and thereby deliver the digital data to its destination with the smallest error rate possible ways to alleviate intersymbol interference include adaptive equalization and error correcting codes one of the causes of intersymbol interference is multipath propagation in which a wireless signal from a transmitter reaches the receiver via multiple paths the causes of this include reflection for instance the signal may bounce off buildings refraction such as through the foliage of a tree and atmospheric effects such as atmospheric ducting and ionospheric reflection since the various paths can be of different lengths this results in the different versions of the

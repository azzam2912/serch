application of high scan rate allows rapid acquisition of a voltammogram within several milliseconds and ensures high temporal resolution of this electroanalytical technique an acquisition rate of 10 hz is routinely employed fscv in combination with carbon fiber microelectrodes became a very popular method for detection of neurotransmitters hormones and metabolites in biological systems initially fscv was successfully used for detection of electrochemically active biogenic amines release in chromaffin cells adrenaline and noradrenaline brain slices 5 ht dopamine norepinephrine and in vivo in anesthetized or awake and behaving animals dopamine further refinements of the method have enabled detection of 5 ht norepinephrine adenosine oxygen ph changes in vivo in rats and mice as well as measurement of dopamine and serotonin concentration in fruit flies in fast scan cyclic voltammetry fscv a small carbon fiber electrode micrometer scale is inserted into living cells tissue or extracellular space the electrode is then used to quickly raise and lower the voltage in a triangular wave fashion when the voltage is in the correct range typically 1 volt the compound of interest will be repeatedly oxidized and reduced this will result in a movement of electrons in solution that will ultimately create a small

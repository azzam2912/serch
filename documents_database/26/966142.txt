in a narrower sense it may describe the dependence of one country on energy resources from another country energy dependence has been identified as one of several factors energy sources diversification energy suppliers diversification energy sources fungibility energy transport market liquidity energy resources political stability energy intensity energy dependence gdp negatively contributing to energy security generally a higher level of energy dependence is associated with higher risk because of the possible interference of trade regulations international armed conflicts terrorist attacks etc a crucial contribution on the road to energy independence is energy efficiency because efficient use of energy can build on individual efforts in power saving instead of having to rely on costly large scale infrastructure energy independence while being attempted by large or resource rich and economically strong countries like the united states russia china and the near and middle east is an idealized status that at present can only be approximated through non sustainable exploitation of a country s non renewable natural resources another factor in reducing dependence is the addition of renewable energy sources to the energy mix usually a country will rely on local and global energy renewable and non renewable resources a mixed model solution

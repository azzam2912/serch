mstp uses bpdus to exchange information between spanning tree compatible devices to prevent loops in each msti multiple spanning tree instances and in the cist common and internal spanning tree by selecting active and blocked paths this is done as well as in stp without the need of manually enabling backup links and getting rid of bridge loops danger moreover mstp allows frames packets assigned to different vlans to follow separate paths each based on an independent msti within mst regions composed of lans and or mst bridges these regions and the other bridges and lans are connected into a single common spanning tree cst it was originally defined in ieee 802 1s as an amendment to 802 1q 1998 edition and later merged into ieee 802 1q 2005 standard clearly defines an extension or an evolution of radia perlman s spanning tree protocol stp and the rapid spanning tree protocol rstp it has some similarities with cisco systems multiple instances spanning tree protocol mistp but there are some differences the original stp and rstp work on the physical link level preventing bridge loops when redundant paths are present however when a lan is virtualized using vlan trunking each physical

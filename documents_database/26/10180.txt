speculation of thomas jefferson abraham lincoln and william howard taft being atheists was reported during election campaigns while others such as jimmy carter used faith as a defining aspect of their campaigns and tenure to hold the office almost all of the presidents can be characterized as christian at least by upbringing though some were unaffiliated with any specific religious body protestants predominate with episcopalians and presbyterians being the most prevalent there have been four nontrinitarian presidents and a single roman catholic president john f kennedy no president has openly identified as atheist three presidents jefferson lincoln and andrew johnson had no religious affiliation most presidents have been formal members of a particular church or religious body and a specific affiliation can be assigned to every president from james a garfield on for many earlier presidents however formal church membership was forestalled until they left office and in several cases a president never joined any church conversely though every president from george washington to john quincy adams can be definitely assigned membership in an anglican or unitarian body the significance of these affiliations is often downplayed as unrepresentative of their true beliefs the pattern of religious adherence has changed dramatically

this type of receiver was popular in the 1920s early examples could be tedious to operate because when tuning in a station each stage had to be individually adjusted to the station s frequency but later models had ganged tuning the tuning mechanisms of all stages being linked together and operated by just one control knob by the mid 1930s it was replaced by the superheterodyne receiver patented by edwin armstrong the trf receiver was patented in 1916 by ernst alexanderson his concept was that each stage would amplify the desired signal while reducing the interfering ones multiple stages of rf amplification would make the radio more sensitive to weak stations and the multiple tuned circuits would give it a narrower bandwidth and more selectivity than the single stage receivers common at that time all tuned stages of the radio must track and tune to the desired reception frequency this is in contrast to the modern superheterodyne receiver that must only tune the receiver s rf front end and local oscillator to the desired frequencies all the following stages work at a fixed frequency and do not depend on the desired reception frequency antique trf receivers can often be identified

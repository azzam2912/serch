the term has two different meanings in separate areas of electrical engineering in antenna theory a ground plane is a conducting surface large in comparison to the wavelength such as the earth which is connected to the transmitter s ground wire and serves as a reflecting surface for radio waves in printed circuit boards a ground plane is a large area of copper foil on the board which is connected to the power supply ground terminal and serves as a return path for current from different components on the board in telecommunication a ground plane is a flat or nearly flat horizontal conducting surface that serves as part of an antenna to reflect the radio waves from the other antenna elements the plane does not necessarily have to be connected to ground ground plane shape and size play major roles in determining its radiation characteristics including gain to function as a ground plane the conducting surface must be at least a quarter of the wavelength 4 of the radio waves in diameter in lower frequency antennas such as the mast radiators used for broadcast antennas the earth itself or a body of water such as a salt marsh or ocean

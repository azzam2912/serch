the process is based on the principle that precious metals do not oxidise or react chemically unlike the base metals so when they are heated at high temperatures the precious metals remain apart and the others react forming slags or other compounds since the early bronze age the process was used to obtain silver from smelted lead ores by the middle ages and the renaissance cupellation was one of the most common processes for refining precious metals by then fire assays were used for assaying minerals that is testing fresh metals such as lead and recycled metals to know their purity for jewellery and coin making cupellation is still in use today native silver is a rare element although it exists as such it is usually found in nature combined with other metals or in minerals that contain silver compounds generally in the form of sulfides such as galena lead sulfide or cerussite lead carbonate so the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores lead melts at 327 c lead oxide at 888 c and silver melts at 960 c to separate the silver the alloy is melted again at the high temperature

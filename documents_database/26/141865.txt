a distinct article discusses the spin representations the spin group is used in physics to describe the symmetries of electrically neutral uncharged fermions its complexification spinc is used to describe electrically charged fermions most notably the electron strictly speaking the spin group describes a fermion in a zero dimensional space but of course space is not zero dimensional and so the spin group is used to define spin structures on pseudo riemannian manifolds the spin group is the structure group of a spinor bundle the affine connection on a spinor bundle is the spin connection the spin connection is useful as it can simplify and bring elegance to many intricate calculations in general relativity the spin connection in turn enables the dirac equation to be written in curved spacetime effectively in the tetrad coordinates which in turn provides a footing for quantum gravity as well as a formalization of hawking radiation where one of a pair of entangled virtual fermions fall past the event horizon and the other does not in short the spin group is a vital cornerstone centrally important for understanding advanced concepts in modern theoretical physics in mathematics the spin group is interesting in its own right

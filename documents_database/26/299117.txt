by mathematical necessity there must also be unstable equilibrium points between the stable points points that are stable in some dimensions and unstable in others are termed unstable as is the case with the first three lagrangian points bistability is the special case with two stable equilibrium points it is the simplest form of multistability and can occur in systems with only one state variable as it only takes a one dimensional space to separate two points near an unstable equilibrium any system will be sensitive to noise initial conditions and system parameters which can cause it to develop in one of multiple divergent directions in economics and social sciences path dependence gives rise to divergent directions of development some path dependent processes are adequately described by multistability by being initially sensitive to input before reaching a stagnant state for example market share instability which can develop into a stable monopoly for one of multiple possible vendors in vision science multistable perception characterizes the wavering percepts that can be brought about by certain visually ambiguous pattern such as the necker cube monocular rivalry or binocular rivalry through lateral inhibition a pattern in which one image when stimulated inhibit the activity

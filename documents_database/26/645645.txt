these primary transporters are enzymes that convert energy from various sources including adenosine triphosphate atp sunlight and other redox reactions to potential energy stored in an electrochemical gradient this potential energy is then used by secondary transporters including ion carriers and ion channels to drive vital cellular processes such as atp synthesis ion transporters are classified as a super family of transporters that contain 12 families of transporters these families are part of the transport classification tc system that is used by the international union of biochemistry and molecular biology iubmb and are grouped according to characteristics such as the substrates being transported the transport mechanism the energy source used and also by comparing the dna sequences making up each protein the most important unifying factor being the charged nature of the substrate which indicates the transport of an ion and not a neutral species ion transporters differ significantly from ion channels an electrochemical gradient or concentration gradient is a difference in concentration of a chemical molecule or ion in two separate areas at equilibrium the concentrations of the ion in both areas will be equal so if there is a difference in concentration the ions will seek to flow

the internal shape may be convergent or convergent divergent c d c d nozzles can accelerate the jet to supersonic velocities within the divergent section whereas a convergent nozzle cannot accelerate the jet beyond sonic speed propelling nozzles may have a fixed geometry or they may have variable geometry to give different exit areas to control the operation of the engine when equipped with an afterburner or a reheat system when afterburning engines are equipped with a c d nozzle the throat area is variable nozzles for supersonic flight speeds at which high nozzle pressure ratios are generated also have variable area divergent sections turbofan engines may have an additional and separate propelling nozzle which further accelerates the bypass air propelling nozzles also act as downstream restrictors the consequences of which constitute an important aspect of engine design convergent nozzles are used on many jet engines if the nozzle pressure ratio is above the critical value about 1 8 1 a convergent nozzle will choke resulting in some of the expansion to atmospheric pressure taking place downstream of the throat i e smallest flow area in the jet wake although jet momentum still produces much of the gross thrust the

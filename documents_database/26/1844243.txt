the frame rate is the number of pictures displayed in one second but each frame is actually scanned twice interleaving odd and even lines each scan is known as a field odd and even fields so field rate is twice the frame rate in each frame there are 625 lines or 312 5 lines in a field so line rate line frequency is 625 times the frame frequency or 625 25 15625 hz the rf parameters of the transmitted signal are almost the same as those for system b which is used on the 7 0 mhz wide channels of the vhf bands the only difference to the rf spectrum of the signal is that the vestigial sideband is 500 khz wider at 1 25 mhz due to this and the extra width of the channel allocations at uhf the width of the guard band between the channels is 650 khz assuming the worst case which is when nicam sound is in use many countries use a variant of system h which is known as system g system g is similar to system h but the lower vestigial side band is 500 khz narrower this makes poor use of the

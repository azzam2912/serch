the cases and have been known since antiquity to have an infinite number of solutions the proposition was first conjectured by pierre de fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of arithmetica fermat added that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin however there were first doubts about it since the publication was done by his son without his consent after fermat s death after 358 years of effort by mathematicians the first successful proof was released in 1994 by andrew wiles and formally published in 1995 it was described as a stunning advance in the citation for wiles s abel prize award in 2016 it also proved much of the modularity theorem and opened up entire new approaches to numerous other problems and mathematically powerful modularity lifting techniques the unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century it is among the most notable theorems in the history of mathematics and prior to its proof was in the guinness book of world records as the most difficult mathematical problem in part because the theorem has the

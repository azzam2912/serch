examples include echolocation of bats and dolphins and insect antennae using self generated energy allows more control over signal intensity direction timing and spectral characteristics by contrast passive sensory systems involve activation by ambient energy that is energy that is preexisting in the environment rather than generated by the user for example human vision relies on using light from the environment active sensory systems receive information with or without direct contact teleceptive active sensory systems collect information by directing propagating energy and detecting objects using cues such as time delay and intensity of return signal examples include echolocation of bats and electrosensory detection of electric fish contact active sensory systems use physical contact between stimuli and organism insect antennae and whiskers are examples of contact active sensory systems bioluminescence adult firefly uses self generated light to locate mates in deep oceans barbeled dragonfish produces near infrared light electrostatic field electric fishes probe the environment and create active electrodynamic imaging active touching nocturnal animals depend on whiskers to navigate by gathering information about position size shape orientation and texture of objects insects use antennae to probe the environment during locomotion human s reaching out to objects with hands is an analogy

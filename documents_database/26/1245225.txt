it is sometimes possible to construct a fundamental solution from a parametrix by iteratively improving it it is useful to review what a fundamental solution for a differential operator with constant coefficients is it is a distribution on such that in the weak sense where is the dirac delta distribution in a similar way a parametrix for a variable coefficient differential operator is a distribution such that where is some function with compact support the parametrix is a useful concept in the study of elliptic differential operators and more generally of hypoelliptic pseudodifferential operators with variable coefficient since for such operators over appropriate domains a parametrix can be shown to exist can be somewhat easily constructed and be a smooth function away from the origin having found the analytic expression of the parametrix it is possible to compute the solution of the associated fairly general elliptic partial differential equation by solving an associated fredholm integral equation also the structure itself of the parametrix reveals properties of the solution of the problem without even calculating it like its smoothness and other qualitative properties more generally if is any pseudodifferential operator of order then another pseudodifferential operator of order is called a

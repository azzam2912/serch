the genus cladophora contains many species that are very hard to tell apart and classify mainly because of the great variation in their appearances which is affected by habitat age and environmental conditions unlike spirogyra the filaments of cladophora branch and do not undergo conjugation there are two multicellular stages in its life cycle a haploid gametophyte and a diploid sporophyte which look highly similar the only way to tell the two stages apart is to either count their chromosomes or examine their offspring the haploid gametophyte produces haploid gametes by mitosis and the diploid sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis the only visible difference between the gametes and spores of cladophora is that the gametes have two flagella and the spores have four the cladophora species can be a major nuisance causing major alteration to benthic conditions linked particularly with increased phosphorus loading cladophora balls are formed from the filaments of the alga which are photosynthetic large numbers of these balls were thrown ashore in devon england they had an average diameter of 2 5 cm and several million balls were found forming a layer this is not to be confused with marimo though formerly part of cladophora is

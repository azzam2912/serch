are a set of tensor invariants that span the space of real symmetric second order 3 dimensional tensors and are isomorphic with respect to principal stress space this right handed orthogonal coordinate system is named in honor of the german scientist dr walter lode because of his seminal paper written in 1926 describing the effect of the middle principal stress on metal plasticity other examples of sets of tensor invariants are the set of principal stresses formula 3 or the set of kinematic invariants formula 4 the lode coordinate system can be described as a cylindrical coordinate system within principal stress space with a coincident origin and the z axis parallel to the vector formula 5 the lode coordinates are most easily computed using the mechanics invariants these invariants are a mixture of the invariants of the cauchy stress tensor formula 6 and the stress deviator formula 7 and are given by which can be written equivalently in einstein notation where formula 14 is the levi civita symbol or permutation symbol and the last two forms for formula 15 are equivalent because formula 7 is symmetric formula 17 the gradients of these invariants can be calculated by where formula 21

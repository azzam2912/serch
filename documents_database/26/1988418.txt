in general a rotor may spin about an axis which is aligned substantially vertically fore and aft or side to side spanwise all three classes have been studied for use as lifting rotors and several variations have been flown on full size aircraft although only the vertical axis rotary wing has become widespread on rotorcraft such as the helicopter some types provide lift at zero forward airspeed allowing for vertical takeoff and landing vtol as in the helicopter others especially unpowered free spinning types require forward airspeed in the same manner as a fixed wing aircraft as in the autogyro many can also provide forward thrust if required many ingenious ways have been devised to convert the spinning of a rotor into aerodynamic lift the various types of such rotor wings may be classified according to the axis of the rotor types include conventional rotorcraft have vertical axis rotors the main types include the helicopter with powered rotors providing both lift and thrust and the autogyro with unpowered rotors providing lift only there are also various hybrid types especially the gyrodyne which has both a powered rotor and independent forward propulsion and the stopped rotor in which the rotor stops

in the early instances of the os these sections were brought into the input output supervisor s transient area not unlike the os 360 control program s supervisor call transient areas in post mvt instances of the os these sections are located in the pageable linkpack area plpa and are demand paged the sole exception is of course the erp for direct access storage devices which must always remain resident in order to recover from possible i o errors on the ipl volume and on other volumes which contain datasets which may be concatenated with certain system datasets ios is designed around a multi programming concept whereby operations on different i o channels control units and devices may be managed concurrently and apparently simultaneously this concurrency and apparent simultaneity is present even in the most basic version of the os pcp which otherwise supports only one user task as the underlying hardware architecture has but one set of i o instructions and but one i o interruption for accessing the devices and for accessing the resulting device status respectively available to support all attached i o devices hence all i o device operations must be synchronously multiplexed in to the

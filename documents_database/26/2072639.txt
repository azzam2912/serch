this phenomenon would be imperceptible in areas of relatively low gravity such as earth but would be significant in areas of extremely high gravity such as a black hole as such the theory claims to disprove that the universe has a beginning or big bang as the big bang theory calls for all wavelengths of light to be impacted by gravity to the same extent the theory was first proposed in 2003 by physicists lee smolin and jo o magueijo and claims to bridge the gap between general relativity and quantum mechanics scientists are currently attempting to detect rainbow gravity using the large hadron collider rainbow gravity theory s origin is largely the product of the disparity between general relativity and quantum mechanics more specifically locality or the concept of cause and effect that drives the principles of general relativity is mathematically irreconcilable with quantum mechanics this issue is due to incompatible functions between the two fields in particular the fields apply radically different mathematical approaches in describing the concept of curvature in four dimensional space time historically this mathematical split begins with the disparity between einstein s theories of relativity which saw physics through the lens of causality and

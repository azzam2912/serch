it is one of the principal oxides of nitrogen nitric oxide is a free radical i e it has an unpaired electron which is sometimes denoted by a dot in its chemical formula i e no nitric oxide is also a heteronuclear diatomic molecule a historic class that drew researches which spawned early modern theories of chemical bonding an important intermediate in chemical industry nitric oxide forms in combustion systems and can be generated by lightning in thunderstorms in mammals including humans nitric oxide is a signaling molecule in many physiological and pathological processes it was proclaimed the molecule of the year in 1992 the 1998 nobel prize in physiology or medicine was awarded for discovering nitric oxide s role as a cardiovascular signalling molecule nitric oxide should not be confused with nitrous oxide no an anesthetic or with nitrogen dioxide no a brown gas and major air pollutant upon condensing to a liquid nitric oxide dimerizes to dinitrogen dioxide but the association is weak and reversible the n n distance in crystalline no is 218 pm nearly twice the n o distance since the heat of formation of no is endothermic no can be decomposed to the elements catalytic

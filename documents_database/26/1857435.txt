for example cells must be able to detect when they are in physical contact with other cells in order to regulate their growth and avoid the generation of tumors carcinogenesis in order to do so cells place receptor molecules on their surface often with a section of the receptor exposed to the outside of the cell extracellular environment and a section inside the cell intracellular environment these molecules are exposed to the environment outside of the cell and therefore in position to sense it they are called receptors because when these come into contact with particular molecules termed ligands then chemical changes are induced to the receptor these changes typically involve alterations in the three dimensional shape of the receptor these 3d structure changes affect both the extracellular and intracellular parts domains of the receptor as a result interaction of a receptor with its specific ligand which is located outside of the cell causes changes to the receptor part which is inside the cell a signal from the extracellular space therefore can affect the biochemical state inside the cell following receptor activation by the ligand several steps can sequentially ensue for example the 3d shape changes to the intracellular domain

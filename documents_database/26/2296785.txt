generally these are secondary tertiary and other subsequent immune responses to the same antigen immunological memory is responsible for the adaptive component of the immune system special t and b cells the so called memory t and b cells immunological memory is the basis of vaccination immunological memory occurs after a primary immune response against the antigen immunological memory is thus created by each individual after a previous initial exposure to a potentially dangerous agent the course of secondary immune response is similar to primary immune response after the memory b cell recognizes the antigen it presents the peptide mhc ii complex to nearby effector t cells that leads to activation of these cells and rapid proliferation of cells after the primary immune response has disappeared the effector cells of the immune response are eliminated however there remain antibodies previously created in the body that represent the humoral component of immunological memory and comprise an important defensive mechanism in subsequent infections in addition to the formed antibodies in the body there remains a small number of memory t and b cells that make up the cellular component of the immunological memory they stay in the body in a resting state

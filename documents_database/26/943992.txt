the axes must all pass through a single point in the plane define perpendicular axes formula 1 formula 2 and formula 3 which meet at origin formula 4 so that the body lies in the formula 5 plane and the formula 3 axis is perpendicular to the plane of the body let i i and i be moments of inertia about axis x y z respectively the perpendicular axis theorem states that this rule can be applied with the parallel axis theorem and the stretch rule to find polar moments of inertia for a variety of shapes if a planar object or prism by the stretch rule has rotational symmetry such that formula 8 and formula 9 are equal then the perpendicular axes theorem provides the useful relationship working in cartesian co ordinates the moment of inertia of the planar body about the formula 3 axis is given by on the plane formula 13 so these two terms are the moments of inertia about the formula 1 and formula 2 axes respectively giving the perpendicular axis theorem the converse of this theorem is also derived similarly note that formula 16 because in formula 17 r measures the distance from the

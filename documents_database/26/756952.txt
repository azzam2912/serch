the following version was collected from george blake bitterne southampton hants in may 1906 i once loved a boy and a bonny bonny boy i loved him i vow and protest i loved him so well there s no tongue can tell till i built him a berth on my breast twas up the wild forest and through the green groves like one that was troubled in mind i hallooed i whooped and i blew on my flute but no bonny boy could i find i looked up high and i looked down low the weather being wonderful warm and who should i spy but my own bonny boy locked fast in another girl s arms he took me upon his assembled knees and looked me quite hard in the face he gave unto me one sweet smile and a kiss but his heart s in another girl s breast now my bonny bonny boy is across the salt seas and i hope he will safely return but if he loves another girl better than me let him take her and why should i mourn now the girl that enjoys my own bonny boy she is not to be blamed

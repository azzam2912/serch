these properties describe the functions behaviour under certain conditions a parabola is a specific type of function these properties concern the domain the codomain and the range of functions these properties concern how the function is affected by arithmetic operations on its operand the following are special examples of a homomorphism on a binary operation relative to negation relative to a binary operation and an order relative to topology and order relative to measure and topology in general functions are often defined by specifying the name of a dependent variable and a way of calculating what it should map to for this purpose the formula 1 symbol or church s formula 2 is often used also sometimes mathematicians notate a function s domain and codomain by writing e g formula 3 these notions extend directly to lambda calculus and type theory respectively these are functions that operate on functions or produce other functions see higher order function examples are category theory is a branch of mathematics that formalizes the notion of a special function via arrows or morphisms a category is an algebraic object that abstractly consists of a class of objects and for every pair of objects a set

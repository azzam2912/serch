the purpose of a turbopump is to produce a high pressure fluid for feeding a combustion chamber or other use there are two types of turbopumps a centrifugal pump where the pumping is done by throwing fluid outward at high speed or an axial flow pump where alternating rotating and static blades progressively raise the pressure of a fluid axial flow pumps have small diameters but give relatively modest pressure increases although multiple compression stages are needed axial flow pumps work well with low density fluids centrifugal pumps are far more powerful for high density fluids but require large diameters for low density fluids turbopumps operate in much the same way as turbocharger units for vehicles higher fuel pressures allow fuel to be supplied to higher pressure combustion chambers for higher performance engines high pressure pumps for larger missiles had been discussed by rocket pioneers such as hermann oberth in mid 1935 wernher von braun initiated a fuel pump project at the southwest german firm klein schanzlin becker that was experienced in building large fire fighting pumps the v 2 rocket design used hydrogen peroxide decomposed through a walter steam generator to power the uncontrolled turbopump produced at the heinkel

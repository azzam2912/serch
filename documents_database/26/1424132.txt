by measuring the radial velocities of its members the velocity dispersion of a cluster can be estimated and used to derive the cluster s mass from the virial theorem radial velocity is found by measuring the doppler width of spectral lines of a collection of objects the more radial velocities one measures the more accurately one knows their dispersion a central velocity dispersion refers to the of the interior regions of an extended object such as a galaxy or cluster the relationship between velocity dispersion and matter or the observed electromagnetic radiation emitted by this matter takes several forms in astronomy based on the object s being observed for instance the m relation was found for material circling black holes the faber jackson relation for elliptical galaxies and the tully fisher relation for spiral galaxies for example the found for objects about the milky way s supermassive black hole smbh is about 75 km s the andromeda galaxy messier 31 hosts a smbh about 10 times larger than our own and has a 160 km s groups and clusters of galaxies have a wider range of velocity dispersions than smaller objects for example our own poor group the local group

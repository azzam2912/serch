the mission tested technologies needed for the laser interferometer space antenna lisa an esa gravitational wave observatory planned to be launched in 2034 the scientific phase started on 8 march 2016 and lasted almost sixteen months in april 2016 esa announced that lisa pathfinder demonstrated that the lisa mission is feasible the estimated mission cost was 400 million lisa pathfinder placed two test masses in a nearly perfect gravitational free fall and controlled and measured their relative motion with unprecedented accuracy the laser interferometer measured the relative position and orientation of the masses to an accuracy of less than 0 01 nanometres a technology estimated to be sensitive enough to detect gravitational waves by the follow on mission the laser interferometer space antenna lisa the interferometer was a model of one arm of the final lisa interferometer but reduced from millions of kilometers long to 40 cm the reduction did not change the accuracy of the relative position measurement nor did it affect the various technical disturbances produced by the spacecraft surrounding the experiment whose measurement was the main goal of lisa pathfinder the sensitivity to gravitational waves however is proportional to the arm length and this is reduced several

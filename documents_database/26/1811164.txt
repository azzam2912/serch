in april 1974 the resulting rusw 200 prototype first led to the development of a sliding two band compander by ernst f schr der of telefunken grundlagenlaboratorium hannover since july 1974 however the finally released high com system which was marketed by telefunken since 1978 worked as a broadband 2 1 2 compander achieving almost 15 db of noise reduction for low and up to 20 db rms a weighted for higher frequencies while avoiding most of the acoustic problems observed with other high compression broadband companders such as emt noisebx or dbx in order to facilitate cost effective mass production in consumer devices such as cassette decks the compander system was integrated into an analogue ic tfk u401b u401bg u401br developed by dietrich h ppner and kurt hintzmann of heilbronn with minimal changes in the external circuitry the ic could also be used to emulate a mostly dolby b compatible compander as in the dnr dynamic noise reduction system for backward compatibility consequently second generation tape decks with high com incorporated a dnr expander as well whereas in some late generation telefunken asc and universum tape decks this even worked during recording but was left undocumented for legal reasons

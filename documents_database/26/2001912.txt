it is a star very similar to our sun with the same spectral type g2v it has 68 of the sun s luminosity 92 of its mass and 78 of its diameter it is estimated to be around 2 billion years old and it has a lower metallicity 43 that of the sun with an apparent visual magnitude of 8 81 it is too faint to be seen with the unaided eye and is located around 170 light years 52 parsecs away from the solar system hd 41248 was investigated in the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher harps and initially thought not to have planets but review of its spectrum showed it to have two super earths with orbital periods of 18 357 days and 25 648 days and minimum masses 12 3 and 8 6 times that of the earth the planets are in a 7 5 mean motion resonance the existence of the planets has been called into question as being a possible false detection due to stellar activity with a cycle of 25 days related to the star s rotational period the original researchers conceded small planet signals could be difficult to unravel from signal noise

prmt5 symmetrically dimethylates h2ar3 h4r3 h3r2 and h3r8 in vivo all of which are linked to a range of transcriptional regulatory events cell mol life sci 2015 72 2041 2059 doi 10 1007 s00018 015 1847 9 prmt5 is a highly conserved arginine methyltransferase that translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at embryonic day e8 5 and during preimplantation development at the 4 cell stage model organisms have been used in the study of prmt5 function a conditional knockout mouse line called prmt5 was generated as part of the international knockout mouse consortium program a high throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion twenty five tests were carried out on mutant mice and two significant abnormalities were observed no homozygous mutant embryos were identified during gestation and therefore none survived until weaning the remaining tests were carried out on heterozygous mutant adult mice but no further abnormalities were observed a conditional allele of prmt5 in the mouse limb shows that it is essential for maintaining a progenitor population as conditional mutants have limb defects protein arginine methyltransferase

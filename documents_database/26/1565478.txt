it is an opaque data structure that is used by the operating system internally most of whose fields are not intended for use by anything other than the operating system microsoft notes in its msdn library documentation which documents only a few of the fields that the structure may be altered in future versions of windows the peb contains data structures that apply across a whole process including global context startup parameters data structures for the program image loader the program image base address and synchronization objects used to provide mutual exclusion for process wide data structures the peb is closely associated with the kernel mode data structure as well as with per process data structures managed within the address space of the client server runtime sub system process however like the csrss data structures the peb is not a kernel mode data structure itself it resides in the application mode address space of the process that it relates to this is because it is designed to be used by the application mode code in the operating system libraries such as ntdll that executes outside of kernel mode such as the code for the program image loader and the heap

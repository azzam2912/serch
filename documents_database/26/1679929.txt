in 1599 edward wright evaluated the integral by numerical methods what today we would call riemann sums he wanted the solution for the purposes of cartography specifically for constructing an accurate mercator projection in the 1640s henry bond a teacher of navigation surveying and other mathematical topics compared wright s numerically computed table of values of the integral of the secant with a table of logarithms of the tangent function and consequently conjectured that that conjecture became widely known and in 1665 isaac newton was aware of it although gregory proved the conjecture in 1668 in his exercitationes geometricae the proof was presented in a form that renders it nearly impossible for modern readers to comprehend isaac barrow in his geometrical lectures of 1670 gave the first intelligible proof though even that was couched in the geometric idiom of the day barrow s proof of the result was the earliest use of partial fractions in integration adapted to modern notation barrow s proof began as follows substituting formula 3 for formula 4 reduces the integral to therefore the second of these follows by first multiplying top and bottom of the interior fraction by formula 7 this gives formula 8 in

in a topological space a closed set can be defined as a set which contains all its limit points in a complete metric space a closed set is a set which is closed under the limit operation in a topological space a set is closed if and only if it coincides with its closure equivalently a set is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points yet another equivalent definition is that a set is closed if and only if it contains all of its boundary points this is not to be confused with a closed manifold a closed set contains its own boundary in other words if you are outside a closed set you may move a small amount in any direction and still stay outside the set note that this is also true if the boundary is the empty set e g in the metric space of rational numbers for the set of numbers of which the square is less than 2 in fact given a set x and a collection f of subsets of x that has these properties then f will be the collection of closed sets for a unique topology on

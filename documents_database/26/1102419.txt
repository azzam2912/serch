haiti declared its independence from france in the aftermath of the first successful slave revolution in the americas in 1804 and their identification as conquerors of a racially repressed society is a theme echoed throughout haiti s history haiti has a unique history of racial ideology during its colonial period class structure shifted from one based on wealth to divisions distinguished by race once accepted as elite families of african descent were rejected because of racist stereotypes this regression shaped the evolution of the haitian revolution as peoples of african descent rose up against the white colonial planters haitians are primarily of african descent but a lot of haitians are also of the indigenous taino descent arawak native indians which inhabited the island prior to christopher columbus s arrival the taino were nearly wiped out due to diseases the europeans brought with them and because of cruel practices including slavery the tainos fled to the mountains just before the africans arrived on the island mixing between the remaining tainos and some of the africans occurred and it is believed a lot of haitians in present day have some ancestral links to the indigenous tainos as part of the french empire

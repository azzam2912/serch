in general it is best to keep related items together the linux ext2 and ext3 filesystems for instance have tried to spread directories on the cylinders of the disk imagine setting up a system with users home directories in home if all the first level directories within home i e the home directories for numerous users are placed next to each other there may be no space left for the contents of those directories user files thus end up being placed far from the directories that contain them and performance suffers spreading directories on the disc allows files in the same directory to remain more or less contiguous as their number and or size grows but there are some situations where this causes excessive spreading of the data on the disc s surface essentially the orlov algorithm tries to spread out top level directories on the assumption that they are unrelated to each other directories created in the root directory of a filesystem are considered top level directories theodore ts o added a special inode flag that allows the system administrator to mark other directories as being top level directories as well if home lives in the root filesystem and

the intersection owes this name to the dangerously poor visibility caused by the three railway overpasses immediately to the north east and west of it and by concrete retaining walls on all four corners more than 250 serious accidents were reported at that intersection between 1992 and 2002 the configuration of this intersection makes it nearly impossible for police to enforce traffic laws in september 2001 then minister of transportation guy chevrette cited this particular intersection as an example of a place where it is too dangerous to post a patrol car and highway code enforcement would thus benefit from the use of photo radar finally on april 4 2002 roadwork to make the intersection safer began with the demolition of one of the three overpasses the one above saint joseph boulevard just west of the intersection it has been speculated that the remaining two overpasses would be eventually demolished as well but to this day they are still in place a major canadian pacific railway line uses these two overpasses making it impossible to demolish them in the short term according to the minist re des transports du qu bec the tunnel should have been completely demolished and reconstructed

they are commonly used to replace piston compressors where large volumes of high pressure air are needed either for large industrial applications or to operate high power air tools such as jackhammers and impact wrenches for smaller rotor sizes the inherent leakage in the rotors becomes much more significant becoming less practical than piston types for smaller volume air compressors the gas compression process of a rotary screw is a continuous sweeping motion so there is very little pulsation or surging of flow as occurs with piston compressors this also allows screw compressors to be significantly quieter and produce much less vibration than piston compressors rotary screw compressors use two meshing helical screws known as rotors to compress the gas in a dry running rotary screw compressor timing gears ensure that the male and female rotors maintain precise alignment in an oil flooded rotary screw compressor lubricating oil bridges the space between the rotors both providing a hydraulic seal and transferring mechanical energy between the driving and driven rotor gas enters at the suction side and moves through the threads as the screws rotate the meshing rotors force the gas through the compressor and the gas exits at the end

degrees from duke university are in electrical engineering he also holds a d science degree from the university of warwick and a d engineering degree from university of technology sydney in addition he has been awarded honorary doctorates from uppsala university and from the university of salamanca his initial research projects investigated sound source localization in humans and bats and the effects of microwave radiation on the auditory system in 1977 he began work as a research engineer at the research triangle institute rti he was the head of the rti neuroscience program 1983 1994 the director of the center for auditory prosthesis research 1994 2002 and was a senior fellow 2002 07 in 1983 wilson received the first of seven contracts 1983 2005 from the neural prosthesis branch of the national institutes of health nih to investigate sound coding strategies for cochlear implants this long period of continuous funding allowed him to investigate multiple signal coding strategies the best known is the high rate continuous interleaved sampling cis processor among many other features cis presents non simultaneous pulses to the different electrodes in the implant which greatly reduces deleterious interactions or crosstalk among the electrodes other signal coding strategies

it is involved in the phosphophatidylinositol pi signaling pathway which affects a wide array of cell functions including but not limited to cell growth apoptosis secretion and information processing inhibition of inositol monophosphatase may be key in the action of lithium in treating bipolar disorder specifically manic depression the enzyme is a dimer comprising 277 amino acid residues per subunit each dimer exists in 5 layers of alternating helices and sheets totaling to 9 helices and sheets per subunit impase has three hydrophilic hollow active sites each of which bind water and magnesium molecules these binding sites appear to be conserved in other phosphodiesterases such as fructose 1 6 bisphosphatase fbpase and inositol polyphosphate 1 phosphatase it was previously reported that the hydrolysis of inositol monophosphate was catalyzed by impase through a 2 magnesium ion mechanism however a recent 1 4 a resolution crystal structure shows 3 magnesium ions coordinating in each active binding site of the 2 dimers supporting a 3 magnesium ion mechanism the mechanism for hydrolysis is now thought to proceed as such the enzyme is activated by a magnesium ion binding to binding site i containing three water molecules and stabilized by the negative charges on

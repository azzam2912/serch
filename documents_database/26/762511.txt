these materials are named after reuben d rieke who first described the recipes for their preparation among the many metals that have been generated by this method are mg ca ti fe co ni cu zn and in which in turn are called rieke magnesium rieke calcium etc rieke metals are highly reactive because they have high surface area and lack surface oxides that can retard reaction of bulk materials the particles are very small ranging from 1 2 m down to 0 1 m or less some metals like nickel and copper give black colloidal suspensions that do not settle even with centrifugation and cannot be filtered other metals such as magnesium and cobalt give larger particles but these are found to be composed mainly of the alkali salt by product with the metal dispersed in them as much finer particles or even as an amorphous phase rieke metals are usually prepared by a reduction of an anhydrous metal chloride with an alkali metal in a suitable solvent for example rieke magnesium can be prepared from magnesium chloride with potassium as the reductant rieke originally described three general procedures the alkali metal chloride coprecipitates with the finely divided metal

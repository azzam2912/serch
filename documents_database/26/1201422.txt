it is one of three positional isomers of methylpyridine whose structures vary according to where the methyl group is attached around the pyridine ring this colorless liquid is a precursor to pyridine derivatives that have applications in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries like pyridine 3 methylpyridine is a colorless liquid with a strong odor and is classified as a weak base 3 methylpyridine is produced industrially by the reaction of acrolein with ammonia this reaction also affords substantial amounts of pyridine a route that gives better control of the product starts with acrolein propionaldehyde and ammonia in practice this reaction also produces substantial amounts of pyridine as a result of dealkylation of the 3 methylpyridine over the oxide catalyst it may also be obtained as a co product of pyridine synthesis from acetaldehyde formaldehyde and ammonia via chichibabin pyridine synthesis approximately 9 000 000 kilograms were produced worldwide in 1989 it has also been prepared by dehydrogenation of 3 methylpiperidine derived from hydrogenation of 2 methylglutaronitrile 3 picoline is a useful precursor to agrochemicals such as chlorpyrifos chlorpyrifos is produced from 3 5 6 trichloro 2 pyridinol which is generated from 3 picoline by way of cyanopyridine this conversion involves

if an arbitrarily large number of samples each involving multiple observations data points were separately used in order to compute one value of a statistic such as for example the sample mean or sample variance for each sample then the sampling distribution is the probability distribution of the values that the statistic takes on in many contexts only one sample is observed but the sampling distribution can be found theoretically sampling distributions are important in statistics because they provide a major simplification en route to statistical inference more specifically they allow analytical considerations to be based on the probability distribution of a statistic rather than on the joint probability distribution of all the individual sample values the sampling distribution of a statistic is the distribution of that statistic considered as a random variable when derived from a random sample of size formula 1 it may be considered as the distribution of the statistic for all possible samples from the same population of a given sample size the sampling distribution depends on the underlying distribution of the population the statistic being considered the sampling procedure employed and the sample size used there is often considerable interest in whether the sampling distribution

it incorporated sophisticated structural refinements that were influential in later boeing designs the sole prototype exhibited unsatisfactory characteristics with its lack of pilot visibility directly leading to its cancellation the xp 9 was designed in 1928 to meet the requirements of a us army request for a monoplane fighter its primary contribution to aircraft design was its semi monocoque construction which would become a standard for future aircraft boeing employed the structural features of the xp 9 into their contemporary p 12 biplane fighter when the p 12e variant incorporated a semi monocoque metal fuselage structure similar to that of the xp 9 the undercarriage arrangement of the p 12c had also been first tried out on the xp 9 and then transferred into the production model the prototype xp 9 marked a 028 386 was first flown on 18 november 1930 it had impressive stats on the specification sheet but it quickly became apparent that its large 6 ft chord wing which was placed atop the fuselage directly in front of the pilot obstructed downward visibility so badly that simple landing maneuvers were hazardous test pilots at the army test centre at wright field found that the xp 9

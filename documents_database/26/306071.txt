the greek name means tiny penis they are parasitic on a variety of molluscs crustaceans birds and mammals some species having complex life cycles involving more than one host for example microphallus piriformes parasitizes the rough periwinkle littorina saxatilis when these are eaten by herring gulls it infects the bird and lays its eggs in the bird s feces to infect new periwinkles other intermediate hosts include for example new zealand mud snail potamopyrgus antipodarum and others several species are notable for manipulating or influencing their hosts microphallus piriformes causes its host the rough periwinkle to move upwards making it more vulnerable to predation by herring gulls microphallus pseudopygmaeus chemically castrates parasitic castration its host the snail onoba aculeus and causes it to grow larger than normal it is not clear if this gigantism benefits the host or parasite or if it is a non adaptive side effect microphallus papillorobustus causes its host the lagoon sand shrimp gammarus insensibilis to swim upwards making it more vulnerable to predation some species of this genus hitch hike on the manipulations of other species for example microphallus hoffmanni parasitizes the same sand shrimps as microphallus papillorobustus but does not manipulate the shrimps itself

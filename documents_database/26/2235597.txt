surface tension forces will only begin to dominate gravitational forces below length scales on the order of the fluid s capillary length which for water is about 2 millimeters because of this scaling biomimetic devices that utilize surface tension will generally be very small however there are many ways in which such devices could be used a is well known for its ability to repel water and self clean yuan and his colleagues fabricated a negative mold of alotus leaf from polydimethylsiloxane pdms to capture the tiny integral for the leaf s ability to repel water known as the lotus effect the lotus leaf s surface was then replicated by allowing a copper sheet to flow into the negative mold with the assistance of ferric chloride and pressure the result was a lotus leaf like surface inherent on the copper sheet static water contact angle measurements of the biomimetic surface were taken to be 132 after etching the copper and 153 after a stearic acid surface treatment to mimic the lotus leaf s waxy coating a surface that mimics the lotus leaf could have numerous applications by providing water repellent outdoor gear various species of floating fern are able to

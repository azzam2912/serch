given a function formula 1 we might fix or bind the first argument producing a function of type formula 2 evaluation of this function might be represented as formula 3 note that the result of partial function application in this case is a function that takes two arguments partial application is sometimes incorrectly called currying which is a related but distinct concept intuitively partial function application says if you fix the first arguments of the function you get a function of the remaining arguments for example if function div x y x y then div with the parameter x fixed at 1 is another function div y div 1 y 1 y this is the same as the function inv that returns the multiplicative inverse of its argument defined by inv y 1 y the practical motivation for partial application is that very often the functions obtained by supplying some but not all of the arguments to a function are useful for example many languages have a function or operator similar to codice 1 partial application makes it easy to define these functions for example by creating a function that represents the addition operator with 1 bound as its first

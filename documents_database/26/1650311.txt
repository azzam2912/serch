in ischaemic or hypoxic conditions such as stroke the concentration of glutamate in synaptic clefts is increased and continuously stimulates nmda receptors gavestinel was synthesized by substituting indole 2 carboxylate at the c 3 position with an unsaturated lateral side chain it binds to nmda receptor on the glycine site with high affinity selectivity and a broad time window efficacy thus gains interests in testing its efficacy in treating stroke in pre clinical studies gavestinel showed no significant side effects on memory learning and cardiovascular system side effects that are very common in nmda antagonists in phase clinical studies to investigate safety tolerability of gavestinel no findings showed that it had significant side effects the dose determined in phase trials was selected for further phase iii trials later however in two large phase iii trials gavestinel showed no efficacy in treating ischemic stroke

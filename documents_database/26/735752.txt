the plasma parameter is usually interpreted to be the argument of the coulomb logarithm which is the ratio of the maximum impact parameter to the classical distance of closest approach in coulomb scattering in this case the plasma parameter is given by where this expression is typically valid for a plasma in which ion thermal velocities are much less than electron thermal velocities a detailed discussion of the coulomb logarithm is available in the nrl plasma formulary pages 34 35 note that the word parameter is usually used in plasma physics to refer to bulk plasma properties in general see plasma parameters an alternative definition of this parameter is given by the average number of electrons in a plasma contained within a debye sphere a sphere of radius the debye length this definition of the plasma parameter is more frequently and appropriately called the debye number and is denoted formula 2 in this context the plasma parameter is defined as since these two definitions differ only by a factor of three they are frequently used interchangeably often the factor of formula 4 is dropped when the debye length is given by formula 5 the plasma parameter is given by where

bass amps typically consist of a preamplifier tone controls a power amplifier and one or more loudspeakers drivers in a cabinet while bass amps share many features with the guitar amplifiers used for electric guitar they are distinct from other types of amplification systems due to the particular challenges associated with low frequency sound reproduction this distinction affects the design of the loudspeakers the size and design of the speaker cabinet and the design of the preamplifier and amplifier speaker cabinets for bass amps usually incorporate larger loudspeakers e g 15 speakers are more common for bass than for electric guitar amps or more speakers and larger cabinet sizes than those used for the amplification of other instruments the loudspeakers themselves must also be sturdier to handle the higher power levels and they must be capable of reproducing very low pitches at high sound pressure levels the bassists who first sought methods to make their instruments louder were upright bass players while the upright bass is a large instrument standing about six feet tall with its endpin extended due to its low register it is not a loud instrument when played acoustically as lower frequencies attenuate rapidly with distance in

the term radiata is no longer accepted as it united several different groupings of animals that do not form a monophyletic group under current views of animal phylogeny the similarities once offered in justification of the taxon such as radial symmetry are now taken to be the result of either incorrect evaluations by early researchers or convergent evolution rather than an indication of a common ancestor because of this the term is used mostly in a historical context in the early 19th century georges cuvier united ctenophora and cnidaria in the radiata zoophytes thomas cavalier smith in 1983 redefined radiata as a subkingdom consisting of myxozoa placozoa cnidaria and ctenophora lynn margulis and k v schwartz later redefined radiata in their five kingdom classification this time including only cnidaria and ctenophora this definition is similar to the historical descriptor coelenterata which has also been proposed as a group encompassing cnidaria and ctenophora although radial symmetry is usually given as a defining characteristic in animals that have been classified in this group there are clear exceptions and qualifications echinoderms for example exhibit unmistakable bilateral symmetry as larvae and are now in the bilateria ctenophores exhibit biradial or rotational symmetry defined by

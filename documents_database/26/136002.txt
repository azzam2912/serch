computer readable format in which the information is organized into bits the result is the representation of an object image sound document or signal usually an analog signal by generating a series of numbers that describe a discrete set of its points or samples the result is called digital representation or more specifically a digital image for the object and digital form for the signal in modern practice the digitized data is in the form of binary numbers which facilitate computer processing and other operations but strictly speaking digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format the decimal or any other number system that can be used instead digitization is of crucial importance to data processing storage and transmission because it allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled though analog data is typically more stable digital data can more easily be shared and accessed and can in theory be propagated indefinitely provided it is migrated to stable formats as needed this is why it is a favored way of preserving information for many organisations around the world the term digitization is often used when

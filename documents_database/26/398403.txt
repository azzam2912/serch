they are a particular type of plasma lamp and one of the most modern the technology was developed in the early 1990s but although it appeared initially to be very promising sulfur lighting was a commercial failure by the late 1990s since 2005 lamps are again being manufactured for commercial use the sulfur lamp consists of a golf ball sized 30 mm fused quartz bulb containing several milligrams of sulfur powder and argon gas at the end of a thin glass spindle the bulb is enclosed in a microwave resonant wire mesh cage a magnetron much like the ones in home microwave ovens bombards the bulb via a waveguide with 2 45 ghz microwaves the microwave energy excites the gas to five atmospheres pressure which in turn heats the sulfur to an extreme degree forming a brightly glowing plasma capable of illuminating a large area because the bulb heats considerably it may be necessary to provide forced air cooling to prevent it from melting the bulb is usually placed at the focus of a parabolic reflector to direct all the light in one direction it would be impossible to excite the sulfur using traditional electrodes since the sulfur would quickly

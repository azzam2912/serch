symptoms may include studies of type iii galactosemia symptoms are mostly descriptive and precise pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown this is largely due to a lack of functional animal models of classic galactosemia the recent development of a drosophila melanogaster gale mutant exhibiting galactosemic symptoms may yield a promising future animal model galactose epimerase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder which means the defective gene is located on an autosome and two copies of the defective gene one from each parent are required to inherit the disorder the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder various human gale mutations resulting in type iii galactosemia have been identified functional analysis of these mutant gale isoforms suggests that reduced catalytic efficiency and increased likelihood of proteolytic digestion act causatively in type iii galactosemia gale deficiency inhibits udp glucose regeneration preventing the formation of glucose 1 phosphate and leading to the accumulation of galactose and galactose 1 phosphate high galactose 1 phosphate levels have been shown to interfere with phosphoglucomutase glycogen phosphorylase udp glycopyrophosphorylase activity in bacterial models and in vitro yet

there are many such systems in place and they are generally named or described based on how the gnss sensor receives the external information some systems transmit additional information about sources of error such as clock drift ephemeris or ionospheric delay others provide direct measurements of how much the signal was off in the past while a third group provide additional vehicle information to be integrated in the calculation process satellite based augmentation systems sbas support wide area or regional augmentation through the use of additional satellite broadcast messages using measurements from the ground stations correction messages are created and sent to one or more satellites for broadcast to end users as differential signal sbas is sometimes synonymous with wadgps wide area differential gps the gbas and sbas that have been implemented or proposed include ground based augmentation system gbas provides differential gps dgps corrections and integrity verification near an airport replacing ilss reference receivers in surveyed positions measure gps deviations and calculate corrections emitted at 2 hz through vhf data broadcast vdb within one gbas supports up to 48 approaches and covers many runway ends with more installation flexibility than an ils with localizer and glideslope antennas at each

the main application of fidsam is the discrimination of unspecific autofluorescent background signal from the target signal of a dedicated chromophore the fidsam method analyses the number of different molecules contributing to a measured fluorescence signal assuming a pure fluorescent dye solution in an isotropic surrounding the individual emitters are indistinguishable accordingly they obey the same fluorescence emission statistics and the time evolution of the fluorescence emission after a pulsed excitation can be described by a monoexponential decay function according to with formula 2 the initial fluorescence intensity after the excitation and formula 3 the decay constant fluorescence lifetime in contrast autofluorescent background consists of a multitude of individual emitters which obey individual emission statistics accordingly the time evolution samples a summation of numerous individual decay statistics and can be written as the fidsam technique bases on a time correlated single photon counting tcspc measurement and analyses the degree of deviation of a recorded fluorescence decay from a monoexponential behavior this is achieved by fitting the recorded fluorescence intensity decay by a monoexponential decay function convoluted with the instrument response function in a next step the error value of the fitting procedure formula 5 is extracted and its inverse value

the main objective is to determine whether the protein in question is a soluble or a transmembrane protein sosui s algorithm was developed in 1996 at tokyo university the name means as much as hydrophobic an allusion to its molecular clients first of all sosui looks for helices that are relatively easy to predict taking into account the known helical potentials of the given amino acid sequence aas the much more difficult task is to differentiate between the helices in soluble proteins and the ones in transmembrane proteins the helix being a very common secondary structure pattern in proteins sosui uses 4 characteristics of the aas in its prediction an important improvement compared to kyte und doolittle s hydropathy index which relies entirely on one characteristic is the introduction of the so called amphiphilicity index it is calculated by giving every aa with an amphiphilic residue a certain value which is derived from the aa s molecular structure to meet sosui s criteria for amphiphilicity the polar hydrophilic residue may not be linked directly to the beta carbon there must be at least one apolar carbon interposed therefore only lysine arginine histidine glutamic acid glutamine tryptophan and tyrosine are relevant

as such it is a concrete category the study of this category is known as group theory there are two forgetful functors from grp m grp mon and u grp set m has two adjoints one right i mon grp and one left k mon grp i mon grp is the functor sending every monoid to the submonoid of invertible elements and k mon grp the functor sending every monoid to the grothendieck group of that monoid the forgetful functor u grp set has a left adjoint given by the composite kf set mon grp where f is the free functor the monomorphisms in grp are precisely the injective homomorphisms the epimorphisms are precisely the surjective homomorphisms and the isomorphisms are precisely the bijective homomorphisms the category grp is both complete and co complete the category theoretical product in grp is just the direct product of groups while the category theoretical coproduct in grp is the free product of groups the zero objects in grp are the trivial groups consisting of just an identity element every morphism f g h in grp has a category theoretic kernel given by the ordinary kernel of algebra ker f x in g f

the thermal mass and conductivity of the element regulate the rate flow of heat into the element all heat detectors have this thermal lag heat detectors have two main classifications of operation rate of rise and fixed temperature the heat detector is used to help in the reduction of property damage it is triggered when temperature increases this is the most common type of heat detector fixed temperature detectors operate when the heat sensitive eutectic alloy reaches the eutectic point changing state from a solid to a liquid thermal lag delays the accumulation of heat at the sensitive element so that a fixed temperature device will reach its operating temperature sometime after the surrounding air temperature exceeds that temperature the most common fixed temperature point for electrically connected heat detectors is 58 c 136 4 f technological developments have enabled the perfection of detectors that activate at a temperature of 47 c 117 f increasing the available reaction time and margin of safety rate of rise ror heat detectors operate on a rapid rise in element temperature of 6 7 to 8 3 c 12 to 15 f increase per minute irrespective of the starting temperature this type of heat

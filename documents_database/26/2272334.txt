cei defines the electrical and jitter requirements for 3 125 6 11 25 28 and 56 gbit s electrical interfaces the common electrical i o cei interoperability agreement published by the oif defines the electrical and jitter requirements for 3 125 6 11 25 28 and 56 gbit s serdes interfaces this cei specification has defined serdes interfaces for the industry since 2004 and it has been highly influential the development of electrical interfaces at the oif began with spi 3 in 2000 and the first differential interface was published in 2003 the seventh generation electrical interface cei 56g defines five reaches of 56 gb s interfaces the oif began work on its eighth generation with its cei 112g project cei has influenced or has been adopted or adapted in many other serial interface standards by many different standards organizations over its long lifetime serdes interfaces have been developed based on cei for most asic and fpga products throughout the 2000 s the oif produced an important series of interfaces that influenced the development of multiple generations of devices beginning with the donation of the pl 3 interface by pmc sierra in 2000 the oif produced the system packet interface

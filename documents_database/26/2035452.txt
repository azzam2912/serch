while the fourier transform gives the frequency information of the signal it is not localized this means that we cannot determine which part of a perhaps long signal produced a particular frequency it is possible to use a short time fourier transform for this purpose however the short time fourier transform limits the basis functions to be sinusoidal to provide a more flexible space frequency signal decomposition several filters including wavelets have been proposed the log gabor filter is one such filter that is an improvement upon the original gabor filter the advantage of this filter over the many alternatives is that it better fits the statistics of natural images compared with gabor filters and other wavelet filters the log gabor filter is able to describe a signal in terms of the local frequency responses because this is a fundamental signal analysis technique it has many applications in signal processing indeed any application that uses gabor filters or other wavelet basis functions may benefit from the log gabor filter however there may not be any benefit depending on the particulars of the design problem nevertheless the log gabor filter has been shown to be particularly useful in image processing applications

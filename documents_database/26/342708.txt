this increased the amount of oxygen in the fuel mixture and thereby improved high altitude performance gm 1 was used on a number of modifications of existing fighter designs in order to counter the increasing performance of allied fighters at higher altitudes a different system for low altitude boost known as mw 50 was also used although gm 1 and mw 50 were rarely used on the same engine mw 50 was a methanol water injection system which injected a mixture of methanol and water into the cylinders to cool the mix cooling causes the air to become denser therefore allowing more air into each cylinder for a given volume this is the same principle that intercoolers use gm 1 was developed in 1940 by otto lutz to improve high altitude performance it could be used by fighters destroyers bombers and reconnaissance aircraft though its first use was in the bf 109e z fighter originally it was liquified under high pressure and stored in several high pressure vessels until it was found that low temperature liquefied nitrous oxide gave better performance due to improved charge cooling it could also be stored and handled more conveniently and was less vulnerable to

this is suggested to be an approximation of the set of pages that the process will access in the future say during the next formula 4 time units and more specifically is suggested to be an indication of what pages ought to be kept in main memory to allow most progress to be made in the execution of that process the effect of the choice of what pages to be kept in main memory as distinct from being paged out to auxiliary storage is important if too many pages of a process are kept in main memory then fewer other processes can be ready at any one time if too few pages of a process are kept in main memory then the page fault frequency is greatly increased and the number of active non suspended processes currently executing in the system approaches zero the working set model states that a process can be in ram if and only if all of the pages that it is currently using often approximated by the most recently used pages can be in ram the model is an all or nothing model meaning if the pages it needs to use increases and there is

as the sulfonyl functional group is electron withdrawing methods for cleaving the sulfur carbon bonds of sulfones are typically reductive in nature olefination or replacement with hydrogen may be accomplished using reductive desulfonylation methods the sulfonyl functional group rs o r has become an important electron withdrawing group for modern organic chemistry sulfonyl carbanions may be used as nucleophiles in alkylation reactions michael type additions and other processes after having served their synthetic purpose sulfonyl groups are often removed in the presence of certain reducing agents one of the sulfur carbon bonds of the sulfonyl group is cleaved leading to sulfur free organic products depending on the nature of the substrate and reaction conditions alkyl sulfones afford either the corresponding alkanes or olefins the julia olefination reductive desulfonylation is typically accomplished with active metals or salts sodium amalgam aluminium amalgam magnesium samarium ii iodide tin hydrides tributyltin hydride or transition metal complexes with reducing agents or nucleophiles pdcl dppp lihbet pd pph lihbet pd pph nahc coet alkyl alkenyl and allylic sulfones may be reduced using one or more of these methods reductive desulfonylation reactions lead to the replacement of a carbon sulfur bond in the sulfonyl group with a

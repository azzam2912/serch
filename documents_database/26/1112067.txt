it shows that friction in fluid lubricated contacts is a non linear function of the contact load the lubricant viscosity and the lubricant entrainment speed the discovery and underlying research is usually attributed to richard stribeck and mayo d hersey who studied friction in journal bearings for railway wagon applications during the first half of the 20th century however other researchers have arrived at similar conclusions before for a contact of two fluid lubricated surfaces the stribeck curve shows the relationship between the so called hersey number a dimensionless lubrication parameter and the friction coefficient the hersey number is defined as formula 1 where is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid n is the entrainment speed of the fluid and p is the normal load per length of the tribological contact hersey s original formula uses the rotational speed revolutions per unit time for n and the load per projected area i e the product of a journal bearing s length and diameter for p thus for a given viscosity and load the stribeck curve shows how friction changes with increasing velocity based on the typical progression of the stribeck curve see right three lubrication regimes can be identified richard

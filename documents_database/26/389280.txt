it is a hydroxy ketone attached to two phenyl groups it appears as off white crystals with a light camphor like odor benzoin is synthesized from benzaldehyde in the benzoin condensation it is chiral and it exists as a pair of enantiomers r benzoin and s benzoin benzoin is not a constituent of benzoin resin obtained from the benzoin tree styrax or tincture of benzoin the main component in these natural products is benzoic acid benzoin was first reported in 1832 by justus von liebig and friedrich woehler during their research on oil of bitter almond which is benzaldehyde with traces of hydrocyanic acid the catalytic synthesis by the benzoin condensation was improved by nikolay zinin during his time with liebig the main uses of benzoin are as a precursor to benzil which is a photoinitiator the conversion proceeds by organic oxidation using copper ii nitric acid or oxone in one study this reaction is carried out with atmospheric oxygen and basic alumina in dichloromethane benzoin can be used in the preparation of several pharmaceutical drugs including oxaprozin ditazole and phenytoin benzoin is prepared from benzaldehyde via the benzoin condensation

it is an unusual eclipsing binary system comprising an f0 supergiant officially named almaaz the traditional name for the system and a companion which is generally accepted to be a huge dark disk orbiting an unknown object possibly a binary system of two small b type stars the distance to the system is still a subject of debate but data from the gaia spacecraft puts its distance at around light years from earth epsilon aurigae was first suspected to be a variable star when german astronomer johann heinrich fritsch observed it in 1821 later observations by eduard heis and friedrich wilhelm argelander reinforced fritsch s initial suspicions and attracted attention to the star hans ludendorff however was the first to study it in great detail his work revealed that the system was an eclipsing binary variable a star that dims when its partner obscures its light about every 27 years epsilon aurigae s brightness drops from an apparent visual magnitude of 2 92 to 3 83 this dimming lasts 640 730 days in addition to this eclipse the system also has a low amplitude pulsation with a non consistent period of around 66 days epsilon aurigae s eclipsing companion has

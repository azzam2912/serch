landfill gas is approximately forty to sixty percent methane with the remainder being mostly carbon dioxide trace amounts of other volatile organic compounds vocs comprise the remainder hydrocarbons landfill gases have an influence on climate change the major components are co and methane both of which are greenhouse gas methane in the atmosphere is a far more potent greenhouse gas with each molecule having twenty five times the effect of a molecule of carbon dioxide methane itself however accounts for less composition of the atmosphere than does carbon dioxide landfills are the third largest source of methane in the us landfill gases are the result of three processes the first two depend strongly on the nature of the waste the dominant process in most landfills is the third process whereby anaerobic bacteria decompose organic waste to produce biogas which consists of methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds despite the heterogeneity of waste the evolution of gases follows well defined kinetic pattern formation of methane and co commences about six months after depositing the landfill material the evolution of gas reaches a maximum at about 20 years then declines over the course of decades because gases produced

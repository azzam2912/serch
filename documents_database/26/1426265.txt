zaslavsky cyrillic 31 may 1935 25 november 2008 was a soviet mathematical physicist and one of the founders of the physics of dynamical chaos zaslavsky was born in odessa ukraine on 31 may 1935 his father was an artillery officer who dragged his cannon in world war ii and survived there zaslavsky received his education at the university of odessa and moved to novosibirsk in 1957 where a golden age of siberian physics was beginning in 1965 zaslavsky joined the institute of nuclear physics where he became interested in nonlinear problems of accelerator and plasma physics roald sagdeev and boris chirikov helped him form an interest in the theory of dynamical chaos in 1968 zaslavsky and his colleagues introduced a separatrix map that became one of the major tools in the theoretical study of hamiltonian chaos the work stochastical instability of nonlinear oscillations by g zaslavsky and b chirikov published in physics uspekhi in 1971 was the first review paper to open the eyes of many physicists to the power of the dynamical systems theory and modern ergodic theory it was realized that very complicated behavior is possible in dynamical systems with only a few degrees of freedom this complexity

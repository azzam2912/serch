as a long non coding rna it belongs to a family of rna transcripts that are not translated into protein ncrnas of these ncrnas lncrnas are transcripts of 200 nucleotides or longer and are almost three times more prevalent than protein coding genes nevertheless only a few of the almost 60 000 lncrnas have been characterized and little is known about their diverse functions transcriptional interference chromatin remodeling splicing translation regulation interaction with mirnas and sirnas and mrna degradation bc200 is one lncrna that has given insight into their specific role in translation regulation and implications in various forms of cancer as well as alzheimer s disease the gene coding for bc200 lncrna is bcyrn1 brain cytoplasmic rna 1 a repeat polymorphism of cytosines and adenines ca was found to be near bcyrn1 and was used as a reference for mapping the gene linkage mapping and radiation hybrid mapping localized the bcyrn1 gene to chromosome 2p16 as a long non coding cytoplasmic rna bc200 rna is a part of the largest group of non coding transcripts in the human genome which is more prevalent than protein coding genes the 5 region of monomeric alu short interspersed repetitive elements sines allows

it is in the civil parish of codnor in woodland to the south of the village there are remains of a colliery site the land at waingrif waingroves was donated by ralph fitzstephen to the knights hospitaller in the early 12th century the deed of gift cites the date 1147 however another document reveals contact between the abbot of darley abbey and the knights hospitaller with regards to waingroves as early as 1121 the land was donated for the foundation of a preceptory of the knights hospitaller a preceptory is a monastic establishment for one of a number of orders of monastic knights however there is dispute as to whether one was ever constructed of those that believe a preceptory did exist it is accepted that it only had a very short life founded around 1147 and supplanted by another hospitaller preceptory in derbyshire yeaveley preceptory following its acquisition by yeaveley a manor was constructed which was leased along with the preceptory s land to lay tenants this and the small time frame of potential existence has led some to argue that a preceptory was never constructed at waingroves and that the land and the manor constructed by the hospitallers

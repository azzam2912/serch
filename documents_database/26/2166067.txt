these proteins possess a phosphorylatable histidine residue and are responsible for transferring a phosphoryl group from an aspartate residue on an intermediate receiver domain typically part of a hybrid histidine kinase to an aspartate on a final response regulator in orthodox two component signaling a histidine kinase protein autophosphorylates on a histidine residue in response to an extracellular signal and the phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to an aspartate residue on the receiver domain of a response regulator in phosphorelays the hybrid histidine kinase contains an internal aspartate containing receiver domain to which the phosphoryl group is transferred after which an hpt protein containing a phosphorylatable histidine receives the phosphoryl group and finally transfers it to the response regulator the relay system thus progresses in the order his asp his asp with the second his contributed by hpt in some cases a phosphorelay system is constructed from four separate proteins rather than a hybrid histidine kinase with an internal receiver domain and in other examples both the receiver and the hpt domains are present in the histidine kinase polypeptide chain a census of two component system domain architecture found that hpt domains in bacteria are more common as domains of

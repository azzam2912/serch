however in reality almost no gem sized natural diamonds are absolutely perfect the color of a diamond may be affected by chemical impurities and or structural defects in the crystal lattice depending on the hue and intensity of a diamond s coloration a diamond s color can either detract from or enhance its value for example most white diamonds are discounted in price when more yellow hue is detectable while intense pink diamonds or blue diamonds such as the hope diamond can be dramatically more valuable of all colored diamonds red diamonds are the rarest the aurora pyramid of hope displays a spectacular array of naturally colored diamonds including red diamonds diamonds occur in a variety of colors steel gray white blue yellow orange red green pink to purple brown and black colored diamonds contain interstitial impurities or structural defects that cause the coloration pure diamonds are perfectly transparent and colorless diamonds are scientifically classed into two main types and several subtypes according to the nature of impurities present and how these impurities affect light absorption type i diamonds have nitrogen atoms as the main impurity commonly at a concentration of 0 1 if the nitrogen atoms are in pairs

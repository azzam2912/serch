the name refers to its unusual design where instead of a large steel pressure vessel surrounding the entire core each fuel assembly is enclosed in an individual 8 cm diameter pipe called a channel which allows the flow of cooling water around the fuel the rbmk is an early generation ii reactor and the oldest commercial reactor design still in wide operation certain aspects of the rbmk reactor design such as the active removal of decay heat the positive void coefficient properties the graphite displacer ends of the control rods and instability at low power levels contributed to the 1986 chernobyl disaster in which an rbmk experienced a very large reactivity excursion leading to a steam and hydrogen explosion a large fire and subsequent meltdown radioactivity was released over a large portion of europe the disaster prompted worldwide calls for the reactors to be completely decommissioned however there is still considerable reliance on rbmk facilities for power in russia most of the flaws in the design of rbmk 1000 reactors were corrected after the chernobyl accident and a dozen reactors have since been operating without any serious incidents for over twenty years while nine rbmk blocks under construction were cancelled

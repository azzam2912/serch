shining through openings in clouds or between other objects such as mountains and buildings these beams of particle scattered sunlight are separated by darker shadowed volumes despite converging toward or radiating from the light source the beams are essentially parallel shafts of directly sunlit particles separated by shadowed ones their apparent convergence in the sky is a visual illusion from linear perspective this illusion also causes the apparent convergence of the otherwise parallel lines of a long straight road or hallway at a distant vanishing point the scattering particles that make sunlight visible may be air molecules or particulates crepuscular rays or god rays are sunbeams that originate when the sun is below the horizon during twilight hours crepuscular rays are noticeable when the contrast between light and dark are most obvious crepuscular comes from the latin word crepusculum meaning twilight crepuscular rays usually appear orange because the path through the atmosphere at sunrise and sunset passes through up to 40 times as much air as rays from a high midday sun particles in the air scatter short wavelength light blue and green through rayleigh scattering much more strongly than longer wavelength yellow and red light in some cases sunbeams

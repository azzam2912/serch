with little food or other sources of electrolytes consumption of large amounts of beer or other dilute alcoholic drinks leads to electrolyte disturbances where the body does not have enough nutrients known as electrolytes namely sodium potassium and magnesium the symptoms of potomania are similar to other causes of hyponatremia and include dizziness muscular weakness neurological impairment and seizures all related to hyponatremia and hypokalaemia while the symptoms of potomania are similar to other causes of hyponatremia and acute water intoxication it should be considered an independent clinical entity because of its often chronic nature of onset pathophysiology and presentation of symptoms the normal human kidney through suppression of anti diuretic hormone is normally able to excrete vast amounts of dilute urine thus a normal adult can drink up to 20 liters per day of water without becoming hyponatremic however the intake of solutes is also necessary to excrete free water under normal circumstances this is clinically irrelevant in the lack of proper solute intake the amount of free water excretion can be severely limited without adequate solute intake the normal functioning electrolyte gradient that pulls water into urine will be effectively destroyed briefly to excrete free water from urine

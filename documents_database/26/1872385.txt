primary research on this compound focuses on its use as a high energy density compound cyanuric triazide is planar and has three fold axis symmetry consisting of alternating carbon and nitrogen atoms whose centers alternate 1 38 and 1 31 apart the distance between the center of the ring and carbon atoms of each of the nitrogens is 1 30 and 1 39 this fixing of the position of the bonds in the cynauric ring is mainly due to the unsymmetrical positions of the azide chains azide groups are linked to the carbon atoms on the cyanuric ring by single bonds with an interatomic distance of 1 38 similar to the cyanuric ring itself this compound is purely synthetic and therefore does not exist in nature cyanuric triazide can be synthesized via nucleophilic aromatic substitution using cyanuric trichloride with an excess of sodium azide refluxed in acetone solution the white crystals can then be purified via crystallization in 20 c toluene this white polycrystalline solid was found to be stable under standard conditions but is extremely shock sensitive causing it to violently decompose when ground with a mortar cyanuric triazide s thermodynamic properties were studied using bomb calorimetry with h

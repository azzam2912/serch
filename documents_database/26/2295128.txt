these enzymes can be found in animals and plants showing distinctive functions in animals and humans they are involved in the degradation of peptides such as bradykinin neurotensin angiotensin i and a peptide helping to regulate physiological processes in plants their role is related to the degradation of targeting peptides and the immune response to pathogens through salicylic acid sa dependent stress signaling in arabidopsis thaliana recognized as a model plant for scientific studies two thimet oligopeptidases known as top1 and top2 have been identified as targets for salicylic acid binding in the plant these top enzymes are key components to understand the sa mediated signaling where interactions exist with different components and most of the pathways are unknown thimet from thiolsensitive metallo oligopeptidases peptide size restriction have been widely studied in the kingdom animalia the first top enzyme was found and purified from rat brain homogenates in 1983 today it is known that top enzymes are mostly distributed in the pituitary brain and testes of humans and rats in plants specifically in a thaliana the enzymes were more recently discovered as part of the 20s proteasome and sa binding proteins different names have been used to identify this group

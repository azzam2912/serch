the challenge consists of being given a large number possibly over 100 digits and asked to return the number that when taken to the 13th power equals the given number for example the 13th root of 8 192 is 2 and the 13th root of 96 889 010 407 is 7 extracting the 13th root has certain properties one is that the 13th root of a number is much smaller a 13th root will have approximately 1 13th the number of digits thus the 13th root of a 100 digit number only has 8 digits and the 13th root of a 200 digit number will have 16 digits furthermore the last digit of the 13th root is always the same as the last digit of the power for the 13th root of a 100 digit number there are 7 992 563 possibilities in the range 41 246 264 49 238 826 this is considered a relatively easy calculation there are 393 544 396 177 593 possibilities in the range 2 030 917 620 904 736 2 424 462 017 082 328 for the 13th root of a 200 digit number this is considered a difficult calculation the guinness book of

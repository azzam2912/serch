it can be used to detect objects that range from the mass of a planet to the mass of a star regardless of the light they emit typically astronomers can only detect bright objects that emit much light stars or large objects that block background light clouds of gas and dust these objects make up only a minor portion of the mass of a galaxy microlensing allows the study of objects that emit little or no light when a distant star or quasar gets sufficiently aligned with a massive compact foreground object the bending of light due to its gravitational field as discussed by einstein in 1915 leads to two distorted unresolved images resulting in an observable magnification the time scale of the transient brightening depends on the mass of the foreground object as well as on the relative proper motion between the background source and the foreground lens object since microlensing observations do not rely on radiation received from the lens object this effect therefore allows astronomers to study massive objects no matter how faint it is thus an ideal technique to study the galactic population of such faint or dark objects as brown dwarfs red dwarfs planets white

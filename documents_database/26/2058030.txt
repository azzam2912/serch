it is found in humans on the x chromosome rnf113a contains two highly conserved domains the ring really interesting new gene finger domain and zinc finger domain ring finger domains have been associated with some tumor suppressors and cytokine receptor associated molecules these domains also act in dna repair and mediating protein protein interactions aliases of rnf113a across taxa include rnf113 cwc24 and znf183 the gene is found on the human x chromosome and reverse strand the specific locus in humans is xq24 rnf113a contains 1312 nucleotides an upstream in frame stop codon is found within the 5 utr rnf113a is an intronless gene with one isoform in humans rnf113a translates a human protein 343 amino acids long and molecular weight of 38 8 kilodaltons the protein is found ubiquitously in the human body yeast two hybrid screens link rnf113a with other proteins most of these proteins are currently known to function in the human spliceosome some of these associations are within the u4 u5 and u6 snrnps much the same as within yeast models rnf113a also contains one acetylation and four phosphorylation sites the protein has both an acetylation and four phosphorylation sites which have been confirmed experimentally additional

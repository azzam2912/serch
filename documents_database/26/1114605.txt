the protein appears to associate with the centrosome complex during the cell cycle dissociation occurs during mitosis when pcm1 is dispersed throughout the cell immunolabeling studies performed found that pcm1 was present in centriolar satellites and in electron dense granules between 70 and 100 nm in diameter these were originally thought to be scattered only around the centrosomes but further studies proved that pcm1 was also found throughout the cytoplasm pcm1 was shown to be essential for cell division because pcm1 antibodies cause cell cycle arrest when microinjected into fertilized murine eggs targeting of centrin pericentrin and ninein was also dramatically reduced after pcm1 depletion using sirna overexpression of pcm1 deletion mutants and pcm1 antibody microinjection as a result of this depletion the radial organization of the microtubules was found to be disrupted but did not appear to effect microtubule nucleation pcm1 has four known transcripts the longest of which has 39 exons the open reading frame of pcm1 encodes a protein of 2024 amino acids the protein contains coiled coil regions between areas of low complexity as well as an adenosine triphosphate atp gtpase domain a nuclear localization domain and a eukaryotic molybdopterin domain the eukaryotic molybdopterin binding domain

using jensen s formula it can be proved that this measure is also equal to the geometric mean of formula 7 for formula 8 on the unit circle i e formula 9 by extension the mahler measure of an algebraic number formula 11 is defined as the mahler measure of the minimal polynomial of formula 11 over formula 13 in particular if formula 11 is a pisot number or a salem number then its mahler measure is simply formula 11 the mahler measure is named after the german born australian mathematician kurt mahler the mahler measure formula 1 of a multi variable polynomial formula 30 is defined similarly by the formula it inherits the above three properties of the mahler measure for a one variable polynomial the multi variable mahler measure has been shown in some cases to be related to special values of zeta functions and formula 32 functions for example in 1981 smyth proved the formulas where formula 34 is the dirichlet l function and where formula 36 is the riemann zeta function here formula 37 is called the logarithmic mahler measure from the definition the mahler measure is viewed as the integrated values of polynomials over the

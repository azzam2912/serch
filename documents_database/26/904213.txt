the multicolored spirals are highly derived structures for feeding and respiration spirobranchus giganteus is similar to most tube building polychaetes it has a tubular segmented body covered with chaetae small appendages that aid the worm s mobility because it does not move outside its tube this worm does not have any specialized appendages for movement or swimming the worms most distinct features are two crowns shaped like christmas trees these are highly modified prostomial palps which are specialized mouth appendages each spiral is composed of feather like tentacles called radioles which are heavily ciliated and cause any prey trapped in them to be transported to the worm s mouth while they are primarily feeding structures s giganteus also uses its radioles for respiration hence the structures commonly are called gills one major difference between christmas tree worms and the closely related sabellida fan worms is that the latter do not have any specialized body structures to plug their tube holes when they withdraw into them s giganteus like other members of its family possess a modified radiole usually called the operculum that it uses to secure its hole when withdrawn into its tube as an annelid s giganteus possesses a

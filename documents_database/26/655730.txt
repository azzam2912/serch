this compound is the product of the half neutralization of hydrogen sulfide hs with sodium hydroxide nahs is a useful reagent for the synthesis of organic and inorganic sulfur compounds sometimes as a solid reagent more often as an aqueous solution solid nahs is colorless and typically smells like hs owing to hydrolysis by atmospheric moisture in contrast with sodium sulfide nas which is insoluble in organic solvents nahs being a 1 1 electrolyte is more soluble alternatively in place of nahs hs can be treated with an organic amine to generate an ammonium salt solutions of hs are sensitive to oxygen converting mainly to polysulfides indicated by the appearance of yellow crystalline nahs undergoes two phase transitions at temperatures above 360 k nahs adopts the nacl structure which implies that the hs behaves as a spherical anion owing to its rapid rotation leading to equal occupancy of eight equivalent positions below 360 k a rhombohedral structure forms and the hs sweeps out a discoidal shape below 114 k the structure becomes monoclinic the analogous rubidium and potassium compounds behave similarly nahs has a relatively low melting point of 350 c in addition to the aforementioned anhydrous forms it can

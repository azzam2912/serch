cable bacteria couple the reduction of oxygen or nitrate at the sediment s surface to the oxidation of sulfide in the deeper anoxic sediment layers long distance electrical conductance in sediment was first observed in 2010 as a spatial separation of sulfide oxidation and oxygen reduction in marine sediment that was interrupted and re established at a rate faster than could be explained by chemical diffusion it was later found that this electrical conductance could be observed across a non conductive layer of glass microspheres where the only possible conductive structures were filamentous bacteria belonging to the family desulfobulbaceae the conductivity of single live filaments was later demonstrated by observing the oxidation state of cytochromes using raman microscopy the same phenomenon was later observed in freshwater sediments and groundwater aquifers cable bacteria densities of up to 2 km per square centimeter of sediment surface have been observed cable bacteria filaments are 0 4 1 7 m in diameter and up to 15 mm long filaments consist of rod shaped cells with an average length of 3 m and 15 58 ridges around encircling the cells diameter these ridges are hypothesized to contain the cells conductive structures each ridge contains two

when the reaction occurs in a liquid solution the solid formed is called the precipitate the chemical that causes the solid to form is called the precipitant without sufficient force of gravity settling to bring the solid particles together the precipitate remains in suspension after sedimentation especially when using a centrifuge to press it into a compact mass the precipitate may be referred to as a pellet precipitation can be used as a medium the precipitate free liquid remaining above the solid is called the supernate or supernatant powders derived from precipitation have also historically been known as flowers when the solid appears in the form of cellulose fibers which have been through chemical processing the process is often referred to as regeneration sometimes the formation of a precipitate indicates the occurrence of a chemical reaction if silver nitrate solution is poured into a solution of sodium chloride a chemical reaction occurs forming a white precipitate of silver chloride when potassium iodide solution reacts with lead ii nitrate solution a yellow precipitate of lead ii iodide is formed precipitation may occur if the concentration of a compound exceeds its solubility such as when mixing solvents or changing their temperature precipitation

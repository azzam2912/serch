it is the multiplicative inverse of instructions per cycle the average of cycles per instruction in a given process is defined by the following formula 1 where formula 2 is the number of instructions for a given instruction type formula 3 formula 4 is the clock cycles for that instruction type and formula 5 is the total instruction count the summation sums over all instruction types for a given benchmarking process let us assume a classic risc pipeline with the following five stages each stage requires one clock cycle and an instruction passes through the stages sequentially without pipelining a new instruction is fetched in stage 1 only after the previous instruction finishes at stage 5 therefore the number of clock cycles it takes to execute an instruction is five cpi 5 1 in this case the processor is said to be subscalar with pipelining a new instruction is fetched every clock cycle by exploiting instruction level parallelism therefore since one could theoretically have five instructions in the five pipeline stages at once one instruction per stage a different instruction would complete stage 5 in every clock cycle and on average the number of clock cycles it takes to execute

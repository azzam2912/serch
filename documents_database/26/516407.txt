operating at 85 mw hfir is one of the highest flux reactor based sources of neutrons for condensed matter physics research in the united states and it provides one of the highest steady state neutron fluxes of any research reactor in the world the thermal and cold neutrons produced by hfir are used to study physics chemistry materials science engineering and biology the intense neutron flux constant power density and constant length fuel cycles are used by more than 500 researchers each year for neutron scattering research into the fundamental properties of condensed matter hfir has approximately 600 users each year for both scattering and in core research the neutron scattering research facilities at hfir contain a world class collection of instruments used for fundamental and applied research on the structure and dynamics of matter the reactor is also used for medical industrial and research isotope production research on severe neutron damage to materials and neutron activation to examine trace elements in the environment additionally the building houses a gamma irradiation facility that uses spent fuel assemblies and is capable of accommodating high gamma dose experiments with projected regular operations the next major shutdown for a beryllium reflector replacement will

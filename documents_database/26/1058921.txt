it consists of a receiving antenna which receives the signal to be radiated in the tunnel and a transmitting antenna installed in the tunnel which is either a yagi antenna or a line antenna in principle a tunnel transmitter can work purely passively in which case the received signal is passed over a cable to the antenna in the tunnel active systems however are more often used in some cases the radio frequency inside the tunnel is different from the one used by the broadcaster more often the program inside is transmitted on the same frequency as outside in which case the information signal should be demodulated or converted to an intermediate frequency in the outside receiver and then modulated shifted back in the transmitter otherwise feedback may occur tunnel transmitters are used in germany only for audio transmitters working in fm range and for further radio services such as mobile phone services which also work in this frequency range elsewhere there are also tunnel transmitters for audio broadcast transmitters which work in the long and medium wave bands an example of this is in the dartford crossing tunnel near london where the programme virgin 1215 in the medium wave

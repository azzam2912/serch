also as a consequence of the properties of quasitriangularity formula 18 moreover formula 19 formula 20 and formula 21 one may further show that the antipode s must be a linear isomorphism and thus s is an automorphism in fact s is given by conjugating by an invertible element formula 22 where formula 23 cf ribbon hopf algebras it is possible to construct a quasitriangular hopf algebra from a hopf algebra and its dual using the drinfeld quantum double construction if the hopf algebra h is quasitriangular then the category of modules over h is braided with braiding the property of being a quasi triangular hopf algebra is preserved by twisting via an invertible element formula 25 such that formula 26 and satisfying the cocycle condition furthermore formula 28 is invertible and the twisted antipode is given by formula 29 with the twisted comultiplication r matrix and co unit change according to those defined for the quasi triangular quasi hopf algebra such a twist is known as an admissible or drinfeld twist

this means that such a device must have barriers that make it possible to distinguish between states and that it must have the ability to control these barriers to perform conditional change of state for example in a digital electronic system transistors play the role of such controllable energy barriers making it extremely practical to perform computing with them a cellular automaton ca is a discrete dynamical system consisting of a uniform finite or infinite grid of cells each cell can be in only one of a finite number of states at a discrete time as time moves forward the state of each cell in the grid is determined by a transformation rule that factors in its previous state and the states of the immediately adjacent cells the cell s neighborhood the most well known example of a cellular automaton is john horton conway s game of life which he described in 1970 cellular automata are commonly implemented as software programs however in 1993 lent et al proposed a physical implementation of an automaton using quantum dot cells the automaton quickly gained popularity and it was first fabricated in 1997 lent combined the discrete nature of both cellular automata and

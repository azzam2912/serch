it is similar to the saccharomyces cerevisiae protein exo1 which interacts with msh2 and which is involved in dna mismatch repair and homologous recombination alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants encoding two different isoforms exoi is essential for meiotic progression through metaphase i in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and in mouse recombination during meiosis is often initiated by a dna double strand break dsb as illustrated in the accompanying diagram during recombination sections of dna at the 5 ends of the break are cut away in a process called resection in the strand invasion step that follows an overhanging 3 end of the broken dna molecule invades the dna of a homologous chromosome that is not broken forming a displacement loop d loop after strand invasion the further sequence of events may follow either of two main pathways leading to a crossover co or a non crossover nco recombinant see genetic recombination and homologous recombination the pathway leading to a co involves a double holliday junction dhj intermediate holliday junctions need to be resolved for co recombination to be completed during meiosis in s cerevisiae transcription of the exo1 gene is highly induced in meiotic

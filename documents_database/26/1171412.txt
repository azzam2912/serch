this may take place under elevated temperatures and nitrogen atmosphere possible uses for electron irradiation include sterilization and cross linking of polymers electron energies typically vary from the kev to mev range depending on the depth of penetration required the irradiation dose is usually measured in grays but also in mrads is equivalent to the basic components of a typical electron beam processing device are illustrated in the figure an electron gun consisting of a cathode grid and anode is used to generate and accelerate the primary beam a magnetic optical focusing and deflection system is used for controlling the way in which the electron beam impinges on the material being processed the workpiece in operation the gun cathode is the source of thermally emitted electrons that are both accelerated and shaped into a collimated beam by the electrostatic field geometry established by the gun electrode grid and anode configuration used the electron beam then emerges from the gun assembly through an exit hole in the ground plane anode with an energy equal to the value of the negative high voltage gun operating voltage being applied to the cathode this use of a direct high voltage to produce a high

the line runs from woodhorn northumberland england to a restaurant in the car park of the qe2 lake in 1991 the woodhorn museum and northumberland archives wansbeck council was given an ex mining locomotive and three man riding cars by the ncb following the closure of vane tempest colliery in county durham it was decided rather than allow these vehicles to become a static exhibition it would better serve the heritage of the community if they were made operational and allowed to develop their potential as a visitor attraction because of this a volunteer group was formed to manage and build a railway on which the vehicles could operate the line was built being completed in 1994 and ran from the site of the present museum along the side of the qe2 lake terminating at the platform known as lakeside halt the railway has operated ever since with the exception of the years when the county archives were built one of two current locomotives the hunslet is the line s longest serving machine delivered to woodhorn in 1991 primarily as a static exhibit following the closure of vane tempest colliery but is now the lead locomotive of the fleet it

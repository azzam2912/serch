the stationary radar later became the p 50 but the mobile radar was to become the p 20 the design inspired a number of successors including the p 30 p 35 and p 37 radar the p 20 was the first russian radar to use the decimetric wavelength the first prototype being created in 1947 and a factory test unit in 1949 by 1949 the radar had completed state trials and was accepted into wide service within the soviet airforce the designers of the p 20 were awarded the state prize of the ussr in 1950 in recognition of the achievement the p 20 is a semi mobile radar with equipment mounted on eight zil 151 trucks components include the control cabin and power supply equipment as well as a trailer for the antenna and transmitter equipment the antenna system of the p 20 consists of two open frame truncated parabolic antennae accomplishing both transmission and reception the radar uses two antenna to determine target altitude by the v beam system with azimuth scanned mechanically the upper antenna is tilted to an angle of 45 degrees from horizontal which results in each target appearing twice on the indicator the distance

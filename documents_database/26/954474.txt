it reflects the prevalence of each natural isotope of an element values are defined by restricted to the iupac ciaaw definition of natural stable terrestrial sources it is the most common and practical atomic weight used for example to determine molar mass for example isotope cu a 62 929 constitutes 69 of the copper on earth the rest being cu a 64 927 then the specified definition is to use many representative sources samples from the earth so that the value can widely be used as the atomic weight for real life substances for example in pharmaceuticals and scientific research atomic weights are specific to single sources and samples of an element such as the atomic weight of carbon in a particular bone from a particular archeological site standard atomic weight generalizes such values to the range of atomic weights that a chemist might expect to derive from many random samples from earth this range is the cause of the interval notation in some standard atomic weight values out of the 118 known chemical elements 84 have stable isotopes and have this earth environment based value typically such a value is for example helium the 2 indicates the uncertainty in

topological indices are numerical parameters of a graph which characterize its topology and are usually graph invariant topological indices are used for example in the development of quantitative structure activity relationships qsars in which the biological activity or other properties of molecules are correlated with their chemical structure topological descriptors are derived from hydrogen suppressed molecular graphs in which the atoms are represented by vertices and the bonds by edges the connections between the atoms can be described by various types of topological matrices e g distance or adjacency matrices which can be mathematically manipulated so as to derive a single number usually known as graph invariant graph theoretical index or topological index as a result the topological index can be defined as two dimensional descriptors that can be easily calculated from the molecular graphs and do not depend on the way the graph is depicted or labeled and no need of energy minimization of the chemical structure the simplest topological indices do not recognize double bonds and atom types c n o etc and ignore hydrogen atoms hydrogen suppressed and defined for connected undirected molecular graphs only more sophisticated topological indices also take into account the hybridization state of

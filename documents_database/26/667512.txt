it is named after carl gustav jacob jacobi who first proposed the method in 1846 but only became widely used in the 1950s with the advent of computers let formula 1 be a symmetric matrix and formula 2 be a givens rotation matrix then is symmetric and similar to formula 1 furthermore formula 5 has entries where formula 7 and formula 8 since formula 9 is orthogonal formula 1 and formula 5 have the same frobenius norm formula 12 the square root sum of squares of all components however we can choose formula 13 such that formula 14 in which case formula 5 has a larger sum of squares on the diagonal set this equal to 0 and rearrange if formula 18 in order to optimize this effect s should be the off diagonal element with the largest absolute value called the pivot the jacobi eigenvalue method repeatedly performs rotations until the matrix becomes almost diagonal then the elements in the diagonal are approximations of the real eigenvalues of s if formula 20 is a pivot element then by definition formula 21 for formula 22 since formula 1 has exactly formula 24 off diagonal elements we have formula 25 or

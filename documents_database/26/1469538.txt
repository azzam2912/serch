even though these systems are usually fully automated a system that requires a manual pump or button activation is still identified as a centralized lubrication system the system can be classified into two different categories that can share a lot of the same components oil systems oil systems primary use is for stationary manufacturing equipment such as cnc milling grease systems grease primary use is on mobile units such as trucks mining or construction equipment oil versus grease can vary even though their primary use is mostly stationary for oil and mobile for grease some stationary manufacturing equipment will use grease systems automatic lubrication system is designed to apply lubricant in small measured amounts over short frequent time intervals time and human resource constraints and sometimes the physical location on machine often makes it impractical to manually lubricate the points as a result production cycles machine availability and manpower availability dictate the intervals at which machinery is lubricated which is not optimal for the point requiring lubrication auto lube systems are installed on machinery to address this problem auto lube systems have many advantages over traditional methods of manual lubrication a typical system consists of controller timer pump w reservoir

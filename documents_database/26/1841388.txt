they are derived from the ectoderm germ layer but are sometimes called the fourth germ layer because they are so important and give rise to so many other types of cells they migrate throughout the body and create a large number of differentiated cells such as neurons glial cells pigment containing cells in skin skeletal tissue cells in the head and many more cardiac neural crest cells cnccs are a type of neural crest cells that migrate to the circumpharyngeal ridge an arc shape ridge above the pharyngeal arches and then into the 3rd 4th and 6th pharyngeal arches and the cardiac outflow tract oft they extend from the otic placodes the structure in developing embryos that will later form the ears to the third somites clusters of mesoderm that will become skeletal muscle vertebrae and dermis the cardiac neural crest cells have a number of functions including creation of the muscle and connective tissue walls of large arteries parts of the cardiac septum parts of the thyroid parathyroid and thymus glands they differentiate into melanocytes and neurons and the cartilage and connective tissue of the pharyngeal arches they may also contribute to the creation of the carotid body the

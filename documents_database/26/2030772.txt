in terms of the cardinality of the two sets this means that if and then that is and are equipotent this is a useful feature in the ordering of cardinal numbers this theorem does not rely on the axiom of choice however its various proofs are non constructive as they depend on the law of excluded middle and are therefore rejected by intuitionists the theorem is named after felix bernstein and ernst schr der it is also known as cantor bernstein theorem or cantor schr der bernstein after georg cantor who first published it without proof the following proof is attributed to julius k nig assume without loss of generality that a and b are disjoint for any a in a or b in b we can form a unique two sided sequence of elements that are alternately in a and b by repeatedly applying formula 1 and formula 2 to go from a to b and formula 3 and formula 4 to go from b to a where defined for any particular a this sequence may terminate to the left or not at a point where formula 4 or formula 2 is not defined by the fact that formula

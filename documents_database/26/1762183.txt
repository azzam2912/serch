it has a generalization to the robinson schensted knuth correspondence which is known as the matrix ball construction starting with a permutation formula 1 written in two line notation say one can apply the robinson schensted correspondence to this permutation yielding two standard young tableaux of the same shape p and q p is obtained by performing a sequence of insertions and q is the recording tableau indicating in which order the boxes were filled viennot s construction starts by plotting the points formula 3 in the plane and imagining there is a light that shines from the origin casting shadows straight up and to the right this allows consideration of the points which are not shadowed by any other point the boundary of their shadows then forms the first shadow line removing these points and repeating the procedure one obtains all the shadow lines for this permutation viennot s insight is then that these shadow lines read off the first rows of p and q in fact even more than that these shadow lines form a timeline indicating which elements formed the first rows of p and q after the successive insertions one can then repeat the construction using

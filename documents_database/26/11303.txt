chymosin its key component is a protease enzyme that curdles the casein in milk in addition to chymosin rennet contains other important enzymes such as pepsin and a lipase rennet is used to separate milk into solid curds for cheesemaking and liquid whey and so is used in the production of most cheeses one of the main actions of rennet is its protease chymosin cleaving the kappa casein chain casein is the main protein of milk cleavage causes casein to stick to other cleaved casein molecules and form a network it can cluster better in the presence of calcium and phosphate which is why it is occasionally added in cheese making especially from calcium phosphate poor goat milk the solid truncated casein protein network traps other components of milk such as fats and minerals to create cheese calf rennet is extracted from the inner mucosa of the fourth stomach chamber the abomasum of young nursing calves as part of livestock butchering these stomachs are a byproduct of veal production if rennet is extracted from older calves grass fed or grain fed the rennet contains less or no chymosin but a high level of pepsin and can only be used for

their habits and affinities vary in many ways but all practise parental care of their larvae in that they capture prey usually insects to feed their larvae whether solitary or social most species construct some form of protection or nest in which they hide the prey and in which the larvae can feed and pupate in reasonable security most solitary hunting wasps sting their prey in such a manner as to paralyse it without killing it as a result it remains fresh for the young to eat in contrast carnivorous social wasps generally feed prey piecemeal to the larvae as soon as they bring it back to the colony so there is no need for preservation of the material a minority of solitary hunting wasps such as certain bembicinae also butcher their prey before feeding it to the larvae hunting wasp is not a biological taxon but rather describes certain ecological strategies that occur within the hymenoptera all hunting wasps are members of the aculeata within the apocrita but not all aculeata are hunting wasps nor are the hunting wasps a single clade within the aculeata they almost certainly have evolved independently several times sometimes probably several times within the

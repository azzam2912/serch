various distributors represent dspace in other overseas markets dspace provides tools for developing testing and calibrating electronic control units ecus in the automotive aerospace and medical engineering industries as well as in industrial automation and mechatronics in most cases the process of developing and testing ecus is based on the five phases of the v cycle dspace s hardware and software cover four of these five phases but not the first phase control design the control design phase involves developing the control algorithms that will run on an ecu usually by modeling them graphically this process can be performed with simulink modeling software from mathworks and is outside dspace s application fields in rapid control prototyping control algorithms are taken from a mathematical model and implemented as a real time application so that the control strategies can be tested with the actual controlled system such as a car or a robot simulink is used as the input and simulation tool and simulink coder also from mathworks is used as the code generator dspace provides the necessary hardware platform consisting of a processor and interfaces for sensors and actuators plus the simulink blocks needed to integrate the interfaces into the simulink

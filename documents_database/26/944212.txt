an asterisk is a unary operator i e one with a single operand found in c like languages that include pointer variables it operates on a pointer variable and returns an codice 2 equivalent to the value at the pointer address this is called dereferencing the pointer for example the c code assigned 1 to variable codice 3 by using the dereference operator and a pointer to the variable codice 3 the unary operator as defined in c and c can be used in compositions in cases of multiple indirection where multiple acts of dereferencing are required pointers can of course reference other pointers and in such cases multiple applications of the dereference operator are needed similarly the java dot operator can be used in compositions forming quite sophisticated statements that require substantial dereferencing of pointers behind the scenes during evaluation a basic example of multiple pointer indirection is the argv argument to the main function in c and c which is given in the prototype as codice 5 the name of the invoked program executable as well as all command line arguments that followed are stored as independent character strings an array of pointers to codice 6 contains pointers

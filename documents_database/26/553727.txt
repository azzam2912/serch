the genus miacis is not monophyletic but a diverse collection of species that belong to the stemgroup within the carnivoramorpha as such most miacis species belong to the group of early carnivores that represent the ancestors of the modern order the crown group carnivora however the species miacis cognitus now gustafsonia is placed not in the stem group but among the caniformia one of the two suborders of the crown group carnivora miacis species were five clawed about the size of a weasel 30 cm and lived on the north american and eurasian continents they retained some primitive characteristics such as low skulls long slender bodies long tails and short legs miacis retained 44 teeth although some reductions in this number were apparently in progress and some of the teeth were reduced in size the hind limbs were longer than the forelimbs the pelvis was dog like in form and structure and some specialized traits were present in the vertebrae it had retractable claws agile joints for climbing and binocular vision miacis and related forms had brains that were relatively larger than those of the creodonts and the larger brain size as compared with body size probably reflects an increase

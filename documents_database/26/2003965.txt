the aim is to study the processes of galaxy formation and evolution in the universe with a comprehensive physical model early results are described in a number of publications following widespread press coverage the project publicly released all data produced by the simulations in april 2015 a followup to the project illustristng was presented in 2017 the original illustris project was carried out by and collaborators as the first large scale galaxy formation application of volker springel s novel arepo code the illustris project includes large scale cosmological simulations of the evolution of the universe spanning initial conditions of the big bang to the present day 13 8 billion years later modeling based on the most precise data and calculations currently available are compared to actual findings of the observable universe in order to better understand the nature of the universe including galaxy formation dark matter and dark energy the simulation includes many physical processes which are thought to be critical for galaxy formation these include the formation of stars and the subsequent feedback due to supernova explosions as well as the formation of super massive black holes their consumption of nearby gas and their multiple modes of energetic feedback

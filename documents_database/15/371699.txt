by permitting each downloader to download only specific parts of the files listed in a torrent it equips peers to begin seeding sooner peers attached to a seed with super seeding enabled therefore distribute pieces of the torrent file much more readily before they have completed download themselves in 2003 bittornado became the first bittorrent client to implement the algorithm testing by one group found that super seeding can help save an upload ratio of around 20 it works best when the upload speed of the seed is greater than that of individual peers super seeding transfers stall when there is only one downloading client the seeders will not send more data until a second client receives the data to avoid this rtorrent continues to offer more pieces to the peers without waiting for confirmation until it is uploading at its configured capacity this improves the upload speed until enough peers have joined the swarm at the cost of not being able to detect cheating peers who engage in such anti social actions as downloading only from seeds downloading from the fastest peers or advertising false pieces

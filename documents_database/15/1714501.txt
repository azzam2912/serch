only a single specimen is known a holotype queen found preserved as a compression fossil the specimen had no wings and small portions of its legs and eyes were faintly preserved it was a large ant reaching in length this ants behaviour would have been similar to that of extant myrmeciinae ants such as foraging singly in search for arthropod prey and nesting in soil or in trees macabeemyrma shows similarities to extinct ants in the genus ypresiomyrma and to the living nothomyrmecia macrops but has not been conclusively assigned to any tribe instead generally regarded as incertae sedis within myrmeciinae however the sole specimen lacks definitive traits and its classification in myrmeciinae and even its identity as an ant has been challenged macabeemyrma ovata is known only from a single fossil specimen a mostly complete adult queen preserved as a compression fossil in fine grained shale the shale is from fossiliferous outcrops at the mcabee fossil beds part of an unnamed formation in the kamloops group which outcrops east of cache creek in british columbia canada the holotype specimen was collected by an unknown person and donated to thompson rivers university in 2002 the specimen was described by bruce

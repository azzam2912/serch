this painting is currently located in alte nationalgalerie berlin like many of his paintings there s only the back view of a figure the painting depicts his wife at his studio in dresden although the painting only shows her back it allows the viewers to imagine what she sees the view that starts to form is that she lives in a constricted environment and the only access of the outside world is through the window a port with some ships water a coastline and trees starts to appear there s also a view of the sky but covered by the window above her the ship that is passing slowly symbolizes how she is watching her life slowly passing by before her the ship will be moving on while she is still stuck in the domestic environment we get a sense that she wants more out of her life just like most of friedrich s paintings in addition there s also a sense of quietness and restriction in this painting but it s not because this room is small the room is in fact a very large space with high ceiling and big windows the painting has perfect verticals and horizontals

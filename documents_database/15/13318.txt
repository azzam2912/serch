thus it is possible that the worst case running time for any algorithm for the tsp increases superpolynomially but no more than exponentially with the number of cities the problem was first formulated in 1930 and is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization it is used as a benchmark for many optimization methods even though the problem is computationally difficult a large number of heuristics and exact algorithms are known so that some instances with tens of thousands of cities can be solved completely and even problems with millions of cities can be approximated within a small fraction of 1 the tsp has several applications even in its purest formulation such as planning logistics and the manufacture of microchips slightly modified it appears as a sub problem in many areas such as dna sequencing in these applications the concept city represents for example customers soldering points or dna fragments and the concept distance represents travelling times or cost or a similarity measure between dna fragments the tsp also appears in astronomy as astronomers observing many sources will want to minimize the time spent moving the telescope between the sources in many applications additional constraints such as limited

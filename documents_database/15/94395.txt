along with the wagtails and longclaws the pipits make up the family motacillidae the genus is widespread occurring across most of the world except the driest deserts rainforests and the mainland of antarctica they are slender often drab ground feeding insectivores of open country like their relatives in the family the pipits are monogamous and territorial pipits are ground nesters laying up to six speckled eggs the genus name anthus is the latin name for a small bird of grasslands molecular studies of the pipits suggested that the genus arose in east asia around seven million years ago mya during the miocene and that the genus had spread to the americas africa and europe between 5 and 6 mya speciation rates were high during the pliocene 5 3 to 2 6 mya but have slowed down so during the pleistocene repeated dispersal between continents seems to have been important in generating new species in eurasia africa and north america rather than species arising by radiation once a continent was reached in south america however vicariance appears to have played an important role in speciation the genus has more than forty species making it the largest genus in terms of numbers

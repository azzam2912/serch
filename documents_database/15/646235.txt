because courts generally reserve jurisdiction for situations in which there is an actual case or controversy i e a real dispute between the parties where such a suit is suspected the court may refuse to exercise jurisdiction for example the european court of justice does not hear preliminary references arising out of hypothetical disputes another form of collusive lawsuit involves fraud where two persons agree to fake an accident so that the victim can sue the other person in order to collect from the other person s insurance this is a crime and insurance companies investigate claims to determine that no collusion is involved because of the fear of collusive suits many jurisdictions have at various times prohibited spouses from suing one another or prohibited children from suing their parents also many jurisdictions have had guest statutes which make it difficult for a passenger in a non commercial vehicle to sue the driver if the passenger is injured due to the driver s negligence another example is in divorce in those jurisdictions where fault remains as a condition before commencement of an action for breach of the marriage contract

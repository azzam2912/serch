a seventh runs in a special mode and is dedicated to aspects of the os and security and an eighth is a spare to improve production yields playstation 3 s cell cpu achieves a theoretical maximum of 230 4 gflops in single precision floating point operations and up to 15 gflops double precision the ps3 has 256 mb of rambus xdr dram clocked at cpu die speed the ppe has 64 kb l1 cache and 512 kb l2 cache while the spes have 2 mb local memory 256 kb per spe connected by the element interconnect bus eib with up to 307 2 gb s bandwidth according to nvidia the rsx the graphics processing unit gpu is based on the nvidia g70 previously known as nv47 architecture the gpu is clocked at 500 mhz and makes use of 256 mb gddr3 ram clocked at 650 mhz with an effective transmission rate of 1 3 ghz the rsx has a floating point performance of 400 4 gflops to date the ps3 has had several component revisions which serve to reduce power consumption this in turn results in production savings lower heat production lower cooling requirements and quieter running since launch the

structural shapes that can be made with this metal forming process include i beams h beams t beams u beams angle iron channels bar stock and railroad rails the most commonly rolled material is structural steel other metals plastic paper and glass can also be rolled common applications include railroads bridges roller coasters art and architectural applications it is a cost effective way of bending these materials because the process requires less set up time and uses pre made dies that are changed according to the shape and dimension of the workpiece this process can roll workpieces into full circles structural shape rolling uses profile rolling techniques where the workpiece is passed through a series of flatteners of larger magnitude than most common rolling devices that match the workpieces cross section the most common method uses 3 rollers the bending is controlled by varying the distance between the rollers structural shapes can be rolled in different ways such as the easy way the hard way heel in out ball in out leg in out stem in out and off axis the hard way would be bending the workpiece in the orientation where its moment of inertia is the greatest the

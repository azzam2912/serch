once these values are known the latent extinction risk can be calculated as predicted risk current risk latent extinction risk when the latent extinction risk is a positive value it indicates that a species is currently less threatened than its biology would suggest it ought to be for example a species may have several of the characteristics often found in threatened species such as large body size small geographic distribution or low reproductive rate but still be rated as least concern in the iucn red list this may be because it has not yet been exposed to serious threatening processes such as habitat degradation conversely negative values of latent risk indicate that a species is already more threatened than its biology would indicate probably because it inhabits a part of the world where it has been exposed to extreme endangering processes species with severely low negative values are usually listed as an endangered species and have associated recovery and conservation plans one of the issues associated with latent extinction risk is its difficulty to calculate because of the limited availability of data for predicting extinction risk across large numbers of species hence the only study of latent risk to date

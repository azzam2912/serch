cowell wanted an instrument with which to play compositions involving multiple rhythmic patterns impossible for one person to perform simultaneously on acoustic keyboard or percussion instruments the invention completed by theremin in 1931 can produce up to sixteen different rhythms a periodic base rhythm on a selected fundamental pitch and fifteen progressively more rapid rhythms each associated with one of the ascending notes of the fundamental pitch s overtone series like the overtone series itself the rhythms follow an arithmetic progression so that for every single beat of the fundamental the first overtone if played beats twice the second overtone beats three times and so forth using the device s keyboard each of the sixteen rhythms can be produced individually or in any combination a seventeenth key permits optional syncopation the instrument produces its percussion like sound using a system proposed by cowell that involves light being passed through radially indexed holes in a series of spinning cogwheel discs before arriving at electric photoreceptors nicolas slonimsky described its capabilities in 1933 the rhythmicon can play triplets against quintuplets or any other combination up to 16 notes in a group the metrical index is associated with the corresponding frequence of vibrations

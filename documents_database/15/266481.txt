a simpler and faster alternative uses the so called stochastic acceptance if this procedure is repeated until there are enough selected individuals this selection method is called fitness proportionate selection or roulette wheel selection if instead of a single pointer spun multiple times there are multiple equally spaced pointers on a wheel that is spun once it is called stochastic universal sampling repeatedly selecting the best individual of a randomly chosen subset is tournament selection taking the best half third or another proportion of the individuals is truncation selection there are other selection algorithms that do not consider all individuals for selection but only those with a fitness value that is higher than a given arbitrary constant other algorithms select from a restricted pool where only a certain percentage of the individuals are allowed based on fitness value retaining the best individuals in a generation unchanged in the next generation is called elitism or elitist selection it is a successful slight variant of the general process of constructing a new population

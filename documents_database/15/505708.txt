the passage of glacier ice over underlying bedrock often results in asymmetric erosional forms as a result of abrasion on the stoss upstream side of the rock and plucking on the lee downstream side these erosional features are seen on scales of less than a metre to several hundred metres the 18th century alpine explorer horace b n dict de saussure coined the term roches moutonn es in 1786 he saw in these rocks a resemblance to the wigs that were fashionable amongst french gentry in his era and which were smoothed over with mutton fat hence moutonn e so as to keep the hair in place the french term is often incorrectly interpreted as meaning sheep rock the contrasting appearance of the erosional stoss and lee aspects is very defined on roches moutonn es all the sides and edges have been smoothed and eroded in the direction travelled by the glacier that once passed over it it is often marked with glacial striations the rough and craggy down ice leeward side is formed by plucking or quarrying an erosional process initiated when ice melts slightly by pressure and seeps into cracks in the rock when the water refreezes the

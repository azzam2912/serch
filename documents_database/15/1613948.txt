this type of phosphatase includes metal dependent protein phosphatases ppms and aspartate based phosphatases pp1 has been found to be important in the control of glycogen metabolism muscle contraction cell progression neuronal activities splicing of rna mitosis cell division apoptosis protein synthesis and regulation of membrane receptors and channels each pp1 enzyme contains both a catalytic subunit and at least one regulatory subunit the catalytic subunit consists of a 30 kd single domain protein that can form complexes with other regulatory subunits the catalytic subunit is highly conserved among all eukaryotes thus suggesting a common catalytic mechanism the catalytic subunit can form complexes with various regulatory subunits these regulatory subunits play an important role in substrate specificity as well as compartmentalization some common regulatory subunits include gm ppp1r3a and gl ppp1r3b which are named after their locations of action within the body muscle and liver respectively while the yeast s cerevisiae only encodes one catalytic subunit mammals have four isozymes encoded by three genes each attracting a different set of regulatory subunits x ray crystallographic structural data is available for pp1 catalytic subunit the catalytic subunit of pp1 forms an fold with a central sandwich arranged between two helical domains

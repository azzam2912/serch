roscommon in ireland this small privately run museum displays a unique collection of the passionate railway fan sean browne who began in the 1950s to collate railway memorabilia nearly everything from signals lamps bells and tokens over warning plaques posters and time tables to station boards the center piece of the museum was the acquisition in 1994 of a metropolitan vickers a class locomotive introduced in 1955 by c ras iompair ireann as part of the dieselisation programme that helped eliminate steam on irish railways by april 1963 he purchased cie 001 class diesel locomotive no 055 earlier called a55 withdrawn as a result of the introduction of iarnr d ireann 201 class locomotives to bring this into the bar wasn t an easy task and required some major re construction of the building because it is 51 ft 15 50 m long and 14 ft 4 25 m high and weighs 61 t thus it takes quite a bit of space in the bar and became a quirky curiosity not only for rail buffs the locomotive cost 100 000 which would be 2 5 million these days but sean browne got it being the only bidder for the scrap

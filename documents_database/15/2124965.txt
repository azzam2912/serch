it is a four terminal device with interesting properties it does not have specific gate terminals since each channel is a gate for the other the voltage conditions modulating the current carried by the other channel where the current in the first channel is formula 1 the current in the second channel is formula 2 the voltage of the first channel is formula 3 formula 4 and in the second channel formula 5 formula 6 we have formula 7 and formula 8 where the formula 9 are the low voltage conductance of the channels and formula 10 is the pinch off voltage assumed to be the same for each channel the field effect tetrode can be used as a highly linear electronically variable resistor resistance is not modulated by signal voltage signal voltage can exceed bias voltage pinch off voltage and junction breakdown voltage the limit is dependent on dissipation signal current flows in inverse proportion to the channel resistances signal does not modulate the depletion layer meaning the tetrode can perform at high frequencies the tuning ratio can be very large the high resistance limit in the megohms range for symmetrical pinch off conditions

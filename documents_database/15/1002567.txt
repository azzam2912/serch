the protein is commonly referred to as the hsv 1 u 6 protein because it is the transcription product of herpes gene u 6 the herpes viral dna enters and exits the capsid via the capsid portal the capsid portal is formed by twelve copies of portal protein arranged as a ring the proteins contain a leucine zipper sequence of amino acids which allow them to adhere to each other each icosahedral capsid contains a single portal located in one vertex the portal is formed during initial capsid assembly and interacts with scaffolding proteins that construct the procapsid when a virus infects a cell it is necessary for the viral dna to be released from the capsid the herpes virus dna exits through the capsid portal the genetic sequence of hsv 1 gene u 6 is conserved across the family herpesviridae and this family of genes is known as the herpesvirus ul6 like gene family u 6 is nomenclature meaning that the protein is genetically encoded by the sixth 6th open reading frame found in the viral genome segment named unique long u research performed in 2004 used electron microscopy to predict that u 6 forms 11 12 13 and

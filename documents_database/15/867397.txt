nielsen where they used it as an electron filter today they are used in the field of mass spectrometry where they are used in both tof mass spectrometers and in ion mobility spectrometers as well as hadamard transform mass spectrometers a variant of tof ms the bradbury nielsen shutter is ideal for injecting short pulses of ions and can be used to improve the mass resolution of tof instruments by reducing the initial pulse size as compared to other methods of ion injection the concept behind the bradbury nielsen shutter is to apply a high frequency voltage in a 180 out of phase manner to alternate wires in a grid which is orthogonal to the path of the ion beam this results in charged particles only passing directly through the shutter at certain times in the voltage phase n 2 when the potential difference between the grid wires is zero at other times the ion beam is deflected to some angle by the potential difference between the neighboring wires this deflection is divergent with ions that pass through alternate slits being deflected in opposite directions the maximum deflection angle can be calculated by tan k v v where is the

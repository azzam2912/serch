it is 70 fold more selective for er over er and has 100 fold lower affinity for gper gpr30 relative to estradiol dpn produces antidepressant and anxiolytic like effects in animals via activation of the endogenous oxytocin system first reported in 2001 dpn was the first selective er agonist to be discovered and was followed by prinaberel erb 041 way 202041 way 200070 and 8 ve2 in 2004 erb 196 way 202196 in 2005 and certain phytoestrogens like liquiritigenin and nyasol cis hinokiresinol since 2007 dpn is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers r dpn and s dpn relative to r dpn s dpn has between 3 and 7 fold higher affinity for er and appears to have higher intrinsic activity in activating er however both enantiomers have very high affinity potency selectivity for er and efficaciously activate er in any case it has been suggested that s dpn might be the preferred enantiomer to use for scientific research

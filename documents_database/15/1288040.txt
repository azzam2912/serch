indeed the reassembly process involves only moving the pieces around and rotating them without changing their shape however the pieces themselves are not solids in the usual sense but infinite scatterings of points the reconstruction can work with as few as five pieces a stronger form of the theorem implies that given any two reasonable solid objects such as a small ball and a huge ball the cut pieces of either one can be reassembled into the other this is often stated informally as a pea can be chopped up and reassembled into the sun and called the pea and the sun paradox the reason the banach tarski theorem is called a paradox is that it contradicts basic geometric intuition doubling the ball by dividing it into parts and moving them around by rotations and translations without any stretching bending or adding new points seems to be impossible since all these operations ought intuitively speaking to preserve the volume the intuition that such operations preserve volumes is not mathematically absurd and it is even included in the formal definition of volumes however this is not applicable here because in this case it is impossible to define the volumes of the

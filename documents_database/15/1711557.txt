it is a member of the forkhead winged helix fox family of transcription factors that is involved in ciliogenesis foxj1 is expressed in ciliated cells of the lung choroid plexus reproductive track embryonic kidney and pre somite embryo stage the human foxj1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 region 2 band 5 sub band 1 foxj1 has a conserved 100 amino acid long dna binding domain this gene encodes a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors similar genes in zebra fish and mouse have been shown to regulate the transcription of genes that control the production of motile cilia the mouse ortholog also functions in the determination of left right asymmetry primary ciliogenesis is foxj1 dependent and this transcription factor is required for motile ciliated cell differentiation the onset of foxj1 expression is indicative of cells fated to become motile cilliated cells cells commit towards ciliogenesis prior to foxj1 activation activation promotes basal body trafficking docking at the apical membrane and subsequent axoneme growth the protein p73 a member of the p53 protein family directly regulates foxj1 and is a requirement for ciliated cell formation the ten thousand base pair long transcription start site

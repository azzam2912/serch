they were discovered by shintaro suzuki s group when they used pcr to find new members of the cadherin family the pcr fragments that corresponded to protocadherins were found in vertebrate and invertebrate species this prevalence in a wide range of species suggested that the fragments were part of an ancient cadherin and were thus termed protocadherins as the first cadherins of the approximately 70 pcdh genes identified in mammalian genomes over 50 are located in tightly linked gene clusters on the same chromosome until recently it was assumed that this kind of organization can only be found in vertebrates but octopus bimaculoides has 168 genes of which nearly three quarters are found in tandem clusters with the two largest clusters compromising 31 and 17 genes respectively in mammals two types of pcdh genes have been defined the non clustered pcdhs which are scattered throughout the genome and the clustered pcdhs organized in three gene clusters designated which in mouse genome comprises 14 22 and 22 respectively large variable exons arrayed in tandem each exon is transcribed from its owner promoter and encodes the entire extracellular domain a transmembrane domain and a short and variable intracellular domain of the corresponding

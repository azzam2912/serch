they are retrotransposons that invade a eukaryotic host genome and may only replicate once the virus has infected the host these genetic elements exist to infect and replicate in their host genome and are derived from ancestral elements unrelated from their host metavirus may use several different hosts for transmission and has been found to be transmissible through ovule and pollen of some plants metavirus contains five families of the ty3 gypsy element with either one or two open reading frames these families are mdg1 mdg3 blastopia 412 and micropia each of the five families contains either one or two open reading frames gag3 and or pol3 there is evidence to support that amino acid deprivation in the elements host genome has frequently caused a frameshift towards the ty3 element metavirus corresponds with the ogre tat gene lineage species of metavirus are single stranded rna retrotransposons they have an icosahedral and linear conformation and are not enclosed in an envelope their diameter is approximately 50 nm and they are usually between 42 and 52 nm in length these genetic elements contain a core and capsid numerous species exist in metavirus and many have yet to be classified saccharomyces cerevisiae ty3

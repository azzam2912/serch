eight such events have been identified bond events were previously believed to exhibit a quasi c 1 500 year cycle but the primary period of variability is now put at c 1 000 years gerard c bond of the lamont doherty earth observatory at columbia university was the lead author of the 1997 paper that postulated the theory of 1470 year climate cycles in the late pleistocene and holocene mainly based on petrologic tracers of drift ice in the north atlantic however more recent work has shown that these tracers provide little support for 1 500 year intervals of climate change and the reported c 1 500 500 year period was a statistical artifact furthermore following publication of the greenland ice core chronology 2005 gicc05 for the north grip ice core it became clear that dansgaard oeschger events also show no such pattern the north atlantic ice rafting events happen to correlate with episodes of lowered lake levels in the mid atlantic region usa the weakest events of the asian monsoon for at least the past 9 000 years and also correlate with most aridification events in the middle east for the past 55 000 years both heinrich and bond

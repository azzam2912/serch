swap was designed to record solar wind en route at and beyond pluto at pluto swap was designed to record the potential nature between the solar wind and ions and or material entering space from the atmosphere of pluto the atmosphere of pluto was discovered in 1988 but it remained enigmatic and it was hard to understand an atmosphere existing in such low temperatures 45 kelvin 380 fahrenheit one of the ideas about pluto is atmospheric loss with pluto being compared to losses from comets the idea of atmospheric loss was suggested in 1980 even before the atmosphere was discovered one idea is the photoionization of escaping neutral particles might alter the flow solar wind around the dwarf planet the atmosphere was known to be very tenuous compared to earth and one of the questions was how the gases were interacting with the solar wind and sunlight likewise weaker at pluto s orbit than at earth s one of the ideas was that pluto s atmosphere would be stripped away by the solar wind over time by the 2010s only three other spacecraft besides new horizons have collected extensive data about the solar wind beyond 10 au voyager 2 pioneer

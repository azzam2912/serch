they were the brainchild of admiral sir john jacky fisher the man who had sponsored the construction of the world s first all big gun warship he visualised a new breed of warship somewhere between the armoured cruiser and battleship it would have the armament of the latter but the high speed of the former this combination would allow it to chase down most ships while allowing it to run from more powerful designs this design philosophy would prove to be most successful when the invincible s were able to use their speed to run down smaller and weaker ships the classic example was during world war i at the battle of the falkland islands where and sank the german armoured cruisers and despite numerous hits by the german ships inflexible and invincible incurred very few casualties among their crews they were least successful when standing in the main line of battle where they faced enemy capital ships an example is the loss of invincible to a magazine explosion during the battle of jutland about eighteen months after her success in the falklands although this explosion owed more to flaws in british ammunition handling practices that exposed numerous cordite charges

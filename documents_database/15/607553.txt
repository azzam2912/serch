given a map of the environment the algorithm estimates the position and orientation of a robot as it moves and senses the environment the algorithm uses a particle filter to represent the distribution of likely states with each particle representing a possible state i e a hypothesis of where the robot is the algorithm typically starts with a uniform random distribution of particles over the configuration space meaning the robot has no information about where it is and assumes it is equally likely to be at any point in space whenever the robot moves it shifts the particles to predict its new state after the movement whenever the robot senses something the particles are resampled based on recursive bayesian estimation i e how well the actual sensed data correlate with the predicted state ultimately the particles should converge towards the actual position of the robot consider a robot with an internal map of its environment when the robot moves around it needs to know where it is within this map determining its location and rotation more generally the pose by using its sensor observations is known as robot localization because the robot may not always behave in a perfectly predictable

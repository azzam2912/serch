they are the chief protein components of chromatin acting as spools around which dna winds and playing a role in gene regulation without histones the unwound dna in chromosomes would be very long a length to width ratio of more than 10 million to 1 in human dna for example each human diploid cell containing 23 pairs of chromosomes has about 1 8 meters of dna wound on the histones the diploid cell has about 90 micrometers 0 09 mm of chromatin when the diploid cells are duplicated and condensed during mitosis the result is about 120 micrometers of chromosomes five major families of histones exist h1 h5 h2a h2b h3 and h4 histones h2a h2b h3 and h4 are known as the core histones while histones h1 h5 are known as the linker histones the core histones all exist as dimers which are similar in that they all possess the histone fold domain three alpha helices linked by two loops it is this helical structure that allows for interaction between distinct dimers particularly in a head tail fashion also called the handshake motif the resulting four distinct dimers then come together to form one octameric nucleosome core approximately 63

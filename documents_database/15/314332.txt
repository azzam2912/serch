the erect portion of the thallus is dichotomous or subpinnately branched flattened and with a distinct midrib gas filled pneumatocysts air vesicles are present in pairs in some species one on either side of the midrib the erect portion of the thallus bears cryptostomata and caecostomata sterile surface cavities the base of the thallus is stipe like due to abrasion of the tissue lateral to the midrib and it is attached to the rock by a holdfast the gametangia develop in conceptacles embedded in receptacles in the apices of the final branches they may be monoecious or dioecious these algae have a relatively simple life cycle and produce only one type of thallus which grows to a maximum size of 2 m fertile cavities the conceptacles containing the reproductive cells are immersed in the receptacles near the ends of the branches after meiosis oogonia and antheridia are produced and released fertilisation follows and the zygote develops directly into the diploid plant it may be considered to be analogous to the life cycle of the flowering plant but in algae the oogonia are released and fertilised in the sea while in flowering plants the ovules are fertilised while attached to the

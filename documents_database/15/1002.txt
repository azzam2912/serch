it began as a philosophical concept in ancient greece and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms the word atom comes from the ancient greek adjective atomos meaning indivisible 19th century chemists began using the term in connection with the growing number of irreducible chemical elements around the turn of the 20th century through various experiments with electromagnetism and radioactivity physicists discovered that the so called uncuttable atom was actually a conglomerate of various subatomic particles chiefly electrons protons and neutrons which can exist separately from each other in fact in certain extreme environments such as neutron stars extreme temperature and pressure prevents atoms from existing at all since atoms were found to be divisible physicists later invented the term elementary particles to describe the uncuttable though not indestructible parts of an atom the field of science which studies subatomic particles is particle physics and it is in this field that physicists hope to discover the true fundamental nature of matter the idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old idea appearing

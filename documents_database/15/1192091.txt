the maneuver is used to place the spacecraft on a proper heading toward its intended orbit it often consists of a partial rotation around the vehicle s vertical axis roll followed by tilting the vehicle pitch to follow the proper gravity turn and or to improve aerodynamics a roll program is completed shortly after the vehicle clears the tower in the case of a crewed mission a crew member usually the commander reports the roll to mission control which is then acknowledged by the capsule communicator during the launch of a space shuttle the roll program was simultaneously accompanied by a pitch maneuver and yaw maneuver the roll program occurred during a shuttle launch for the following reasons the ragmop computer program northrop in 1971 1972 discovered a 20 payload increase by rolling upside down it went from 40 000 lb to 48 000 lb to a 150 nm equatorial orbit without violating any constraints max q 3 g limit etc so the incentive to roll was initially for the payload increase by minimizing drag losses and moment balancing losses by keeping the main engine thrust vectors more parallel to the srbs titan ii and saturn v launches also required

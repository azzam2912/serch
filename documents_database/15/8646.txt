the device preserves the input power and simply trades off forces against movement to obtain a desired amplification in the output force the model for this is the law of the lever machine components designed to manage forces and movement in this way are called mechanisms an ideal mechanism transmits power without adding to or subtracting from it this means the ideal mechanism does not include a power source is frictionless and is constructed from rigid bodies that do not deflect or wear the performance of a real system relative to this ideal is expressed in terms of efficiency factors that take into account departures from the ideal the lever is a movable bar that pivots on a fulcrum attached to or positioned on or across a fixed point the lever operates by applying forces at different distances from the fulcrum or pivot the location of the fulcrum determines a lever s class where a lever rotates continuously it functions as a rotary 2nd class lever the motion of the lever s end point describes a fixed orbit where mechanical energy can be exchanged see a hand crank as an example in modern times this kind of rotary leverage is

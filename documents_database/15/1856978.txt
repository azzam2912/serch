the links between nodes have finite capacity and thus some calls arriving may find no route available to their destination these calls are lost from the network hence the name loss networks the loss network was first studied by erlang for a single telephone link frank kelly was awarded the frederick w lanchester prize for his 1991 paper loss networks where he demonstrated the behaviour of loss networks can exhibit hysteresis consider a network with j links labelled 1 2 j and that each link j has c circuits let r be the set of all possible routes in the network combinations of links a call might use and each route r write a for the number of circuits route r uses on link j a is therefore a j x r matrix consider the case where all elements of a are either 0 or 1 and for each route r calls requiring use of the route arrive according to a poisson process of rate v when a call arrives if there is sufficient capacity remaining on all the required links the call is accepted and occupies the network for an exponentially distributed length of time with parameter 1 if

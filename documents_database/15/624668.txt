it is often considered to be the physical inverse of the pyroelectric effect it should not be confused with the thermoelectric effect specifically the peltier effect in which a temperature difference occurs when a current is driven through an electric junction with two dissimilar conductors the underlying mechanism of the effect is not fully established in particular different textbooks give conflicting explanations however as with any isolated adiabatic temperature change the effect comes from the voltage raising or lowering the entropy of the system the magnetocaloric effect is an analogous but better known and understood phenomenon electrocaloric materials were the focus of significant scientific interest in the 1960s and 1970s but were not commercially exploited as the electrocaloric effects were insufficient for practical applications the highest response being 2 5 degrees celsius under an applied potential of 750 volts in march 2006 it was reported in the journal science that thin films of the material pzt a mixture of lead titanium oxygen and zirconium showed the strongest electrocalorific response yet reported with the materials cooling down by as much as 12 k 12 c for an electric field change of 480 kv cm at an ambient temperature of 220 c

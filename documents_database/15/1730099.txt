first recognised in 2010 it includes the outhwaite park scoria cone that was first mapped by hochstetter 1864 and inferred by later geologists to be a late phase vent of adjacent domain volcano borehole drilling and building excavations in the grafton auckland domain area during the 1990s and 2000s provided new subsurface geological information that allowed geologists to recognise the buried grafton volcano the central and western parts of this grafton volcano comprise a tuff ring arc surrounding a diameter explosion crater filled with a solidified lava lake basalt at least thick which underlies and surrounds scoria cones that erupted from two vents within the crater at outhwaite park and the east end of auckland hospital most of grafton volcano is buried beneath of volcanic ash that forms the western sector of the adjacent auckland domain tuff ring subsurface information suggests that the domain volcano probably erupted 5 100 years after the grafton volcano from a separate batch of magma that rose most of the way up the same conduit the domain explosion crater erupted east of grafton volcano and blasted through and destroyed the eastern arc of grafton volcano s tuff ring and basalt filled crater floor creating its

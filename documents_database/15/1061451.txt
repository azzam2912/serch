the class ii molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha dra and a beta chain drb both anchored in the membrane it plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins class ii molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells apc b lymphocytes dendritic cells macrophages the beta chain is approximately 26 28 kda it is encoded by 6 exons exon one encodes the leader peptide exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular domains exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and exon 5 encodes the cytoplasmic tail within the dr molecule the beta chain contains all the polymorphisms specifying the peptide binding specificities hundreds of drb1 alleles have been described and typing for these polymorphisms is routinely done for bone marrow and kidney transplantation drb1 is expressed at a level five times higher than its paralogues drb3 drb4 and drb5 drb1 is present in all individuals allelic variants of drb1 are linked with either none or one of the genes drb3 drb4 and drb5 there are 4 related pseudogenes drb2 drb6 drb7 drb8 and drb9

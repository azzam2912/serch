the problem itself has occupied leading scientists for decades while still remaining unsolved according to science the problem remains one of the top 125 outstanding issues in modern science at present some of the most successful methods have a reasonable probability of predicting the folds of small single domain proteins within 1 5 angstroms over the entire structure de novo methods tend to require vast computational resources and have thus only been carried out for relatively small proteins de novo protein structure modeling is distinguished from template based modeling tbm by the fact that no solved homologue to the protein of interest is used making efforts to predict protein structure from amino acid sequence exceedingly difficult prediction of protein structure de novo for larger proteins will require better algorithms and larger computational resources such as those afforded by either powerful supercomputers such as blue gene or mdgrape 3 or distributed computing projects such as folding home rosetta home the human proteome folding project or nutritious rice for the world although computational barriers are vast the potential benefits of structural genomics by predicted or experimental methods to fields such as medicine and drug design make de novo structure prediction an active

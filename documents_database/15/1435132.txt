babel has provisions for using multiple dynamically computed metrics by default it uses hop count on wired networks and a variant of etx on wireless links but can be configured to take radio diversity into account or to automatically compute a link s latency and include it in the metric babel operates on ipv4 and ipv6 networks it has been reported to be a robust protocol and to have fast convergence properties in october 2015 babel was chosen as the mandatory to implement protocol by the ietf homenet working group albeit on an experimental basis in june 2016 an ietf working group was created whose main goal is to produce a standard version of babel four implementations of babel are freely available both bird and the reference version have support for source specific routing an extension to do authentication is available for the reference version but it has not been merged yet into the mainline version

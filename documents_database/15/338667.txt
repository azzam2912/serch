its mass is thus approximately the planck mass and its compton wavelength and schwarzschild radius are about the planck length planck particles are sometimes used as an exercise to define the planck mass and planck length they play a role in some models of the evolution of the universe during the planck epoch compared to a proton for example the planck particle would be extremely small its radius being equal to the planck length which is about 10 times the proton s radius and massive the planck mass being 10 times the proton s mass the planck particle would also have a very fleeting existence evaporating due to hawking radiation after approximately while opinions vary as to its proper definition the most common definition of a planck particle is a particle whose compton wavelength is equal to its schwarzschild radius this sets the relationship thus making the mass of such a particle this mass will be formula 3 times larger than the planck mass making a planck particle 1 772 times more massive than the planck unit mass its radius will be the compton wavelength the planck length is defined as using the above derivations we can substitute the universal

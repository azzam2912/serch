in nature it forms when meteorites containing graphite strike the earth the great heat and stress of the impact transforms the graphite into diamond but retains graphite s hexagonal crystal lattice lonsdaleite was first identified in 1967 from the canyon diablo meteorite where it occurs as microscopic crystals associated with diamond hexagonal diamond has also been synthesized in the laboratory 1966 or earlier published in 1967 by compressing and heating graphite either in a static press or using explosives it has also been produced by chemical vapor deposition and also by the thermal decomposition of a polymer poly hydridocarbyne at atmospheric pressure under argon atmosphere at it is translucent brownish yellow and has an index of refraction of 2 40 to 2 41 and a specific gravity of 3 2 to 3 3 its hardness is theoretically superior to that of cubic diamond up to 58 more according to computational simulations but natural specimens exhibited somewhat lower hardness through a large range of values from 7 to 8 on mohs hardness scale the cause is speculated as being due to the samples having been riddled with lattice defects and impurities the property of lonsdaleite as a discrete material has been

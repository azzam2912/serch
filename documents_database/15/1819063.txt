it was built in 1986 around the existing antiproton accumulator aa to improve the antiproton production by a factor of 10 together the antiproton collector and the antiproton accumulator formed the so called antiproton accumulator complex aac low energy antiproton research continues at cern using the antiproton decelerator it was built as a successor to lear and started operation in 2000 after the antiproton accumulator aa had been operational since 1980 the update program acol was proposed in 1983 the update comprised improvement work on the antiproton source the construction of the antiproton collector ac as well as reconstructions of the injection and ejection systems of the antiproton accumulator aa and its stochastic cooling system the estimated budget of the upgrade program was 40 2 million chf the changes were implemented during 1986 and 1987 with the ac getting constructed tightly around the existing aa ring the antiproton accumulator complex aac served its last particles to the proton antiproton collider sps in 1991 after the sps was shut down aac continued to produce antiprotons for lear operation stopped in 1997 when the aa was dismantled and the ac was converted into the antiproton decelerator ad the main scope of the

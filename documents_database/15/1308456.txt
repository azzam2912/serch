it is called tumefactive as the lesions are tumor like and they mimic tumors clinically radiologically and sometimes pathologically these atypical lesion characteristics include a large intracranial lesion of size greater than 2 0 cm with a mass effect edema and an open ring enhancement a mass effect is the effect of a mass on its surroundings for example exerting pressure on the surrounding brain matter edema is the build up of fluid within the brain tissue usually the ring enhancement is directed toward the cortical surface the tumefactive lesion may mimic a malignant glioma or cerebral abscess causing complications during the diagnosis of tumefactive ms t2 hypointense rim and incomplete ring enhancement of the lesions on post gadolinium t1 weighted imaging on brain mri enable accurate diagnosis of tdl normally a tumefactive demyelinating lesion appears together with smaller disseminated lesions separated in time and space yielding a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis hence the name tumefactive multiple sclerosis when the demyelinating lesion appears alone it has been termed solitary sclerosis these cases belong to a multiple sclerosis borderline and there is currently no universal agreement on how they should be considered tumefactive multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating and inflammatory disease

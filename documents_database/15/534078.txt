the exhaust manifold is configured in such a way that positive and negative pulses are produced during the operation of the cycle by designing it as a diffuser the asv has three openings one is connected to the manifold vacuum another is connected to the exhaust pipe and the third is open to the atmosphere when a negative pulse is induced in the exhaust air from the atmosphere enters the exhaust manifold through a one way reed valve and serves to oxidize the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons in the exhaust this system consists of a spring loaded diaphragm and a shaft which is attached to the bottom a manifold vacuum is applied over the diaphragm where the shaft end is towards the opening of the atmosphere during deceleration the engine vacuum rises and acts against the spring to push the shaft downwards thereby blocking the opening through which atmospheric air is passed to the exhaust though there is a negative pulse during deceleration the manifold vacuum blocks and cuts off the air to the exhaust manifold used on the honda falcon nx4 mainly responsible for backfire or popping during deceleration when an open exhaust is added to the bike and

it is also available in dietary supplements indole 3 carbinol is the subject of on going biomedical research into its possible anticarcinogenic antioxidant and anti atherogenic effects research on indole 3 carbinol has been conducted primarily using laboratory animals and cultured cells limited and inconclusive human studies have been reported a recent review of the biomedical research literature found that evidence of an inverse association between cruciferous vegetable intake and breast or prostate cancer in humans is limited and inconsistent and larger randomized controlled trials are needed to determine if supplemental indole 3 carbinol has health benefits investigation of mechanisms by which consumption of indole 3 carbinol might influence cancer incidence focuses on its ability to alter estrogen metabolism and other cellular effects controlled studies have been performed on such animals as rats mice and rainbow trout introducing various controlled levels of carcinogens and levels of indole 3 carbinol into their daily diet results showed dose related decreases in tumor susceptibility due to indole 3 carbinol inferred by decreases in aflatoxin dna binding the first direct evidence of pure anti initiating activity by a natural anticarcinogen indole 3 carbinol found in human diet was claimed by dashwood et al in

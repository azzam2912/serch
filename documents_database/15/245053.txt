rosen of bolt beranek and newman and david l mills exterior gateway protocol egp is a protocol for exchanging routing information between two neighbor gateway hosts each with its own router in a network of autonomous systems egp is commonly used between hosts on the internet to exchange routing table information the routing table contains a list of known routers the addresses they can reach and a cost metric associated with the path to each router so that the best available route is chosen each router polls its neighbor at intervals between 120 to 480 seconds and the neighbor responds by sending its complete routing table egp 2 is the latest version of egp egp was developed by bolt beranek and newman in the early 1980s it was first described in rfc 827 and formally specified in rfc 904 1984 egp is a simple reachability protocol and unlike modern distance vector and path vector protocols it is limited to tree like topologies during the early days of the internet egp version 3 egp3 was used to interconnect autonomous systems currently bgp version 4 is the accepted standard for internet routing and has essentially replaced the more limited egp3 https whatis

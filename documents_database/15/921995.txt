over the long term the water is eroding the land beaches represent a special case in that they exist where sand accumulated from the same processes that strip away rocky and sedimentary material that is they can grow as well as erode river deltas are another exception in that silt that erodes up river can accrete at the river s outlet and extend ocean shorelines catastrophic events such as tsunamis hurricanes and storm surges accelerate beach erosion potentially carrying away the entire sand load human activities can be as catastrophic as hurricanes albeit usually over a longer time interval tsunamis potentially enormous waves often caused by earthquakes have great erosional and sediment reworking potential they may strip beaches of sand that may have taken years to accumulate and may destroy trees and other coastal vegetation tsunamis are also capable of flooding hundreds of meters inland past the typical high water level and fast moving water associated with the inundating tsunami can crush homes and other coastal structures a storm surge is an onshore gush of water associated with a low pressure weather system storms storm surges can cause beach accretion and erosion historically notable storm surges occurred during the north

cytochrome p2c8 also possesses epoxygenase activity i e it metabolizes long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids e g arachidonic acid eicosapentaenoic acid docosahexaenoic acid and linoleic acid to their biologically active epoxides following is a table of selected substrates inducers and inhibitors of 2c8 inhibitors of cyp2c8 can be classified by their potency such as where classes of agents are listed there may be exceptions within the class cyp2c8 also possesses epoxygenase activity it is one of the principal enzymes responsible for attacking various long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids at their double i e alkene bonds to form epoxide products that act as signaling agents it metabolizes 1 arachidonic acid to various epoxyeicosatrienoic acids also termed eets 2 linoleic acid to 9 10 epoxy octadecaenoic acids also termed vernolic acid linoleic acid 9 10 oxide or leukotoxin and 12 13 epoxy octadecaenoic also termed coronaric acid linoleic acid 12 13 oxide or isoleukotoxin 3 docosohexaenoic acid to various epoxydocosapentaenoic acids also termed edps and 4 eicosapentaenoic acid to various epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids also termed eeqs along with cyp2c8 cyp2c9 cyp2c19 cyp2j2 and possibly cyp2s1 are the main producers of eets and very likely eeqs edps and the epoxides of linoleic acid

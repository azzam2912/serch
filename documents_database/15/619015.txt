magnetic and optical data storage devices rely on individual bits being stored as distinct magnetic or optical changes on the surface of the recording medium holographic data storage records information throughout the volume of the medium and is capable of recording multiple images in the same area utilizing light at different angles additionally whereas magnetic and optical data storage records information a bit at a time in a linear fashion holographic storage is capable of recording and reading millions of bits in parallel enabling data transfer rates greater than those attained by traditional optical storage holographic data storage contains information using an optical interference pattern within a thick photosensitive optical material light from a single laser beam is divided into two or more separate optical patterns of dark and light pixels by adjusting the reference beam angle wavelength or media position a multitude of holograms theoretically several thousands can be stored on a single volume the stored data is read through the reproduction of the same reference beam used to create the hologram the reference beam s light is focused on the photosensitive material illuminating the appropriate interference pattern the light diffracts on the interference pattern and projects the pattern

ideal lattices naturally occur in many parts of number theory but also in other areas in particular they have a significant place in cryptography micciancio defined a generalization of cyclic lattices as ideal lattices they can be used in cryptosystems to decrease by a square root the number of parameters necessary to describe a lattice making them more efficient ideal lattices are a new concept but similar lattice classes have been used for a long time for example cyclic lattices a special case of ideal lattices are used in ntruencrypt and ntrusign ideal lattices also form the basis for quantum computer attack resistant cryptography based on the ring learning with errors these cryptosystems are provably secure under the assumption that the shortest vector problem svp is hard in these ideal lattices in general terms ideal lattices are lattices corresponding to ideals in rings of the form formula 1 for some irreducible polynomial formula 2 of degree formula 3 all of the definitions of ideal lattices from prior work are instances of the following general notion let formula 4 be a ring whose additive group is isomorphic to formula 5 i e it is a free formula 6 module of rank

c fasciculata like other species of crithidia have a single host life cycle with insect host in the case of c fasciculata this is the mosquito c fasciculata have low host species specificity and can infect many species of mosquito c fasciculata is found in two morphologically different life cycle stages the free swimming choanomastigote form which has a long external flagellum for motility and the attached immotile amastigote form in the mosquito gut amastigotes excreted in the faeces contaminate the mosquito habitat contamination of flowers during nectar feeding is common transmission of c fasciculata primarily occurs when amastigotes washed into standing water are ingested by mosquito larvae the amastigotes are typically found in the rectum of a larva each molt of the larva results in loss of infection but it is generally quickly re acquired from the environment by ingestion of more amastigotes when the fourth instar larva pupates the amastigote infection is maintained in the gut through metamorphosis giving rise to an infected adult mosquito c fasciculata is an example of a non human infective trypanosomatid and is related to several human parasites including trypanosoma brucei which causes african trypanosomiasis and leishmania spp which cause leishmaniasis c fasciculata

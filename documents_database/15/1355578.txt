the p adic regulator is an analogue of the usual regulator defined using p adic logarithms instead of the usual logarithms introduced by leopoldt proposed a definition of a p adic regulator r attached to k and a prime number p the definition of r uses an appropriate determinant with entries the p adic logarithm of a generating set of units of k up to torsion in the manner of the usual regulator the conjecture which for general k is still open then comes out as the statement that r is not zero let k be a number field and for each prime p of k above some fixed rational prime p let u denote the local units at p and let u denote the subgroup of principal units in u set then let e denote the set of global units that map to u via the diagonal embedding of the global units in e since formula 2 is a finite index subgroup of the global units it is an abelian group of rank formula 3 where formula 4 is the number of real embeddings of formula 5 and formula 6 the number of pairs of complex embeddings leopoldt s

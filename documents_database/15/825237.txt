the concept unifies very different types of such rules in mathematics the different choices made for how time is measured and the special properties of the ambient space may give an idea of the vastness of the class of objects described by this concept time can be measured by integers by real or complex numbers or can be a more general algebraic object losing the memory of its physical origin and the ambient space may be simply a set without the need of a smooth space time structure defined on it there are two classes of definitions for a dynamical system one is motivated by ordinary differential equations and is geometrical in flavor and the other is motivated by ergodic theory and is measure theoretical in flavor the measure theoretical definitions assume the existence of a measure preserving transformation this appears to exclude dissipative systems as in a dissipative system a small region of phase space shrinks under time evolution a simple construction sometimes called the krylov bogolyubov theorem shows that it is always possible to construct a measure so as to make the evolution rule of the dynamical system a measure preserving transformation in the construction a given measure

it is made from aminolauric acid or laurolactam monomers that each have 12 carbons hence the name nylon 12 it is one of several nylon polymers nylon 12 can be produced through two routes the first being polycondensation of aminolauric acid a bifunctional monomer with one amine and one carboxylic acid group n hn ch coh ch conh n ho the second route is ring opening polymerization of laurolactam at 260 300 c ring opening can be carried out by cationic or anionic initiators although cationic initiators have not been used commercially due to the product being less stable and oxidized relatively quickly in comparison to those produced by activated anionic polymerization monomer casting ring opening polymerization is the preferred route for commercial production nylon 12 exhibits properties between short chain aliphatic nylons e g nylon 6 and nylon 66 and polyolefins at 178 180 c the melting point of nylon 12 is the lowest among the important polyamides its mechanical properties such as hardness tensile strength and resistance to abrasion are similar to those of nylon 6 and nylon 66 low water absorption and density 1 01 g ml result from its relatively long hydrocarbon chain length which also

in a wireless power transmission system a transmitter device driven by electric power from a power source generates a time varying electromagnetic field which transmits power across space to a receiver device which extracts power from the field and supplies it to an electrical load the technology of wireless power transmission can eliminate the use of the wires and batteries thus increasing the mobility convenience and safety of an electronic device for all users wireless power transfer is useful to power electrical devices where interconnecting wires are inconvenient hazardous or are not possible wireless power techniques mainly fall into two categories near field and far field in near field or non radiative techniques power is transferred over short distances by magnetic fields using inductive coupling between coils of wire or by electric fields using capacitive coupling between metal electrodes inductive coupling is the most widely used wireless technology its applications include charging handheld devices like phones and electric toothbrushes rfid tags induction cooking and wirelessly charging or continuous wireless power transfer in implantable medical devices like artificial cardiac pacemakers or electric vehicles in far field or radiative techniques also called power beaming power is transferred by beams of electromagnetic radiation

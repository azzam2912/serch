some authors distinguish it from a compound spike inflorescence by requiring that the flowers and fruit be pedicellate having a single stem per flower the branches of a panicle are often racemes a panicle may have determinate or indeterminate growth this type of inflorescence is largely characteristic of grasses such as oat and crabgrass as well as other plants such as pistachio and mamoncillo botanists use the term paniculate in two ways having a true panicle inflorescence as well as having an inflorescence with the form but not necessarily the structure of a panicle a corymb may have a paniculate branching structure with the lower flowers having longer pedicels than the upper thus giving a flattish top superficially resembling an umbel many species in the subfamily amygdaloideae such as hawthorns and rowans produce their flowers in corymbs paniculatus masculine paniculata feminine and paniculatum neuter are genders of a latin adjective meaning paniculate these terms are often used in the specific epithets of binomial names mostly plants indicating that the flowers are borne in panicles by far the most common gender is the feminine paniculata because most latin plant names are feminine the term is occasionally used for other organisms

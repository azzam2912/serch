it was basically a successor to all gas and gaiters where nimmo had played a very similar role the main difference being that brother dominic was working class whereas nimmo s previous character rev mervyn noote had been upper class oh brother was not quite as successful or as affectionately remembered as the earlier programme although it did last three series containing 19 episodes only eight of which exist in the bbc archives the comic potential in a monastery may have been rather limited although it did benefit from a cast which included some experienced actors particularly nimmo himself and felix aylmer as father prior a region 2 dvd was released in 2004 oh brother was followed by a sequel oh father in 1973 also starring nimmo and with the same writers in this series dominic left the monastery and became a roman catholic priest it had a supporting cast of laurence naismith pearl hackney and david kelly this was not a success and only lasted a single series of seven episodes

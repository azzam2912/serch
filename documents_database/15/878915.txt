the demersal zone is just above the benthic zone and forms a layer of the larger profundal zone being just above the ocean floor the demersal zone is variable in depth and can be part of the photic zone where light can penetrate and photosynthetic organisms grow or the aphotic zone which begins between depths of roughly and extends to the ocean depths where no light penetrates the distinction between demersal species of fish and pelagic species is not always clear cut the atlantic cod gadus morhua is a typical demersal fish but can also be found in the open water column and the atlantic herring clupea harengus is predominantly a pelagic species but forms large aggregations near the seabed when it spawns on banks of gravel two types of fish inhabit the demersal zone those that are heavier than water and rest on the seabed and those that have neutral buoyancy and remain just above the substrate in many species of fish neutral buoyancy is maintained by a gas filled swim bladder which can be expanded or contracted as the circumstances require a disadvantage of this method is that adjustments need to be made constantly as the water pressure

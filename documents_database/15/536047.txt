its numbering follows the jedec standard it is a transistor type of enduring popularity the exact performance characteristics depend on the manufacturer and date before the move to the epitaxial base version in the mid 1970s the f could be as low as 0 8 mhz for example packaged in a to 3 case style it is a 15 amp 60 volt or more see below 115 watt power transistor with a forward current gain of 20 to 70 at a collector current of this may be 100 to 200 when testing using a multimeter it often has a transition frequency of around 3 0 mhz and 6 mhz is typical for the 2n3055a at this frequency the calculated current gain beta drops to 1 indicating the transistor can no longer provide useful amplification in common emitter configuration the frequency at which gain begins to drop off may be much lower see below the maximum collector to emitter voltage for the 2n3055 like other transistors depends on the resistance path the external circuit provides between the base and emitter of the transistor with 100 ohms a 70 volt breakdown rating v and the collector emitter sustaining voltage v is given

it quantifies the severity of multicollinearity in an ordinary least squares regression analysis it provides an index that measures how much the variance the square of the estimate s standard deviation of an estimated regression coefficient is increased because of collinearity consider the following linear model with k independent variables the standard error of the estimate of is the square root of the j 1 diagonal element of s x x where s is the root mean squared error rmse note that rmse is a consistent estimator of the true variance of the error term formula 1 x is the regression design matrix a matrix such that x is the value of the j independent variable for the i case or observation and such that x the predictor vector associated with the intercept term equals 1 for all i it turns out that the square of this standard error the estimated variance of the estimate of can be equivalently expressed as where r is the multiple r for the regression of x on the other covariates a regression that does not involve the response variable y this identity separates the influences of several distinct factors on the variance of the

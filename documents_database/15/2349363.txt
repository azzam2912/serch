in 1945 he developed a new method for obtaining calcined and caustic soda from sodium sulfate coal and water vapour in 1946 1962 he defined the thermodynamic characteristics of a number of inorganic compounds and chemical processes he created a method for accurate calculation of the high temperature heat capacity of solid inorganic compounds widely used in thermodynamic studies of high temperature metallurgical processes silicate technology and inorganic technology since 1961 he developed research on experimental thermodynamics achieving high accuracy results in 1965 1979 he studied the high temperature enthalpy and heat capacity of many individual ferrites and their solid solutions he experimentally measured the heats of transformations including magnetic ones in the immediate vicinity of the transition points he established the relationship between the composition and properties as well as between the magnetic and thermal properties of ferrites awarded the order of the red banner the order of friendship of peoples and the order of the badge of honor

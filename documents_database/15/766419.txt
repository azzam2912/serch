inductive charging is usually done with a charging station or inductive pad energy is sent through an inductive coupling to an electrical device which can then use that energy to charge batteries or run the device it is the technology that enables smartphone wireless charging such as the qi wireless charging standard induction chargers use an induction coil to create an alternating electromagnetic field from within a charging base and a second induction coil in the portable device takes power from the electromagnetic field and converts it back into electric current to charge the battery the two induction coils in proximity combine to form an electrical transformer greater distances between sender and receiver coils can be achieved when the inductive charging system uses resonant inductive coupling recent improvements to this resonant system include using a movable transmission coil i e mounted on an elevating platform or arm and the use of other materials for the receiver coil made of silver plated copper or sometimes aluminium to minimize weight and decrease resistance due to the skin effect the transfer of power was the very first attempt using radio waves as a medium radio waves were first predicted in 1864 by james

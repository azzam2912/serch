if we denote by s the power set of s and by v the empty set then v can also be constructed by setting v v v v v v and so on thus v can be expressed as follows the hereditarily finite sets are a subclass of the von neumann universe they are a model of the axioms consisting of the axioms of set theory with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation thus proving that the axiom of infinity is not a consequence of the other axioms of set theory notice that there are countably many hereditarily finite sets since v is finite for any finite n its cardinality is 2 see tetration and the union of countably many finite sets is countable equivalently a set is hereditarily finite if and only if its transitive closure is finite v is also symbolized by formula 2 meaning hereditarily of cardinality less than formula 3 gave the following natural bijection f from the natural numbers to the hereditarily finite sets known as the ackermann coding it is defined recursively by we have f m f n if and only if the m th binary digit of n counting from

it has been part of the collection of the city of amsterdam since the van der hoop bequest in 1854 and in the rijksmuseum in amsterdam since it opened in 1885 the first vermeer it acquired the central element of the painting is a woman in blue standing in front of a window not depicted reading a letter the woman appears to be pregnant although many have argued that the woman s rounded figure is simply a result of the fashions of the day although the woman s loose clothing may be suggestive pregnancy was very rarely depicted in art during this period while the contents of the letter are not visible the composition of the painting is revealing the map of the county of holland and west friesland in the netherlands on the wall behind the woman has been interpreted as suggesting that the letter she reads was written by a traveling husband alternatively the box of pearls barely visible on the table before the woman might suggest a lover as pearls are sometimes a symbol of vanity the very action of letter reading reflects a thematic pattern throughout vermeer s works as a common private moment becomes revealing

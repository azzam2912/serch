aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric in nature i e it has both basic and acidic properties closely related are aluminium oxide hydroxide alo oh and aluminium oxide or alumina alo the latter of which is also amphoteric these compounds together are the major components of the aluminium ore bauxite the naming for the different forms of aluminium hydroxide is ambiguous and there is no universal standard all four polymorphs have a chemical composition of aluminium trihydroxide one aluminium atom attached to three hydroxide groups gibbsite is also known as hydrargillite named after the greek words for water and clay the first compound named hydrargillite was thought to be aluminium hydroxide but was later found to be aluminium phosphate despite this both gibbsite and hydrargillite are used to refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide with gibbsite used most commonly in the united states and hydrargillite used more often in europe in 1930 it was referred to as alumina trihydrate to contrast it with bayerite which was called alumina trihydrate the alpha and beta designations were used to differentiate the more and less common forms respectively in 1957 a symposium on alumina nomenclature attempted to develop a universal standard resulting in

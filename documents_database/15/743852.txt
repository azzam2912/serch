this test has now become embodied within european directive 2005 66 ec coming into force in may 2007 effectively outlawing traditional metal fabricated bull bars the new legislation has led to the development of more pedestrian friendly products various manufacturers have undertaken development using softer energy absorbing materials however the overhead of testing has prevented many designs from coming to market the terminology frontal protection system derives from three terms an fps attaches to the front of a vehicle like a bull bar but is made of a technical composite of energy absorbing materials the composite technology offers an interim solution to vehicle designers assisting them to meet ec directive 2003 102 ec phase 2 testing in 2001 showed that steel bull bars could lead to greater risk of injury later studies carried out by mira one of the uk s leading testing facilities may have proved that the latest development of a vehicle frontal protection system can make many 4x4 vehicles safer in the event of front end collisions with pedestrians or cyclists calculations based on these tests show that if fitted to a current large 4x4 vehicle an fps could save lives and reduce serious pedestrian injuries this

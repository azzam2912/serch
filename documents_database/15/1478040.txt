a standard design uses a red light emitting diode led at the focus of collimating optics which generates a dot style illuminated reticle that stays in alignment with the weapon the sight is attached to regardless of eye position nearly parallax free they are considered to be fast acquisition and easy to use gun sights for target shooting hunting and in police and military applications aside from firearm applications they are also used on cameras and telescopes on cameras they are used to photograph flying aircraft birds in flight and other distant quickly moving subjects telescopes have a narrow field of view and therefore are often equipped with a secondary finder scope such as a red dot sight the typical configuration for a red dot sight is a tilted spherical mirror reflector with a red light emitting diode led at its off axis focus the mirror has a partially silvered multilayer dielectric dichroic coating designed to reflect just the red spectrum allowing it to pass through most other light the led used is usually deep red 670 nanometre wavelength since they are very bright are high contrast against a green scene and work well with a dichroic coating since they

the various r nyi entropies are all equal for a uniform distribution but measure the unpredictability of a nonuniform distribution in different ways the min entropy is never greater than the ordinary or shannon entropy which measures the average unpredictability of the outcomes and that in turn is never greater than the hartley or max entropy defined as the logarithm of the number of outcomes with nonzero probability as with the classical shannon entropy and its quantum generalization the von neumann entropy one can define a conditional version of min entropy the conditional quantum min entropy is a one shot or conservative analog of conditional quantum entropy to interpret a conditional information measure suppose alice and bob were to share a bipartite quantum state formula 1 alice has access to system formula 2 and bob to system formula 3 the conditional entropy measures the average uncertainty bob has about alice s state upon sampling from his own system the min entropy can be interpreted as the distance of a state from a maximally entangled state this concept is useful in quantum cryptography in the context of privacy amplification see for example definition let formula 1 be a bipartite density operator

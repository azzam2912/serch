it is found in the microsomal fraction of the procine kidney cortex it exists as a disulfide linked homodimer that is glygosylphosphatidylinositol gpi anchored to the renal brush border of the kidney the active site on each homodimer is made up of a barrel subunit with binuclear zinc ions that are bridged by the gly125 side chain located at the bottom of the barrel the gene coding for dpep1 is 6 kb long and consists of ten exons and nine introns the protein itself is made of 411 amino acid residues and is only transcribed in kidney cells although disulfide linkages in dpep1 do not contribute to the enzyme s activity they are essential for the enzyme s proper function because they keep the enzyme s subunits together and attached to the renal brush border cysteine 261 is involved in disulfide linkage between the enzyme s subunits and is also located very close to both the site of the gpi anchor and the membrane suggesting that it is also involved in the enzyme s linkage to the membrane dpep1 is also a metalloenzyme that specifically uses zinc as its cofactor the enzyme s typical zinc content is 1 42 ug

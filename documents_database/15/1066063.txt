essentially a nanotip is dragged by a spring over a corrugated energy landscape a frictional parameter can be introduced to describe the ratio between the energy corrugation and the elastic energy stored in the spring if the tip surface interaction is described by a sinusoidal potential with amplitude v and periodicity a then where k is the spring constant if superlubricity regime if 1 the tip motion consists in abrupt jumps between the minima of the energy landscape stick slip regime the name tomlinson model is however historically incorrect the paper by tomlinson that is often cited in this context did not contain the model known as the tomlinson model and suggests an adhesive contribution to friction in reality it was ludwig prandtl who suggested in 1928 this model to describe the plastic deformations in crystals as well as the dry friction in the meantime many researchers still call this model the prandtl tomlinson model in russia this model was introduced by the soviet physicists yakov frenkel and t kontorova the frenkel defect became firmly fixed in the physics of solids and liquids in the 1930s this research was supplemented with works on the theory of plastic deformation their theory

it describes the distribution of the quotient x n y n where the numerator x has a noncentral chi squared distribution with n degrees of freedom and the denominator y has a central chi squared distribution with n degrees of freedom it is also required that x and y are statistically independent of each other it is the distribution of the test statistic in analysis of variance problems when the null hypothesis is false the noncentral f distribution is used to find the power function of such a test if formula 1 is a noncentral chi squared random variable with noncentrality parameter formula 2 and formula 3 degrees of freedom and formula 4 is a chi squared random variable with formula 5 degrees of freedom that is statistically independent of formula 1 then is a noncentral f distributed random variable the probability density function pdf for the noncentral f distribution is when formula 9 and zero otherwise the degrees of freedom formula 3 and formula 5 are positive the term formula 12 is the beta function where the cumulative distribution function for the noncentral f distribution is where formula 15 is the regularized incomplete beta function the mean and variance

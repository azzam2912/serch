the motivating prototype example of an abelian category is the category of abelian groups ab the theory originated in an effort to unify several cohomology theories by alexander grothendieck and independently in the slightly earlier work of david buchsbaum abelian categories are very stable categories for example they are regular and they satisfy the snake lemma the class of abelian categories is closed under several categorical constructions for example the category of chain complexes of an abelian category or the category of functors from a small category to an abelian category are abelian as well these stability properties make them inevitable in homological algebra and beyond the theory has major applications in algebraic geometry cohomology and pure category theory abelian categories are named after niels henrik abel a category is abelian if it is preadditive and this definition is equivalent to the following piecemeal definition note that the enriched structure on hom sets is a consequence of the first three axioms of the first definition this highlights the foundational relevance of the category of abelian groups in the theory and its canonical nature the concept of exact sequence arises naturally in this setting and it turns out that exact functors

it compiles structured query language sql into machine code via termed code generation on april 23 2013 memsql launched its first generally available version of the database to the public it is a very fast database memsql combines lock free data structures and a just in time compilation jit to process highly volatile workloads more specifically memsql implements lock free hash tables and lock free skip lists in memory for fast random access to data sql queries sent to the memsql server are converted into byte code and compiled through llvm into machine code queries are then stripped of their parameters and the query template is stored as a shared object which is subsequently matched against incoming queries to the system executing pre compiled query plans removes interpretation along hot code paths providing highly efficient code paths that minimize the number of central processing unit cpu instructions required to process sql statements memsql is wire compatible with mysql this means that applications can connect to memsql through mysql clients and drivers as well as standard open database connectivity odbc and java database connectivity jdbc connectors in addition to mysql syntax and functionality memsql can also store columns in json format

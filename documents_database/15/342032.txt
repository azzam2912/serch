it was named for the butterfly multi stage switching network around which it was built each machine had up to 512 cpus each with local memory which could be connected to allow every cpu access to every other cpu s memory although with a substantially greater latency roughly 15 1 than for its own the cpus were commodity microprocessors the memory address space was shared the first generation used motorola 68000 processors followed by a 68010 version the butterfly connect was developed specifically for this computer the second or third generation gp 1000 models used motorola 68020 s and scaled to 256 cpus the later tc 2000 models used motorola mc88100 s and scaled to 512 cpus the butterfly was initially developed as the voice funnel a router for the st ii protocol intended for carrying voice and video over ip networks the butterfly hardware was later used for the butterfly satellite imp bsat packet switch of darpa s wideband packet satellite network which operated at multiple sites around the us over a shared 3 mbit s broadcast satellite channel in the late 1980s this network became the terrestrial wideband network based on terrestrial t1 circuits instead of a shared

the scuba diver must be weighted sufficiently to be slightly negatively buoyant at the end of the dive when most of the breathing gas has been used and needs to maintain neutral buoyancy at safety or obligatory decompression stops during the dive buoyancy is controlled by adjusting the volume of air in the buoyancy compensation device bcd and if worn the dry suit in order to achieve neutral or positive buoyancy as needed the amount of weight required is determined by the maximum overall positive buoyancy of the fully equipped but unweighted diver anticipated during the dive with an empty buoyancy compensator and normally inflated dry suit this depends on the diver s mass and body composition buoyancy of other diving gear worn especially the diving suit water salinity weight of breathing gas consumed and water temperature it normally is in the range of to the weights can be distributed to trim the diver to suit the purpose of the dive surface supplied divers may be more heavily weighted to facilitate underwater work and may be unable to achieve neutral buoyancy and rely on the diving stage bell umbilical lifeline shotline or jackstay for returning to the surface free divers

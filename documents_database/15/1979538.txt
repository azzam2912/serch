dr bergantin received his academic education at epm unifesp brazil and uam spain degree in biomedicine 2008 msc 2010 and phd 2014 his research involves cell signaling mediated by ca2 and camp skeletal and smooth muscles peripheral and central nervous systems his research work solved the enigma of the paradoxical effects produced by l type ca2 channel blockers top 25 hottest articles biochemistry genetics and molecular biology cell calcium top 1 july to september 2013 top 5 october to december 2013 top 1 january to december 2013 full year top 6 january to march 2014 since 1975 several clinical and experimental studies have reported that acute and chronic administration of l type voltage activated ca2 channels vaccs blockers such as nifedipine produces reduction in arterial pressure associated with an increase of sympathetic activity despite this sympathetic hyperactivity has been initially attributed to adjust reflex of arterial pressure the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this apparent sympathomimetic effect of the l type vaccs blockers remained unclear for decades in 2013 dr bergantin and collaborators discovered that this paradoxical increase in sympathetic activity produced by l type vaccs blockers is due to interaction of the ca2 camp signaling pathways then the

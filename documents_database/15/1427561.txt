the reader only discovers that the parsing is incorrect when it gets to the banana at that point in order to make sense of the sentence the reader is forced to re parse it with flies as the subject fruit as a qualifier of flies and like as the main verb the role of the first sentence is to predispose the reader towards the incorrect parsing of the second one however after re parsing the second sentence the reader presumably becomes aware that the first sentence too could be re parsed in the same way the sentence time flies like an arrow is in fact often used to illustrate syntactic ambiguity modern english speakers understand the sentence to unambiguously mean time passes fast as fast as an arrow travels but the sentence is syntactically ambiguous and alternatively could be interpreted as meaning for example in addition the sentence contains semantic ambiguity for instance the noun phrase time flies could refer to all time flies or particular time flies and an arrow to all arrows a particular arrow or different arrows for different flies compare fruit flies like a banana fruit flies ate a banana fruit flies live on a banana

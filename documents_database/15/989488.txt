it can be used as an amplifier or rotary transformer it is similar to a third brush dynamo but has additional regulator or variator windings it is also similar to an amplidyne except that the latter has a compensating winding which fully counteracts the effect of the flux produced by the load current the technical description is a cross field direct current machine designed to utilize armature reaction a metadyne can convert a constant voltage input into a constant current variable voltage output the word metadyne is derived from the greek words for conversion of power while the name is believed to have been coined by joseph maximus pestarini italian language giuseppe massimo pestarini in a paper which he submitted to the montefiore international contest at li ge belgium in 1928 the type of machine which it described had been known since the 1880s the first known british patent for a direct current cross field generator was obtained by a i gravier of paris in 1882 and two further patents were obtained by e rosenberg in 1904 and 1907 rosenberg later became the chief electrical engineer for metropolitan vickers and his machine produced a cross field by applying a short

this modification allows secondary reactions of this functional group that would otherwise not be possible the concept was introduced by d seebach hence the german word umpolung for reversed polarity and e j corey polarity analysis during retrosynthetic analysis tells a chemist when umpolung tactics are required to synthesize a target molecule the vast majority of important organic molecules contain heteroatoms which polarize carbon skeletons by virtue of their electronegativity therefore in standard organic reactions the majority of new bonds are formed between atoms of opposite polarity this can be considered to be the normal mode of reactivity one consequence of this natural polarization of molecules is that 1 3 and 1 5 heteroatom substituted carbon skeletons are extremely easy to synthesize aldol reaction claisen condensation michael reaction claisen rearrangement diels alder reaction whereas 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 heteroatom substitution patterns are more difficult to access via normal reactivity it is therefore important to understand and develop methods to induce umpolung in organic reactions the simplest method of obtaining 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 heteroatom substitution patterns is to start with them biochemical and industrial processes can provide inexpensive sources of chemicals that have normally

neurotensin was first isolated from extracts of bovine hypothalamus based on its ability to cause a visible vasodilation in the exposed cutaneous regions of anesthetized rats neurotensin is distributed throughout the central nervous system with highest levels in the hypothalamus amygdala and nucleus accumbens it induces a variety of effects including analgesia hypothermia and increased locomotor activity it is also involved in regulation of dopamine pathways in the periphery neurotensin is found in enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine where it leads to secretion and smooth muscle contraction neurotensin shares significant sequence similarity in its 6 c terminal amino acids with several other neuropeptides including neuromedin n which is derived from the same precursor this c terminal region is responsible for the full biological activity the n terminal portion having a modulatory role the neurotensin neuromedin n precursor can also be processed to produce large 125 138 amino acid peptides with the neurotensin or neuromedin n sequence at their c terminus these large peptides appear to be less potent than their smaller counterparts but are also less sensitive to degradation and may represent endogenous long lasting activators in a number of pathophysiological situations the sequence of bovine neurotensin was determined

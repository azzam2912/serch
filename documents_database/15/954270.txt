it was first stated by leonid kantorovich in 1948 it is similar to the form of the banach fixed point theorem although it does not assume the existence of a fixed point newton s method constructs a sequence of points that under certain conditions will converge to a solution formula 1 of an equation formula 2 or a vector solution of a system of equation formula 3 the kantorovich theorem gives conditions on the initial point of this sequence if those conditions are satisfied then a solution exists close to the initial point and the sequence converges to that point let formula 4 be an open subset and formula 5 a differentiable function with a jacobian formula 6 that is locally lipschitz continuous for instance if formula 7 is twice differentiable that is it is assumed that for any open subset formula 8 there exists a constant formula 9 such that for any formula 10 holds the norm on the left is some operator norm that is compatible with the vector norm on the right this inequality can be rewritten to only use the vector norm then for any vector formula 12 the inequality must hold now choose any initial

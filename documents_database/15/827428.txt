windsat was developed and managed by the space test program at kirtland afb nm designed for a three year lifetime it is primarily designed to measure ocean surface wind direction nonprecipitating conditions with a 25 km spatial resolution secondary measurements are sea surface temperature soil moisture rain rate ice and snow characteristics and water vapor the solar mass ejection imager smei is an instrument intended to detect disturbances in the solar wind by means of imaging scattered light from the free electrons in the plasma of the solar wind to do this three ccd cameras observe sections of the sky of size 60 by 3 degree as the smei instrument observes the whole sky data generated has been used to observe periodic changes in the brightness of stars this data can be used to detect asteroseismological oscillation in giant stars and for the detection of large eclipsing extra solar planets

it forms one of the reservoir units in the wytch farm oilfield in dorset the sandstone is very fine grained to fine grained and contains regular narrow bands that are calcite cemented and more resistant to weathering giving it a characteristic banded appearance at outcrop such as in the cliffs between bridport and burton bradstock in dorset it is named for bridport and has previously been known as the midford sand s cotteswold sands yeovil sands and upper lias sand s it forms a locally important aquifer particularly around yeovil the bridport sand formation is known from exposures in dorset somerset and gloucestershire and from the subsurface in numerous boreholes it is also present offshore in the portland south wight basin a sub basin of the wessex basin it reaches a maximum thickness of over 135 m in the kimmeridge 3 well in the onshore part of the portland south wight sub basin it thins northwards from dorset onto the mendips axis where it is missing it reappears to the north of the axis the formation shows significant lateral variations in lithology three separate facies have been recognised the bridport sands the ferruginous iron rich facies and the calcareous facies

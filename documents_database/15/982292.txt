docteur s sciences since 1977 he has been since 1985 directeur de recherches at cnrs and a member of the functional analysis team of the institut de math matique of paris talagrand was elected as correspondent of the acad mie des sciences of paris on march 1997 and then as a full member on november 2004 in the mathematics section talagrand studies mainly functional analysis and probability theory and their applications talagrand has been interested in probability with minimal structure he has obtained a complete characterization of bounded gaussian processes in very general settings and also new methods to bound stochastic processes he discovered new aspects of the isoperimetric and concentration of measure phenomena for product spaces by obtaining inequalities which make use of new kind of distances between a point and a subset of a product space these inequalities show in great generality that a random quantity which depends on many independent variables without depending too much on one of them does have only small fluctuations these inequalities helped to solve most classical problems in probability theory on banach spaces and have also transformed the abstract theory of stochastic processes these inequalities have been successfully used in many applications

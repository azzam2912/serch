there are two main categories of texture filtering magnification filtering and minification filtering depending on the situation texture filtering is either a type of reconstruction filter where sparse data is interpolated to fill gaps magnification or a type of anti aliasing aa where texture samples exist at a higher frequency than required for the sample frequency needed for texture fill minification put simply filtering describes how a texture is applied at many different shapes size angles and scales depending on the chosen filter algorithm the result will show varying degrees of blurriness detail spatial aliasing temporal aliasing and blocking depending on the circumstances filtering can be performed in software such as a software rendering package or in hardware for real time or gpu accelerated rendering or in a mixture of both for most common interactive graphical applications modern texture filtering is performed by dedicated hardware which optimizes memory access through memory cacheing and pre fetch and implements a selection of algorithms available to the user and developer there are many methods of texture filtering which make different trade offs between computational complexity memory bandwidth and image quality during the texture mapping process for any arbitrary 3d surface a takes place

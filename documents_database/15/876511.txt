in the case of an integer the variable definition is restricted to whole numbers only and the range will cover every number within its range including the maximum and minimum for example the range of a signed 16 bit integer variable is all the integers from 32 768 to 32 767 when an array is numerically indexed its range is the upper and lower bound of the array depending on the environment a warning a fatal exception or unpredictable behavior will occur if the program attempts to access an array element that is outside the range in some programming languages such as c arrays have a fixed lower bound zero and will contain data at each position up to the upper bound so an array with 5 elements will have a range of 0 to 4 in others such as php an array may have holes where no element is defined and therefore an array with a range of 0 to 4 will have up to 5 elements and a minimum of 2 another meaning of range in computer science is an alternative to iterator when used in this sense range is defined as a pair of begin end iterators

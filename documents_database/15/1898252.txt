the spherical basis closely relates to the description of angular momentum in quantum mechanics and spherical harmonic functions while spherical polar coordinates are one orthogonal coordinate system for expressing vectors and tensors using polar and azimuthal angles and radial distance the spherical basis are constructed from the standard basis and use complex numbers a vector a in 3d euclidean space can be expressed in the familiar cartesian coordinate system in the standard basis e e e and coordinates a a a or any other coordinate system with associated basis set of vectors from this extend the scalars to allow multiplication by complex numbers so that we are now working in formula 1 rather than formula 2 in the spherical bases denoted e e e and associated coordinates with respect to this basis denoted a a a the vector a is where the spherical basis vectors can be defined in terms of the cartesian basis using complex valued coefficients in the xy plane mathbf e frac 1 sqrt 2 mathbf e x frac i sqrt 2 mathbf e y in which i denotes the imaginary unit and one normal to the plane in the z direction the inverse relations are mathbf

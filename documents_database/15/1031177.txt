it was first published by leslie holdridge in 1947 and updated in 1967 it is a relatively simple system based on few empirical data giving objective mapping criteria a basic assumption of the system is that both soil and climax vegetation can be mapped once the climate is known while it was first designed for tropical and subtropical areas the system applies globally the system has been shown to fit tropical vegetation zones mediterranean zones and boreal zones but is less applicable to cold oceanic or cold arid climates where moisture becomes the determining factor the system has found a major use in assessing the possible changes in natural vegetation patterns due to global warming the three axes of the barycentric subdivisions are further indicators incorporated into the system are biotemperature is based on the growing season length and temperature it is measured as the mean of all temperatures with all temperatures below freezing and above 30 c adjusted to 0 c as plants are dormant at these temperatures holdridge s system uses biotemperature first rather than the temperate latitude bias of merriam s life zones and does not primarily consider elevation the system is considered more appropriate to the

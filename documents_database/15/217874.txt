it includes the chow ring of algebraic cycles as a special case some of the deepest problems in algebraic geometry and number theory are attempts to understand motivic cohomology let x be a scheme of finite type over a field k a key goal of algebraic geometry is to compute the chow groups of x because they give strong information about all subvarieties of x the chow groups of x have some of the formal properties of borel moore homology in topology but some things are missing for example for a closed subscheme z of x there is an exact sequence of chow groups the localization sequence whereas in topology this would be part of a long exact sequence this problem was resolved by generalizing chow groups to a bigraded family of groups borel moore motivic homology groups which were first called higher chow groups by bloch namely for every scheme x of finite type over a field k and integers i and j we have an abelian group h x z j with the usual chow group being the special case for a closed subscheme z of a scheme x there is a long exact localization sequence for motivic

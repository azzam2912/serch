it was developed in 2011 by professor hubert h girault s group at the cole polytechnique f d rale de lausanne epfl in switzerland in a typical estasi process a droplet of a protic solvent containing analytes is deposited on a sample area of interest which itself is mounted to an insulating substrate under this substrate and right below the droplet an electrode is placed and connected with a pulsed high voltage hv to electrostatically charge the droplet during pulsing when the electrostatic pressure is larger than the surface tension droplets and ions are sprayed estasi is a contactless process based on capacitive coupling one advantage of estasi is that the electrode and sample droplet act contact less avoiding thereby any oxidation or reduction of the sample compounds at the electrode surface which often happens during standard electrospray ionization esi estasi is a powerful new ambient ionization technique that has already found many applications in the detection of different analytes such as organic molecules peptides and proteins with molecule weight up to 70 kda furthermore it was used to couple ms with various separation techniques including capillary electrophoresis and gel isoelectric focusing and it was successfully applied under atmospheric pressure

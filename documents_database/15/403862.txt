this approach has been known since at least the mid 1980s in robotics where it has been called a meadow map and was popularized in video game ai in 2000 a navigation mesh is a collection of two dimensional convex polygons a polygon mesh that define which areas of an environment are traversable by agents in other words a character in a game could freely walk around within these areas unobstructed by trees lava or other barriers that are part of the environment adjacent polygons are connected to each other in a graph pathfinding within one of these polygons can be done trivially in a straight line because the polygon is convex and traversable pathfinding between polygons in the mesh can be done with one of the large number of graph search algorithms such as a agents on a navmesh can thus avoid computationally expensive collision detection checks with obstacles that are part of the environment representing traversable areas in a 2d like form simplifies calculations that would otherwise need to be done in the true 3d environment yet unlike a 2d grid it allows traversable areas that overlap above and below at different heights the polygons of various sizes

it was designed by siebe gorman company of lambeth and forrestt co ltd of wivenhoe in essex who built and supplied it in 1902 for the british admiralty local conditions at gibraltar dictated the need for such a craft the heavy harbour moorings have three chains extending out radially along the seabed from a central ring each terminating in a large anchor most harbours have a soft seabed and it is usual to lay down moorings by settling anchors in the mud clay or sand but this could not be done in gibraltar harbour where the seabed is hard rock for gibraltar the seabed needed to be dug out sufficiently for an anchor point to hold the barge would be towed over the work site moored in place with anchors and the bell would be lowered to the seabed air pumped into the bell would displace the water and workers accessed the bell through the airlock in the central access shaft this system allowed continuous work with changes of workmen in four hour shifts and allowed men to work on the seabed in normal work clothing in 1969 the gibraltar chronicle reported the plant as still working in the harbour

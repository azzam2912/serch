while relatively small quantities of water appear to be colorless pure water has a slight blue color that becomes a deeper blue as the thickness of the observed sample increases the blue hue of water is an intrinsic property and is caused by selective absorption and scattering of white light dissolved elements or suspended impurities may give water a different color the intrinsic colour of liquid water may be demonstrated by looking at a white light source through a long pipe that is filled with purified water and closed at both ends with a transparent window the light turquoise blue colour is caused by weak absorption in the red part of the visible spectrum absorptions in the visible spectrum are usually attributed to excitations of electronic energy states in matter water is a simple three atom molecule ho and all its electronic absorptions occur in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum and are therefore not responsible for the colour of water in the visible region of the spectrum the water molecule has three fundamental modes of vibration two stretching vibrations of the o h bonds in the gaseous state of water occur at v 3650 cm and v 3755

seismic inversion may be pre or post stack deterministic random or geostatistical it typically includes other reservoir measurements such as well logs and cores geophysicists routinely perform seismic surveys to gather information about the geology of an oil or gas field these surveys record sound waves which have traveled through the layers of rock and fluid in the earth the amplitude and frequency of these waves can be estimated so that any side lobe and tuning effects introduced by the wavelet may be removed seismic data may be inspected and interpreted on its own without inversion but this does not provide the most detailed view of the subsurface and can be misleading under certain conditions because of its efficiency and quality most oil and gas companies now use seismic inversion to increase the resolution and reliability of the data and to improve estimation of rock properties including porosity and net pay there are many different techniques used in seismic inversion these can be roughly grouped into two categories the combination of these categories yields four technical approaches to the inversion problem and the selection of a specific technique depends on the desired objective and the characteristics of the subsurface rocks

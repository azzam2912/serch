these were probably rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks or of waterfowl and are here placed in the order odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty the fossil specimens show that p miocaenus was one of the larger pseudotooth birds hardly smaller in size than osteodontornis or the older dasornis its head must have been about long in life and its wingspan was probably more than perhaps closer to unlike in its contemporary osteodontornis but like in the older pseudodontornis between each two of pelagornis s large teeth was a single smaller one pelagornis differed from dasornis and its smaller contemporary odontopteryx in having no pneumatic foramen in the fossa pneumotricipitalis of the humerus a single long latissimus dorsi muscle attachment site on the humerus instead of two distinct segments and no prominent ligamentum collaterale ventrale attachment knob on the ulna further differences between odontopteryx and pelagornis are found in the tarsometatarsus in the latter it has a deep fossa of the hallux first metatarsal bone whereas its middle toe trochlea is not conspicuously expanded forward the salt glands inside the eye sockets were extremely large and well developed in pelagornis from the humerus pieces of specimen lacm 127875

the interplay among these genes is broadly used as an example of epistasis labrador retrievers are a popular dog breed in many countries there are three recognised colours black chocolate and yellow that result from the interplay among genes that direct production and expression of two pigments eumelanin and pheomelanin in the fur and skin of the dog the recognized colours are due to two genes while a third gene affects the range of colouration observed within the yellow labrador these individual genes do not act independently of each other and their interaction in affecting the trait of coat colour is used to demonstrate the genetic principle of epistasis where multiple genes react synergistically to affect a single trait the genetics of mammalian colouration has been studied in detail and similar mechanisms have been identified across many species for this reason much of the early work on the colouration of dogs in general and labradors in particular have relied heavily on analogy to the traits characterized in mice and other mammals initial genetic studies of coat colour in dogs published in the 1950s concluded that there were two main genes involved one distinguishing blacks from browns and the other distinguishing

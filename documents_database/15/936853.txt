in fluid dynamics it lies directly in the wake of an object traveling within a fluid and is accompanied by a vertical protrusion if it occurs in a river boaters upstream steer clear of their appearance the degree of their formation can indicate the efficiency of a boat s hull design the magnitude of these features in a boat increases with speed while the relationship is inversely proportional for airplanes energetic volcanic eruptions can create rooster tail formations from their ejecta they can form in relation to coronal loops near the sun s surface in gear shifting it is the relation between the coefficient of friction and the sliding speed of the clutch cars can throw rooster tails in their wake and loose materials are under its wheels in meteorology a rooster tail satellite pattern can be applied to either low or high level cloudiness with the low cloud line seen in the wake of tropical cyclones and the high cloud pattern seen either within mare s tails or within the outflow jet of tropical cyclones rooster tails are caused by constructive interference near and to the wake of objects within a flowing fluid a fast current of water flowing

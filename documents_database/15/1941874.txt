other trapping devices utilize acoustic electric magnetic and optical fields for trapping this device uses solely hydrodynamic flow since it does not utilize acoustic electric magnetic or optical fields the particles being studied do not need to possess chemical or physical characteristics that cater to these fields instead hydrodynamic trapping is universal and can be used on any particles hydrodynamic traps are able to confine small nanoparticles this is because the hydrodynamic trapping force is closely related to radius of a particle whereas alternate trapping methods are more closely related to volume of a particle these traps are stable and they allow for precise control of environmental factors this means that if a specific nanoparticle in a solution is desired for study this nanoparticle can be trapped in concentrated sample suspensions the surrounding medium in the trap can be easily controlled in addition to the previously mentioned advantages of using hydrodynamic trapping hydrodynamic trapping is also a relatively low cost trapping method and it is very easy to use and analyze it is also simple and inexpensive to incorporate into existing soft lithography based microfluidic systems the first step in creating the microfluidic devices used for hydrodynamic trapping is to

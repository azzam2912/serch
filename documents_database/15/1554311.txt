the halo ketones are readily prepared from ketones by various ketone halogenation reactions and the products are reactive intermediates that can be used for a variety of other chemical reactions the reduction of halo ketones generates a variety of product structures that may exhibit unique substitution patterns and reactivity for instance reduction of dihalo ketones leads to 2 oxyallyl metal complexes which participate in 4 3 and 3 2 cycloaddition reactions as the 2 component 2 oxyallyl metal intermediates may also intercept nucleophiles in a process that involves umpolung at the carbon in addition because reduction of monohalo ketones produces enolates in a site specific fashion reactions associated with enolates alkylation aldol michael may be carried out using halo ketone substrates under reductive conditions many reducing agents used in this type of reaction are commercially available a few require preparation and immediate use including zinc copper couple and zinc silver couples and organocuprates monohalo ketones are reduced by both one electron and two electron reducing agents to afford the parent ketones derivatives functionalized with electrophiles or products of dimerization the mechanism of reduction itself depends on the nature of the reducing agent one electron reducing agents such as d or

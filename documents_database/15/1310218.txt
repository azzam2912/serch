it was invented and patented in 1954 by george h royer it has the advantages of simplicity low component count rectangle waveforms and easy transformer isolation by making maximum use of the transformer core it also minimises the size and weight of the transformer the classic royer circuit outputs square waves there is another converter design often described as a resonant royer which generates sinewaves this was apparently first described in 1959 by baxandall and therefore should be called the baxandall converter its differences are explained below both versions are widely used mainly as power inverters the royer circuit consists of a saturable core transformer with a center tapped primary winding a feedback winding and optionally a secondary winding the two halves of the primary are driven by two transistors in push pull configuration the feedback winding couples a small amount of the transformer flux back in to the transistor bases to provide positive feedback generating oscillation the oscillation frequency is determined by the maximum magnetic flux density the power supply voltage and the inductance of the primary winding the basic royer generates square wave output the need to use a saturable core limits the choice of core material some

the thought experiment is usually described as follows two identical capacitors are connected in parallel with an open switch between them one of the capacitors is charged with a voltage of formula 1 the other is uncharged when the switch is closed some of the charge formula 2 on the first capacitor flows into the second reducing the voltage on the first and increasing the voltage on the second when a steady state is reached and the current goes to zero the voltage on the two capacitors must be equal since they are connected together since they both have the same capacitance formula 3 the charge will be divided equally between the capacitors so each capacitor will have a charge of formula 4 and a voltage of formula 5 at the beginning of the experiment the total initial energy formula 6 in the circuit is the energy stored in the charged capacitor at the end of the experiment the final energy formula 8 is equal to the sum of the energy in the two capacitors thus the final energy formula 8 is equal to half of the initial energy formula 6 where did the other half of the initial energy

he is one of the pioneers in evolutionary computation and one of the authors responsible for the evolution strategies evolutionsstrategien his work has helped to understand the dynamics of evolutionary algorithms and to put evolutionary computation on formal grounds schwefel was born in berlin he attended the technical university of berlin tub and graduated as an aerospace engineer in 1965 and got his dr ing in 1975 while as a student at tub he met ingo rechenberg in november 1963 both of them were studying the aero and space technology and both of them were keen on cybernetics and bionics rechenberg was dealing with wall shear stress measurements and schwefel was responsible for organizing fluid dynamics exercises for other students together they were dreaming of a research robot working according to cybernetic principles but computers became available only later on while attending the hermann f ttinger institute for hydrodynamics hfi at tub he and rechenberg began performing experiments upon wings kinked plates and other objects related to fluid dynamics the main objective of those experiments concerned optimizing the shape and or parameters through mostly small modifications on the real objects a technique they called experimental optimization in order to reduce

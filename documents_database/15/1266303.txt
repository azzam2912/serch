it is a complex process manifested by diverse groups of bacteria involving a series of biochemical reactions using three steps similar to anaerobic conversion dark fermentation differs from photofermentation in that it proceeds without the presence of light fermentative hydrolytic microorganisms hydrolyze complex organic polymers to monomers which are further converted to a mixture of lower molecular weight organic acids and alcohols by obligatory producing acidogenic bacteria utilization of wastewater as a potential substrate for biohydrogen production has been drawing considerable interest in recent years especially in the dark fermentation process industrial wastewater as a fermentative substrate for h production addresses most of the criteria required for substrate selection viz availability cost and biodegradability angenent et al 2004 kapdan and kargi 2006 chemical wastewater venkata mohan et al 2007a b cattle wastewater tang et al 2008 dairy process wastewater venkata mohan et al 2007c rai et al 2012 starch hydrolysate wastewater chen et al 2008 and designed synthetic wastewater venkata mohan et al 2007a 2008b have been reported to produce biohydrogen apart from wastewater treatment from dark fermentation processes using selectively enriched mixed cultures under acidophilic conditions various wastewaters viz paper mill wastewater idania et al 2005 starch effluent zhang

as a result of the inhibition of actin polymerization cytochalasins can change cellular morphology inhibit cellular processes such as cell division and even cause cells to undergo apoptosis cytochalasins have the ability to permeate cell membranes prevent cellular translocation and cause cells to enucleate cytochalasins can also have an effect on other aspects of biological processes unrelated to actin polymerization for example cytochalasin a and cytochalasin b can also inhibit the transport of monosaccharides across the cell membrane cytochalasin h has been found to regulate plant growth cytochalasin d inhibits protein synthesis and cytochalasin e prevents angiogenesis cytochalasins are known to bind to the barbed fast growing plus ends of microfilaments which then blocks both the assembly and disassembly of individual actin monomers from the bound end once bound cytochalasins essentially cap the end of the new actin filament one cytochalasin will bind to one actin filament studies done with cytochalasin d cd have found that cd actin dimers contain atp bound actin upon formation these cd actin dimers are reduced to cd actin monomers as a result of atp hydrolysis the resulting cd actin monomer can bind atp actin monomer to reform the cd actin dimer cd is very

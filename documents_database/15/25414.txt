since the degree of operationalization can vary itself it can result in a more or less operational definition the procedures included in definitions should be repeatable by anyone or at least by peers an example of operational definition of the term weight of an object operationalized to a degree would be the following weight is the numbers that appear when that object is placed on a weighing scale according to it the weight can be any of the numbers shown on the scale after and including the very moment the object is put on it clearly the inclusion of the moment when one can start reading the numbers on the scale would make it more fully an operational definition nonetheless it is still in contrast to those purely theoretical definitions properties described in this manner must be sufficiently accessible so that people other than the definer may independently measure or test for them at will an operational definition is generally designed to model a theoretical definition the most operational definition is a process for identification of an object by distinguishing it from its background of empirical experience the binary version produces either the result that the object exists or that

the failure modes can in simple cases be found by simple mathematical solutions for complex structures the failure modes are found by numerical tools when a structure is subjected to compressive axial stress buckling may occur buckling is characterized by a sudden sideways deflection of a structural member this may occur even though the stresses that develop in the structure are well below those needed to cause failure of the material of which the structure is composed as an applied axial load is increased on a member such as a column it will ultimately become large enough to cause the member to become unstable and it is said to have buckled further loading will cause significant and somewhat unpredictable deformations possibly leading to complete loss of the member s load carrying capacity if the deformations that occur after buckling do not cause the complete collapse of that member the member will continue to support the load that caused it to buckle if the buckled member is part of a larger assemblage of components such as a building any load applied to the buckled part of the structure beyond that which caused the member to buckle will be redistributed within the

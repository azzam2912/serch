a flare is used for signaling illumination or defensive countermeasures in civilian or military applications it is based on a non hygroscopic not absorbing air dilithium nitrogen rich salt that served as an oxidizer and red colorant the u s army research laboratory and the ludwig maximilian institution were credited as the research facilities for developing this product announced in january 2018 as of 2018 this is the first documented red light flare compound that is based on lithium and does not contain any perchlorates halogenated materials or strontium based materials this formulation was assessed as having high color quality to achieve the red light emission from the flare the authors report a formulation mixture of powdered magnesium and hexamine as fuels nitrocellulose an epoxy binder system and lithium based nitrogen salts as the oxidizer and color agent when burned users could observe a cool burning flame emitting a deep red color when the flares are burned a chemical reaction involving strontium chloride srcl occurs srcl emits the red color after the flare is ignited this chemical compound is known as a metastable molecular emitter meaning it is not stable at low temperatures but stable in excited high temperature combustion

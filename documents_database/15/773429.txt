iceland lies on the divergent boundary between the eurasian plate and the north american plate it also lies above a hotspot the iceland plume the plume is believed to have caused the formation of iceland itself the island first appearing over the ocean surface about 16 to 18 million years ago the result is an island characterized by repeated volcanism and geothermal phenomena such as geysers the eruption of laki in 1783 caused much devastation and loss of life leading to a famine that killed about 25 of the island s population and resulted in a drop in global temperatures as sulfur dioxide was spewed into the northern hemisphere this caused crop failures in europe and may have caused droughts in india the eruption has been estimated to have killed over six million people globally between 1963 and 1967 the new island of surtsey was created off the southwest coast by a volcanic eruption since iceland is located above the mid atlantic ridge some scientists believe the hotspot beneath iceland could have contributed to the rifting of the supercontinent pangaea and the subsequent formation of the north atlantic ocean this is because igneous rocks have been found on both sides

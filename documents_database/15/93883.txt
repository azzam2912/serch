aldoses can be distinguished from ketoses which have the carbonyl group away from the end of the molecule and are therefore ketones like most carbohydrates simple aldoses have the general chemical formula c ho because formaldehyde n 1 and glycolaldehyde n 2 are not generally considered to be carbohydrates the simplest possible aldose is the triose glyceraldehyde which only contains three carbon atoms because they have at least one asymmetric carbon center all aldoses exhibit stereoisomerism aldoses can exist in either a form or form the determination is made based on the chirality of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the aldehyde end namely the second last carbon in the chain aldoses with alcohol groups on the right of the fischer projection are aldoses and those with alcohols on the left are aldoses aldoses are more common than aldoses in nature examples of aldoses include glyceraldehyde erythrose ribose glucose and galactose ketoses and aldoses can be chemically differentiated through seliwanoff s test where the sample is heated with acid and resorcinol the test relies on the dehydration reaction which occurs more quickly in ketoses so that while aldoses react slowly producing a light pink color ketoses react more quickly and strongly

the function of this complex is to reduce surface tension in the alveolus and prevent collapse during expiration the protein component of surfactant helps in the modulation of the innate immune response and inflammatory processes sp a2 is a member of a subfamily of c type lectins called collectins together with surfactant protein a1 sp a1 they are the most abundant proteins of pulmonary surfactant sp a2 binds to the carbohydrates found in the surface of several microorganisms and helps in the defense against respiratory pathogens surfactant homeostasis is critical for breathing and thus survival in the prematurely born infant but also for maintaining lung health and normal lung function throughout life quantitative and or qualitative alterations in surfactant composition and or function are associated with respiratory diseases the lung is the main site of sftpa2 synthesis but sftpa2 mrna expression has also been detected in the trachea prostate pancreas thymus colon eye salivary gland and other tissues while the majority of these tissues express both sftpa2 and sftpa1 transcripts only sftpa2 expression was found in the trachea and prostate using specific monoclonal antibodies for surfactant protein a the protein can be detected in lung alveolar type ii pneumocytes club

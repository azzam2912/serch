a mammoth task from a recording viewpoint as the tempo of the concerts and of course the running order of the material changes from night to night according to the mood of the boys the accuracy of their memory their feelings the rapport of the crowd the strength of the coffee at half time i m convinced the weather situation these and many other excuses have been put to me by the boys for making my life a misery to try and plot the moment to change tapes to convince them that they won t be heard 30 feet away from the microphone to tell them that hefty foot tapping will inevitably come over on the track is a waste of breath and a source of endless amusement to ronnie and roy suffice to say that recording them on tour has made me lighter by nearly a stone and for that reason and of course for the laughter the stirring moments the sad songs the sense of having tried and i hope achieved recording the corries live it hass all been worthwhile good listening alan spence recording supervisor

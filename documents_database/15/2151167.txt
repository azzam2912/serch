both the component cyclobutadiene and cyclooctatetraene component rings are antiaromatic but when fused together the rings counteract each other bicyclo 6 2 0 decapentaene can be synthesised in a multistep process from bicyclo 4 2 0 octa 3 7 diene 2 5 dione this is irradiated with ultraviolet producing a tricyclo decadiendione this is then reduced to a diol with lithium aluminium hydride the cis isomer then is converted to a tetraene by adding bromide or mesylate and then stripping it with potassium tert butoxide the tricyclodecatetraene has two four carbon rings fused to a hexadiene ring when this is heated to 100 c in benzene it converts to bicyclo 6 2 0 decapentaene losing one bridge to form a cyclooctatetraene ring another synthesis starts from octalene bicyclo 6 2 0 decapentaene has the appearance of orange red crystals when solid at 78 c in standard conditions it is a liquid red orange oil bicyclo 6 2 0 decapentaene dissolves in pentane bicyclo 6 2 0 decapentaene reacts with oxygen in air when heated to 100 c it dimerizes by converting to a yellow oil that consists of three eight member unsaturated rings an isomer of cyclooct c octalene bicyclo

it can be applied to large datasets generated using either oligonucleotide arrays medip chip or next generation sequencing medip seq providing a quantitative estimation of absolute methylation state in a region of interest medip methylated dna immunoprecipitation is an experimental technique used to assess dna methylation levels by using an antibody to isolate methylated dna sequences the isolated fragments of dna are either hybridized to a microarray chip medip chip or sequenced by next generation sequencing medip seq while this tells you what areas of the genome are methylated it does not give absolute methylation levels imagine two different genomic regions a and b region a has six cpgs dna methylation in mammalian somatic cells generally occurs at cpg dinucleotides three of which are methylated region b has three cpgs all of which are methylated as the antibody simply recognizes methylated dna it will bind both these regions equally and subsequent steps will therefore show equal signals for these two regions this does not give the full picture of methylation in these two regions in region a only half the cpgs are methylated whereas in region b all the cpgs are methylated therefore to get the full picture of methylation

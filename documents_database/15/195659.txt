injective hulls were first described in and are described in detail in the textbook a module e is called the injective hull of a module m if e is an essential extension of m and e is injective here the base ring is a ring with unity though possibly non commutative in some cases for r a subring of a self injective ring s the injective hull of r will also have a ring structure for instance taking s to be a full matrix ring over a field and taking r to be any ring containing every matrix which is zero in all but the last column the injective hull of the right r module r is s for instance one can take r to be the ring of all upper triangular matrices however it is not always the case that the injective hull of a ring has a ring structure as an example in shows a large class of rings which do have ring structures on their injective hulls are the nonsingular rings in particular for an integral domain the injective hull of the ring considered as a module over itself is the field of fractions the injective hulls

owing to the relatively high velocities involved and the likelihood of subsequent impact with the ground or sea very severe damage or the total destruction of at least one of the aircraft usually results the potential for a mid air collision is increased by miscommunication mistrust error in navigation deviations from flight plans lack of situational awareness and the lack of collision avoidance systems although a rare occurrence in general due to the vastness of open space available collisions often happen near or at airports where large volumes of aircraft are spaced more closely than in general flight the first recorded collision between aircraft occurred at the milano circuito aereo internazionale meeting held between 24 september and 3 october 1910 in milan italy on 3 october frenchman ren thomas flying the antoinette iv monoplane collided with british army captain bertram dickson by ramming his farman iii biplane in the rear both pilots survived but dickson was so badly injured that he never flew again the first fatal collision occurred in douai france on 19 june 1912 captain marcel dubois and lieutenant albert peignan both of the french army crashed into one another killing both pilots almost all modern large aircraft

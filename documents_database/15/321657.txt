it was introduced by arthur compton in his explanation of the scattering of photons by electrons a process known as compton scattering the compton wavelength of a particle is equal to the wavelength of a photon whose energy is the same as the mass see mass energy equivalence of that particle the standard compton wavelength of a particle is given by where is the planck constant is the particle s mass and is the speed of light the significance of this formula is shown in the derivation of the compton shift formula the codata 2014 value for the compton wavelength of the electron is other particles have different compton wavelengths when the compton wavelength is divided by one obtains the reduced compton wavelength barred lambda i e the compton wavelength for radian instead of radians where is the reduced planck constant the inverse reduced compton wavelength is a natural representation for mass on the quantum scale and as such it appears in many of the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics the reduced compton wavelength appears in the relativistic klein gordon equation for a free particle it appears in the dirac equation the following is an explicitly covariant form employing the

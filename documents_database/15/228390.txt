in the case of only two random variables this is called a bivariate distribution but the concept generalizes to any number of random variables giving a multivariate distribution the joint probability distribution can be expressed either in terms of a joint cumulative distribution function or in terms of a joint probability density function in the case of continuous variables or joint probability mass function in the case of discrete variables these in turn can be used to find two other types of distributions the marginal distribution giving the probabilities for any one of the variables with no reference to any specific ranges of values for the other variables and the conditional probability distribution giving the probabilities for any subset of the variables conditional on particular values of the remaining variables suppose each of two urns contains twice as many red balls as blue balls and no others and suppose one ball is randomly selected from each urn with the two draws independent of each other let formula 4 and formula 5 be discrete random variables associated with the outcomes of the draw from the first urn and second urn respectively the probability of drawing a red ball from either of

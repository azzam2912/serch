she studied inorganic chemistry at the university of w rzburg then carried out doctorate research on organometallic chemistry at the university of california at berkeley although her phd research focussed on organometallic chemistry including host guest systems and applications to catalysis fiedler became interested in cellular signal transduction pathways during her postdoctoral research at the university of california san francisco she started her independent career as an assistant professor at princeton university in 2010 her research focuses on the synthesis and signalling roles of inositol phosphates in particular those with a pyrophosphate functionality which has relevance to cellular signalling and cancer biology in 2015 fiedler became the director of the leibniz forschungsinstitut f r molekulare pharmakologie as well as a professor of chemistry at the humboldt university of berlin she continues developing her research focus on the synthesis and signalling roles of protein modifications involving pyrophosphates as well as building collaborations on biological chemistry and catalysis fiedler has received a new innovator award totalling over 2 million from the nih in 2013 she also received funding from the sidney kimmel foundation for cancer research and the rita allen foundation during her postdoctoral research she received the ernst schering foundation postdoctoral

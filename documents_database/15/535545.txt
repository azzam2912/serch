two giant molecular clouds are a part of it orion a and orion b the stars currently forming within the complex are located within these clouds a number of other somewhat older stars no longer associated with the molecular gas are also part of the complex most notably the orion s belt orion ob1b as well as the dispersed population north of it orion ob1a near the head of orion there is also a population of young stars that is centered on meissa the complex is between 1 000 and 1 400 light years away and hundreds of light years across the orion complex is one of the most active regions of nearby stellar formation visible in the night sky and is home to both protoplanetary discs and very young stars much of it is bright in infrared wavelengths due to the heat intensive processes involved in stellar formation though the complex contains dark nebulae emission nebulae reflection nebulae and h ii regions the presence of ripples on the surface of orion s molecular clouds was discovered in 2010 the ripples are a result of the expansion of the nebulae gas over pre existing molecular gas the orion complex includes

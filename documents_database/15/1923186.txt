ferroptosis is initiated by the failure of the glutathione dependent antioxidant defenses resulting in unchecked lipid peroxidation and eventual cell death lipophilic antioxidants and iron chelators can prevent ferroptotic cell death the accumulation of lipid peroxides that results in the process of ferroptosis makes it peroxidation driven meaning it is driven by the oxidative degeneration of lipids this process of cell death occurs when free radical molecules take electrons from a lipid molecule to cause the degradation of the lipid molecule this degradation is the result of the lipid molecules being oxidized meaning losing electrons to the free radical molecules this process makes ferroptosis a regulatory form of cell death the reason the process of oxidative degradation of a lipid drives ferroptosis is because glutathione peroxidase 4 gpx4 a lipid repair enzyme undergoes a loss of activity researchers have identified roles in which ferroptosis can contribute to the medical field such as in aiding in cancer treatments where this form of cell death can be induced in the human body ferroptosis activation plays a regulatory role on growth of tumor cells in the human body however the positive effects of ferroptosis could be potentially neutralized by its disruption of metabolic

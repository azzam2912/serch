such compounds are intermediates in many catalytic reactions that convert alkynes to other organic products e g hydrogenation and trimerization transition metal alkyne complexes are often formed by the displacement of labile ligands by the alkyne for example a variety of cobalt alkyne complexes may be formed by reaction of the alkyne with dicobalt octacarbonyl many alkyne complexes are produced by reduction of metal halides e g titanocene dichloride and bis triphenylphosphine platinum dichloride in the presence of the alkyne the coordination of alkynes to transition metals is similar to that of alkenes the bonding is described by the dewar chatt duncanson model upon complexation the c c bond elogates and the alkynyl carbon bends away from 180 for example in the phenylpropyne complex pt pph c ph me the c c distance is 1 277 25 vs 1 20 for a typical alkyne the c c c angle distorts 40 from linearity because the bending induced by complexation strained alkynes such as cycloheptyne and cyclooctyne are stabilized by complexation in the ir spectra the c c vibration of alkynes which occurs near 2300 cm shifts upon complexation to around 1800 cm indicating a weakening of the c c bond

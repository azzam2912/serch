another unusual feature of sn 2008ha was its low expansion velocity of only 2000 km s at maximum brightness which indicates a very small kinetic energy released in the explosion for comparison sn 2002cx expanded at a velocity of 5000 km s whereas typical sn ia expand at around 10 000 km s the low expansion velocity of sn2008ha resulted in relatively small doppler broadening of spectral emission lines and this led to higher quality data the supernova was studied with ultraviolet optical and near infrared photometry as well as optical spectra using the magellan telescopes in chile the mmt telescope in arizona the gemini and keck telescopes in hawaii and nasa s swift satellite spectroscopically sn 2008ha was identified as a sn 2002cx type a peculiar sub class of sn ia sn 2008ha had a brightness period of only 10 days which is significantly shorter than that of other sn 2002cx like objects 15 days or normal ia supernovas 20 days from the peak luminosity and the brightness time it was estimated that sn 2008ha generated 3 0 0 9 10 m of ni had a kinetic energy of 2 10 ergs and ejected 0 15 m of material

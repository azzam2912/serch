it is known from a collection of subfossil bones from the mare aux songes swamp a detailed sketch made by de jossigny in 1770 a no less detailed description by desjardins of a bird shot in 1836 and a number of brief reports about owls the first being those of van westzanen in 1602 and matelief in 1606 no descriptions of owls were recorded between the mid 17th and the late 18th century this led to considerable confusion especially since the bones were referred to ear tuft less strix or barn owls whereas the image and the description unequivocally show the presence of ear tufts thus it was for a long time believed that 2 or even 3 species of owls occurred on the island the supposed barn owl tyto newtoni was described from tarsometatarsus bones of what probably was a male individual of this species whereas the mauritius owl s type specimen seems to be a bone of a larger female bird but the bird was neither a strix nor a barn owl instead the mascarene owls of the genus mascarenotus were most probably an aberrant member of the scops owl lineage the mauritius bird was the largest species

pyoverdines are important virulence factors and are required for pathogenesis in many biological models of infection their contributions to bacterial pathogenesis include providing a crucial nutrient i e iron regulation of other virulence factors including exotoxin a and the protease prpl supporting the formation of biofilms and are increasingly recognized for having toxicity themselves pyoverdines have also been investigated as trojan horse molecules for the delivery of antimicrobials to otherwise resistant bacterial strains as chelators that can be used for bioremediation of heavy metals and as fluorescent reporters used to assay for the presence of iron and potentially other metals due to their bridging the gaps between pathogenicity iron metabolism and fluorescence pyoverdines have piqued the curiosity of scientists around the world for over 100 years like most siderophores pyoverdine is synthesized and secreted into the environment when the microorganism that produces it detects that intracellular iron concentrations have fallen below a preset threshold although iron is the fourth most abundant element in the earth s crust solubility of biologically relevant iron compounds is exceedingly low and is generally insufficient for the needs of most but not all microorganisms siderophores which are typically quite soluble and have exceptionally high avidity

the anomaly occurs during the die making by the single squeeze hubbing process while the exact cause of trails wavy steps is not known it is believed to be caused by movement of the die against the hub during the single squeeze hubbing process similarities exist between this anomaly and the doubled die however the major difference is that a doubled die is a duplication of a design element while a trail die is an extension of a design element in 1986 the annual report of the director of the mint for financial year 1986 states that the mint had been experimenting with a new single squeeze hubbing system in the year 1996 the mint announced at the opening of the denver mint s die shop that the cent nickel and dime dies would be made from this process it took until 1999 to include the rest of the denominational coins dies to be produced by this method while the purpose of the single squeeze hubbing process s creation was to entirely eliminate the doubled die error not only has it failed to do so but also it has produced this die anomaly whose properties are similar in nature this

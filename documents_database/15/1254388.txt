however roger blench 2014 argues that the aberrancy of utupua and vanikoro which he considers to be separate branches that do not group with each other is due to the fact that they are actually non austronesian languages blench 2014 doubts that utupua and vanikoro are closely related and thus should not be grouped together since each of the three utupua and three vanikoro languages are highly distinct from each other blench doubts that these languages had diversified on the islands of utupua and vanikoro but had rather migrated to the islands from elsewhere according to blench historically this was due to the lapita demographic expansion consisting of both austronesian and non austronesian settlers migrating from the lapita homeland in the bismarck archipelago to various islands further to the east ethnologue does not accept the vanikoro node fran ois 2009 notes that the lexicons of all three vanikoro languages are highly distinct from each other and do not appear to be closely related although their grammars are all similar

most courts have no such power and must entertain any case properly filed so long as the court has subject matter jurisdiction over the questions of law which must be decided and in personam jurisdiction over the parties to the case typically the highest court in a state or country will have discretionary jurisdiction the reason for this is that appellate courts in common law countries have two basic functions error correction and ensuring the orderly development of case law in the first case the appellate court simply examines the record and determines whether the lower court applied existing law correctly and reverses and remands sends the case back for severe errors that is the parties may generally agree on the applicable law but the appellant will contend that the trial court incorrectly interpreted and applied the existing law in the second case the appellate court rules on novel issues in a case and under stare decisis those rulings become new law in themselves in those cases the parties disagree vigorously if any existing legal rule even applies to the facts of the case or the appellant may be deliberately trying to attack an established rule in the hope that

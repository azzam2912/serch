it includes several sequenced fructose mannose and mannitol specific porters as well as several putative pts porters of unknown specificities the fructose porters of this family phosphorylate fructose on the 1 position those of tc family 4 a 6 phosphorylate fructose on the 6 position the iia iib and iic domains of the fructose and mannitol specific porters are demonstrably homologous the iib and iic domains of the fructose porters appear to be dissimilar from each other as those of the mannitol porters the iib and iic domains of these porters are homologous to those of the glc family however the structure of the iia domain of the mannitol porter of escherichia coli has been determined and it proved to possess an secondary structure a structure which is very different from the sandwich structure of iia further the iic domains of the mannitol and fructose porters are as dissimilar from each other as they are from the glucose or lactose families as is true of other members of the pts gfl superfamily the iic domains of these permeases probably have a uniform 10 tms topology

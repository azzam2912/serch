it is a special case of the frame matroid of a biased graph the circuits or minimal dependent sets of this matroid are the bicircular graphs or bicycles but that term has other meanings in graph theory these are connected graphs whose circuit rank is exactly two there are three distinct types of bicircular graph all these definitions apply to multigraphs i e they permit multiple edges edges sharing the same endpoints and loops edges whose two endpoints are the same vertex the closed sets flats of the bicircular matroid of a graph can be described as the forests of such that in the induced subgraph of every connected component has a cycle since the flats of a matroid form a geometric lattice when partially ordered by set inclusion these forests of also form a geometric lattice in the partial ordering for this lattice that if for the most interesting example let be with a loop added to every vertex then the flats of are all the forests of spanning or nonspanning thus all forests of a graph form a geometric lattice the forest lattice of g bicircular matroids can be characterized as the transversal matroids that arise from a

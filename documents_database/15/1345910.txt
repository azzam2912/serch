a region may refer to a country or subdivision national hiv records are often complicated incomplete or even nonexistent this list is only documented cases not for estimated cases estimated case numbers differ in significant ways estimates are available for all areas for all years unlike hard records and estimates attempt to quantify an epidemic in current time whereas registered documented cases are behind the curve they have lag time to detection and represent the past rather than current situation documentation of hiv transmission often present with significant holes and inconsistencies in the earlier years of the epidemic especially in africa health systems where completely overwhelmed and millions of people died without government recordkeeping there is little way of knowing how many people contracted hiv to get around the problem to get the total cumulative number of hiv infections hiv death data is taken into account in the table below where those living with hiv are summed with those died of hiv for a cumulative hiv infection figure nevertheless the data of credible death estimates exist only for the specific years where available in spite of data quality issues all these types of data help to create an epidemiological picture

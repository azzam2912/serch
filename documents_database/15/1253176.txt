86 or simply md 86 is the standard assault rifle used by the romanian military forces and manufactured in cugir romania by the romarm firm located in bucharest the export name for this variant is the aims 74 as the soviet union switched from the 7 62 39mm caliber akm to the 5 45 39mm caliber ak 74 it encouraged other nations of the warsaw pact to follow suit by the mid 1980s romania decided to switch calibers however it was decided that the new rifle would be developed independently and not represent a clone of the soviet ak 74 in doing so the pa md 86 has several anachronistic akm elements that were found only on the prototype soviet ak 74 the most easily recognized akm feature is the gas block design 45 degree versus 90 degree incidentally although the gas block is purely akm the gas vent in the barrel did change to a 90 degree design to minimize bullet shearing a problem with early soviet ak 74s with 45 degree gas blocks this means the romanian pa md 86 has a double angle gas port which makes it much harder to clean the gas vent this variant

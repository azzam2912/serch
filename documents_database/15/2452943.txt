driven by the evolution of 3d printing techniques nanolattices aiming to exploit beneficial material size effects through miniaturized lattice designs were first developed in the mid 2010s nanolattices are the smallest man made lattice truss structures and a class of metamaterials which derive their properties from both their geometry general metamaterial definition and the small size of their elements therefore they can possess effective properties which are not found in nature and may not be achieved with larger scale lattices of the same geometry to produce nanolattice materials polymer templates are manufactured by high resolution 3d printing processes such as multiphoton lithography or by self assembly techniques ceramic metal or composite material nanolattices are formed by post treatment of the polymer templates with techniques including pyrolysis atomic layer deposition electroplating and electroless plating pyrolysis which additionally shrinks the lattices by up to 90 creates the smallest size structures whereby the polymeric template material transforms into carbon or other ceramics and metals through thermal decomposition in inert atmosphere or vacuum nanolattices are the strongest existing cellular materials they are extremely light weight consisting of 50 99 air but can be as strong as steel the extremely small volume of their individual

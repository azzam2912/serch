how autism occurs is not well understood its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies there is evidence that gut brain axis abnormalities may be involved a 2015 review proposed that immune dysregulation gastrointestinal inflammation malfunction of the autonomic nervous system gut flora alterations and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction a 2016 review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight

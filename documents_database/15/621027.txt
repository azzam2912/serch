most species were relatively small in size the family flourished in the late triassic and early jurassic periods and has been found on numerous continents many members of coelophysidae are characterized by long slender skulls and light skeletons built for speed one member coelophysis displays the earliest known furcula in a dinosaur under cladistic analysis coelophysidae was first defined by paul sereno in 1998 as the most recent common ancestor of coelophysis bauri and procompsognathus triassicus and all of that common ancestor s descendants however tykoski 2005 has advocated for the definition to change to include the additional taxa of syntarsus kayentakatae and segisaurus halli coelophysidae is part of the superfamily coelophysoidea which in turn is a subset of the larger neotheropoda clade as part of coelophysoidea coelophysidae is often placed as sister to the dilophosauridae family however the monophyly of this clade has often been disputed the older term podokesauridae named 14 years prior to coelophysidae which would normally grant it priority is now usually ignored since its type specimen was destroyed in a fire and can no longer be compared to new finds coelophysids are characterized by slender skinny builds and long narrow skulls with large fenestrae to

trains trams going in the same direction can also overtake provided that the signalling arrangement allows it a passing loop is double ended and connected to the main track at both ends though a dead end siding known as a refuge siding which is much less convenient can be used a similar arrangement is used on the gauntlet track of cable railways and funiculars and in passing places on single track roads ideally the loop should be longer than all trains needing to cross at that point the first train to arrive must stop or move very slowly while the second to arrive may pass at speed if one train is too long for the loop it must wait for the opposing train to enter the loop before proceeding taking a few minutes ideally the shorter train should arrive first and leave second if both trains are too long for the loop time consuming see sawing or double saw by operations are required for the trains to cross on railway systems that use platforms especially high level platforms for passengers to board and disembark from trains the platforms may be provided on both the main and loop tracks or possibly

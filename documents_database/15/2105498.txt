these self maps were originally exploited in order to construct infinite families of elements in the homotopy groups of spheres their existence pointed the way towards the nilpotence and periodicity theorems the story begins with the degree formula 1 map on formula 2 as a circle in the complex plane the degree formula 1 map is well defined for formula 6 in general where formula 7 if we apply the infinite suspension functor to this map formula 8 and we take the cofiber of the resulting map we find that formula 10 has the remarkable property of coming from a moore space i e a designer co homology space formula 11 and formula 12 is trivial for all formula 13 it is also of note that the periodic maps formula 14 formula 15 and formula 16 come from degree maps between the toda smith complexes formula 17 formula 18 and formula 19 respectively the formula 20th toda smith complex formula 21 where formula 22 is a finite spectrum which satisfies the property that its bp homology formula 23 is isomorphic to formula 24 that is toda smith complexes are completely characterized by their formula 25 local properties and are defined

hmwk is inactive until it either adheres to binding proteins beneath an endothelium disrupted by injury thereby initiating coagulation or it binds to intact endothelial cells or platelets for functions other than coagulation in the past hmwk has been called hmwk kallikrein factor flaujeac factor 1975 fitzgerald factor 1975 and williams fitzgerald flaujeac factor the eponyms being for people first reported to have hmwk deficiency its current accepted name is to contrast it with low molecular weight kininogen lmwk which has a similar function to hmwk in the tissue as opposed to serum kinin kallikrein system hmwk is an alpha globulin with six functional domains it circulates as a single chain 626 amino acid polypeptide the heavy chain contains domains 1 2 and 3 the light chain domains 5 and 6 domain 4 links the heavy and light chains the domains contain the following functional sites hmwk is one of four proteins which interact to initiate the contact activation pathway also called the intrinsic pathway of coagulation the other three are factor xii factor xi and prekallikrein hmwk is not enzymatically active and functions only as a cofactor for the activation of kallikrein and factor xii it is also necessary

e shaw research to perform high speed molecular dynamics simulations of biological systems on conventional computer clusters the code uses novel parallel algorithms and numerical methods to achieve high performance on platforms containing multiple processors but may also be executed on a single computer the core and source code are available at no cost for non commercial use by universities and other not for profit research institutions and have been used in the folding home distributed computing project desmond is available as commercial software through schr dinger inc desmond supports algorithms typically used to perform fast and accurate molecular dynamics long range electrostatic energy and forces can be calculated using particle mesh ewald based methods constraints can be enforced using the m shake algorithm these methods can be used together with time scale splitting respa based integration schemes desmond can compute energies and forces for many standard fixed charged force fields used in biomolecular simulations and is also compatible with polarizable force fields based on the drude formalism a variety of integrators and support for various ensembles have been implemented in the code including methods for temperature control andersen nos hoover and langevin and pressure control berendsen martyna tobias klein

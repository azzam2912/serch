it is an example of a nanomedicine the agent represents a nanoparticle conjugate that consists of a drug delivery molecule namely a cyclodextrin based polymer cdp and an anti cancer compound camptothecin it was developed by mark e davis professor of chemical engineering at the california institute of technology and associates at insert therapeutics inc now calando pharmaceuticals inc hence the original name it 101 its novel delivery mode allows the agent and thus the toxic anti cancer component to be preferentially accumulated in cancer tissue in turn toxic side effect are expected to be reduced the technology was licensed by calando and caltech to cerulean pharma inc in june 2009 camptothecin cpt an alkaloid extract with poor water solubility from plants such as camptotheca acuminata exhibits anti cancer activity possibly due at least in part by the inhibition of dna topoisomerase i resulting in cell death in crlx101 cpt is linked covalently through a glycine link to the linear copolymer cdp which in turn consists of alternating subunits of beta cyclodextrin and polyethylene glycol peg the crlx101 nanoparticle is water soluble after intravenous injection active cpt is slowly released as the linkage is hydrolysed the size of the nanoparticle

the functional attains stationary value equal to actual scattering t matrix the functional is stationary if and only if the two functions satisfy the lippmann schwinger equation the development of the variational formulation of the scattering theory can be traced to works of l hult n and j schwinger in 1940s the t matrix expressed in the form of stationary value of the functional reads where formula 2 and formula 3 are the initial and the final states respectively formula 4 is the interaction potential and formula 5 is the retarded green s operator for collision energy formula 6 the condition for the stationary value of the functional is that the functions formula 7 and formula 8 satisfy the lippmann schwinger equation and different form of the stationary principle for t matrix reads the wave functions formula 7 and formula 8 must satisfy the same lippmann schwinger equations to get the stationary value the principle may be used for the calculation of the scattering amplitude in the similar way like the variational principle for bound states i e the form of the wave functions formula 14 is guessed with some free parameters that are determined from the condition of stationarity

this genetically inherited condition affects the retina and the white matter of the central nervous system resulting in vision loss lacunar strokes and ultimately dementia symptoms commonly begin in the early to mid forties and treatments currently aim to manage or alleviate the symptoms rather than treating the underlying cause the overall prognosis is poor and death can sometimes occur within 10 years of the first symptoms appearing the official name of the trex1 gene is three prime repair exonuclease 1 the normal function of the trex1 gene is to provide instructions for making the 3 prime repair exonuclease 1 enzyme this enzyme is a dna exonuclease which means it trims molecules of dna by removing dna building blocks nucleotides from the ends of the molecules in this way it breaks down unneeded dna molecules or fragments that may be generated during genetic material in preparation for cell division dna repair cell death and other processes changes mutations to the trex1 gene can result in a range of conditions one of which is ad rvcl the mutations to the trex1 gene are believed to prevent the production of the 3 prime repair exonuclease 1 enzyme researchers suggest that the absence

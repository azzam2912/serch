in the us soil classification of 1938 used the name planosols whereas its successor the usda soil taxonomy includes most planosols in the great groups albaqualfs albaquults and argialbolls these soils are typically in seasonally waterlogged flat lands they occur mainly in subtropical and temperate semi arid and subhumid regions planosols are formed mostly in clayey alluvial and colluvial deposits geological stratification and or a pedogenetic process of destruction and removal of clay has resulted in the relatively coarse textured light coloured surface soil abruptly overlying finer textured subsoil impeded downward percolation of water causes temporarily reducing conditions with a stagnic colour pattern at least close to the abrupt textural change planosols in their natural state support a sparse grass vegetation often with scattered shrubs and trees that have shallow root systems that can cope with temporary waterlogging agricultural land use on is normally less intensive than that on most other soils under the same climate conditions vast areas of planosols are used for extensive grazing wood production on planosols is much lower than on other soils under the same conditions in the temperate zone these soils are mainly in grass or planted to crops such as wheat and sugar

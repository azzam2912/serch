since the cuticle of these animals typically forms a largely inelastic exoskeleton it is shed during growth and a new larger covering is formed the remnants of the old empty exoskeleton are called exuviae after moulting an arthropod is described as teneral a callow it is fresh pale and soft bodied within one or two hours the cuticle hardens and darkens following a tanning process analogous to the production of leather during this short phase the animal expands since growth is otherwise constrained by the rigidity of the exoskeleton growth of the limbs and other parts normally covered by hard exoskeleton is achieved by transfer of body fluids from soft parts before the new skin hardens a spider with a small abdomen may be undernourished but more probably has recently undergone ecdysis some arthropods especially large insects with tracheal respiration expand their new exoskeleton by swallowing or otherwise taking in air the maturation of the structure and colouration of the new exoskeleton might take days or weeks in a long lived insect this can make it difficult to identify an individual if it has recently undergone ecdysis ecdysis allows damaged tissue and missing limbs to be regenerated or substantially re

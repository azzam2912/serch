the region has been heavily re engineered to accommodate the needs of water delivery shipping agriculture and most recently suburban development these needs have wrought direct changes in the movement of water and the nature of the landscape and indirect changes from the introduction of non native species new species have altered the architecture of the food web as surely as levees have altered the landscape of islands and channels that form the complex system known as the delta this article deals particularly with the ecology of the low salinity zone lsz of the estuary reconstructing a historic food web for the lsz is difficult for a number of reasons first there is no clear record of the species that historically have occupied the estuary second the san francisco estuary and delta have been in geologic and hydrologic transition for most of their 10 000 year history and so describing the natural condition of the estuary is much like hitting a moving target climate change hydrologic engineering shifting water needs and newly introduced species will continue to alter the food web configuration of the estuary this model provides a snapshot of the current state with notes about recent changes or

it has a mass around 13 jupiter masses and a radius around 46 larger than jupiter s it orbits at 9 au from beta pictoris close to the plane of the debris disk orbiting the star with a low eccentricity and a period of 20 21 years beta pictoris b is a super jupiter an exoplanet that has a radius and mass greater than that of the planet jupiter it has a temperature of most likely due to its dusty atmosphere and mass normally it would be much colder it has a mass of between 9 and 13 jupiter masses and a radius of 1 46 in 2018 a study directly measured the astrometric perturbation of beta pictoris by beta pictoris b one of the first examples of an exoplanet being measured directly by its astrometric perturbation its mass was directly measured as the planet orbits an a type star named beta pictoris the star has a mass of 1 75 solar masses and a radius of 1 8 solar radii it has a surface temperature of 8056 k and is 12 million years old in comparison the sun is about 4 6 billion years old and has a surface

wlp is essentially a true chip scale package csp technology since the resulting package is practically of the same size as the die wafer level packaging allows integration of wafer fab packaging test and burn in at wafer level in order to streamline the manufacturing process undergone by a device from silicon start to customer shipment wafer level packaging consists of extending the wafer fab processes to include device interconnection and device protection processes most other kinds of packaging do wafer dicing first and then put the individual die in a plastic package and attach the solder bumps wafer level packaging involves attaching the top and bottom outer layers of packaging and the solder bumps to integrated circuits while still in the wafer and then dicing the wafer there is no single industry standard method of wafer level packaging at present a major application area of wlps are smartphones due to the size constraints for example the apple iphone 5 has at least eleven different wlps the samsung galaxy s3 has six wlps and the htc one x has seven functions provided wlps in smartphones include sensors power management wireless etc in fact it has recently been rumored that the

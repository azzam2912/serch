it was introduced by oswald teichm ller identifying the roots of unity in the p adic integers with the corresponding ones in the complex numbers can be considered as a usual dirichlet character of conductor q more generally given a complete discrete valuation ring o whose residue field k is perfect of characteristic p there is a unique multiplicative section of the natural surjection the image of an element under this map is called its teichm ller representative the restriction of to k is called the teichm ller character if x is a p adic integer then formula 5 is the unique solution of formula 6 that is congruent to x mod p it can also be defined by the multiplicative group of p adic units is a product of the finite group of roots of unity and a group isomorphic to the p adic integers the finite group is cyclic of order p 1 or 2 as p is odd or even respectively and so it is isomorphic to z q z the teichm ller character gives a canonical isomorphism between these two groups a detailed exposition of the construction of teichm ller representatives for the p adic integers

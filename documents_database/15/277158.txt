however it does have a strong relationship to the icosidodecahedron an archimedean solid either one of the two clusters of two pentagons and two triangles can be aligned with a congruent patch of faces on the icosidodecahedron if two bilunabirotundae are aligned this way on opposite sides of the icosidodecahedron then two vertices from the bilunabirotundae will meet in the very center of the icosidodecahedron the other two clusters of faces of the bilunabirotunda each with one square and two triangles can be aligned with a congruent patch of faces on the rhombicosidodecahedron if two bilunabirotundae are aligned this way on opposite sides of the rhombicosidodecahedron then a cube can be put between the bilunabirotundae at the very center of the rhombicosidodecahedron each of the two pairs of adjacent pentagons each pair of pentagons sharing an edge can be aligned with the pentagonal faces of a metabidiminished icosahedron as well the following define the vertices of a bilunabirotunda centered at the origin with edge length 1 where formula 1 is the golden ratio six bilunabirotundae can be augmented around a cube with pyritohedral symmetry b m stewart labeled this six bilunabirotunda model as 6j p the bilunabirotunda can be used

the object in this frame is stationary within the frame which is useful for many types of calculations for example a freely falling elevator is a proper frame for a free falling object in the elevator while the surface of the earth is not proper frames can be inertial and non inertial as in the example above the use of a proper frame is essential for the investigation of physical laws within the framework of general relativity the term comoving frame is also a good description of a non inertial frame which is useful for many of the same uses as we mentioned previously one advantage of proper frame and comoving frame is that the two frames must always maintain the same spatial position i in the frame e g on the same frame of reference this includes that the frame must always be in position in the spacetime frame and thus the spacetime can be viewed as having no axis as our first example of a proper frame one uses the following frame to find the earth the earth is situated in the center with respect to the observer or our point of reference of our next example the

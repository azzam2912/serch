originating in england the world s quintessential common law jurisdiction the concept of consideration has been adopted by other jurisdictions including the us in essence this rule declares that performance of a pre existing duty does not amount to good consideration to support a valid contract but there are exceptions to the rule english law recognises bargains supported by consideration not bare promises however only simple contracts need consideration to be enforceable special contracts do not require consideration currie v misa 1875 declares that consideration may comprise any of these positive and negative matters the leading case is stilk v myrick 1809 where a captain promised 8 crew the wages of 2 deserters provided the remainers completed the voyage the shipowner refused to honour the agreement the court deemed the 8 crew were unable to enforce the deal as they had an existing obligation to sail the ship and meet ordinary foreseeable emergencies however in two cases the courts held that a claimant provides good consideration provided they act above and beyond their contractual obligation the rule may be affected by issues of public policy as in collins v godefroy 1831 england v davidson 1840 and williams v williams 1957

the effect is sometimes referred to as packet jitter although the definition is an imprecise fit the term pdv is defined in itu t recommendation y 1540 internet protocol data communication service ip packet transfer and availability performance parameters section 6 2 in computer networking although not in electronics usage of the term jitter may cause confusion from rfc 3393 section 1 1 the variation in packet delay is sometimes called jitter this term however causes confusion because it is used in different ways by different groups of people in this document we will avoid the term jitter whenever possible and stick to delay variation which is more precise the means of packet selection for measurement is not specified in rfc 3393 but could for example be the packets which had the largest variation in delay in a selected time period the delay is specified from the start of the packet being transmitted at the source to the start of the packet being received at the destination a component of the delay which does not vary from packet to packet can be ignored hence if the packet sizes are the same and packets always take the same time to be

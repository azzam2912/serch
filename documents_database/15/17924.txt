it is a potassium rich alkali feldspar microcline typically contains minor amounts of sodium it is common in granite and pegmatites microcline forms during slow cooling of orthoclase it is more stable at lower temperatures than orthoclase sanidine is a polymorph of alkali feldspar stable at yet higher temperature microcline may be clear white pale yellow brick red or green it is generally characterized by cross hatch twinning that forms as a result of the transformation of monoclinic orthoclase into triclinic microcline the chemical compound name is potassium aluminium silicate and it is known as e number reference e555 microcline may be chemically the same as monoclinic orthoclase but because it belongs to the triclinic crystal system the prism angle is slightly less than right angles hence the name microcline from the greek small slope it is a fully ordered triclinic modification of potassium feldspar and is dimorphous with orthoclase microcline is identical to orthoclase in many physical properties and can be distinguished by x ray or optical examination when viewed under a polarizing microscope microcline exhibits a minute multiple twinning which forms a grating like structure that is unmistakable perthite is either microcline or orthoclase with thin lamellae of

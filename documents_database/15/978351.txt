arachidonate 5 lipoxygenase is a member of the lipoxygenase family of enzymes it transforms essential fatty acids efa substrates into leukotrienes as well as a wide range of other biologically active products alox5 is a current target for pharmaceutical intervention in a number of diseases the alox5 gene which occupies 71 9 kilobase pairs kb on chromosome 10 all other human lipoxygenases are clustered together on chromosome 17 is composed of 14 exons divided by 13 introns encoding the mature 78 kilodalton kd alox5 protein consisting of 673 amino acids the gene promoter region of alox5 contains 8 gc boxes but lacks tata boxes or cat boxes and thus resembles the gene promoters of typical housekeeping genes five of the 8 gc boxes are arranged in tandem and are recognized by the transcription factors sp1 and egr 1 a novel sp1 binding site occurs close to the major transcription start site position 65 a gc rich core region including the sp1 egr 1 sites may be critical for basal 5 lo promoter activity cells primarily involved in regulating inflammation allergy and other immune responses e g neutrophils eosinophils basophils monocytes macrophages mast cells dendritic cells and b lymphocytes express alox5

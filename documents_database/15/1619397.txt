when started on december 25 1946 it became the first nuclear reactor in europe to achieve a self sustaining nuclear chain reaction it was still in operation in the beginning of the 2010s with a power level of 24 kw making it at that time the world s oldest operating reactor the fuel in f 1 is metallic uranium with the natural content of the 235 u isotope 0 72 graphite as a moderator cadmium rods to control the neutron flux structurally it is a spherical structure with a diameter of about 6 meters made of loose graphite bricks the graphite stack has holes in which fuel and control rods are placed as well as research and control equipment the weight of graphite is 400 tons uranium is 50 tons thermal power of the reactor is from 100 w to 1 mw air cooling if necessary forced air cooling was provided by fans long term operation at high power was not possible but the large mass of the core allowed a short term increase in power to peak values in november 2016 it was in permanent shutdown state

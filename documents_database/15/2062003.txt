it first ran on ground in april 2016 and first flew on march 13 2018 it is to power the 777 9 s maiden flight in early 2020 derived from the general electric ge90 with a larger fan advanced materials like cmcs higher bypass ratio and compression ratios it should improve fuel efficiency by 10 over its predecessor it is rated for of thrust in february 2012 ge announced studies on a more efficient derivative dubbed the ge9x to power both the 8 9 variants of the new boeing 777x it was to feature the same fan diameter as the ge90 115b with thrust decreased by to a new rating of per engine the 8x engine was to be derated to in 2013 the diameter of the fan was increased by to in 2014 thrust was increased slightly from and fan diameter to the first engine was expected to be ground tested in 2016 with flight testing to begin in 2017 and certification happening in 2018 because of the delays the first flight test occurred in march 2018 and the certification is expected to complete in late 2019 the first engine to test fett completed its first test run in

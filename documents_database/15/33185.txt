it concerns construction of an angle equal to one third of a given arbitrary angle using only two tools an unmarked straightedge and a compass the problem as stated is impossible to solve for arbitrary angles as proved by pierre wantzel in 1837 however although there is no way to trisect an angle in general with just a compass and a straightedge some special angles can be trisected for example it is relatively straightforward to trisect a right angle that is to construct an angle of measure 30 degrees it is possible to trisect an arbitrary angle by using tools other than straightedge and compass for example neusis construction also known to ancient greeks involves simultaneous sliding and rotation of a marked straightedge which cannot be achieved with the original tools other techniques were developed by mathematicians over the centuries because it is defined in simple terms but complex to prove unsolvable the problem of angle trisection is a frequent subject of pseudomathematical attempts at solution by naive enthusiasts these solutions often involve mistaken interpretations of the rules or are simply incorrect using only an unmarked straightedge and a compass greek mathematicians found means to divide a line into an

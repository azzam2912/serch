it grew out of a may 5 1961 nasa proposal to use scout rockets to launch small satellites to evaluate the worldwide mercury tracking network in preparation for manned orbital missions the launch of mercury scout 1 on november 1 1961 was unsuccessful and the satellite failed to achieve orbit electricity came from 1500 watt hours stored in chemical batteries the mercury tracking network was a series of u s owned and operated ground stations and tracking ships positioned around the world under the flightpath of mercury spacecraft when the spacecraft came within several hundred miles of a ground station it could have line of sight voice and telemetry communications by hf shortwave vhf or uhf radio and c band and s band radar these communications passes would only last a few minutes until the ground station disappeared over the horizon between ground stations mercury spacecraft were out of communications except for an occasional unreliable hf message in the early 1960s there were no synchronous communications satellites the ground stations were linked back to nasa s mercury control in florida through land lines undersea cables and in some cases hf radio the concept was approved on may 24 on june

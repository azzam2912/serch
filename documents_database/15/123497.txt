the technique is also used in other applications where power supply and signal communication take place over the same wires phantom power supplies are often built into mixing consoles microphone preamplifiers and similar equipment in addition to powering the circuitry of a microphone traditional condenser microphones also use phantom power for polarizing the microphone s transducer element phantom powering was used in telephone systems since the introduction of the rotary dial telephone in 1919 before it was applied to condenser microphones one such application in the telephone system was to provide a dc signaling path around transformer connected amplifiers in analogue line transmission systems the first known commercially available phantom powered microphone was the schoeps model cmt 20 which came out in 1964 built to the specifications of french radio with 9 12 volt dc phantom power the positive pole of this powering was grounded microphone preamplifiers of the nagra iv series tape recorders offered this type of powering as an option for many years and schoeps continued to support negative phantom until the cmt series was discontinued in the mid 1970s but it is obsolete now in 1966 neumann gmbh presented a new type of transistorized microphone to the

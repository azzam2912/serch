sod mimetics effectively convert the superoxide anion o a reactive oxygen species into hydrogen peroxide which is further converted into water by catalase reactive oxygen species are natural byproducts of cellular respiration and cause oxidative stress and cell damage which has been linked to causing cancers neurodegeneration age related declines in health and inflammatory diseases sod mimetics are a prime interest in therapeutic treatment of oxidative stress because of their smaller size longer half life and similarity in function to the native enzyme the chemical structure of sod mimetics generally consists of manganese iron or copper and zinc coordination complexes salen manganese iii complexes contain aromatic ring structures that increase the lipid solubility and cell permeability of the entire complex manganese ii and iron iii complexes are commonly used due to their high kinetic and thermodynamic stability increasing the half life of the mimetic however manganese based sod mimetics are found to be more therapeutically effective than their counterparts due to their low toxicity higher catalytic activity and increased stability in vivo similar to the native enzyme s mechanism the manganese complexes undergo a reversible oxidation reduction cycle in the first half reaction manganese covalently coordinates to the superoxide anion

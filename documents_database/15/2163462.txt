it was introduced in 2009 the lightning s cockpit pod accommodates a pilot and passenger in tandem the main rotor is two bladed with a pre rotator unconventionally the tail boom is mounted though the centre of the propeller shaft the boom may be unbolted and removed to aid access to the engine and prop there is a choice of two very compact d motor engines both liquid cooled horizontally opposed side valve four strokes either the 4 cylinder lf26 or the 6 cylinder lf39 the engine is sited behind the cockpit driving a 3 or 4 bladed ground adjustable pusher propeller which is coaxial with the tail boom although d motor engines are direct drive units with no gearbox the lightning has a multi belt drive reduction system of about 3 2 ratio resulting in a maximum propeller speed of some 2 000 rpm this arrangement avoids the necessity of a tailboom beneath the propeller thereby reducing drag the empenage has a spring steel tail drag to inhibit propeller strikes consuming some of avgas per hour the autogyro has an endurance of 4 hours with 30 minutes reserve its cruise speed of gives the autogyro a range of over

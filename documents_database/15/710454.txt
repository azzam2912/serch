the results of the extracts are either essential oils absolutes concretes or butters depending on the amount of waxes in the extracted product to a certain extent all of these techniques tend to distort the odour of the aromatic compounds obtained from the raw materials heat chemical solvents or exposure to oxygen in the extraction process denature the aromatic compounds either changing their odour character or rendering them odourless certain plant materials contain too little volatile oil to undergo expression or their chemical components are too delicate and easily denatured by the high heat used in steam distillation instead the oils are extracted using their solvent properties organic solvent extraction is the most common and most economically important technique for extracting aromatics in the modern perfume industry raw materials are submerged and agitated in a solvent that can dissolve the desired aromatic compounds commonly used solvents for maceration solvent extraction include hexane and dimethyl ether in organic solvent extraction aromatic compounds as well as other hydrophobic soluble substances such as wax and pigments are also obtained the extract is subjected to vacuum processing which removes the solvent for re use the process can last anywhere from hours to months fragrant

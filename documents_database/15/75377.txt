the problem is related to the following question given any two polyhedra of equal volume is it always possible to cut the first into finitely many polyhedral pieces which can be reassembled to yield the second based on earlier writings by gauss hilbert conjectured that this is not always possible this was confirmed within the year by his student max dehn who proved that the answer in general is no by producing a counterexample the answer for the analogous question about polygons in 2 dimensions is yes and had been known for a long time this is the wallace bolyai gerwien theorem unknown to hilbert and dehn hilbert s third problem was also proposed independently by w adys aw kretkowski for a math contest of 1882 by the academy of arts and sciences of krak w and was solved by ludwik antoni birkenmajer with a different method than dehn birkenmajer did not publish the result and the original manuscript containing his solution was rediscovered years later the formula for the volume of a pyramid had been known to euclid but all proofs of it involve some form of limiting process or calculus notably the method of exhaustion or in more

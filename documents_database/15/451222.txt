as its primary product it provided an independent software repository for solaris in a similar manner to the repositories for linux distributions the objective of the blastwave project was to allow solaris and opensolaris users to freely have pre packaged open source software in accordance with specified standards it was created in a time when sun hardware and solaris tools were very expensive and thus it was difficult to create a project to support open source users the lead design engineer for the software architecture was philip brown who was a member of the original six software advocates that advised sun microsystems inc to re release solaris on the x86 architecture the primary financial sponsor and business lead was dennis clarke the software was in svr4 compliant package format and ready to run via the simple package utilities such as pkg get written by philip brown and designed with the same sort of friendly interface as apt get within the debian project in late 2008 a group of maintainers including philip brown forked out a project called opencsw later the pkg get tool was retired from opencsw in favour of a new open source pkgutil tool written within this project

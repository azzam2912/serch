the aim is to create deals where the suits are more unevenly distributed between the players thus creating wild deals in order to make the game more vivid goulash dealing has variations basically each player sorts the cards from the previous deal by suits and all four hands are stacked back in the deck the deck is then cut once or twice and cards are then dealt in groups of 4 5 4 or 5 5 3 instead of one at a time as usual some players play a goulash in rubber bridge only when the previous deal was passed out others play full goulash rubbers in both cases at least a game must be bid in the goulash deal otherwise the partial part score contract is discarded and the goulash redealt when goulash dealing is in effect some players adjust their bidding principles in some or all of the following ways in order to accommodate the anticipated wildness of the deal others use opening bids to identify aces or two suited hands or have other conventional meanings that aid in determining whether to bid or double in competition

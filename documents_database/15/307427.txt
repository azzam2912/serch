round lake is the smaller lake located west of green lake both lakes are meromictic which means no seasonal mixing of surface and bottom waters occurs meromictic lakes are fairly rare they have been extensively studied in part because their sediments can preserve a historical record extending back thousands of years and because of the euxinic anoxic sulfidic conditions which can form in the deep water green lake reaches a maximum depth of 195 feet deep lakes tend to appear bluish because the wavelengths of light that can penetrate and be dispersed at great depths are those closer to the blue end of the spectrum because of its depth and the high salinity of the basin waters the lake is meromictic and does not turn over and intermix waters like many other lakes in this region do green lake s cold and dense bottom waters tend to stay separate from the shallower warmer waters because of this sediment sinks and collects in the bottom and virtually does not decay since the sediment is not kicked up by mixing the lake does not take on a muddy turbid appearance like other lakes do meromictic lakes also have still mirror like waters

for example the critical exponent of mississippi is 7 3 as it contains the string ississi which is of length 7 and period 3 if w is an infinite word over the alphabet a and x is a finite word over a then x is said to occur in w with exponent for positive real if there is a factor y of w with y x x where x is a prefix of x a is the integer part of and the length y x we say that y is an power the word w is power free if it contains no factors which are powers the critical exponent for w is the supremum of the for which w has powers or equivalently the infimum of the for which w is power free the repetition threshold of an alphabet a of n letters is the minimum critical exponent of infinite words over a clearly this value rt n depends only on n for n 2 any binary word of length four has a factor of exponent 2 and since the critical exponent of the thue morse sequence is 2 the repetition threshold for binary alphabets is rt 2 2 it

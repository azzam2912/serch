since there already is an array of aldehyde specific reagents commercially available such as aminooxy or hydrazide reagents possible applications are diverse and include the conjugation of fluorophores glycans peg polyethylene glycol chains or reactive groups for further synthesis see applications the aldehyde tag is an artificial peptide tag recognized by the formylglycine generating enzyme fge formylglycine is a glycine with a formyl group cho an aldehyde at the carbon the sulfatase motif is the basis for the sequence of the peptide which results in the site specific conversion of a cysteine to a formylglycine residue the peptide tag was engineered after studies on fge recognizable sequences in sulfatases from different organisms carrico et al discovered a high homology in the sulfatase motif in bacteria archaea as well as eukaryotes aldehydes and ketones find use as chemical reporters due to their strong electrophilic properties this enables a reaction under mild conditions when using a strong nucleophilic coupling partner typically hydrazides and aminooxy probes are used in bioconjugation they form stabilized addition products with carbonyl groups that are favoured under the physiological reaction conditions at neutral ph the equilibrium of schiff base formation is lying far to the reactant s side

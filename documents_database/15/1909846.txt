these receptors stimulate or inhibit cytotoxic activity of nk cells therefore they are divided into activating and inhibitory receptors according to their function cd94 nkg2 recognize nonclassical mhc glycoproteins class i hla e in human and qa 1 molecules in the mouse cd94 nkg2 family includes seven members nkg2a b c d e f and h genes encoding these receptors are clustered in the natural killer complex nkc on human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 6 together with clr c lectin related genes nkg2 receptors are transmembrane proteins type ii which dimerize with cd94 molecule cd94 contains a short cytoplasmic domain and it is responsible for signal transduction therefore nkg2 receptors form disulfide bonded heterodimers nkg2d represent an exception it is a homodimer receptors of cd94 nkg2 family bind nonclassical mhc glycoproteins class i hla e in human and qa 1 molecules in the mouse nonclassical mhc glycoproteins class i are structurally similar to classical mhc class i molecules but they present mainly peptides derived from the signal peptides of mhc class i therefore nk cells can indirectly monitor the expression of classical mhc class i molecules through the interaction of cd94 nkg2 with hla e qa 1 and hla

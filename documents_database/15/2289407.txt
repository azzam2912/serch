a multiple objective linear program molp is a linear program with more than one objective function an molp is a special case of a vector linear program multi objection linear programming is also a subarea of multi objective optimization in mathematical terms a molp can be written as where formula 2 is an formula 3 matrix formula 4 is a formula 5 matrix formula 6 is an formula 7 dimensional vector with components in formula 8 formula 9 is an formula 7 dimensional vector with components in formula 11 formula 12 is an formula 13 dimensional vector with components in formula 8 formula 15 is an formula 13 dimensional vector with components in formula 11 a feasible point formula 18 is called efficient if there is no feasible point formula 19 with formula 20 formula 21 where formula 22 denotes the component wise ordering often in the literature the aim in multiple objective linear programming is to compute the set of all efficient extremal points there are also algorithms to determine the set of all maximal efficient faces based on these goals the set of all efficient extreme points can seen to be the solution of molp this type of

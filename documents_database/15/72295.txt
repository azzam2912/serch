scandium and yttrium are considered rare earth elements because they tend to occur in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides and exhibit similar chemical properties but have different electronic and magnetic properties rarely a broader definition that includes actinides may be used since the actinides share some mineralogical chemical and physical especially electron shell configuration characteristics the 17 rare earth elements are cerium ce dysprosium dy erbium er europium eu gadolinium gd holmium ho lanthanum la lutetium lu neodymium nd praseodymium pr promethium pm samarium sm scandium sc terbium tb thulium tm ytterbium yb and yttrium y they are often found in minerals with thorium th and less commonly uranium u despite their name rare earth elements are with the exception of the radioactive promethium relatively plentiful in earth s crust with cerium being the 25th most abundant element at 68 parts per million more abundant than copper however because of their geochemical properties rare earth elements are typically dispersed and not often found concentrated in rare earth minerals as a result economically exploitable ore deposits are less common the first rare earth mineral discovered 1787 was gadolinite a mineral composed of cerium yttrium iron silicon and other elements

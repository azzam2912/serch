this alkoxide of titanium iv is used in organic synthesis and materials science it is a diamagnetic tetrahedral molecule titanium isopropoxide is a component of the sharpless epoxidation a nobel prize winning method for the synthesis of chiral epoxides the structures of the titanium alkoxides are often complex crystalline titanium methoxide is tetrameric with the molecular formula alkoxides derived from bulkier alcohols such as isopropanol aggregate less titanium isopropoxide is mainly a monomer in nonpolar solvents it is prepared by treating titanium tetrachloride with isopropanol hydrogen chloride is formed as a coproduct titanium isopropoxide reacts with water to deposit titanium dioxide this reaction is employed in the sol gel synthesis of tio based materials in the form of powders or thin films typically water is added in excess to a solution of the alkoxide in an alcohol the composition crystallinity and morphology of the inorganic product are determined by the presence of additives e g acetic acid the amount of water hydrolysis ratio and reaction conditions the compound is also used as a catalyst in the preparation of certain cyclopropanes in the kulinkovich reaction prochiral thioethers are oxidized enantioselectively using a catalyst derived from ti o i pr titanium iv

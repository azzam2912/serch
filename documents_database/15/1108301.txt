cd163 is the high affinity scavenger receptor for the hemoglobin haptoglobin complex and in the absence of haptoglobin with lower affinity for hemoglobin alone it also is a marker of cells from the monocyte macrophage lineage cd163 functions as innate immune sensor for gram positive and gram negative bacteria the receptor was discovered in 1987 the molecular size is 130 kda the receptor belongs to the scavenger receptor cysteine rich family type b and consists of a 1048 amino acid residues extracellular domain a single transmembrane segment and a cytoplasmic tail with several splice variants a soluble form of the receptor exists in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid commonly denoted scd163 it is generated by ectodomain shedding of the membrane bound receptor which may represent a form of modulation of cd163 function scd163 shedding occurs as a result of enzymatic cleavage by adam17 scd163 is upregulated in a large range of inflammatory diseases including liver cirrhosis type 2 diabetes macrophage activation syndrome gaucher s disease sepsis hiv infection rheumatoid arthritis and hodgkin lymphoma scd163 is also upregulated in cerebrospinal fluid after subarachnoid haemorrhage cd163 has recently been identified as expressed on neurons in the cns following hemorrhage although the significance of

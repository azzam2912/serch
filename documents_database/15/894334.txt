the frequency of the periodic motion is known as a vibration frequency and the typical frequencies of molecular vibrations range from less than 10 to approximately 10 hz corresponding to wavenumbers of approximately 300 to 3000 cm in general a non linear molecule with n atoms has 3 n 6 normal modes of vibration but a linear molecule has 3 n 5 such modes because rotation about its molecular axis cannot be observed a diatomic molecule has one normal mode of vibration the normal modes of vibration of polyatomic molecules are independent of each other but each normal mode will involve simultaneous vibrations of different parts of the molecule such as different chemical bonds a molecular vibration is excited when the molecule absorbs a quantum of energy e corresponding to the vibration s frequency according to the relation e h where h is planck s constant a fundamental vibration is excited when one such quantum of energy is absorbed by the molecule in its ground state when two quanta are absorbed the first overtone is excited and so on to higher overtones to a first approximation the motion in a normal vibration can be described as a kind of simple

in ancient geological time this shelf was part of gondwana and around 400 million years ago split from what is now africa and drifted westwards from it today the islands are subjected to the roaring forties winds that shape both their geography and climate the falklands comprise two main islands west falkland and east falkland and about 776 small islands the geological history of the falkland islands began during the precambrian era more than 1000 million years ago when proterozoic granites and gneisses were laid down in gondwana these rocks became part of the cape meredith formation and outcrop at the cape during the siluro devonian era these rocks were overlain with quartzose and subarkosic sandstones with some siltstone and mudstone rocks that are particularly erosion and weather resistant giving these parts of the islands a rugged landscape and coastline tectonic forces continued to form the region a mountain chain formed part of which now creates wickham heights on east falkland island and extends westwards through west falkland into the jason islands a basin developed and was filled with land based or terrigenous sediments these layers of sand and mud filled the basin as it sank and as they hardened

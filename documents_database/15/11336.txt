it is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process it is by far the most important source of energy for life on earth its diameter is about 1 39 million kilometers 864 000 miles or 109 times that of earth and its mass is about 330 000 times that of earth it accounts for about 99 86 of the total mass of the solar system roughly three quarters of the sun s mass consists of hydrogen 73 the rest is mostly helium 25 with much smaller quantities of heavier elements including oxygen carbon neon and iron the sun is a g type main sequence star g2v based on its spectral class as such it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf its light is closer to white than yellow it formed approximately 4 6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud most of this matter gathered in the center whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the solar system the central mass became so hot and dense that it

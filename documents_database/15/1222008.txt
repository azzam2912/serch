this definition is clearly parallel to the definition of an ordinary critical point as the point at which two phase coexistence terminates a point of three phase coexistence is termed a triple point for a one component system since from gibbs phase rule this condition is only achieved for a single point in the phase diagram f 2 3 1 0 for tricritical points to be observed one needs a mixture with more components it can be shown that three is the minimum number of components for which these points can appear in this case one may have a two dimensional region of three phase coexistence f 2 3 3 2 thus each point in this region corresponds to a triple point this region f 2 p 3 will terminate in two critical lines of two phase coexistence these two critical lines f 1 p 2 may then terminate at a single tricritical point this point f 0 p 1 is therefore twice critical since it belongs to two critical branches indeed its critical behavior is different from that of a conventional critical point the upper critical dimension is lowered from d 4 to d 3 so the classical exponents

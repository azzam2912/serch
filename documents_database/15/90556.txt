it is the challenge of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge the difficulty of the problem raised the question of whether specified axioms of euclidean geometry concerning the existence of lines and circles implied the existence of such a square in 1882 the task was proven to be impossible as a consequence of the lindemann weierstrass theorem which proves that pi is a transcendental rather than an algebraic irrational number that is it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients it had been known for decades that the construction would be impossible if were transcendental but was not proven transcendental until 1882 approximate squaring to any given non perfect accuracy in contrast is possible in a finite number of steps since there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to the expression squaring the circle is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do the impossible the term quadrature of the circle is sometimes used to mean the same thing as squaring the circle but it may also refer to approximate or numerical methods for finding the area of a circle

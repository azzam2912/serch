the pentagram map takes a given polygon finds the intersections of the shortest diagonals of the polygon and constructs a new polygon from these intersections richard schwartz introduced the pentagram map for a general polygon in a 1992 paper though it seems that the special case in which the map is defined for pentagons only goes back to an 1871 paper of alfred clebsch and a 1945 paper of theodore motzkin the pentagram map is similar in spirit to the constructions underlying desargues theorem and poncelet s porism it echoes the rationale and construction underlying a conjecture of branko gr nbaum concerning the diagonals of a polygon suppose that the vertices of the polygon p are given by formula 1 the image of p under the pentagram map is the polygon q with vertices formula 2 as shown in the figure here formula 3 is the intersection of the diagonals formula 4 and formula 5 and so on on a basic level one can think of the pentagram map as an operation defined on convex polygons in the plane from a more sophisticated point of view the pentagram map is defined for a polygon contained in the projective plane over

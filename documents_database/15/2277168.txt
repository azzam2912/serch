pentabromopseudilin pbp is a unique hybrid bromophenol bromopyrrole compound that is made up of over 70 bromine atoms contributing to its potent bioactivity pbp was first isolated from pseudomonas bromoutilis and has since been found to be produced by other marine microbes including alteromonas luteoviolaceus chromobacteria and pseudoalteromonas spp pbp was first isolated and reported in 1966 when burkholder and colleagues identified an unusual highly brominated pyrrole antibiotic that was produced from thalassia associated marine bacteria collected from tropical waters off la parguera puerto rico early investigations from this first report pointed at intrigue in regards to the pyrrole s particularly potent activity against gram positive bacteria namely the strains staphylococcus aureus diplococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes however despite inhibition these strains at pbp drug concentrations of 0 0063 g ml these promising preliminary findings failed to yield the same success in in vivo mouse therapeutic studies of more than 20 classified pyrrole antibiotics pbp is the most active member in its class and demonstrates a high in vitro activity ic 0 1 m against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa as such it has a served as a model example of the potential significance of marine natural products drug discovery

the entire area is part of the golden gate national recreation area the headlands are famous for their views of the bay area especially of the golden gate bridge the headlands sometimes create their own clouds when moist warm pacific ocean breezes are pushed into higher colder air causing condensation fog fog drip and perhaps rain the hills also get more precipitation than at sea level for the same reason however despite being relatively wet strong gusty pacific winds prevent dense forests from forming the many gaps ridges and valleys in the hills increase the wind speed and periodically during powerful winter storms these winds can reach hurricane force in summer breezes can still be very gusty when the oceanic air and fog cross the hills november through february in the headlands are dominated by periodic rainstorms that blow in from the pacific often originating in the gulf of alaska and give the area the majority of its rainfall for the year these cloudy gray and rainy days often are interspersed with cool but extremely clear ones as winter turns to spring the april to june weather tends to be dominated by powerful winds less rain and clearer skies summer

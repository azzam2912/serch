the distribution function of f is defined by then f is called weak formula 2 if there exists a constant c such that the distribution function of f satisfies the following inequality for all t 0 the smallest constant c in the inequality above is called the weak formula 2 norm and is usually denoted by formula 5 or formula 6 similarly the space is usually denoted by l or l any formula 2 function belongs to l and in addition one has the inequality this is nothing but markov s inequality aka chebyshev s inequality the converse is not true for example the function 1 x belongs to l but not to l similarly one may define the weak formula 12 space as the space of all functions f such that formula 13 belong to l and the weak formula 12 norm using more directly the l norm is defined as the best constant c in the inequality for all t 0 informally marcinkiewicz s theorem is in other words even if you only require weak boundedness on the extremes p and q you still get regular boundedness inside to make this more formal one has to explain that

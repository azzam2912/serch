it belongs to the virgo cluster of galaxies and is positioned near the northeastern edge of this assemblage the morphological classification of ngc 4698 in the de vaucouleurs system is sa s ab which indicates a purely spiral structure with moderate to tightly wound arms it is inclined to the line of sight from the earth by an angle of 53 along a position angle of 170 a unique feature of this galaxy is that the stars and dust of the nuclear disk are rotating in a direction that is aligned perpendicularly to the galactic disk the bulge likewise appears elongated out of the galactic plane this unusual alignment may have been the result of a past merger event ngc 4698 is classified as a seyfert 2 galaxy with an active galactic nucleus which displays a prominent emission of radio and x ray energy from the core while showing narrow emission lines in the optical spectrum the unified model of seyfert galaxies proposes that the nucleus of a seyfert 2 galaxy is obscured by a thick torus of gas and dust however the varying x ray emission of the core of ngc 4698 shows little indication of being obstructed suggesting

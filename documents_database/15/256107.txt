it is named after the engineer and fluid dynamicist theodore von k rm n and is responsible for such phenomena as the singing of suspended telephone or power lines and the vibration of a car antenna at certain speeds a vortex street will only form at a certain range of flow velocities specified by a range of reynolds numbers re typically above a limiting re value of about 90 the global reynolds number for a flow is a measure of the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in the flow of a fluid around a body or in a channel and may be defined as a nondimensional parameter of the global speed of the whole fluid flow where between for common flows the ones which can usually be considered as incompressible or isothermal the kinematic viscosity is everywhere uniform over all the flow field and constant in time so there is no choice on the viscosity parameter which becomes naturally the kinematic viscosity of the fluid being considered at the temperature being considered on the other hand the reference length is always an arbitrary parameter so particular attention should be put when comparing flows around different obstacles or in channels

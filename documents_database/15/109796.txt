by phyletic definition these many celled sub vertebrate animals lack a vertebral column spinal column vertebrae backbone or long full length notochord in contrast to the vertebrates in the one phylum of chordata relatedly invertebrates have never had a cartilaginous or boney internal skeleton with its skeletal supports gill slits ribs and jaws finally throughout geologic time invertebrates have remained non craniate creatures that is they never developed a cranium nerve chord brain skull or hard protective braincase unlike many vertebrates in the many decades since jean baptiste de lamarck a pioneering biologist and evolutionist first conceptualized and coined the category invertebrata between 1793 and 1801 and the term biology in 1802 zoology has come to recognize that the non vertebrate category is not a scientifically valid monophyletic taxon evolutionary biology and developmental biology a k a evo devo now consider the term invertebrata to be both polyphyletic and paraphyletic nevertheless most earth science departments continue to employ this term and paleontologists find it both useful and practical in evaluating fossil invertebrates and consequently invertebrate evolution however there is one contemporary caveat paleobiologists and microbiologists in the 21st century no longer classify one celled animal like microbes either as invertebrates

as the pistons are mechanically linked their force and stroke length are the same if the diameters are different the hydraulic pressure in each cylinder will vary in the same ratio as their areas the smaller piston giving rise to a higher pressure as the pressure is inversely proportional to the area it will be inversely proportional to the square of the diameter the working volume of the intensifier is limited by the stroke of the piston this in turn limits the amount of work that may be done by one stroke of the intensifier these are not reciprocating machines i e continually running multi stroke machines and so their entire work must be carried out by a single stroke this limits their usefulness somewhat to machines that can accomplish their task within a single stroke they are often used where a powerful hydraulic jack is required but there is insufficient space to fit the cylinder size that would normally be required for the lifting force necessary and with the available system pressure using an intensifier mounted outside the jack allows a higher pressure to be obtained and thus a smaller cylinder used for the same lift force intensifiers are

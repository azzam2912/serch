this box set is similar to the earlier pebbles box a 5 lp box set and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set and in the same order along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc supposedly the trash box collects the first five volumes of the cds in the pebbles series i e those released by aip records not to be confused with the 4 earlier cds that were issued by esd records however as is generally true of the cd reissues of these five volumes though not nearly to the same extent the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original pebbles lps and the later pebbles cds in the corresponding volumes and the surf rock rarities on pebbles volume 4 have been eschewed entirely overall there are 109 tracks in the box set excluding the introduction and ending cuts as compared to 101 songs on the individual cds and 72 tracks in the pebbles box although most of the recordings on the trash box were released at some point on one of the individual pebbles albums several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in

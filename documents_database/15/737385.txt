when an object is in an elliptical orbit the tidal forces acting on it are stronger near periapsis than near apoapsis thus the deformation of the body due to tidal forces i e the tidal bulge varies over the course of its orbit generating internal friction which heats its interior this energy gained by the object comes from its gravitational energy so over time in a two body system the initial elliptical orbit decays into a circular orbit tidal circularization sustained tidal heating occurs when the elliptical orbit is prevented from circularizing due to additional gravitational forces from other bodies that keep tugging the object back into an elliptical orbit in this more complex system gravitational energy still is being converted to thermal energy however now the orbit s semimajor axis would shrink rather than its eccentricity tidal heating is responsible for the geologic activity of the most volcanically active body in the solar system io a moon of jupiter io s eccentricity persists as the result of its orbital resonances with the galilean moons europa and ganymede the same mechanism has provided the energy to melt the lower layers of the ice surrounding the rocky mantle of jupiter s

however the gene is unknown raising serious questions regarding the actual existence of this peptide in nature delta sleep inducing peptide was first discovered in 1974 by the swiss schoenenberger monnier group who isolated it from the cerebral venous blood of rabbits in an induced state of sleep it was primarily believed to be involved in sleep regulation due to its apparent ability to induce slow wave sleep in rabbits but studies on the subject have been contradictory delta sleep inducing peptide dsip like material has been found in human breast milk dsip is an amphiphilic peptide of molecular weight 850 daltons with the amino acid motif n trp ala gly gly asp ala ser gly glu c it has been found in both free and bound forms in the hypothalamus limbic system and pituitary as well as various peripheral organs tissues and body fluids in the pituitary it co localises with many peptide and non peptide mediators such as corticotropin like intermediate peptide clip adrenocorticotrophic hormone acth melanocyte stimulating hormone msh thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and melanin concentrating hormone mch it is abundant in the gut secretory cells and in the pancreas where it co localises with glucagon in

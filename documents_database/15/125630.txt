in the general linear group similarity is therefore the same as conjugacy and similar matrices are also called conjugate however in a given subgroup of the general linear group the notion of conjugacy may be more restrictive than similarity since it requires that be chosen to lie in when defining a linear transformation it can be the case that a change of basis can result in a simpler form of the same transformation for example the matrix representing a rotation in when the axis of rotation is not aligned with the coordinate axis can be complicated to compute if the axis of rotation were aligned with the positive axis then it would simply be where formula 3 is the angle of rotation in the new coordinate system the transformation would be written as where and are the original and transformed vectors in a new basis containing a vector parallel to the axis of rotation in the original basis the transform would be written as where vectors and and the unknown transform matrix are in the original basis to write in terms of the simpler matrix we use the change of basis matrix that transforms and as formula 6 and formula

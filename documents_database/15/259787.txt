the naming is formally determined by the international technology roadmap for semiconductors itrs the 193 nm wavelength was introduced by many but not all companies for lithography of critical layers mainly during the 90 nm node yield issues associated with this transition due to the use of new photoresists were reflected in the high costs associated with this transition even more significantly the 300 mm wafer size became mainstream at the 90 nm node the previous wafer size was 200 mm diameter a 90nm silicon mosfet was fabricated by iranian engineer ghavam shahidi later ibm director with d a antoniadis and h i smith at mit in 1988 the device was fabricated using x ray lithography toshiba sony and samsung developed a 90nm process during 20012002 before being introduced in 2002 for toshiba s edram and samsung s 2gb nand flash memory ibm demonstrated a 90nm silicon on insulator soi cmos process with development led by ghavam shahidi in 2002 the same year intel demonstrated a 90nm strained silicon process fujitsu commercially introduced its 90nm process in 2003 followed by tsmc in 2004 gurtej singh sandhu of micron technology initiated the development of atomic layer deposition high k films for

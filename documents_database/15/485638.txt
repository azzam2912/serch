the theory of subfactors led to the discovery of the jones polynomial in knot theory usually formula 1 is taken to be a factor of type formula 4 so that it has a finite trace in this case every hilbert space module formula 5 has a dimension formula 6 which is a non negative real number or formula 7 the index formula 8 of a subfactor formula 9 is defined to be formula 10 here formula 11 is the representation of formula 9 obtained from the gns construction of the trace of formula 1 this states that if formula 9 is a subfactor of formula 1 both of type formula 4 then the index formula 17 is either of the form formula 18 for formula 19 or is at least formula 20 all these values occur the first few values of formula 21 are formula 22 suppose that formula 9 is a subfactor of formula 1 and that both are finite von neumann algebras the gns construction produces a hilbert space formula 25 acted on by formula 1 with a cyclic vector formula 27 let formula 28 be the projection onto the subspace formula 29 then formula 1 and formula

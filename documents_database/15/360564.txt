a natural number n is called superabundant precisely when for all m sum of divisors function i e the sum of all positive divisors of n including n itself the first few superabundant numbers are 1 2 4 6 12 24 36 48 60 120 for example the number 5 is not a superabundant number because for 1 2 3 4 and 5 the sigma is 1 3 4 7 6 and 7 4 6 5 superabundant numbers were defined by unknown to alaoglu and erd s about 30 pages of ramanujan s 1915 paper highly composite numbers were suppressed those pages were finally published in the ramanujan journal 1 1997 119 153 in section 59 of that paper ramanujan defines generalized highly composite numbers which include the superabundant numbers proved that if n is superabundant then there exist a k and a a a such that where p is the i th prime number and that is they proved that if n is superabundant the prime decomposition of n has non increasing exponents the exponent of a larger prime is never more than that a smaller prime and that all primes up to formula 4 are factors of n

predating or associated with those fluids are vertical dikes of porphyritic intrusive rocks from which this deposit type derives its name in later stages circulating meteoric fluids may interact with the magmatic fluids successive envelopes of hydrothermal alteration typically enclose a core of disseminated ore minerals in often stockwork forming hairline fractures and veins because of their large volume porphyry orebodies can be economic from copper concentrations as low as 0 15 copper and can have economic amounts of by products such as molybdenum silver and gold in some mines those metals are the main product the first mining of low grade copper porphyry deposits from large open pits coincided roughly with the introduction of steam shovels the construction of railroads and a surge in market demand near the start of the 20th century some mines exploit porphyry deposits that contain sufficient gold or molybdenum but little or no copper porphyry copper deposits are currently the largest source of copper ore most of the known porphyrys are concentrated in western south and north america and southeast asia and oceania along the pacific ring of fire the caribbean southern central europe and the area around eastern turkey scattered areas in china

the prefix cyano is used interchangeably with the term nitrile in industrial literature nitriles are found in many useful compounds including methyl cyanoacrylate used in super glue and nitrile rubber a nitrile containing polymer used in latex free laboratory and medical gloves nitrile rubber is also widely used as automotive and other seals since it is resistant to fuels and oils organic compounds containing multiple nitrile groups are known as cyanocarbons inorganic compounds containing the c n group are not called nitriles but cyanides instead though both nitriles and cyanides can be derived from cyanide salts most nitriles are not nearly as toxic the n c c geometry is linear in nitriles reflecting the sp hybridization of the triply bonded carbon the c n distance is short at 1 16 consistent with a triple bond nitriles are polar as indicated by high dipole moments as liquids they have high relative permittivities often in the 30s the first compound of the homolog row of nitriles the nitrile of formic acid hydrogen cyanide was first synthesized by c w scheele in 1782 in 1811 j l gay lussac was able to prepare the very toxic and volatile pure acid around 1832 benzonitrile

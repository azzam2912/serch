the program originated on the ms dos platform but has since been ported to linux additionally tim gilman has ported fractint to the macintosh during the early 1990s the program was the definitive fractal generating program for personal computers its name comes from the words fractal and integer since the first versions of it computed fractals by using only integer arithmetic also known as fixed point arithmetic which led to much faster rendering on x86 computers without math coprocessors since then floating point arithmetic and arbitrary precision modes have been added the latter of which emulates an arbitrarily large mantissa in ram the arbitrary precision mode is slow even on modern computers fractint can draw most kinds of fractals that have appeared in the literature it also has a few fractal types that are not strictly speaking fractals but may be more accurately described as display hacks these include cellular automata fractint originally appeared in 1988 as fract386 a computer program for rendering fractals very quickly on the intel 80386 processor using integer arithmetic most 386 processors of the era did not come with floating point units 387 so the integer approach was much faster the early versions of fract386

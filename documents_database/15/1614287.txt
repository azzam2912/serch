it was developed by belgian engineer edgard frankignoul in 1909 and has achieved considerable worldwide success since this method can be applied to different site conditions and is still widely used due to its high tensile load capacity and relatively low noise and ground vibration levels edgard frankignoul applied for the production patent for the franki pile in july 1909 he then co founded the geotechnical company frankipile soci t des pieux arm s frankignoul with li ge aristocrat edmond baar with the goal of commercializing the franki piling system by 1929 the technique had been implemented by 34 international subsidiaries and license holders the franki pile process has undergone several reformations since it was conceived the dry concrete plug was not introduced to the design until 1926 before this innovation the casing had to be top driven and equipped with a lost bottom plate the franki pile with vibrated shaft and hydraulic vibrating hammer were manufactured starting from 1960 and 1971 respectively franki piles can be used as high capacity deep foundation elements without the necessity of excavation or dewatering they are useful in conditions where a sufficient bearing soil can only be reached deeper in the ground and

tcf4 activates transcription by binding to the e box 5 canntg 3 found usually on sstr2 inr or somatostatin receptor 2 initiator element tcf4 is primarily involved in neurological development of the fetus during pregnancy by initiating neural differentiation by binding to dna it is found in the central nervous system somites and gonadal ridge during early development later in development it will be found in the thyroid thymus and kidneys while in adulthood tcf4 it is found in lymphocytes muscles and gastrointestinal system mutations in tcf4 cause pitt hopkins syndrome pths these mutations cause tcf4 proteins to not bind to dna properly and control the differentiation of the nervous system in most cases that have been studied the mutations were de novo meaning it was a new mutation not found in other family members of the patient common symptoms of pitt hopkins syndrome include a wide mouth gastrointestinal problems developmental delay of fine motor skills speech and breathing problems epilepsy and other brain defects

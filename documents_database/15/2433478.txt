temperatures range from approximately at the upper boundary with the crust to approximately at the boundary with the lower mantle upper mantle material which has come up onto the surface is made up of about 55 olivine 35 pyroxene and 5 to 10 of calcium oxide and aluminum oxide minerals such as plagioclase spinel or garnet depending upon depth the density profile through earth is determined by the velocity of seismic waves density increases progressively in each layer largely due to compression of the rock at increased depths abrupt changes in density occur where the material composition changes the upper mantle begins just beneath the crust and ends at the top of the lower mantle crust and mantle are distinguished by composition while the lithosphere and asthenosphere are defined by a change in mechanical properties the top of the mantle is defined by a sudden increase in the speed of seismic waves which was first noted by andrija mohorovi i in 1909 this boundary is now referred to as the mohorovi i discontinuity or moho the moho defines the base of the crust and varies from to below the surface of the earth oceanic crust is thinner than continental crust

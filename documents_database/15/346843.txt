these immune cytopenias may occur simultaneously or sequentially its overall phenotype resembles a combination of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a condition in which the red blood cells that normally carry oxygen and carbon dioxide are destroyed by an autoimmune process immune thrombocytopenic purpura is a condition in which platelets are destroyed by an autoimmune process platelets are a component of blood that contribute to the formation of blood clots in the body to prevent bleeding the syndrome was first described in 1951 by r s evans and colleagues it has been variously reported that between 7 8 and 23 of patients who have autoimmune hemolytic anemia will also have thrombocytopenia and thus evans syndrome the two cytopenias may occur together or sequentially although evans syndrome seems to be a disorder of immune regulation the exact pathophysiology is unknown but a gradual loss of self tolerance is postulated autoantibodies targeted at different antigenic determinants on red cells and platelets are assumed to cause isolated episodes of hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia respectively the diagnosis of primary evans syndrome is made upon blood tests to confirm not only hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura but also

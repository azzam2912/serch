to operate services on the former lancashire and yorkshire main line they originally entered service uniquely in this region which earned them the name of the calder valley sets they were an updated version of the class 104 with more powerful engines a revised cab design and raised bodyside window frames the fact that they were primarily intended for services on the arduous calder valley route meant that class 110 needed more power than other first generation dmus so they were fitted with rolls royce c6nflh engines and when delivered they had the highest hp ton of any of the first generation dmus including the lightweights with a set weighing 87 tons tare this gave a power to weight ratio of 8 3 hp ton which was appreciably higher than any other dmu in use at the time using normally aspirated engines performance tests included a standing start against a ruling gradient of 1 in 261 and a set in tare condition achieved a speed of in 45 seconds in 2 minutes 4 seconds and in 4 minutes 6 seconds from a standing start on a 1 in 45 gradient a speed of in third gear was reached in 42

ratification defines the international act in which a state indicates its consent to be bound to a treaty if the parties intended to show their consent by such an act in the case of bilateral treaties ratification is usually accomplished by exchanging the requisite instruments and in the case of multilateral treaties the usual procedure is for the depositary to collect the ratifications of all states keeping all parties informed of the situation the institution of ratification grants states the necessary time frame to seek the required approval for the treaty on the domestic level and to enact the necessary legislation to give domestic effect to that treaty the term applies to private contract law international treaties and constitutions in federal states such as the united states and canada the term is also used in parliamentary procedure in deliberative assemblies in contract law the need for ratification can arise in two ways if the agent attempts to bind the principal despite lacking the authority to do so and if the principal authorizes the agent to make an agreement but reserves the right to approve it an example of the former situation is an employee not normally responsible for procuring supplies

it is considered to be fundamental to all natural science especially physics causality is also a topic studied from the perspectives of philosophy and statistics from the perspective of physics causality cannot occur between an effect and an event that is not in the back past light cone of said effect similarly a cause cannot have an effect outside its front future light cone in classical physics an effect cannot occur before its cause in einstein s theory of special relativity causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause that is not in the back past light cone of that event similarly a cause cannot have an effect outside its front future light cone these restrictions are consistent with the grounded belief or assumption that causal influences cannot travel faster than the speed of light and or backwards in time in quantum field theory observables of events with a spacelike relationship elsewhere have to commute so the order of observations or measurements of such observables do not impact each other causality in this context should not be confused with newton s second law which is related to the conservation of momentum and is a consequence of the

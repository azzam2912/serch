it is a cognitive model that describes how people actually make decisions rather than a rational or normative theory that prescribes what people should or ought to do it is also a dynamic model of decision making rather than a static model because it describes how a person s preferences evolve across time until a decision is reached rather than assuming a fixed state of preference the preference evolution process is mathematically represented as a stochastic process called a diffusion process it is used to predict how humans make decisions under uncertainty how decisions change under time pressure and how choice context changes preferences this model can be used to predict not only the choices that are made but also decision or response times the paper decision field theory was published by jerome r busemeyer and james t townsend in 1993 the dft has been shown to account for many puzzling findings regarding human choice behavior including violations of stochastic dominance violations of strong stochastic transitivity violations of independence between alternatives serial position effects on preference speed accuracy tradeoff effects inverse relation between probability and decision time changes in decisions under time pressure as well as preference reversals between choices

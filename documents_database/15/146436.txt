mindat org defines conchoidal fracture as follows a fracture with smooth curved surfaces typically slightly concave showing concentric undulations resembling the lines of growth of a shell materials that break in this way include quartz chert flint quartzite jasper and other fine grained or amorphous materials with a composition of pure silica such as obsidian and window glass as well as a few metals such as solid gallium conchoidal fractures can also occur in other materials under favorable circumstances this material property was widely used in the stone age to make sharp tools and minerals that fractured in this fashion were widely traded as a desirable raw material conchoidal fractures often result in a curved breakage surface that resembles the rippling gradual curves of a mussel shell the word conchoid is derived from the word for this animal konchoeid s fissures emanating from the bulb of percussion they are defined in contrast to the faceted fractures often seen in single crystals such as semiconductor wafers and gemstones and the high energy ductile fracture surfaces desirable in most structural applications several subdefinitions exist for instance on the webmineral website in lithic stone tools conchoidal fractures form the basis of flint knapping

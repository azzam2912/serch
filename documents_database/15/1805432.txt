the area experiences some of the greatest mean annual duration of bright sunshine as the sun shines bright during approximatively as much as 4 300 hours a year which is equal to 97 of the possible total this region also has the highest mean annual values of solar radiation the maximum recorded being over 220 kcal cm the low latitude of the landmass is another asset much of the continent lies in the intertropical zone where the intensity and the strength of the sunlight are always high the area contains lots of vast sun drenched arid and semi arid expanses in the north in the south and to a lesser extent in the east about two fifths of the continent are desert and thus continuously sunny the combination of all these geographical and climatic factors is the cause of the large solar potential of africa this gives solar power the potential to bring energy to virtually any location in africa without the need for expensive large scale grid level infrastructural developments the distribution of solar resources across africa is fairly uniform with more than 85 of the continent s landscape receiving a global solar horizontal irradiation at or over 2

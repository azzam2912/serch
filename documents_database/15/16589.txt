essentially squelch is a specialized type of noise gate designed to suppress randomized signals squelch is widely used in two way radios and radio scanners to suppress the sound of channel noise when the radio is not receiving a transmission squelch can be opened which allows all signals entering the receiver to be heard this can be useful when trying to hear distant or otherwise weak signals for example in dxing a carrier squelch or noise squelch is the most simple variant of all it operates strictly on the signal strength such as when a television mutes the audio or blanks the video on empty channels or when a walkie talkie mutes the audio when no signal is present in some designs the squelch threshold is preset for example television squelch settings are usually preset receivers in base stations or repeaters at remote mountain top sites are usually not adjustable remotely from the control point in two way radios also known as radiotelephones the received signal level required to unsquelch un mute the receiver may be fixed or adjustable with a knob or a sequence of button presses typically the operator will adjust the control until noise is heard and

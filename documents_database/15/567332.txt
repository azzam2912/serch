each step represents a frequency ratio of or 54 55 cents when composing with 22 et one needs to take into account different facts considering the 5 limit there is a difference between 3 fifths and the sum of 1 fourth 1 major third it means that starting from c there are two a s one 16 steps and one 17 steps away there is also a difference between a major tone and a minor tone in c major the second note d will be 4 steps away however in a minor where a is 6 steps below c the fourth note d will be 9 steps above a so 3 steps above c so when switching from c major to a minor one need to slightly change the note d these discrepancies arise because unlike 12 et 22 et does not temper out the syntonic comma of 81 80 and in fact exaggerates its size by mapping it to one step extending 22 et to the 7 limit we find the septimal minor seventh 7 4 can be distinguished from the sum of a fifth 3 2 and a minor third 6 5 also the septimal subminor third 7

a category in which a tensor product formula 1 is defined such that the tensor product is symmetric i e formula 2 is in a certain strict sense naturally isomorphic to formula 3 for all objects formula 4 and formula 5 of the category one of the prototypical examples of a symmetric monoidal category is the category of vector spaces over some fixed field k using the ordinary tensor product of vector spaces a symmetric monoidal category is a monoidal category c i such that for every pair a b of objects in c there is an isomorphism formula 6 that is natural in both a and b and such that the following diagrams commute in the diagrams above a l r are the associativity isomorphism the left unit isomorphism and the right unit isomorphism respectively some examples and non examples of symmetric monoidal categories the classifying space geometric realization of the nerve of a symmetric monoidal category is an formula 12 space so its group completion is an infinite loop space a dagger symmetric monoidal category is a symmetric monoidal category with a compatible dagger structure a cosmos is a complete cocomplete closed symmetric monoidal category in a symmetric

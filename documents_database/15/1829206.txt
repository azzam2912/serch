as the eye ages it is common for the vitreous to separate from the retina but if this separation is not complete i e there is still an adhesion this can create pulling forces on the retina that may result in subsequent loss or distortion of vision the adhesion in of itself is not dangerous but the resulting pathological vitreomacular traction vmt can cause severe ocular damage the current standard of care for treating these adhesions is pars plana vitrectomy ppv which involves surgically removing the vitreous from the eye a biological agent for non invasive treatment of adhesions called ocriplasmin has been approved by the fda on oct 17 2012 traction caused by vma is the underlying pathology of an eye disease called symptomatic vma there is evidence that symptomatic vma can contribute to the development of several well known eye disorders such as macular hole and macular pucker that can cause visual impairment including blindness it may also be associated with age related macular degeneration amd diabetic macular edema dme retinal vein occlusion and diabetic retinopathy dr over time it is common for the vitreous within the human eye to liquify and collapse in processes known as syneresis

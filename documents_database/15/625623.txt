the moving fluid creates a space devoid of downstream flowing fluid on the downstream side of the object fluid behind the obstacle flows into the void creating a swirl of fluid on each edge of the obstacle followed by a short reverse flow of fluid behind the obstacle flowing upstream toward the back of the obstacle this phenomenon is naturally observed behind large emergent rocks in swift flowing rivers the propensity of a fluid to swirl is used to promote good fuel air mixing in internal combustion engines in fluid mechanics and transport phenomena an eddy is not a property of the fluid but a violent swirling motion caused by the position and direction of turbulent flow in 1883 scientist osborne reynolds conducted a fluid dynamics experiment involving water and dye where he adjusted the velocities of the fluids and observed the transition from laminar to turbulent flow characterized by the formation of eddies and vortices turbulent flow is defined as the flow in which the system s inertial forces are dominant over the viscous forces this phenomenon is described by reynolds number a unit less number used to determine when turbulent flow will occur conceptually the reynolds number is

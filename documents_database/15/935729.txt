bismuth is in the 3 oxidation state bismuth subcarbonate occurs naturally as the mineral bismutite its structure consists of bi o layers and co layers and is related to kettnerite cabi co of it is light sensitive it is highly radiopaque and for example is used as a filler in radiopaque catheters which can be seen by x ray in modern medicine bismuth subcarbonate has been made into nanotube arrays that exhibit antibacterial properties it is also used in fireworks to make dragon s eggs it is a constituent of milk of bismuth which was a popular digestive tract panacea in the 1930s bismuth subcarbonate may be harmful if swallowed it may irritate the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract bismuth subcarbonate can be attained from the reaction between bismuth nanoparticles and the atmospheric carbon dioxide co dissolved in water bismuth subcarbonate has the tendency to form nanoplates but it can be also obtained as small round nanospheres with controlled size when it is grown in the presence of halloysite nanotubes the high ph and high temperature of the aqueous solution helps to reduce the time of synthesis it is readily formed on the surface of undoped bismuth oxide bio and bio

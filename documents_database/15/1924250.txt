even though its structure is very similar to a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor mosfet the fundamental switching mechanism differs making this device a promising candidate for low power electronics tfets switch by modulating quantum tunneling through a barrier instead of modulating thermionic emission over a barrier as in traditional mosfets because of this tfets are not limited by the thermal maxwell boltzmann tail of carriers which limits mosfet drain current subthreshold swing to about 60 mv decade of current at room temperature exactly 63 mv decade at 300 k the concept was proposed by chang et al while working at ibm joerg appenzeller and his colleagues at ibm were the first to demonstrate that current swings below the mosfet s 60 mv per decade limit were possible in 2004 they reported they had created a tunnel transistor with a carbon nanotube channel and a subthreshold swing of just 40 mv per decade in 2015 a team led by kaustav banerjee at university of california santa barbara demonstrated a tunnel transistor by making a vertical structure with atomically thin mos as the active channel and germanium as the source electrode exhibiting a minimum subthreshold swing of only 3 9

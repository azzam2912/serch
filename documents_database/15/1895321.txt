henrich focke built the laboratory in 1960 at the age of 70 in the city of bremen until shortly before his death in 1979 focke continued aerodynamic studies in slow flight characteristics and the stability problem of helicopters the rediscovery of his aerodynamic laboratory together with its wind tunnel was regarded as a sensation for science and technology since 2004 the technical monument focke flight laboratory is protected by law the lab was discovered in 1997 by kai steffen after having read the memoirs of henrich focke the former graduate student searched for the missing wind tunnel contacting the focke family and finding the laboratory in a backyard shed near the main station of bremen the laboratory had not been entered by anyone for about 20 years the wind tunnel is a closed recirculating wind tunnel for subsonic speed range produces wind speeds up to 16 m per second and is still fully functional the simplicity of the instrumentation is demonstrated by the use of kitchen scales to measure the forces acting in the wind tunnel stove pipes and curtains controlling the airflow and reducing swirl everything in this lab was still in place as the 85 year old henrich

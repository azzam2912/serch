dust storms arise when a gust front or other strong wind blows loose sand and dirt from a dry surface fine particles are transported by saltation and suspension a process that moves soil from one place and deposits it in another drylands around north africa and the arabian peninsula are the main terrestrial sources of airborne dust it has been argued that poor management of the earth s drylands such as neglecting the fallow system are increasing dust storms size and frequency from desert margins and changing both the local and global climate and also impacting local economies the term sandstorm is used most often in the context of desert dust storms especially in the sahara desert or places where sand is a more prevalent soil type than dirt or rock when in addition to fine particles obscuring visibility a considerable amount of larger sand particles are blown closer to the surface the term dust storm is more likely to be used when finer particles are blown long distances especially when the dust storm affects urban areas as the force of wind passing over loosely held particles increases particles of sand first start to vibrate then to saltate leaps as

the current is located off the eastern coast of greenland along the greenland continental margin the current cuts through the nordic seas the greenland and norwegian seas and through the denmark strait the current is of major importance because it directly connects the arctic to the northern atlantic it is a major contributor to sea ice export out of the arctic and it is a major freshwater sink for the arctic the egc is composed of a mixture of three distinct water masses the water masses are polar water atlantic water and deep water these water masses can be clearly seen throughout the egc s tract southward however the upper layer water masses do change some due to atmospheric interaction along with inflow from other water sources in the nordic seas the top 150 meters of the egc is considered polar water and it is cold and low in salinity the lowness in salinity has a lot to do with freshwater run off from sea ice melting river runoff and pacific water flux and it is cold due to air sea interactions while in the arctic typical characteristics for the egc polar water are a temperature between 0 c and

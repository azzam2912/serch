it is intended to study aspects of magnetic fusion energy which will be pertinent to the iter fusion project as part of that country s contribution to the iter effort the project was approved in 1995 but construction was delayed by the east asian financial crisis which weakened the south korean economy considerably however the construction phase of the project was completed on september 14 2007 the first plasma was achieved in june 2008 kstar will be one of the first research tokamaks in the world to feature fully superconducting magnets which again will be of great relevance to iter as this will also use sc magnets the kstar magnet system consists of 16 niobium tin direct current toroidal field magnets 10 niobium tin alternating current poloidal field magnets and 4 niobium titanium alternating current poloidal field magnets it is planned that the reactor will study plasma pulses of up to 20 seconds duration until 2011 when it will be upgraded to study pulses of up to 300 seconds duration the reactor vessel will have a major radius of 1 8 m a minor radius of 0 5 m a maximum toroidal field of 3 5 tesla and a maximum

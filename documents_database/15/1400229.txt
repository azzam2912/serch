it is one of the primary components found in carrot seed oil comprising approximately 40 of this essential oil this sesquiterpene alcohol is thought to be formed in carrot seeds daucus carota l umbelliferae during the vegetation period additionally studies have shown that carotol may be involved in allelopathic interactions expressing activity as an antifungal herbicidal and insecticidal agent it has been proposed that there is a direct cyclisation of farnesyl pyrophosphate fpp to the carotol carotane backbone this type of cyclisation is unconventional for the typical chemistry of sesquiterpenes the only other proposed mechanism requires a complex ten membered ring with a methyl migration this latter reaction regardless of how plausible it may appear to be on paper is energetically undesired and through the diligent work of m soucek and coworkers it was shown that the cyclization from fpp to carotol is the most probable biosynthesis route the formation of farnesyl pyrophosphate is via the mevalonate pathway an additional five carbon ipp unit is added in the same manner to gpp the cyclization of fpp proceeds via a synchronous reaction of trans antiparallel additions this leads to the trans carbocation intermediate further cyclisation occurs yielding the 5 and 7

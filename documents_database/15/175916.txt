water requires a non gaseous surface to make the transition from a vapour to a liquid this process is called condensation in the atmosphere this surface presents itself as tiny solid or liquid particles called ccns when no ccns are present water vapour can be supercooled at about 13 c 8 f for 5 6 hours before droplets spontaneously form this is the basis of the cloud chamber for detecting subatomic particles in above freezing temperatures the air would have to be supersaturated to around 400 before the droplets could form the concept of cloud condensation nuclei is used in cloud seeding that tries to encourage rainfall by seeding the air with condensation nuclei it has further been suggested that creating such nuclei could be used for marine cloud brightening a climate engineering technique a typical raindrop is about 2 mm in diameter a typical cloud droplet is on the order of 0 02 mm and a typical cloud condensation nucleus aerosol is on the order of 0 0001 mm or 0 1 m or greater in diameter the number of cloud condensation nuclei in the air can be measured and ranges between around 100 to 1000 per cubic centimetre

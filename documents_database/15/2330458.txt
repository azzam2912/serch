with an apparent visual magnitude of 6 3 it lies below the normal brightness limit of stars that are visible with the naked eye under most viewing conditions an annual parallax shift of 39 24 mas for the a component provides a distance estimate of 83 light years the pair are candidate members of the castor moving group which implies a relatively youthful age of around 200 million years hd 119124 is moving closer to the sun with a radial velocity of 12 km s this system was first identified as a double star by friedrich von struve 1793 1864 and catalogued as the 1774th entry in his list as of 2015 the magnitude 10 5 k type companion star was located at an angular separation of 18 10 arc seconds along a position angle of 135 from the brighter primary they appear to be gravitationally bound with an estimated orbital period of around 7 000 years the primary component a is a sun like star with a stellar classification of f8 v indicating it is an f type main sequence star that is generating energy via hydrogen fusion at its core it is slightly larger and more massive than

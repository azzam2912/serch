a quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space but it lacks translational symmetry while crystals according to the classical crystallographic restriction theorem can possess only two three four and six fold rotational symmetries the bragg diffraction pattern of quasicrystals shows sharp peaks with other symmetry orders for instance five fold aperiodic tilings were discovered by mathematicians in the early 1960s and some twenty years later they were found to apply to the study of natural quasicrystals the discovery of these aperiodic forms in nature has produced a paradigm shift in the fields of crystallography quasicrystals had been investigated and observed earlier but until the 1980s they were disregarded in favor of the prevailing views about the atomic structure of matter in 2009 after a dedicated search a mineralogical finding icosahedrite offered evidence for the existence of natural quasicrystals roughly an ordering is non periodic if it lacks translational symmetry which means that a shifted copy will never match exactly with its original the more precise mathematical definition is that there is never translational symmetry in more than n 1 linearly independent directions where n is the dimension of the space filled e g the three dimensional tiling displayed in

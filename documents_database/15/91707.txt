in other words functional dependency is a constraint between two attributes in a relation given a relation r a set of attributes x in r is said to functionally determine another set of attributes y also in r written x y if and only if each x value in r is associated with precisely one y value in r r is then said to satisfy the functional dependency x y equivalently the projection formula 1 is a function i e y is a function of x in simple words if the values for the x attributes are known say they are x then the values for the y attributes corresponding to x can be determined by looking them up in any tuple of r containing x customarily x is called the determinant set and y the dependent set a functional dependency fd x y is called trivial if y is a subset of x in other words a dependency fd x y means that the values of y are determined by the values of x two tuples sharing the same values of x will necessarily have the same values of y the determination of functional dependencies is an important part

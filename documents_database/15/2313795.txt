it was discovered in december 1986 it remains an extremely radioactive object however its danger has decreased over time due to the decay of its radioactive components unyielding to a drill the mass is quite dense but it is able to be damaged by a kalashnikov rifle the elephant s foot is a large mass of black corium with many layers externally resembling tree bark and glass it was formed during the chernobyl disaster in april 1986 and discovered in december 1986 it is named for its wrinkly appearance resembling the foot of an elephant it lies beneath reactor no 4 of the chernobyl nuclear power plant under reactor room 217 the elephant s foot is composed primarily of silicon dioxide with traces of uranium titanium zirconium magnesium and graphite the mass is largely homogeneous though the depolymerized silicate glass contains occasional crystalline grains of zircon these grains of zircon are not elongated suggesting a moderate crystallization rate while uranium dioxide dendrites grew quickly at high temperatures within the lava the zircon began crystallization during slow cooling of the lava despite the distribution of uranium bearing particles not being uniform the radioactivity of the mass is evenly distributed the mass

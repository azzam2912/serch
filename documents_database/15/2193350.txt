the measurement of current ranges from picoamps to tens of thousands of amperes the selection of a current sensing method depends on requirements such as magnitude accuracy bandwidth robustness cost isolation or size the current value may be directly displayed by an instrument or converted to digital form for use by a monitoring or control system current sensing techniques include shunt resistor current transformers and rogowski coils magnetic field based transducers and others current sensing technologies must fulfill various requirements for various applications generally the common requirements are the measurement of the electric current can be classified depending upon the underlying fundamental physical principles such as ohm s law is the observation that the voltage drop across a resistor is proportional to the current going through it this relationship can be used to sense currents sensors based on this simple relationship are well known for their lower costs and reliability due to this simple principle the common and simple approach to current sensing is the use of a shunt resistor the voltage drop across the shunt is proportional to its current flow both alternating currents ac and direct currents dc can be measured with the shunt resistor the high performance

they are used in the prevention of blood clots and treatment of venous thromboembolism deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and in the treatment of myocardial infarction heparin is a naturally occurring polysaccharide that inhibits coagulation the process that leads to thrombosis natural heparin consists of molecular chains of varying lengths or molecular weights chains of varying molecular weights from 5000 to over 40 000 daltons make up polydisperse pharmaceutical grade heparin lmwhs in contrast consist of only short chains of polysaccharide lmwhs are defined as heparin salts having an average molecular weight of less than 8000 da and for which at least 60 of all chains have a molecular weight less than 8000 da these are obtained by various methods of fractionation or depolymerisation of polymeric heparin heparin derived from natural sources mainly porcine intestine or bovine lung can be administered therapeutically to prevent thrombosis however the effects of natural or unfractionated heparin are more unpredictable than lmwh because it can be given subcutaneously and does not require aptt monitoring lmwh permits outpatient treatment of conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism that previously mandated inpatient hospitalization for unfractionated heparin administration because lmwh has more predictable pharmacokinetics

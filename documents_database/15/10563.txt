usually indicated by the greek letter sigma they are occasionally denoted by tau when used in connection with isospin symmetries they are these matrices are named after the physicist wolfgang pauli in quantum mechanics they occur in the pauli equation which takes into account the interaction of the spin of a particle with an external electromagnetic field each pauli matrix is hermitian and together with the identity matrix sometimes considered as the zeroth pauli matrix the pauli matrices form a basis for the vector space of hermitian matrices this means that any hermitian matrix can be written as a linear combination of pauli matrices where all the scalar coefficients are chosen to be real hermitian operators represent observables so the pauli matrices span the space of observables of the dimensional complex hilbert space in the context of pauli s work represents the observable corresponding to spin along the th coordinate axis in three dimensional euclidean space the pauli matrices after multiplication by to make them anti hermitian also generate transformations in the sense of lie algebras the matrices form a basis for formula 2 which exponentiates to the special unitary group su 2 the algebra generated by the three matrices

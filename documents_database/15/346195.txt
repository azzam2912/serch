it is a measure of how efficiently a limited frequency spectrum is utilized by the physical layer protocol and sometimes by the media access control the channel access protocol the link spectral efficiency of a digital communication system is measured in bit s hz or less frequently but unambiguously in bit s hz it is the net bitrate useful information rate excluding error correcting codes or maximum throughput divided by the bandwidth in hertz of a communication channel or a data link alternatively the spectral efficiency may be measured in bit symbol which is equivalent to bits per channel use bpcu implying that the net bit rate is divided by the symbol rate modulation rate or line code pulse rate link spectral efficiency is typically used to analyse the efficiency of a digital modulation method or line code sometimes in combination with a forward error correction fec code and other physical layer overhead in the latter case a bit refers to a user data bit fec overhead is always excluded the modulation efficiency in bit s is the gross bitrate including any error correcting code divided by the bandwidth an upper bound for the attainable modulation efficiency is given by

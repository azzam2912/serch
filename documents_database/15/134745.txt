in the brain phenethylamine regulates monoamine neurotransmission by binding to trace amine associated receptor 1 taar1 and inhibiting vesicular monoamine transporter 2 vmat2 in monoamine neurons to a lesser extent it also acts as a neurotransmitter in the human central nervous system in mammals phenethylamine is produced from the amino acid l phenylalanine by the enzyme aromatic l amino acid decarboxylase via enzymatic decarboxylation in addition to its presence in mammals phenethylamine is found in many other organisms and foods such as chocolate especially after microbial fermentation phenethylamine is sold as a dietary supplement for purported mood and weight loss related therapeutic benefits however in orally ingested phenethylamine a significant amount is metabolized in the small intestine by monoamine oxidase b mao b and then aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh which convert it to phenylacetic acid this means that for significant concentrations to reach the brain the dosage must be higher than for other methods of administration phenethylamines or more properly substituted phenethylamines are the group of phenethylamine derivatives that contain phenethylamine as a backbone in other words this chemical class includes derivative compounds that are formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms in the phenethylamine core structure with substituents the

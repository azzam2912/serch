beta waves can be split into three sections low beta waves 12 5 16 hz beta 1 power beta waves 16 5 20 hz beta 2 power and high beta waves 20 5 28 hz beta 3 power beta states are the states associated with normal waking consciousness beta waves were discovered and named by the german psychiatrist hans berger who invented electroencephalography eeg in 1924 as a method of recording electrical brain activity from the human scalp berger termed the larger amplitude slower frequency waves that appeared over the posterior scalp when the subject s eye were closed alpha waves the smaller amplitude faster frequency waves that replaced alpha waves when the subject opened his or her eyes were then termed beta waves low amplitude beta waves with multiple and varying frequencies are often associated with active busy or anxious thinking and active concentration over the motor cortex beta waves are associated with the muscle contractions that happen in isotonic movements and are suppressed prior to and during movement changes bursts of beta activity are associated with a strengthening of sensory feedback in static motor control and reduced when there is movement change beta activity is increased when movement

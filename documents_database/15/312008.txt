he earned his undergraduate degree in 1974 and phd in 1977 from the university of strathclyde in glasgow until february 2001 he was a group leader at the ibm zurich research laboratory where he was involved in nanoscale science since 1983 currently he is a professor in the department of chemistry and biochemistry at ucla where he conducts research and advises graduate students in his picolab he is also the faculty director of the nano pico characterization core lab at the california nanosystems institute at ucla he pioneered research on electrical contact with single atoms and molecules light emission and molecular imaging using stm his accomplishments include the first stm manipulation of molecules at room temperature the realization of molecular abacus using buckyballs c the discovery of single molecule rotors and the development of nanomechanical sensors based on nanotechnology which explore the ultimate limits of sensitivity and measurement recently he discovered a new method to synthesize carbon nanotubes more regular in diameter and length his current interests within cnsi are in the nanoarchitectonics of molecular systems and molecular and biomolecular machines in particular those with quantum mechanical possibilities for information processing recently he has undertaken research in biophysics which he

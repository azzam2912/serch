all human portions of the missions would be conducted from lighter than air craft or from orbit venus is a planet with a runaway greenhouse effect with surface temperatures and pressure of and respectively conventional rocket engines will not work at those pressures hence human missions to venus have historically been thought impractical if not impossible however venus has advantages for crewed travel such as earth like gravity 90 earth gravity an atmosphere that provides a level of protection from solar and interstellar radiation and greater proximity compared to mars whereas all ground missions measured their operational time in minutes or hours the soviet vega missions found success in launching small balloons that operated until their batteries were exhausted days at altitude the atmosphere of venus is and the equivalent pressure to about on earth however due to the large amount of the density for a given pressure is greater than in earth s atmosphere therefore breathable air acts as a buoyant gas concurrently the gravity at the proposed altitude is 8 73 m s versus 9 81 m s on earth s surface venus has an induced magnetosphere from the interaction of its thick atmosphere with the solar wind

the spectrum has a standard decomposition into three parts this decomposition is relevant to the study of differential equations and has applications to many branches of science and engineering a well known example from quantum mechanics is the explanation for the discrete spectral lines and the continuous band in the light emitted by excited atoms of hydrogen let x be a banach space b x the family of bounded operators on x and t b x by definition a complex number is in the spectrum of t denoted t if t does not have an inverse in b x if t is one to one and onto then its inverse is bounded this follows directly from the open mapping theorem of functional analysis so is in the spectrum of t if and only if t is either not one to one or not onto one distinguishes three separate cases so t is the disjoint union of these three sets the spectrum of an unbounded operator can be divided into three parts in the same way as in the bounded case but because the operator is not defined everywhere the definitions of domain inverse etc are more involved given a finite

the clamper does not restrict the peak to peak excursion of the signal it moves the whole signal up or down so as to place the peaks at the reference level a diode clamp a simple common type consists of a diode which conducts electric current in only one direction and prevents the signal exceeding the reference value and a capacitor which provides a dc offset from the stored charge the capacitor forms a time constant with the resistor load which determines the range of frequencies over which the clamper will be effective a clamping circuit also known as a clamper will bind the upper or lower extreme of a waveform to a fixed dc voltage level these circuits are also known as dc voltage restorers clampers can be constructed in both positive and negative polarities when unbiased clamping circuits will fix the voltage lower limit or upper limit in the case of negative clampers to 0 volts these circuits clamp a peak of a waveform to a specific dc level compared with a capacitively coupled signal which swings about its average dc level the clamping network is one that will clamp a signal to a different dc level the

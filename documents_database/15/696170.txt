it was originally established as a social organization for japanese and japanese american women at usc and has since then come to consist of a diverse membership of women hailing from numerous racial and cultural backgrounds in its early beginnings the founding mothers of sigma phi omega were invited by chi alpha delta an asian american sorority from ucla to become one of their chapters chi alpha delta had been chartered in 1928 at ucla but was rendered inactive between 1942 and 1945 because the majority of its members were unable to attend ucla due to world war ii after the end of the war the sorority was reorganized in 1946 however the founding mothers decided to start their own organization the greek letters were chosen at random and were not used by any other existing fraternities or sororities at that time although sigmas did not originate as a sorority one could speculate that the choosing of greek letters was a public way of voicing an unsatisfactory opinion about the treatment of asian americans specifically japanese americans by the campus and greek organizations sigma phi omega has chosen domestic violence awareness and prevention sexual assault awareness as its national philanthropy

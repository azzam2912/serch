they are named so because they release new peptides from the ribosome during translation of mrna most codons are recognized by charged trna molecules called aminoacyl trnas because they are adhered to specific amino acids corresponding to each trna s anticodon in the standard genetic code there are three mrna stop codons uag amber uaa ochre and uga opal or umber although these stop codons are triplets just like ordinary codons they are not decoded by trnas it was discovered by mario capecchi in 1967 that instead trnas do not ordinarily recognize stop codons at all and that what he named release factor was not a trna molecule but a protein later it was demonstrated that different release factors recognize different stop codons there are two classes of release factors class 1 release factors recognize stop codons they bind to the a site of the ribosome in a way mimicking that of trna releasing the new polypeptide as it disassembles the ribosome class 2 release factors are gtpases that enhance the activity of class 1 release factors it helps the class 1 rf dissociate from the ribosome bacterial release factors include rf1 rf2 and rf3 or prfa prfb prfc in

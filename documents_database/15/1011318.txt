it entered phase i human clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma only three years after its discovery in 2003 this marine natural product is produced by the obligate marine bacteria salinispora tropica and salinispora arenicola which are found in ocean sediment salinosporamide a belongs to a family of compounds known collectively as salinosporamides which possess a densely functionalized lactam lactone bicyclic core salinosporamide a was discovered by william fenical and paul jensen from scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla ca in preliminary screening a high percentage of the organic extracts of cultured salinispora strains possessed antibiotic and anticancer activities which suggests that these bacteria are an excellent resource for drug discovery salinispora strain cnb 392 was isolated from a heat treated marine sediment sample and cytotoxicity guided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of salinosporamide a although salinosporamide a shares an identical bicyclic ring structure with omuralide it is uniquely functionalized salinosporamide a displayed potent in vitro cytotoxicity against hct 116 human colon carcinoma with an ic50 value of 11 ng ml 1 this compound also displayed potent and highly selective activity in the nci s 60 cell line panel with a mean gi50

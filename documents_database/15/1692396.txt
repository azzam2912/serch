however recent studies of feathered dinosaurs have shown that we might be able to infer the color of some species through the use of melanosomes the color determining pigments within the feathers in 2010 paleontologists studied a well preserved skeleton of anchiornis an averaptoran from the tiaojishan formation in china and found melanosomes within its fossilized feathers as different shaped melanosomes determine different colors analysis of the melanosomes allowed the paleontologists to infer that anchiornis had black white and grey feathers all over its body and a crest of dark red or ochre feathers on its head another specimen was reported to possess melanosomes which induced grey and black coloration but none that suggested red or brown coloration in 2010 dr mike benton from the university of bristol analyzed the remains of sinosauropteryx confuciusornis caudipteryx and sinornithosaurus from the yixian and also discovered melanosomes it was determined that sinosauropteryx had orange feathers and that its tail was striped given the feathers were brightly colored and ill suited for flight it is hypothesized that this species used its feathers for display a 2017 study also reported that the body coloration of sinosauropteryx extended to the face creating a raccoon like mask

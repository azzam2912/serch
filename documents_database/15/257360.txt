the strength of the forces responsible for spatial organization of the system range from weak intermolecular forces electrostatic charge or hydrogen bonding to strong covalent bonding provided that the electronic coupling strength remains small relative to the energy parameters of the component whereas traditional chemistry concentrates on the covalent bond supramolecular chemistry examines the weaker and reversible non covalent interactions between molecules these forces include hydrogen bonding metal coordination hydrophobic forces van der waals forces pi pi interactions and electrostatic effects important concepts advanced by supramolecular chemistry include molecular self assembly molecular folding molecular recognition host guest chemistry mechanically interlocked molecular architectures and dynamic covalent chemistry the study of non covalent interactions is crucial to understanding many biological processes that rely on these forces for structure and function biological systems are often the inspiration for supramolecular research the existence of intermolecular forces was first postulated by johannes diderik van der waals in 1873 however nobel laureate hermann emil fischer developed supramolecular chemistry s philosophical roots in 1894 fischer suggested that enzyme substrate interactions take the form of a lock and key the fundamental principles of molecular recognition and host guest chemistry in the early twentieth century non covalent bonds were

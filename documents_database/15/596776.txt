because neutrinos only weakly interact with other particles of matter neutrino detectors must be very large to detect a significant number of neutrinos neutrino detectors are often built underground to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation the field of neutrino astronomy is still very much in its infancy the only confirmed extraterrestrial sources so far as of 2018 are the sun and the supernova 1987a in the nearby large magellenic cloud another likely source 3 standard deviations is the blazar txs 0506 056 about 3 7 billion light years away neutrino observatories will give astronomers fresh eyes with which to study the universe various detection methods have been used super kamiokande is a large volume of water surrounded by phototubes that watch for the cherenkov radiation emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an electron or muon in the water the sudbury neutrino observatory is similar but uses heavy water as the detecting medium other detectors have consisted of large volumes of chlorine or gallium which are periodically checked for excesses of argon or germanium respectively which are created by neutrinos interacting with the original substance minos uses a solid plastic scintillator watched by phototubes borexino uses

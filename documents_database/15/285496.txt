either all the rows can be updated or a subset may be chosen using a condition the codice 1 statement has the following form for the codice 1 to be successful the user must have data manipulation privileges codice 1 privilege on the table or column and the updated value must not conflict with all the applicable constraints such as primary keys unique indexes codice 7 constraints and codice 8 constraints in some databases such as postgresql when a from clause is present what essentially happens is that the target table is joined to the tables mentioned in the fromlist and each output row of the join represents an update operation for the target table when using from one should ensure that the join produces at most one output row for each row to be modified in other words a target row shouldn t join to more than one row from the other table s if it does then only one of the join rows will be used to update the target row but which one will be used is not readily predictable because of this indeterminacy referencing other tables only within sub selects is safer though often harder to

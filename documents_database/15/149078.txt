many of these phytochemicals have beneficial effects on long term health when consumed by humans and can be used to effectively treat human diseases at least 12 000 such compounds have been isolated so far a number estimated to be less than 10 of the total these phytochemicals are divided into 1 primary metabolites such as sugars and fats which are found in all plants and 2 secondary metabolites compounds which are found in a smaller range of plants serving a more specific function for example some secondary metabolites are toxins used to deter predation and others are pheromones used to attract insects for pollination it is these secondary metabolites and pigments that can have therapeutic actions in humans and which can be refined to produce drugs examples are inulin from the roots of dahlias quinine from the cinchona morphine and codeine from the poppy and digoxin from the foxglove chemical compounds in plants mediate their effects on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work this enables herbal medicines to be as effective

the central nervous system is usually unaffected the presumed pathogenesis of acalvaria is faulty migration of the membranous neurocranium with normal placement of the embryonic ectoderm resulting in absence of the calvaria but an intact layer of skin over the brain parenchyma in other words instead of having a skull cap protecting the brain there is only skin covering it the size of the area that is missing the skull cap can vary from case to case in extreme cases the entire top part of the cranium that is dome shaped may be absent there are four main signs of acalvaria absence of the flat bones of the cranial vault absence of the dura mater and muscles associated with it skull abnormalities and the absence of a skull cap this condition can be diagnosed prior to birth using ultrasonography physicians often use magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis because in utero acalvaria is sometimes confused with anencephaly or encephalocele a distinguishable difference is that with anencephaly the cerebral hemispheres are missing but with acalvaria all parts of the cerebrum are usually present and developed whereas parts of the calvarium are missing currently there is no identified cause of acalvaria

they were discovered by and painlev transcendents have their origin in the study of special functions which often arise as solutions of differential equations as well as in the study of isomonodromic deformations of linear differential equations one of the most useful classes of special functions are the elliptic functions they are defined by second order ordinary differential equations whose singularities have the painlev property the only movable singularities are poles this property is rare in nonlinear equations poincar and l fuchs showed that any first order equation with the painlev property can be transformed into the weierstrass elliptic function or the riccati equation which can all be solved explicitly in terms of integration and previously known special functions mile picard pointed out that for orders greater than 1 movable essential singularities can occur and found a special case of what was later called painleve vi equation see below for orders greater than 2 the solutions can have moving natural boundaries around 1900 paul painlev studied second order differential equations with no movable singularities he found that up to certain transformations every such equation of the form with r a rational function can be put into one of fifty canonical

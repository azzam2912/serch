it was developed by the british national physical laboratory during world war i in an attempt to find an aluminium alloy that would retain its strength at high temperatures duralumin an aluminium alloy containing 4 copper was already known at this time its strength and its previously unknown age hardening behaviour had made it a popular choice for zeppelins aircraft of the period were largely constructed of wood but there was a need for an aluminium alloy suitable for making engines particularly pistons that would have the strength of duralumin but could retain this when in service at high temperatures for long periods the national physical laboratory began a series of experiments to study new aluminium alloys experimental series y was successful and gave its name to the new alloy like duralumin this was a 4 copper alloy but with the addition of 2 nickel and 1 5 magnesium this addition of nickel was an innovation for aluminium alloys these alloys are one of the three main groups of high strength aluminium alloys the nickel aluminium alloys having the advantage of retaining strength at high temperatures the alloy was first used in the cast form but was soon used for

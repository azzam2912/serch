bio mems have considerable overlap and is sometimes considered synonymous with lab on a chip loc and micro total analysis systems tas bio mems is typically more focused on mechanical parts and microfabrication technologies made suitable for biological applications on the other hand lab on a chip is concerned with miniaturization and integration of laboratory processes and experiments into single often microfluidic chips in this definition lab on a chip devices do not strictly have biological applications although most do or are amenable to be adapted for biological purposes similarly micro total analysis systems may not have biological applications in mind and are usually dedicated to chemical analysis a broad definition for bio mems can be used to refer to the science and technology of operating at the microscale for biological and biomedical applications which may or may not include any electronic or mechanical functions the interdisciplinary nature of bio mems combines material sciences clinical sciences medicine surgery electrical engineering mechanical engineering optical engineering chemical engineering and biomedical engineering some of its major applications include genomics proteomics molecular diagnostics point of care diagnostics tissue engineering single cell analysis and implantable microdevices in 1967 s b carter reported the use of

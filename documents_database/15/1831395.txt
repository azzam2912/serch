formally for all x in a semigroup s there exists a positive integer n and a subgroup g of s such that x belongs to g epigroups are known by wide variety of other names including quasi periodic semigroup group bound semigroup completely regular semigroup strongly regular semigroup s r or just regular semigroup although the latter is ambiguous more generally in an arbitrary semigroup an element is called group bound if it has a power that belongs to a subgroup epigroups have applications to ring theory many of their properties are studied in this context epigroups were first studied by douglas munn in 1961 who called them pseudoinvertible by analogy with periodic semigroups an epigroup s is partitioned in classes given by its idempotents which act as identities for each subgroup for each idempotent e of s the set formula 1 is called a unipotency class whereas for periodic semigroups the usual name is torsion class subsemigroups of an epigroup need not be epigroups but if they are then they are called subepigroups if an epigroup s has a partition in unipotent subepigroups i e each containing a single idempotent then this partition is unique and its components are

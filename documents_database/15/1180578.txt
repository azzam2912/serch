antidunes occur in supercritical flow meaning that the froude number is greater than 1 0 or the flow velocity exceeds the wave velocity this is also known as upper flow regime in antidunes sediment is deposited on the upstream stoss side and eroded from the downstream lee side opposite lower flow regime bedforms as a result antidunes migrate in an upstream direction counter to the current flow antidunes are called in phase bedforms meaning that the water surface elevation mimics the bed elevation this is due to the supercritical flow regime antidune bedforms evolve rapidly growing in amplitude as they migrate upstream the resultant wave at the water s surface also increases in amplitude when that wave becomes unstable breaks and washes downstream much of the antidune bedform may be destroyed antidunes are typically found in fluvial environments in shallow areas with a high flow rate unlike ripples and dunes in lower flow regime antidunes are generally symmetric and migrate counter to the flow direction antidunes evolve rapidly growing in amplitude as they migrate against the current when the surface wave above them becomes unstable and breaks when the surface wave amplitude reaches 1 7 its wavelength most of the

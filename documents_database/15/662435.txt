the undercar pressure problems in the 78 were resolved with the 79 with further design work on the venturi tunnels under the car which allowed the low pressure area to be evenly spaced along the whole of the underside this was achieved by extending the rear bodywork to a point inside the rear wheels allowing the underside to extend further back instead of ending abruptly in front of the rear wheels as on the 78 as a result the rear suspension was also redesigned to allow the air to exit the rear more cleanly than on its predecessor this allowed a smaller rear wing to be designed causing less drag when the car first appeared the upper bodywork was steeply raked and featured coke bottle sidepods after work in the wind tunnel these features were found to be unnecessary as the car generated so much downforce anyway these features were however later incorporated into the lotus 80 in all five chassis were built during the design s lifetime with the prototype 79 1 being sold to h ctor rebaque to race as a privateer entrant the car was powered by the ford cosworth dfv and constructed of sheet aluminium honeycomb

it is often used as a convenient water soluble source of isotopes of the radioactive element technetium tc in particular it is used to carry the tc isotope half life 6 hours which is commonly used in nuclear medicine in several nuclear scanning procedures a technetate vii salt is a compound containing this ion pertechnetate compounds are salts of technetic vii acid pertechnetate is analogous to permanganate but it has little oxidizing power pertechnetate has higher oxidation power than perrhenate understanding pertechnate is important in understanding technetium contamination in the environment and in nuclear waste management a technetium 99m generator provides the pertechnetate containing the short lived isotope tc for medical uses this compound is generated directly from molybdate held on alumina within the generator see this topic for detail pertechnetate has a wide variety of uses in diagnostic nuclear medicine since technetate vii can substitute for iodine in the na i symporter nis channel in follicular cells of the thyroid gland inhibiting uptake of iodine into the follicular cells tc pertechnetate can be used as an alternative to i in imaging of the thyroid although it specifically measures uptake and not organification it has also been used historically to

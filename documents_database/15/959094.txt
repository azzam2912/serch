the term was first used in the management of hiv the first virus in which genome sequencing was routinely used to look for drug resistance at the time of infection a virus will infect and begin to replicate within a preliminary cell as subsequent cells are infected random mutations will occur in the viral genome when these mutations begin to accumulate antiviral methods will kill the wild type strain but will not be able to kill one or many mutated forms of the original virus at this point a resistance mutation has occurred because the new strain of virus is now resistant to the antiviral treatment that would have killed the original virus resistance mutations are evident and widely studied in hiv due to its high rate of mutation and prevalence in the general population resistance mutation is now studied in bacteriology and parasitology resistance mutations can occur through several mechanisms from single nucleotide substitutions to combinations of amino acid substitutions deletions and insertions over time these new genetic lines will persist if they become resistant to treatments being used against them it has been shown that pathogens will favor and become more resistant to treatment in common host genotypes

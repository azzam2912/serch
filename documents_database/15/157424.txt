proteins with similar structure exist in virtually all living organisms the hsp70s are an important part of the cell s machinery for protein folding and help to protect cells from stress members of the hsp70 family are very strongly upregulated by heat stress and toxic chemicals particularly heavy metals such as arsenic cadmium copper mercury etc hsp70 was originally discovered by fm ritossa in the 1960s when a lab worker accidentally boosted the incubation temperature of drosophila fruit flies when examining the chromosomes ritossa found a puffing pattern that indicated the elevated gene transcription of an unknown protein this was later described as the heat shock response and the proteins were termed the heat shock proteins hsps the hsp70 proteins have three major functional domains the hsp70 system interacts with extended peptide segments of proteins as well as partially folded proteins to cause aggregation of proteins in key pathways to deregulate activity when not interacting with a substrate peptide hsp70 is usually in an atp bound state hsp70 by itself is characterized by a very weak atpase activity such that spontaneous hydrolysis will not occur for many minutes as newly synthesized proteins emerge from the ribosomes the substrate binding domain

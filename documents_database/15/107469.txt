or ergot fungi refers to a group of fungi of the genus claviceps the most prominent member of this group is claviceps purpurea rye ergot fungus this fungus grows on rye and related plants and produces alkaloids that can cause ergotism in humans and other mammals who consume grains contaminated with its fruiting structure called ergot sclerotium claviceps includes about 50 known species mostly in the tropical regions economically significant species include c purpurea parasitic on grasses and cereals c fusiformis on pearl millet buffel grass c paspali on dallis grass c africana on sorghum and c lutea on paspalum c purpurea most commonly affects outcrossing species such as rye its most common host as well as triticale wheat and barley it affects oats only rarely c purpurea has at least three races or varieties which differ in their host specificity an ergot kernel called a sclerotium develops when a spore of fungal species of the genus claviceps infects a floret of flowering grass or cereal the infection process mimics a pollen grain growing into an ovary during fertilization infection requires that the fungal spore have access to the stigma consequently plants infected by claviceps are mainly outcrossing species with

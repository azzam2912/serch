it is also a chemical intermediate in the biosynthesis of many other endogenous steroids including androgens estrogens glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids as well as neurosteroids 17 ohp is an agonist of the progesterone receptor pr similarly to progesterone albeit weakly in comparison in addition it is an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor mr as well as a partial agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor gr albeit with very low potency ec 100 fold less relative to cortisol at the latter site also similarly to progesterone 17 ohp is derived from progesterone via 17 hydroxylase encoded by cyp17a1 17 ohp increases in the third trimester of pregnancy primarily due to fetal adrenal production this steroid is primarily produced in the adrenal glands and to some degree in the gonads specifically the corpus luteum of the ovary normal levels are 3 90 ng dl in children and in women 20 100 ng dl prior to ovulation and 100 500 ng dl during the luteal phase measurements of levels of 17 ohp are useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia as the typical enzymes that are defective namely 21 hydroxylase and 11 hydroxylase lead to a build up of 17 ohp

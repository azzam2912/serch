the ancient ice cap was at least twice the size of the present ice cap and may have been 1500 2000 meters thick later research suggests that the area of this polar ice sheet is believed to have covered about 1 5 million square kilometers the area of texas is 696 200 square km so ice sheet of mars was over twice the area of the state of texas this group of ridges extends from 270 100 e and 70 90 s around the south pole of mars it sits under the late amazonian south polar layered deposits spld in the mare australe quadrangle the combined length of these ridges is huge one study studied seven different ridge systems which contained almost 4 000 ridges that had a total length 51 000 km most eskers are thought to be formed inside ice walled tunnels by streams which flowed within and under glaciers after the retaining ice walls melted away stream deposits remained as long winding ridges crater counts show that the ridges are of two different ages one dates from early hesperian while the other group dates to the late noachian these dates correspond to the time when mars had

it is performed via a periodic batch production process that controls the time of each chemical reaction a small amount of a liquid organic extract is spread as a thin layer onto a matrix made of a thin microporous material whose surfaces are freely accessible from and to the outside the extract is held by capillary forces or other forces this layer is alternately and repeatedly brought into brief contact with thin layers of the donor and the strip aqueous liquid in the extraction step selected species that are present in the donor solution are transported from the donor aqueous solution to the organic phase where a reaction ensues in the stripping step the reaction reverses and the extracted species are stripped into the strip aqueous solution thus two alternate product batches are generated a raffinate and a strip product as each of the species to be separated associates differently with the host the composition of the raffinate and strip product is differentiated with a typical liquid mass diffusivity in the order of 10 m s the characteristic time for diffusion through a 20 micron thick liquid layer is 0 4 s therefore the thinness of both phases organic and

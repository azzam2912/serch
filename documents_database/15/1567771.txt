this duplication syndrome has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 64 000 births and is the reciprocal of the 8p23 1 deletion syndrome the 8p23 1 duplication is associated with a variable phenotype including one or more of speech delay developmental delay mild dysmorphism with prominent forehead and arched eyebrows and congenital heart disease chd the phenotypic data on 11 patients indicated that cases are not always ascertained for chd but that chd was the most common single feature found in 6 out of 11 individuals developmental delay and or learning difficulties were found in 5 out of 11 cases but one prenatal case was developing normally at 15 months of age case 1 three other prenatal cases could not yet be reliably assessed a variable degree of facial dysmorphism was present in 5 out of 11 individuals partial toe syndactyly has been found in one mother and son diad and adrenal anomalies in two probands but not in the duplicated mother of one of them the phenotype is compatible with independent adult life with varying degrees of support duplication of the gata4 transcription factor is believed to underlie the congenital heart disease and other genes common to the duplication

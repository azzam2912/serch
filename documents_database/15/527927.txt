due to an impaired release of the gonadotropins follicle stimulating hormone fsh and luteinizing hormone lh and a resultant lack of sex steroid and peptides production by the gonads in kallmann syndrome a variable non reproductive phenotype occurs with anosmia loss of the sense of smell including sensorineural deafness coloboma bimanual synkinesis craniofacial abnormalities and or renal agenesis ihh is divided into two syndromes ihh with olfactory alterations or anosmia kallmann syndrome and ihh with normal smell normosmic ihh kallmann syndrome is responsible for approximately 50 of all cases of the condition it is associated with mutations in kal1 fgfr1 fgf8 fgf17 il17rd prokr2 nelf chd7 which positively regulates gnrh secretion hs6st1 flrt3 spry4 dusp6 sema3a and wdr11 gene genes which are related to defects in neuronal migration gene defects associated with ihh and normal smell include prokr2 fgfr1 fgf8 chd7 dusp6 and wdr11 as in ks but in addition also mutations in kiss1r tacr3 gnrh1 gnrhr lep lepr hesx1 fshb and lhb gnrh insensitivity is the second most common cause of ihh responsible for up to 20 of cases a minority of less than 5 10 is due to inactivating mutations in genes which positively regulate gnrh secretion such

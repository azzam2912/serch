the band is also composed of members wiley hodgden and mick murphy who previously played with hawkins in the cover band chevy metal the birds of satan formed as an evolution of former cover band chevy metal according to hawkins it was kind of a deliberate move i suppose it was basically i had this cover band called chevy metal and i just didn t have a lot of time and i wanted to make a record i had been kind of fucking around with songs and i had another band called the coattail riders but those guys have all kind of moved on and not everybody is available at times i really only had a week to put down this record and i wanted to do it really quickly so i had been playing with these guys with wiley hodgden the bass player for years and mick murphy the guitar player and it was easy i just said you want to help me make a record and they were like yeah fuck yea so we did it really quick and dave grohl came for a couple songs pat smear came in on a song it was all just us

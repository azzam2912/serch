the modification was discovered in the 1980s as an unwanted side effect of reactive ion etching rie other methods for forming a similar structure include electrochemical etching stain etching metal assisted chemical etching and laser treatment which is developed in eric mazur s laboratory at harvard university and ffc cambridge process an electrochemical reduction process black silicon has become a major asset to the solar photovoltaic industry as it enables greater light to electricity conversion efficiency of standard crystalline silicon solar cells which significantly reduces their costs black silicon is a needle shaped surface structure where needles are made of single crystal silicon and have a height above 10 m and diameter less than 1 m its main feature is an increased absorption of incident light the high reflectivity of the silicon which is usually 20 30 for quasi normal incidence is reduced to about 5 this is due to the formation of a so called effective medium by the needles within this medium there is no sharp interface but a continuous change of the refractive index that reduces fresnel reflection when the depth of the graded layer is roughly equal to the wavelength of light in silicon about one

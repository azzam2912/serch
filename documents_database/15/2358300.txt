active for nearly ninety years its membership and importance varied greatly over time at its peak it represented the large majority of stonemasons in the country the union was founded in aberdeen in 1831 and by the end of the decade had fifteen branches including glasgow and edinburgh however most were very small and in 1840 it had only 433 members despite this it had strong financial reserves and in 1841 it donated 500 to the operative society of masons quarrymen and allied trades of england and wales which enabled it to remain on strike and eventually win a partial victory in a dispute relating to the construction of the houses of parliament each branch operated largely autonomously and this led to serious disagreements between the aberdeen and glasgow branches the aberdeen branch broke away in 1842 forming the rival northern union of operative masons by 1846 most members had left the united operatives and the union nearly collapsed however the glasgow branch remained operational and in 1851 it re established the union on a national basis with the support of the english and welsh union the reorganised union proved far more successful growing to 3 000 members by 1855

while the formula was named after de moivre he never stated it in his works the expression is sometimes abbreviated to the formula is important because it connects complex numbers and trigonometry by expanding the left hand side and then comparing the real and imaginary parts under the assumption that is real it is possible to derive useful expressions for and in terms of and as written the formula is not valid for non integer powers however there are generalizations of this formula valid for other exponents these can be used to give explicit expressions for the th roots of unity that is complex numbers such that for formula 2 and formula 3 de moivre s formula asserts that formula 4 or equivalently that formula 5 in this example it is easy to check the validity of the equation by multiplying out the left side de moivre s formula is a precursor to euler s formula formula 6 which establishes the fundamental relationship between the trigonometric functions and the complex exponential function one can derive de moivre s formula using euler s formula and the exponential law for integer powers since euler s formula implies that the left side is

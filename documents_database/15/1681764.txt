it had an estimated magnitude of 7 4 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of about ix violent on the mercalli intensity scale it triggered a massive landslide blocking the murghab river and forming the usoi dam the tallest dam in the world creating sarez lake the earthquake and related landslides destroyed many buildings and killed about 100 people the earthquake epicenter is located in the central pamir mountains these mountains form the western end of the himalayan chain caused by the continuing continental collision between the northward moving indian plate and the eurasian plate the area is affected by active faulting on both thrust faults and strike slip faults the 1911 earthquake occurred within the pamir hindu kush seismic zone which is regularly affected by earthquakes some of which have magnitudes of 7 or greater the earthquake lasted for two minutes and was followed by an aftershock an hour later the energy radiated by this event was one of the first to be estimated from seismograph recordings of seismic waves current estimates for the magnitude lie in the range 7 4 7 6 on the surface wave magnitude scale the earthquake caused the waters

broadly speaking sheaf cohomology describes the obstructions to solving a geometric problem globally when it can be solved locally the central figure of this study is alexander grothendieck and his 1957 tohoku paper sheaves sheaf cohomology and spectral sequences were invented by jean leray at the prisoner of war camp oflag xvii a in austria from 1940 to 1945 leray and other prisoners organized a universit en captivit in the camp leray s definitions were simplified and clarified in the 1950s it became clear that sheaf cohomology was not only a new approach to cohomology in algebraic topology but also a powerful method in complex analytic geometry and algebraic geometry these subjects often involve constructing global functions with specified local properties and sheaf cohomology is ideally suited to such problems many earlier results such as the riemann roch theorem and the hodge theorem have been generalized or understood better using sheaf cohomology the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space x is an abelian category and so it makes sense to ask when a morphism f b c of sheaves is injective a monomorphism or surjective an epimorphism one answer is that f is injective resp surjective

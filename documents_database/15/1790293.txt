in transshipment transportation may or must go through intermediate nodes possibly changing modes of transport the transshipment problem has its origins in medieval times when trading started to become a mass phenomenon obtaining the minimum cost route had been the main priority however technological development slowly gave priority to minimum duration transportation problems transshipment or transhipment is the shipment of goods or containers to an intermediate destination and then from there to yet another destination one possible reason is to change the means of transport during the journey for example from ship transport to road transport known as transloading another reason is to combine small shipments into a large shipment consolidation dividing the large shipment at the other end deconsolidation transshipment usually takes place in transport hubs much international transshipment also takes place in designated customs areas thus avoiding the need for customs checks or duties otherwise a major hindrance for efficient transport a few initial assumptions are required in order to formulate the transshipment problem completely the goal is to minimize formula 7 subject to since in most cases an explicit expression for the objective function does not exist an alternative method is suggested by rajeev and satya the

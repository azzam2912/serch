it is located approximately 54 light years away in the constellation ara in 2009 a gas giant was found in orbit around the primary star in addition to its confirmation in 2011 there was also a strong indication of a companion the second gas giant was characterised in 2012 along with two much smaller planets the first planet discovered b is a super jovian first characterised in october 2009 the planet was formally announced in 2011 along with the first recognition of a trend not attributable to the companion star even after fitting a planet and a trend it was noted that the residual velocities were still around 3 4 m s significantly larger than the instrumental errors of around 1 7 m s this tentatively implied the existence of other bodies in orbit though nothing more could be said at the time the star was a test case for the harps terra software for better reduction of data from the harps spectrometer in early 2012 even with significantly lower margins of error on the data less data was accessible than what was used in 2011 still the team reached a very similar conclusion to the previous team with a

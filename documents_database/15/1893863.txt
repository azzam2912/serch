the dryden model treats the linear and angular velocity components of continuous gusts as spatially varying stochastic processes and specifies each component s power spectral density the dryden wind turbulence model is characterized by rational power spectral densities so exact filters can be designed that take white noise inputs and output stochastic processes with the dryden gusts power spectral densities the dryden model named after hugh dryden is one of the most commonly used models of continuous gusts it was first published in 1952 the dryden model is characterized by power spectral densities for gusts three linear velocity components u v w formula 1 where and l are the turbulence intensity and scale length respectively for the i th velocity component and is a spatial frequency these power spectral densities give the stochastic process spatial variations but any temporal variations rely on vehicle motion through the gust velocity field the speed with which the vehicle is moving through the gust field v allows conversion of these power spectral densities to different types of frequencies formula 2 where has units of radians per unit time the gust angular velocity components p q r are defined as the variations of the linear

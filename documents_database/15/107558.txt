when applied to an audio signal spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs voiceprints or voicegrams when the data is represented in a 3d plot they may be called waterfalls spectrograms are used extensively in the fields of music sonar radar and speech processing seismology and others spectrograms of audio can be used to identify spoken words phonetically and to analyse the various calls of animals a spectrogram can be generated by an optical spectrometer a bank of band pass filters by fourier transform or by a wavelet transform in which case it is also known as a scaleogram a spectrogram is usually depicted as a heat map i e as an image with the intensity shown by varying the colour or brightness a common format is a graph with two geometric dimensions one axis represents time and the other axis represents frequency a third dimension indicating the amplitude of a particular frequency at a particular time is represented by the intensity or color of each point in the image there are many variations of format sometimes the vertical and horizontal axes are switched so time runs up and down sometimes as a waterfall plot where the amplitude is represented by height

the changes are first recorded in the log which must be written to stable storage before the changes are written to the database in a system using wal all modifications are written to a log before they are applied usually both redo and undo information is stored in the log the purpose of this can be illustrated by an example imagine a program that is in the middle of performing some operation when the machine it is running on loses power upon restart that program might need to know whether the operation it was performing succeeded succeeded partially or failed if a write ahead log is used the program can check this log and compare what it was supposed to be doing when it unexpectedly lost power to what was actually done on the basis of this comparison the program could decide to undo what it had started complete what it had started or keep things as they are wal allows updates of a database to be done in place another way to implement atomic updates is with shadow paging which is not in place the main advantage of doing updates in place is that it reduces the need to

various units of measurement are used usually based on the grazing equivalent of one adult cow or in some areas on that of one sheep many different schemes exist giving various values to the grazing effect of different types of animal livestock grazing comparison units are used for assessing the overall effect on grazing land of different types of animals or of mixtures of animals expressed either as a total for a whole field or farm or as units per hectare ha or acre for example using uk government livestock units lus from the 2003 scheme a particular pasture field might be able to support 15 adult cattle or 25 horses or 100 sheep in that scheme each of these would be regarded as being 15 lus or 1 5 lus per hectare about 0 6 lus per acre different species and breeds of livestock do not all graze in the same way and this is also taken into account when deciding the appropriate number of units for grazing land for example horses naturally graze unevenly eating short grass areas first and only grazing longer turf if there is insufficient short grass cattle graze longer grass preferentially tending to produce

to achieve this the learning algorithm is presented some training examples that demonstrate the intended relation of input and output values then the learner is supposed to approximate the correct output even for examples that have not been shown during training without any additional assumptions this problem cannot be solved exactly since unseen situations might have an arbitrary output value the kind of necessary assumptions about the nature of the target function are subsumed in the phrase inductive bias a classical example of an inductive bias is occam s razor assuming that the simplest consistent hypothesis about the target function is actually the best here consistent means that the hypothesis of the learner yields correct outputs for all of the examples that have been given to the algorithm approaches to a more formal definition of inductive bias are based on mathematical logic here the inductive bias is a logical formula that together with the training data logically entails the hypothesis generated by the learner however this strict formalism fails in many practical cases where the inductive bias can only be given as a rough description e g in the case of artificial neural networks or not at all the following

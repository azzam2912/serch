these processors pass work to one another through a reconfigurable interconnect of channels by harnessing a large number of processors working in parallel an mppa chip can accomplish more demanding tasks than conventional chips mppas are based on a software parallel programming model for developing high performance embedded system applications mppa is a mimd multiple instruction streams multiple data architecture with distributed memory accessed locally not shared globally each processor is strictly encapsulated accessing only its own code and memory point to point communication between processors is directly realized in the configurable interconnect the mppa s massive parallelism and its distributed memory mimd architecture distinguishes it from multicore and manycore architectures which have fewer processors and an smp or other shared memory architecture mainly intended for general purpose computing it s also distinguished from gpgpus with simd architectures used for hpc applications an mppa application is developed by expressing it as a hierarchical block diagram or workflow whose basic objects run in parallel each on their own processor likewise large data objects may be broken up and distributed into local memories with parallel access objects communicate over a parallel structure of dedicated channels the objective is to maximize aggregate throughput

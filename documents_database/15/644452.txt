there are only a few cif statements and they fall into one of two categories geometry or control the geometry statements are codice 1 to switch mask layers codice 2 to draw a rectangle codice 3 to draw a path codice 4 to draw a circle codice 5 to draw an arbitrary figure and codice 6 to draw a subroutine of other geometry statements the control statements are codice 7 to start the definition of a subroutine codice 8 to finish the definition of a subroutine codice 9 to delete the definition of subroutines codice 10 through codice 11 to include additional user specified information and codice 12 to terminate a cif file all of these keywords are usually abbreviated to one or two letters that are unique the codice 1 statement or the letter codice 14 sets the mask layer to be used for all subsequent geometry until the next such statement following the codice 1 keyword comes a single layer name parameter for example the command sets the layer to be the cmos contact cut see fig b 1 for some typical mos layer names the codice 2 statement or the letter codice 17 is the most commonly

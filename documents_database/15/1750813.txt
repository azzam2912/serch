it is a type of reversible deactivation radical polymerization the initiating materials for nitroxide mediated radical polymerization nmp are a family of compounds referred to as alkoxyamines an alkoxyamine can essentially be viewed as an alcohol bound to a secondary amine by an n o single bond the utility of this functional group is that under certain conditions homolysis of the c o bond can occur yielding a stable radical in the form of a 2 center 3 electron n o system and a carbon radical which serves as an initiator for radical polymerization for the purposes of nmp the r groups attached to the nitrogen are always bulky sterically hindering groups and the r group in the o position forms a stable radical generally is benzylic for polymerization to occur successfully nmp allows for excellent control of chain length and structure as well as a relative lack of true termination that allows polymerization to continue as long as there is available monomer because of this it is said to be living the living nature of nmp is due to the persistent radical effect pre the pre is a phenomenon observable in some radical systems which leads to the highly

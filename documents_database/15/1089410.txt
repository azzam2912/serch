she pioneered the concept of superoptimization and designed the synthesis kernel a small kernel with a unix compatibility layer that makes heavy use of self modifying code for efficiency after high school she was given a scholarship to the cooper union school of engineering in manhattan where she obtained a bachelor s and master s degree she went to obtain her ph d in computer science from columbia university in 1992 studying under professor calton pu in october 1992 massalin joined microunity as a research scientist where she became responsible for signal processing modules and software architecture massalin s first breakthrough product came while studying at columbia massalin developed synthesis an operating system kernel that allocated resources ran security and low level hardware interfaces and created executable code to improve performance synthesis optimized critical operating system code using run time information which was a new insight previous thought impractical to support synthesis massalin invented object like data structures called quajects which contain both data and code information massalin is still working on broadband microprocessors her parents were croatian refugees from trieste in the 1940s they moved astoria queens new york where her father became a construction worker in a 1996

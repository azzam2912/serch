they are named after ernst kummer who made a conjecture about the statistical properties of their arguments as complex numbers these sums were known and used before kummer in the theory of cyclotomy a kummer sum is therefore a finite sum taken over r modulo p where is a dirichlet character taking values in the cube roots of unity and where e x is the exponential function exp 2 ix given p of the required form there are two such characters together with the trivial character the cubic exponential sum k n p defined by is easily seen to be a linear combination of the kummer sums in fact it is 3 p where p is one of the gaussian periods for the subgroup of index 3 in the residues mod p under multiplication while the gauss sums are linear combinations of the p with cube roots of unity as coefficients however it is the gauss sum for which the algebraic properties hold such cubic exponential sums are also now called kummer sums it is known from the general theory of gauss sums that in fact the prime decomposition of g in the cyclotomic field it naturally lies in is

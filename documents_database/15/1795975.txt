microfabrication is the production of parts on the micro and nano scale typically on the surface of silicon wafers for the production of integrated circuits microelectromechanical systems mems solar cells and other devices photolithography makes this process possible through the combined use of hexamethyldisilazane hmds photoresist positive or negative spin coating photomask an exposure system and other various chemicals by carefully manipulating these factors it is possible to create nearly any geometry microstructure on the surface of a silicon wafer the chemical interaction between all the different components and the surface of the silicon wafer makes photolithography an interesting chemistry problem current science has been able to create features on the surface of silicon wafers between 1 and 100 m silicon wafers are cut from a solid ingot of nearly pure 99 9999999 silicon this is done through the process of czochralski growth which is diagramed in the adjacent image and produces a single intact diamond cubic silicon crystal due to its structure monocrystalline silicon is anisotropic which gives it different structural and electrical properties in different plane directions using miller indexes to denote the different plane orientations the 1 0 0 and the 1 1 1 faces are typically

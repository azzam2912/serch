essentially it says that any definable subclass of a set is a set some mathematicians call it the axiom schema of comprehension although others use that term for unrestricted comprehension discussed below because restricting comprehension avoided russell s paradox several mathematicians including zermelo fraenkel and g del considered it the most important axiom of set theory one instance of the schema is included for each formula in the language of set theory with free variables among x w w a so b does not occur in in the formal language of set theory the axiom schema is or in words note that there is one axiom for every such predicate thus this is an axiom schema to understand this axiom schema note that the set b must be a subset of a thus what the axiom schema is really saying is that given a set a and a predicate p we can find a subset b of a whose members are precisely the members of a that satisfy p by the axiom of extensionality this set is unique we usually denote this set using set builder notation as c a p c thus the essence of the axiom is the

within the core of the complex the chlorophyll and beta carotene pigments are mainly bound to the antenna proteins cp43 psbc and cp47 psbb which pass the excitation energy on to chlorophylls in the reaction centre proteins d1 qb psba and d2 qa psbd that bind all the redox active cofactors involved in the energy conversion process the psii oxygen evolving complex oec provides electrons to re reduce the psii reaction center and oxidizes 2 water molecules to recover its reduced initial state it consists of oee1 psbo oee2 psbp and oee3 psbq the remaining subunits in psii are of low molecular weight less than 10 kda and are involved in psii assembly stabilisation dimerization and photoprotection cytochrome b559 which forms part of the reaction centre core of psii is a heterodimer composed of one alpha subunit psbe one beta psbf subunit and a heme cofactor two histidine residues from each subunit coordinate the heme although cytochrome b559 is a redox active protein it is unlikely to be involved in the primary electron transport in psii due to its very slow photo oxidation and photo reduction kinetics instead cytochrome b559 could participate in a secondary electron transport pathway that helps

when modeling network data dynamics the traditional time series models such as an autoregressive moving average model arma p q are not appropriate this is because these models only provide a finite number of parameters in the model and thus interaction in a finite time window but the network data usually have a long range dependent temporal structure a self similar process is one way of modeling network data dynamics with such a long range correlation this article defines and describes network data transfer dynamics in the context of a self similar process properties of the process are shown and methods are given for graphing and estimating parameters modeling the self similarity of network data suppose formula 1 be a weakly stationary 2nd order stationary process with mean formula 2 variance formula 3 and autocorrelation function formula 4 assume that the autocorrelation function formula 4 has the form formula 6 as formula 7 where formula 8 and formula 9 is a slowly varying function at infinity that is formula 10 for all formula 11 for example formula 12 and formula 13 are slowly varying functions let formula 14 where formula 15 denote an aggregated point series over non overlapping blocks

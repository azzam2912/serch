a meta heuristic method is a method that sits on top of a local search algorithm to change its behavior guided local search builds up penalties during a search it uses penalties to help local search algorithms escape from local minimal and plateaus when the given local search algorithm settles in a local optimum gls modifies the objective function using a specific scheme explained below then the local search will operate using an augmented objective function which is designed to bring the search out of the local optimum the key is in the way that the objective function is modified to apply gls solution features must be defined for the given problem solution features are defined to distinguish between solutions with different characteristics so that regions of similarity around local optima can be recognized and avoided the choice of solution features depends on the type of problem and also to a certain extent on the local search algorithm for each feature formula 1 a cost function formula 2 is defined each feature is also associated with a penalty formula 3 initially set to 0 to record the number of occurrences of the feature in local minima the features and costs

jennison made a number of discoveries in the field of radio astronomy including the discovery of the double nature of radio source cygnus a 3c 405 0 with m k das gupta and the mapping of cassiopeia a with v latham jennison was born in grimsby england in 1922 his education was at clee grammar school for boys he was commissioned from raf aircrew to the technical branch signals where he developed radar and microwave systems using the magnetron in the 1950s he developed a new observable for obtaining information about visibility phases in an interferometer when delay errors are present called the closure phase he performed the first measurements of closure phase at optical wavelengths jennison saw greater potential for his technique in radio interferometry and proposed that it should be tested on a three element radio interferometer at jodrell bank in 1958 he successfully demonstrated its effectiveness at radio wavelengths but it only became widely used for long baseline radio interferometry in 1974 a minimum of three antennas are required this method was used for the first vlbi measurements and a modified form of this approach self calibration is still used today at radio optical and infrared wavelengths

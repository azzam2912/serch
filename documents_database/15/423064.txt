they were similar in appearance to many other gwr tank engines but smaller than the ubiquitous gwr 5700 class the nominally collett designed 5400 class had driving wheels for greater top speed with autocoaches and were all fitted with the required remote control gear for working the push pull autotrains they had a modern cab and a larger bunker they were frequently seen on inner suburban routes from paddington the 5400 class was related to the 2021 class saddle tank designed by william dean and built at wolverhampton railway works this was a light compact design with wheels itself derived from the smaller armstrong gwr 850 class dating from 1874 the class pioneer was not a new engine at all rather it was a 1930 rebuild of 2021 tank 2080 it merely had substitute larger wheels and splashers and a larger bunker whereas the new locos built from 1931 onwards had the rounded edge cab as well this cab style was to be fitted to all subsequent gwr pannier tank designs including the later derivations of the 5700 class despite its success the prototype had a short life as number 5400 lasting only two years before scrapping it was replaced

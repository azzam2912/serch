suppose the action space is continuous for simplicity suppose each action is chosen from an interval formula 13 in this context supermodularity of formula 10 implies that an increase in player formula 15 s choice formula 11 increases the marginal payoff formula 17 of action formula 18 for all other players formula 19 that is if any player formula 15 chooses a higher formula 11 all other players formula 19 have an incentive to raise their choices formula 18 too following the terminology of bulow geanakoplos and klemperer 1985 economists call this situation strategic complementarity because players strategies are complements to each other this is the basic property underlying examples of multiple equilibria in coordination games the opposite case of submodularity of formula 10 corresponds to the situation of strategic substitutability an increase in formula 11 lowers the marginal payoff to all other player s choices formula 18 so strategies are substitutes that is if formula 15 chooses a higher formula 11 other players have an incentive to pick a lower formula 18 for example bulow et al consider the interactions of many imperfectly competitive firms when an increase in output by one firm raises the marginal revenues of the

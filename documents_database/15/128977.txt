monads are used in the theory of pairs of adjoint functors and they generalize closure operators on partially ordered sets to arbitrary categories a monad is a certain type of endofunctor for example if formula 1 and formula 2 are a pair of adjoint functors with formula 1 left adjoint to formula 2 then the composition formula 5 is a monad if formula 1 and formula 2 are inverse functors the corresponding monad is the identity functor in general adjunctions are not equivalences they relate categories of different natures the monad theory matters as part of the effort to capture what it is that adjunctions preserve the other half of the theory of what can be learned likewise from consideration of formula 8 is discussed under the dual theory of comonads throughout this article formula 9 denotes a category a monad on formula 9 consists of an endofunctor formula 11 together with two natural transformations formula 12 where formula 13 denotes the identity functor on formula 9 and formula 15 where formula 16 is the functor formula 17 from formula 9 to formula 9 these are required to fulfill the following conditions sometimes called coherence conditions we can rewrite these

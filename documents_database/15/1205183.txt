the word ablation stems from the latin word ablatus meaning carried away in most cases however ablative brain surgery doesn t involve removing brain tissue but rather destroying tissue and leaving it in place the lesions it causes are irreversible there are some target nuclei for ablative surgery and deep brain stimulation those nuclei are the motor thalamus the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus ablative brain surgery was first introduced by pierre flourens 1774 1867 a french physiologist he removed different parts of the nervous system from animals and observed what effects were caused by the removal of certain parts for example if an animal could not move its arm after a certain part was removed it was assumed that the region would control arm movements the method of removal of part of the brain was termed experimental ablation with the use of experimental ablation flourens claimed to find the area of the brain that controlled heart rate and breathing ablative brain surgery is also often used as a research tool in neurobiology for example by ablating specific brain regions and observing differences in animals subjected to behavioral tests the functions of all the removed areas may be inferred

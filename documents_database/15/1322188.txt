sbc is a digital audio encoder and decoder used to transfer data to bluetooth audio output devices like headphones or loudspeakers it can also be used on the internet it was designed to obtain a reasonably good audio quality at medium bit rates while keeping low computational complexity having bluetooth bandwidth limitations and processing power in mind as of a2dp version 1 3 the low complexity subband coding remains the default codec and its implementation is mandatory for devices supporting that profile but vendors are free to add their own codecs to match their needs sbc supports mono and stereo streams certain sampling frequencies up to 48 khz the codec does not have bitrate limitations although manufacturers usually use maximum bit rates of 342 kbit s for mono and 345 kbit s for stereo streams it uses 4 or 8 subbands an adaptive bit allocation algorithm in combination with an adaptive block pcm quantizer frans de bont has based the sbc audio codec on his earlier work and in parts on the mpeg 1 audio layer ii standard in addition the sbc is based on the algorithms described in the ep 0400755b1 the patent owners wrote that they allow the

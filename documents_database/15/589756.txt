the game is not to be confused with square s tom sawyer inexplicably the level order is changed in the english version perhaps so as not to confuse players by starting with the rafting stage the japanese original s level 5 the pirate ship is the english version s level 1 both making the beginning of the game much more difficult and making the plot incohesive tom sawyer is dreaming and in this dream he must save becky from injun joe travelling through six stages to get to her he encounters various creatures including a giant octopus a giant alligator in the mississippi river ghosts and ghouls in a haunted house and a dragon he wakes up from the dream and finds himself in his missouri classroom where he finds one feather on his desk that had belonged to injun joe it is never made clear whether or not the events of the game were real

the trench reaches a depth of about in contrast with the average depth of the south china sea of about it is created by subduction in which the sunda plate part of eurasian plate is subducting under the philippine mobile belt producing this almost n s trending trench the convergent boundary is terminated to the north by the taiwan collision zone and to the south by the mindoro terrane sulu palawan block colliding with sw luzon it is an area pervaded by negative gravity anomalies the manila trench is associated with frequent earthquakes and the subduction zone is responsible for the belt of volcanoes on the west side of the philippine island of luzon which includes mount pinatubo convergence between the philippine mobile belt and the sunda plate have been estimated using gps measurements and this value ranges from 50 mm yr in taiwan to 100 mm yr near n luzon and 50 mm yr near zambales and 20 mm yr near mindoro island plate locking between the sunda plate and luzon is about 1 coupled almost unlocked as determined by elastic block models suggesting that the trench absorbs the philippine mobile belt eurasian plate convergence the manila trench was

it is used when a slope is too steep or when there is no alternative method of preventing soil erosion the most common crop choices for strip cropping are closely sown crops such as hay wheat or other forages which are alternated with strips of row crops such as corn soybeans cotton or sugar beets the forages serve primarily as cover crops in certain systems strips in particularly eroded areas are used to grow permanent protective vegetation in most systems however all strips are alternated on an annual basis widths of strips are determined by a number of factors with the two most important being the average wind velocity in a specific site and the features of the slope particularly the gradient each strip typically ranges from 25 feet 7 6 m to 75 feet 23 m in width but certain conditions may necessitate widths outside of this range a minimum width of 50 feet 15 m is ideal for the use of most farm equipment the growing of a cultivated crop as corn in strips alternating with strips of a sod forming crop as hay arranged to follow an approximate contour of the land and minimize erosion strip cropping

those compounds come in a form of dyes and pigments the type of a colorant is chosen based on the type of a polymeric resin that needs to be colored dyes are usually used with polycarbonates polystyrene and acrylic polymers pigments are better suited for use with polyolefins the colorant must satisfy various constraints for example the compound must be chemically compatible with the base resin be a suitable match with a color standard see e g international color consortium be chemically stable which in this case means being able to survive the stresses and processing temperature heat stability in the fabrication process and be durable enough to match the life duration of the product the parameters of the compound vary with a desired effect which may include the final product being pearlescent metallic fluorescent phosphorescent thermochromic or photochromic the exact chemical formula will furthermore depend on the type of application general purpose food contact item toy package subject to coneg etc different methods for delivering colorants in molding plastics include masterbatches concentrates a method which which involves a concentrate being separated into resin cube blends salt pepper mixes dry blending which are natural polymers already sprayed into natural polymers

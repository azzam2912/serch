it was designed and built by millenworks under contract to the tank automotive research development and engineering center textron marine and land systems will use the platform for further development of component technologies the vehicle was a possible joint light tactical vehicle candidate but was not selected the luv has a very revolutionary drivetrain layout the front wheels of the vehicle are powered by an electric motor located under the hood while the rear wheels are powered by a separate diesel electric parallel hybrid consisting of a second electric motor as well as a standard nato m16 diesel motor this eliminates the driveshaft common on most 4wd vehicles and reduces the chances of an ied mobility kill since a hit in either the front or rear will not completely incapacitate the vehicle eliminating the driveshaft also allows for greater ground clearance which combined with a v hull design improves survivability from land mines allowing the blast more space to dissipate the vehicle s other safety features include scalable armor protection and a quick release windshield for emergency egress the front and rear sub frames are identical along with interchangeable suspension corners which reduces the number of required spare parts the

the technology is used for communication systems such as telemetry weather balloon radiosondes caller id garage door openers and low frequency radio transmission in the vlf and elf bands the simplest fsk is binary fsk bfsk bfsk uses a pair of discrete frequencies to transmit binary 0s and 1s information with this scheme the 1 is called the mark frequency and the 0 is called the space frequency reference implementations of fsk modems exist and are documented in detail the demodulation of a binary fsk signal can be done using the goertzel algorithm very efficiently even on low power microcontrollers in principle fsk can be implemented by using completely independent free running oscillators and switching between them at the beginning of each symbol period in general independent oscillators will not be at the same phase and therefore the same amplitude at the switch over instant causing sudden discontinuities in the transmitted signal in practice many fsk transmitters use only a single oscillator and the process of switching to a different frequency at the beginning of each symbol period preserves the phase the elimination of discontinuities in the phase and therefore elimination of sudden changes in amplitude reduces sideband power reducing

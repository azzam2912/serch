the test uses an in vitro diagnostic system developed at inserm the universit paris descartes and assistance publique h pitaux de paris ap hp in order to isolate cancer cells from blood without loss and identify them through a diagnostic cytopathology based approach a 1 ml sample of blood will typically contain 5 to 10 million leukocytes 5 billion erythrocytes and a small number of circulating rare cells including the diagnostic problem is to find and identify the rare ctcs among the abundant other cells in a given blood sample the iset technology is based on the observation that tumor cells of all types of solid cancers are larger than blood cells leukocytes and erythrocytes however blood filtration to recover rare circulating tumor cells without loss and without cell damage is a challenge the iset test uses a specially designed device and specially designed filters to allow the elimination of all erythrocytes and most leukocytes from the sample making the subsequent cytopathology process significantly easier and more accurate the iset technology was first reported in 2000 in the american journal of pathology by the team of professor patrizia paterlini br chot since the first report in 2000 over 80 scientific

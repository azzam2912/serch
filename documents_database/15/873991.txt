a visual sensor network may be a type of wireless sensor network and much of the theory and application of the latter applies to the former the network generally consists of the cameras themselves which have some local image processing communication and storage capabilities and possibly one or more central computers where image data from multiple cameras is further processed and fused this processing may however simply take place in a distributed fashion across the cameras and their local controllers visual sensor networks also provide some high level services to the user so that the large amount of data can be distilled into information of interest using specific queries the primary difference between visual sensor networks and other types of sensor networks is the nature and volume of information the individual sensors acquire unlike most sensors cameras are directional in their field of view and they capture a large amount of visual information which may be partially processed independently of data from other cameras in the network alternatively one may say that while most sensors measure some value such as temperature or pressure visual sensors measure patterns in light of this communication in visual sensor networks differs substantially from traditional

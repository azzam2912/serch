this type of connection is very important in sound recording and production because it allows the use of long cables while reducing susceptibility to external noise caused by electromagnetic interference balanced connections typically use shielded twisted pair cable and three conductor connectors the connectors are usually 3 pin xlr or trs phone connectors when used in this manner each cable carries one channel therefore stereo audio for example would require two of them many microphones operate at low voltage levels and some with high output impedance hi z which makes long microphone cables especially susceptible to electromagnetic interference microphone interconnections are therefore a common application for a balanced interconnection which cancels out most of this induced noise if the power amplifiers of a public address system are located at any distance from the mixing console it is also normal to use balanced lines for the signal paths from the mixer to these amplifiers many other components such as graphic equalizers and effects units have balanced inputs and outputs to allow this in recording and for short cable runs in general a compromise is necessary between the noise reduction given by balanced lines and the cost introduced by the extra circuitry

here i am undertaking a description of our native thebaid which i have just visited around vologda and belozersk secular people are unlikely to know it whereas many people have heard about the thebaid of egypt and have read in paterikon about the exploits of the great greek fathers who lighted up in the harsh deserts of the scetis and the palestine in a space of more than 500 miles from the lavra to beloozero and further it was like one continuous area studded with hermitages and desert hermits which lay people were then to settle and build their homes where there were only cells st sergius is the head of all stands on the southern edge of this wonderful area and sends pupils and companions into the thebaid and st cyril on the other side of the area accepts newcomers sometimes northern thebaid is more narrowly referred to as an extensive neighborhood of the st cyril belozersk monastery the term northern thebaid is also used as a brand similar to the concept of the russian north

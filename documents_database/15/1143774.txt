this protein domain contains from 40 to 60 amino acids many proteins containing a ring finger play a key role in the ubiquitination pathway zinc finger znf domains are relatively small protein motifs that bind one or more zinc atoms and which usually contain multiple finger like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule they bind dna rna protein and or lipid substrates their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and of the linker between fingers as well as on the higher order structures and the number of fingers znf domains are often found in clusters where fingers can have different binding specificities there are many superfamilies of znf motifs varying in both sequence and structure they display considerable versatility in binding modes even between members of the same class e g some bind dna others protein suggesting that znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions for example znf containing proteins function in gene transcription translation mrna trafficking cytoskeleton organisation epithelial development cell adhesion protein folding chromatin remodelling and zinc sensing zinc binding motifs are stable structures and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target some zn

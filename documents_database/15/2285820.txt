the equation reads as with initial conditions where formula 3 measures the density of white dwarf formula 4 is the non dimensional radial distance from the center and formula 5 is a constant which is related to the density of the white dwarf at the center when formula 6 this equation reduces to lane emden equation with polytropic index formula 7 in the lane emden equation the density at the centre can be scaled out of the equation but for white dwarfs the central density is directly tied to the equation from the quantum statistics of a completely degenerate electron gas all the lowest quantum states are occupied the pressure and the density of a white dwarf is given by where where formula 10 is the mean molecular weight of the gas when this is substituted into the hydrostatic equilibrium equation where formula 12 is the gravitational constant and formula 13 is the radial distance we get and letting formula 15 we have if we denote the density at the origin as formula 17 then a non dimensional scale gives where formula 20 in other words once the above equation is solved the density is given by in the neighborhood

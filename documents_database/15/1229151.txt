due to electric field screening the potential energy becomes much more sharply exponentially peaked around the equilibrium position of the atom and electrons become localized and can no longer conduct a current in a semiconductor at low temperatures each site atom or group of atoms contains a certain number of electrons and is electrically neutral for an electron to move away from a site requires a certain amount of energy as the electron is normally pulled back toward the now positively charged site by coulomb forces if the temperature is high enough that formula 1 of energy is available per site the boltzmann distribution predicts that a significant fraction of electrons will have enough energy to escape their site leaving an electron hole behind and becoming conduction electrons that conduct current the result is that at low temperatures a material is insulating and at high temperatures the material conducts while the conduction in an n p type doped semiconductor sets in at high temperatures because the conduction valence band is partially filled with electrons holes with the original band structure being unchanged the situation is different in the case of the mott transition where the band structure itself changes mott

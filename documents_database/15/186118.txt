it is a water insoluble pale yellow oil with an almond like odor it freezes to give greenish yellow crystals it is produced on a large scale from benzene as a precursor to aniline in the laboratory it is occasionally used as a solvent especially for electrophilic reagents nitrobenzene is prepared by nitration of benzene with a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid water and nitric acid this mixture is sometimes called mixed acid the production of nitrobenzene is one of the most dangerous processes conducted in the chemical industry because of the exothermicity of the reaction h 117 kj mol world capacity for nitrobenzene in 1985 was about 1 7 10 tonnes the nitration process involves formation of the nitronium ion no followed by an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction of it with benzene the nitronium ion is generated by the reaction of nitric acid and an acidic dehydration agent typically sulfuric acid approximately 95 of nitrobenzene is consumed in the production of aniline aniline is a precursor to urethane polymers rubber chemicals pesticides dyes particularly azo dyes explosives and pharmaceuticals nitrobenzene is also used to mask unpleasant odors in shoe and floor polishes leather dressings paint solvents and other materials

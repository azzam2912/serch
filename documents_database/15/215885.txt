it is of special importance in safety critical gps applications such as in aviation or marine navigation gps does not include any internal information about the integrity of its signals it is possible for a gps satellite to broadcast slightly incorrect information that will cause navigation information to be incorrect but there is no way for the receiver to determine this using the standard techniques raim uses redundant signals to produce several gps position fixes and compare them and a statistical function determines whether or not a fault can be associated with any of the signals raim is considered available if 24 gps satellites or more are operative if the number of gps satellites is 23 or fewer raim availability must be checked using approved ground based prediction software several gps related systems also provide integrity signals separate from gps among these is the waas system which uses separate signals broadcast from different satellites to indicate these problems directly raim detects faults with redundant gps pseudorange measurements that is when more satellites are available than needed to produce a position fix the extra pseudoranges should all be consistent with the computed position a pseudorange that differs significantly from the expected

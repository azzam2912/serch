it focuses on how the atomic orbitals of the dissociated atoms combine to give individual chemical bonds when a molecule is formed in contrast molecular orbital theory has orbitals that cover the whole molecule in 1916 g n lewis proposed that a chemical bond forms by the interaction of two shared bonding electrons with the representation of molecules as lewis structures in 1927 the heitler london theory was formulated which for the first time enabled the calculation of bonding properties of the hydrogen molecule h based on quantum mechanical considerations specifically walter heitler determined how to use schr dinger s wave equation 1926 to show how two hydrogen atom wavefunctions join together with plus minus and exchange terms to form a covalent bond he then called up his associate fritz london and they worked out the details of the theory over the course of the night later linus pauling used the pair bonding ideas of lewis together with heitler london theory to develop two other key concepts in vb theory resonance 1928 and orbital hybridization 1930 according to charles coulson author of the noted 1952 book valence this period marks the start of modern valence bond theory as contrasted with

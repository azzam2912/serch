these are flattened vesicles sacs packed into a continuous layer just under the membrane and supporting it typically forming a flexible pellicle thin skin in dinoflagellates they often form armor plates alveolates have mitochondria with tubular cristae ridges and their flagellae or cilia have a distinct structure almost all sequenced mitochondrial genomes of ciliates and apicomplexia are linear the mitochondrial genome of babesia microti is circular this species is also now known not to belong to either of the genera babesia or theileria and a new genus will have to be created for it alveolata comprises around 9 major and minor groups which are very diverse in form and are known to be related by various ultrastructural and genetic similarities the acavomonidia and colponemidia were previously grouped together as colponemids a taxon now split based on ultrastructural analysis the acavomonidia are closer to the dinoflagellate perkinsid group than the colponemidia are as such the informal term colponemids as it stands currently covers two non sister groups within alveolata the acavomonidia and the colponemidia the apicomplexa and dinoflagellates may be more closely related to each other than to the ciliates both have plastids and most share a bundle or cone of

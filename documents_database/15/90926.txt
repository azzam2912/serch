such a tensor can be defined as a linear function which maps an m n tuple of m one forms and n vectors to a scalar consider the following octet of related tensors the first one is covariant the last one contravariant and the remaining ones mixed notationally these tensors differ from each other by the covariance contravariance of their indices a given contravariant index of a tensor can be lowered using the metric tensor g and a given covariant index can be raised using the inverse metric tensor g thus g could be called the index lowering operator and g the index raising operator generally the covariant metric tensor contracted with a tensor of type m n yields a tensor of type m 1 n 1 whereas its contravariant inverse contracted with a tensor of type m n yields a tensor of type m 1 n 1 as an example a mixed tensor of type 1 2 can be obtained by raising an index of a covariant tensor of type 0 3 where formula 4 is the same tensor as formula 5 because with kronecker acting here like an identity matrix likewise raising an index of the metric tensor

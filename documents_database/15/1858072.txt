triethylphosphine oxide etpo tepo is used as a probe molecule and systems are evaluated by p nmr spectroscopy gutmann 1975 used p nmr spectroscopy to parameterize lewis acidity of solvents by acceptor numbers beckett 1996 recognised its more generally utility and adapted the procedure so that it could be easily applied to molecular species when dissolved in weakly lewis acidic solvents the term gutmann beckett method was first used in chemical literature in 2007 prof dr viktor gutmann 1921 98 was an eminent austrian chemist see renowned for his work on non aqueous solvents prof michael a beckett is a former head of the school of chemistry at bangor university uk the p chemical shift of etpo is sensitive to chemical environment but can usually be found between 40 and 100 ppm the o atom in etpo is a lewis base and its interaction with lewis acid sites causes deshielding of the adjacent p atom gutmann described an acceptor number an scale for solvent lewis acidity with two reference points relating to the p nmr chemical shift of etpo in the weakly lewis acidic solvent hexane 41 0 ppm an 0 and in the strongly lewis acidic solvent sbcl 86

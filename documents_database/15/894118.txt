glass etching comprises the techniques of creating art on the surface of glass by applying acidic caustic or abrasive substances traditionally this is done after the glass is blown or cast although mold etching has replaced some forms of surface etching the removal of minute amounts of glass causes the characteristic rough surface and translucent quality of frosted glass various techniques are used to achieve an etched surface in glass whether for artistic effect or simply to create a translucent surface acid etching is done using hexafluorosilicic acid hsif which when anhydrous is colourless the acid is prepared by dissolving silica in a mixture of hydroelectric acid hydrochloric acid quartz powder calcium fluoride and concentrated sulfuric acid derived after heating glass etching cream is used by hobbyists as it is generally easier to use than acid available from art supply stores it consists of fluoride compounds such as hydrogen fluoride and sodium fluoride which are still very dangerous as the types of acids used in this process are extremely hazardous see hydrofluoric acid for safety abrasive methods have gained popularity abrasive blasting sandblasting is another common technique for creating patterns in glassware creating a frosted look to the glass it

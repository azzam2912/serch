air conditioners space heaters refrigerators water heaters etc are examples of devices that perform temperature control these are often broadly classified as thermostatically controlled loads tcls a home thermostat is an example of a closed control loop it constantly measures the current room temperature and compares this to a desired user defined set point and controls a heater and or air conditioner to increase or decrease the temperature to meet the desired set point a simple low cost cheap thermostat merely switches the heater or air conditioner either on or off and temporary overshoot and undershoot of the desired average temperature must be expected a more expensive thermostat varies the amount of heat or cooling provided by the heater or cooler depending on the difference between the required temperature the setpoint and the actual temperature this minimizes over undershoot this method is called proportional control further enhancements using the accumulated error signal integral and the rate at which the error is changing derivative are used to form more complex pid controllers which is the form usually seen in industrial settings an object s or space s temperature increases when heat energy moves into it increasing the average kinetic energy of

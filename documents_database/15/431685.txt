the anion has the bent shape of the ozone molecule inorganic ozonides are formed by burning potassium rubidium or caesium in ozone or by treating the alkali metal hydroxide with ozone if potassium is left undisturbed in air for years it accumulates a covering of superoxide and ozonide they are very sensitive explosives that have to be handled at low temperatures in an atmosphere consisting of an inert gas lithium and sodium ozonide are extremely unstable and must be prepared by low temperature ion exchange starting from cso sodium ozonide which is prone to decomposition into naoh and was previously thought to be impossible to obtain in pure form however with the help of cryptands and methylamine pure may be obtained as red crystals isostructural to ionic ozonides are being investigated as sources of oxygen in chemical oxygen generators tetramethylammonium ozonide which can be made by a metathesis reaction with caesium ozonide in liquid ammonia is stable up to 348k phosphite ozonides ro po are used in the production of singlet oxygen they are made by ozonizing a phosphite ester in dichloromethane at low temperatures and decompose to yield singlet oxygen and a phosphate ester organic ozonides are called molozonides

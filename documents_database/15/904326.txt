a person born again in christ does not merit of his own virtue but the virtues of christ are applied to his work therefore it is god crowning his works congruent merit is the equivalent of condign merit but applied to an unregenerated person by the goodness of god in the first case god has obligated himself by his promises to reward his son s merits in his children in the second case god bestows his merit to those who seek him in faith not from obligation but from mercy and love in neither case is god obligated by the human in the first case god is obligated by his promises to those who love him in the second god is obligated by his love and mercy to his creatures who obey him in some formulations of calvinism condign merit is not needed because jesus atonement is a congruent merit given by god condign merit supposes an equality between service and return it is measured by commutative justice and thus gives a real claim to a reward in the name of christ congruous merit owing to its inadequacy and the lack of intrinsic proportion between the service and the recompense

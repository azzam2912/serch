these matrices generalize permutation matrices and arise naturally when using dodgson condensation to compute a determinant they are also closely related to the six vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions from statistical mechanics they were first defined by william mills david robbins and howard rumsey in the former context an example of an alternating sign matrix that is not also a permutation matrix is the alternating sign matrix conjecture states that the number of formula 2 alternating sign matrices is the first few terms in this sequence for n 0 1 2 3 are this conjecture was first proved by doron zeilberger in 1992 in 1995 greg kuperberg gave a short proof based on the yang baxter equation for the six vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions that uses a determinant calculation due to anatoli izergin in 2001 a razumov and y stroganov conjectured a connection between o 1 loop model fully packed loop model fpl and asms this conjecture was proved in 2010 by cantini and sportiello

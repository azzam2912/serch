skyrmions named after british physicist tony hilton royle skyrme can be formed in magnetic materials in their bulk such as in mnsi or in magnetic thin films they can be achiral fig 1 a or chiral fig 1 b in nature and may exist both as dynamic excitations or stable or metastable states although the broad lines defining magnetic skyrmions have been established de facto there exist a variety of interpretations with subtle differences most descriptions include the notion of topology a categorization of shapes and the way in which an object is laid out in space using a continuous field approximation as defined in micromagnetics descriptions generally specify a non zero integer value of the topological index not to be confused with the chemistry meaning of topological index this value is sometimes also referred to as the winding number the topological charge although it is unrelated to charge in the electrical sense the topological quantum number although it is unrelated to quantum mechanics or quantum mechanical phenomena notwithstanding the quantization of the index values or more loosely as the skyrmion number the topological index of the field can be described mathematically as where formula 1 is the topological index

he worked in both pure mathematics and mathematics for physics he made important contributions to optics classical mechanics and algebra although hamilton was not a physicist he regarded himself as a pure mathematician his work was of major importance to physics particularly his reformulation of newtonian mechanics now called hamiltonian mechanics this work has proven central to the modern study of classical field theories such as electromagnetism and to the development of quantum mechanics in pure mathematics he is best known as the inventor of quaternions william rowan hamilton s scientific career included the study of geometrical optics classical mechanics adaptation of dynamic methods in optical systems applying quaternion and vector methods to problems in mechanics and in geometry development of theories of conjugate algebraic couple functions in which complex numbers are constructed as ordered pairs of real numbers solvability of polynomial equations and general quintic polynomial solvable by radicals the analysis on fluctuating functions and the ideas from fourier analysis linear operators on quaternions and proving a result for linear operators on the space of quaternions which is a special case of the general theorem which today is known as the cayley hamilton theorem hamilton also invented icosian calculus

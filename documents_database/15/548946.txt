the term rng pronounced rung is meant to suggest that it is a ring without i i e without the requirement for an identity element there is no consensus in the community as to whether the existence of a multiplicative identity must be one of the ring axioms see the history section of the article on rings the term rng was coined to alleviate this ambiguity when people want to refer explicitly to a ring without the axiom of multiplicative identity a number of algebras of functions considered in analysis are not unital for instance the algebra of functions decreasing to zero at infinity especially those with compact support on some non compact space formally a rng is a set r with two binary operations called addition and multiplication such that rng homomorphisms are defined in the same way as ring homomorphisms except that the requirement is dropped that is a rng homomorphism is a function from one rng to another such that for all x and y in r all rings are rngs a simple example of a rng that is not a ring is given by the even integers with the ordinary addition and multiplication of integers another

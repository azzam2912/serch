these coefficients are natural numbers which the littlewood richardson rule describes as counting certain skew tableaux they occur in many other mathematical contexts for instance as multiplicity in the decomposition of tensor products of irreducible representations of general linear groups or related groups like the special linear and special unitary groups or in the decomposition of certain induced representations in the representation theory of the symmetric group or in the area of algebraic combinatorics dealing with young tableaux and symmetric polynomials littlewood richardson coefficients depend on three partitions say formula 1 of which formula 2 and formula 3 describe the schur functions being multiplied and formula 4 gives the schur function of which this is the coefficient in the linear combination in other words they are the coefficients formula 5 such that the littlewood richardson rule states that formula 5 is equal to the number of littlewood richardson tableaux of skew shape formula 8 and of weight formula 3 the littlewood richardson rule was first stated by but though they claimed it as a theorem they only proved it in some fairly simple special cases there are now several short proofs of the rule such as and using bender knuth

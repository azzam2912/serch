south of this southern segment a gap without volcanic activity separates the southern volcanic zone from the austral volcanic zone the volcanic field extends from the western side of the channel north over the head of the channel towards lake risopatr n with one isolated cone found on the eastern side of the channel the town of puyuhuapi is located approximately halfway through the field the cones on the western side are a separate group from the ones towards the north and associated with two different eruption fissures but both fissures are associated with the liqui e ofqui fault zone the basement on which the field is built is formed by rocks of the patagonian batholith the field is formed by cinder cones while the isolated centre is formed by a fissure fed lava flow the southernmost cone is also the largest with a diametre of and features a high secondary cone nested within its wide summit crater the eruption fissures also generated lava flows the cones formed afterwards over the fissures on the northern end of the puyuhuapi channel the eruptions filled part of the channel and separated lake risopatr n from it this activity may have been phreatomagmatic

it is a colorless flammable gas or refrigerated liquid with a faintly sweet odor chloroethane is produced by hydrochlorination of ethylene at various times in the past chloroethane has also been produced from ethanol and hydrochloric acid or from ethane and chlorine but these routes are no longer economical some chloroethane is generated as a byproduct of polyvinyl chloride production should demand for chloroethane continue to fall to the point where making it for its own sake is not economical this may become the leading source of the chemical ethyl chloride is an inexpensive ethylating agent it reacts with aluminium metal to give ethylaluminium sesquichloride a precursor to polymers and other useful organoaluminium compounds chloroethane is used to convert cellulose to ethylcellulose a thickening agent and binder in paints cosmetics and similar products like other chlorinated hydrocarbons chloroethane has been used as a refrigerant an aerosol spray propellant an anesthetic and a blowing agent for foam packaging for a time it was used as a promoter chemical in the aluminium chloride catalyzed process to produce ethylbenzene the precursor for styrene monomer at present though it is not widely used in any of these roles beginning in 1922 and continuing through

the mechanism of fragmentation involves the absorption by a given ion of multiple infrared photons the parent ion becomes excited into more energetic vibrational states until a bond s is broken resulting in gas phase fragments of the parent ion in the case of powerful laser pulses the dissociation proceeds via inner valence ionization of electrons irmpd is most often used in fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry by applying intense tunable ir lasers like ir opos or ir free electron lasers the wavelength dependence of the irmpd yield can be studied this infrared photodissociation spectroscopy allows for the measurement of vibrational spectra of unstable species that can only be prepared in the gas phase such species include molecular ions but also neutral species like metal clusters that can be gently ionized after interaction with the ir light for their mass spectrometric detection due to the relatively large differences in ir absorption frequencies that are due to different resonance frequencies for molecules containing different isotopes this technique has been suggested as a way to perform isotope separation with difficult to separate isotopes in a single pass for example molecules of uf containing u 235 might be ionized completely as

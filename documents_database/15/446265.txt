the wall plug efficiency is the product of the following three efficiencies the gain medium is nitrogen molecules in the gas phase the nitrogen laser is a three level laser in contrast to more typical four level lasers the upper laser level of nitrogen is directly pumped imposing no speed limits on the pump pumping is normally provided by direct electron impact the electrons must have sufficient energy or they will fail to excite the upper laser level typically reported optimum values are in the range of 80 to 100 ev per torr cm pressure of nitrogen gas there is a 40 ns upper limit of laser lifetime at low pressures and the lifetime becomes shorter as the pressure increases the lifetime is only 1 to 2 ns at 1 atmosphere in general the strongest lines are at 337 1 nm wavelength in the ultraviolet other lines have been reported at 357 6 nm also ultraviolet this information refers to the second positive system of molecular nitrogen which is by far the most common no vibration of the two nitrogen atoms is involved because the atom atom distance does not change with the electronic transition the rotation needs to change

a two stage process converts an input of 8 bits into a 10 bit code with particular desirable properties in the first stage the first bit is untransformed and each subsequent bit is either xor or xnor transformed against the previous bit the encoder chooses between xor and xnor by determining which will result in the fewest transitions the ninth bit encodes which operation was used in the second stage the first eight bits are optionally inverted to even out the balance of ones and zeros and therefore the sustained average dc level the tenth bit encodes whether this inversion took place the 10 bit tmds symbol can represent either an 8 bit data value during normal data transmission or 2 bits of control signals during screen blanking of the 1 024 possible combinations of the 10 transmitted bits control data is encoded using the values in the table below control data characters are designed to have a large number 7 of transitions to help the receiver synchronize its clock with the transmitter clock on channel 0 the c0 and c1 bits encode the hsync and vsync signals on the other channels they encode the ctl0 through ctl3 signals which

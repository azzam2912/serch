it is very similar in structure to matrine which has one less oxygen atom oxymatrine has a variety of effects in vitro and in animal models including protection against apoptosis tumor and fibrotic tissue development and inflammation furthermore oxymatrine has been shown to decrease cardiac ischemia decreased blood perfusion myocardial injury arrhythmias irregular heartbeats and improve heart failure by increasing cardiac function recent research has shown that oxymatrine prevents cardiac fibrosis in rats the development of fibrotic tissue in the heart occurs when fibroblasts produce excessive amounts of collagen particularly types i and iii which accumulate and deposit in the heart the excessive transformation to fibrotic tissue negatively affects the function and structure of the heart additionally excessive amounts of collagen in the ventricles lead to alterations in gene expression deposition of extracellular matrix wall thickening and ventricular remodeling in a manner that promotes dysfunction the mechanism by which oxymatrine may inhibit fibrosis is still unidentified one theory that has been proposed is that oxymatrine inhibits a key signaling pathway involved in collagen production one of the main signaling receptors involved in this pathway is the tgf 1 co receptor complex of type i and type ii receptors which acts

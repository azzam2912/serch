the molecule consists of two cyclopentadienyl rings bound on opposite sides of a central iron atom it is an orange solid with a camphor like odor that sublimes above room temperature and is soluble in most organic solvents it is remarkable for its stability it is unaffected by air water strong bases and can be heated to 400 c without decomposition in oxidizing conditions it can reversibly react with strong acids to form the ferrocenium cation the rapid growth of organometallic chemistry is often attributed to the excitement arising from the discovery of ferrocene and its many analogues metallocenes ferrocene was discovered by accident thrice the first known synthesis may have been made in the late 1940s by unknown researchers at union carbide who tried to pass hot cyclopentadiene vapor through an iron pipe the vapor reacted with the pipe wall creating a yellow sludge that clogged the pipe years later a sample of the sludge that had been saved was obtained and analyzed by e brimm shortly after reading kealy and pauson s article and was found to consist of ferrocene the second time was around 1950 when s miller j tebboth and j tremaine researchers at british oxygen

the craton contains archaean rocks 2 8 to 3 7 billion years old during the carboniferous the craton was rifted apart by the dnieper donets rift as a result geomorphologically the cratonic area is split by the donbass fold belt also known as a part of the large pripyat dniepr donets aulacogen which transects sarmatia dividing it into the ukrainian massif or shield on the southwest and the voronezh massif to the northeast sarmatia is made up of several once independent archaean land masses that formed respectively at 3 7 2 9 3 6 2 8 3 2 3 0 and 2 7 2 6 ga these are separated by a series of 2 2 2 1 ga orogenic belts sarmatia s northwestern margin has an extensive continental magmatic arc dating back to 2 0 1 95 ga the ukrainian shield and voronezh massif are the exposed areas of the sarmatian craton the craton can be divided into arachaean 3 7 2 7 terranes separated by palaeoproterozoic c 2 2 2 1 ga and 2 0 1 9 ga belts the osnitsk mikashevichi belt in the northwest is wide and extends for more than from the trans european suture zone

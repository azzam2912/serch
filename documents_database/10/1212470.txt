a photonics mast replaces the mechanical line of sight viewing system with digital equipment similar to a digital camera array and it has fewer locational and dimensional constraints than a traditional periscope unlike a periscope it need not be located directly above its user and it requires only a small pressure hull penetration for cabling this allows the photonics mast to fit entirely within the sail of the submarine and means the control room need not be placed directly below the sail a photonics mast operates by rising above the water in a manner similar to a telescoping car antenna and provides information through an array of sensors such as high definition low light and thermographic cameras images and information can appear on display panels for analysis the photonics mast can also support the navigation electronic warfare and communications functions of a conventional optical periscope mast the royal navy tested an optronic mast on the in 1998 boats of the currently under construction each have two optronic masts manufactured by thales optronics in 2004 the united states navy began fitting photonics masts to s according to the us navy in virginia class boats traditional periscopes have been supplanted by two

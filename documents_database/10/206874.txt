the term was coined in 1949 by e l kaufman et al and is derived from the latin adjective subitus meaning sudden and captures a feeling of immediately knowing how many items lie within the visual scene when the number of items present falls within the subitizing range number judgments for larger set sizes are referred to either as estimating if insufficient time is available for observers to accurately count all the items present or counting otherwise the accuracy speed and confidence with which observers make judgments of the number of items are critically dependent on the number of elements to be enumerated judgments made for displays composed of around one to four items are rapid accurate and confident however as the number of items to be enumerated increases beyond this amount judgments are made with decreasing accuracy and confidence in addition response times rise in a dramatic fashion with an extra 250 350ms added for each additional item within the display beyond about four while the increase in response time for each additional element within a display is 250 350ms per item outside the subitizing range there is still a significant albeit smaller increase of 40 100ms per item

rocket trajectory was intended to carry the rocket about high and horizontally from wsmr launch complex 33 impact velocity of returning rockets was reduced by inducing structural failure of the rocket airframe upon atmospheric re entry more durable recordings and instruments might be recovered from the rockets after ground impact but telemetry was developed to transmit and record instrument readings during flight the first of 300 railroad cars of v 2 rocket components began to arrive at las cruces new mexico in july 1945 for transfer to wsmr so much equipment was taken from germany that the deutsches museum later had to obtain a v 2 for an exhibit from the us in november general electric ge employees began to identify sort and reassemble v 2 rocket components in wsmr building 1538 designated as wsmr assembly building 1 the army completed a blockhouse in wsmr launch area 1 in september 1945 wsmr launch complex 33 for the captured v 2s was built around this blockhouse initial v 2 assembly efforts produced 25 rockets available for launch the army assembled an upper atmosphere research panel of representative from the air material command naval research laboratory nrl army signal corps ballistic research

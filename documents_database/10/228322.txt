nuclear scientists and engineers often need to know where neutrons are in an apparatus what direction they are going and how quickly they are moving it is commonly used to determine the behavior of nuclear reactor cores and experimental or industrial neutron beams neutron transport is a type of radiative transport neutron transport has roots in the boltzmann equation which was used in the 1800s to study the kinetic theory of gases it did not receive large scale development until the invention of chain reacting nuclear reactors in the 1940s as neutron distributions came under detailed scrutiny elegant approximations and analytic solutions were found in simple geometries however as computational power has increased numerical approaches to neutron transport have become prevalent today with massively parallel computers neutron transport is still under very active development in academia and research institutions throughout the world it remains a computationally challenging problem since it depends on 3 dimensions of space time and the variables of energy span several decades from fractions of mev to several mev modern solutions use either discrete ordinates or monte carlo methods or even a hybrid of both the neutron transport equation is a balance statement that conserves neutrons each

almost all of the germanic trias was deposited during the triassic period and consists of three clearly different units buntsandstein muschelkalk and keuper that gave the period its name triassic means threefold in the past the names of these three units were also used as units in the geologic timescale but in modern literature they only have a lithostratigraphic meaning the germanic trias formed in the large germanic basin a basin that covered much of midwestern europe including the south of the north sea and baltic sea during the triassic the muschelkalk has a predominantly marine facies whereas the buntsandstein and keuper are mostly continental in the central parts of the germanic basin the germanic trias has an average thickness of 800 meters but regional differences are considerable in the north of germany the thickness of the buntsandstein alone can exceed 1400 meters the germanic trias lies on top of the permian zechstein group and below lower jurassic units such as the lias group or altena group the base is not defined in the same way everywhere in northern germany the base is formed by the calv rde beds in the spessart and odenwald by the base of the heigenbr

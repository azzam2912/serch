this colourless liquid is the simplest organic nitrile hydrogen cyanide is a simpler nitrile but the cyanide anion is not classed as organic it is produced mainly as a byproduct of acrylonitrile manufacture it is used as a polar aprotic solvent in organic synthesis and in the purification of butadiene in the laboratory it is used as a medium polarity solvent that is miscible with water and a range of organic solvents but not saturated hydrocarbons it has a convenient liquid range and a high dielectric constant of 38 8 with a dipole moment of 3 92 d acetonitrile dissolves a wide range of ionic and nonpolar compounds and is useful as a mobile phase in hplc and lc ms the n c c skeleton is linear with a short c n distance of 1 16 acetonitrile was first prepared in 1847 by the french chemist jean baptiste dumas acetonitrile is used mainly as a solvent in the purification of butadiene in refineries specifically acetonitrile is fed into the top of a distillation column filled with hydrocarbons including butadiene and as the acetonitrile falls down through the column it absorbs the butadiene which is then sent from the bottom of

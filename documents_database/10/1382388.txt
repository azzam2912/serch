gapping usually elides minimally a finite verb and further any non finite verbs that are present this material is gapped from the non initial conjuncts of a coordinate structure gapping exists in many languages but by no means in all of them and gapping has been studied extensively and is therefore one of the more understood ellipsis mechanisms stripping is viewed as a particular manifestation of the gapping mechanism where just one remnant instead of two or more appears in the gapped stripped conjunct canonical examples of gapping have a true gap which means the elided material appears medially in the non initial conjuncts with a remnant to its left and a remnant to its right the elided material of gapping in all the examples below is indicated with subscripts and a smaller font in the first sentence the second conjunct has the subject others the object rice but the verb has been gapped that is omitted gapping can span several verbs and nonfinite clause boundaries as the second and third sentence illustrate but it cannot apply across a finite clause boundary as seen in the next sentence the star indicates that the sentence is bad gapping is also incapable

it uses an aps h 10 3 megapixel kodak kaf 10500 ccd image sensor as of 15 november 2014 the most recent firmware version is 2 024 the m8 body is slightly thicker than the classic mp and m7 approximately 14 thicker it is an all metal body made of a high strength magnesium alloy the top and base plates are cut from brass billets before receiving a black or silver chrome finish the m8 supports all existing leica m mount lenses however some older models might not offer all the functions due to mismatching cams all lenses are multiplied by a 1 33x crop factor hence a 28mm lens will act approximately like a 35mm when mounted to the m8 because the infrared filter over the sensor is relatively weak adding an ir cut filter in front of the lens is recommended in addition leica chooses to omit the anti alias filter citing the reason for higher resolution power of the lens however the moir artifacts can occur in scenes with closely spaced geometric patterns such as fabric or mesh distant buildings balcony railings corrugated roofing etc the m8 uses modern metal blade focal plane shutter it can fire

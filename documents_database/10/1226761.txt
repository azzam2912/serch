in addition the agricultural sector consisted of state farms of the seychelles agricultural development company sadeco and the outer islands managed by the idc three other large holdings producing mainly coconuts cinnamon and tea about 250 families engaged in full time production of foodstuffs and an estimated 700 families working on a part time basis many households cultivate gardens and raise livestock for home consumption the total cultivable area of the islands is only about 400 hectares although rainfall is abundant wet and dry seasons are sharply defined better irrigation and drainage systems are needed to improve food crops the government has taken various measures to reduce dependency on imported foods including deregulating production and marketing and reducing the trades tax on fertilizers and equipment as a result vegetable and fruit production climbed from 505 tons in 1990 to 1 170 tons in 1992 this increase failed to be matched by a commensurate decrease in imports of fruits and vegetables which reached 3 471 tons in 1992 local consumption had apparently increased and substitution between imported and domestic foodstuffs was possible only to a limited degree in most cases imported produce is significantly cheaper in spite of air freight import

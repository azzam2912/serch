the ship was constructed in the 1870s for the royal navy to oppose the perceived growing threat from the italian regia marina in the mediterranean the italian navy had started constructing a pair of battleships and equipped with four armstrong 17 7 inch 450 mm guns weighing 100 tons each these were superior to the armament of any ship in the british mediterranean squadron and inflexible was designed as a counter to them inflexible mounted larger guns than those of any previous british warship and had the thickest armour ever to be fitted to a royal navy ship controversially she was designed so that if her un armoured ends should be seriously damaged in action and become water logged the buoyancy of the armoured centre section of the ship would keep her afloat and upright the ship was the first major warship to depend in part for the protection of her buoyancy on a horizontal armoured deck below the water line rather than armoured sides along the waterline the original concept was based upon an outline design similar to that for hms dreadnought but with improved armament the ship was conceptually constructed from three components several outline studies being produced

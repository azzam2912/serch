these proteins have strong sequence and structural homology particularly at their c terminal end the function is to promote their pathogenicity and virulence in host cells though cell adhesion yada is found in three pathogenic species of yersinia y pestis y pseudotuberculosis and y enterocolitica the yada domain is encoded for by a virulence plasmid in yersinia which encodes a type iii secretion t3s system consisting of the ysc injectisome and the yop effectors essentially the main function of the yada domain is to help cell adhesion and to increase virulence yada is a collagen binding outer membrane protein it forms the fibrillar matrix on the bacterial cell surface this aids cell attachment and helps the bacteria invade eukaryotic cells additionally by forming the fibrillar matrix the yada domain protects the bacteria by facilitating agglutination resistance serum resistance complement inactivation and phagocytosis resistance the importance of adhesins to yada function and yersinia survival is huge attachment further allows more interactions and increase of biofilm formation to aid bacterial colonization in yersinia it helps initiate the infectious process in host cells and are critical virulence factors additionally bacteria have the ability to regulate adhesin expression meaning that when yersinia no longer

only hydrofluoric acid and highly concentrated caustic wastes are known to attack vcp such wastes would not be permitted to be discharged into a municipal sewage collection system without adequate pretreatment there are three main types of vcp produced in the u s bell spigot pipe with factory applied compression joints band seal pipe with rubber compression couplings and no dig r pipe for trenchless installation with an elastomeric gasket and stainless steel collar for a low profile compression joint all vcp manufactured in the u s must comply with astm c425 to provide a flexible leak free joint clay pipe has been in use in sanitary sewer systems for at least 5 000 years vcp pipe is made by forming clay then heating it to 2000 degrees celsius the pipe is then vitrified in some areas the pipe is then glazed to ensure that it will be water tight vcp products use clay as a major component in its production making its raw materials environmentally friendly the manufacturing process has been fine tuned for centuries and was designed to be fiscally responsible which had the added benefit of being environmentally responsible but the primary benefit both environmental and fiscal

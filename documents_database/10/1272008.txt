it is believed that fancm in conjunction with other fanconi anemia proteins repair dna at stalled replication forks and stalled transcription structures called r loops the structure of the c terminus of fancm amino acids 1799 2048 bound to a partner protein faap24 reveals how the protein complex recognises branched dna a structure of amino acids 675 790 of fancm reveal how the protein binds duplex dna through a remodeling of the mhf1 mhf2 histone like protein complex homozygous mutations in the fancm gene are associated with fanconi anemia although several individuals with fancm deficiency do not appear to have the disorder a founder mutation in the scandinavian population is also associated with a higher than average frequency of triple negative breast cancer in heterozygous carriers fancm carriers also have elevated levels of ovarian cancer and other solid tumours recombination during meiosis is often initiated by a dna double strand break dsb during recombination sections of dna at the 5 ends of the break are cut away in a process called resection in the strand invasion step that follows an overhanging 3 end of the broken dna molecule then invades the dna of a homologous chromosome that is not broken

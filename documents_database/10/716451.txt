kent is a probability distribution on the two dimensional unit sphere formula 1 in formula 2 it is the analogue on the two dimensional unit sphere of the bivariate normal distribution with an unconstrained covariance matrix the kent distribution was proposed by john t kent in 1982 and is used in geology as well as bioinformatics the probability density function formula 3 of the kent distribution is given by where formula 5 is a three dimensional unit vector formula 6 denotes the transpose of formula 7 and the normalizing constant formula 8 is formula 9 where formula 10 is the modified bessel function and formula 11 is the gamma function note that formula 12 and formula 13 the normalizing constant of the von mises fisher distribution the parameter formula 14 with formula 15 determines the concentration or spread of the distribution while formula 16 with formula 17 determines the ellipticity of the contours of equal probability the higher the formula 14 and formula 16 parameters the more concentrated and elliptical the distribution will be respectively vector formula 20 is the mean direction and vectors formula 21 are the major and minor axes the latter two vectors determine the orientation of

it was created by nicholas jackiw for the visual geometry project at swarthmore college it is designed to run on windows 95 or windows nt 4 0 or later and mac os 8 6 or later including mac os x it also runs on linux under wine with a few bugs geometer s sketchpad includes the traditional euclidean tools of classical geometric constructions if a figure such as the pentadecagon can be constructed with the compass and straightedge method it can also be constructed in the program the program allows cheat transformations to create figures impossible to construct under the compass and straightedge rules such as the regular nonagon objects can be animated the program allows the creation of numerous objects which can be measured and potentially used to solve hard math problems the program allows the determination of the midpoints and midsegments of objects geometer s sketchpad can measure lengths of segments measures of angles area perimeter etc some of the tools include a construct function which allows the user to create objects in relation to selected objects the transform function allows the user to create points in relation to objects which include distance angle ratio and others

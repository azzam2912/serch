it is contrasted with the concept of the exact differential in calculus which can be expressed as the gradient of another function and is therefore path independent consequently an inexact differential cannot be expressed in terms of its antiderivative for the purpose of integral calculations i e its value cannot be inferred just by looking at the initial and final states of a given system it is primarily used in calculations involving heat and work because they are path functions not state functions an inexact differential is commonly defined as a differential form d x where there is no corresponding function x such that formula 1 more precisely an inexact differential is a differential form that cannot be expressed as the differential of a function in the language of calculus for a given vector field f formula 2 is an inexact differential if there is no function f such that the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals requires path independence in order to express the values of a given vector field in terms of the partial derivatives of another function that is the multivariate analogue of the antiderivative this is because there can be no unique representation of an

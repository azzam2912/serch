in many cases only one atom in the ligand binds to the metal so the denticity equals one and the ligand is said to be monodentate sometimes called unidentate ligands with more than one bonded atom are called polydentate or multidentate the word denticity is derived from dentis the latin word for tooth the ligand is thought of as biting the metal at one or more linkage points the denticity of a ligand is described with the greek letter kappa for example edta describes an edta ligand that coordinates through 6 non contiguous atoms denticity is different from hapticity because hapticity refers exclusively to ligands where the coordinating atoms are contiguous in these cases the eta notation is used bridging ligands use the mu notation polydentate ligands are chelating agents and classified by their denticity some atoms cannot form the maximum possible number of bonds a ligand could make in that case one or more binding sites of the ligand are unused such sites can be used to form a bond with another chemical species in general the stability of a metal complex correlates with the denticity of the ligands which can be attributed to the chelate effect polydentate ligands

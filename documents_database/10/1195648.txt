in these hot blue binary variables a white dwarf accretes hydrogen poor matter from a compact companion star these binaries have extremely short orbital periods shorter than about one hour and have unusual spectra dominated by helium with hydrogen absent or extremely weak they are predicted to be strong sources of gravitational waves strong enough to be detected with the laser interferometer space antenna lisa am cvn stars differ from most other cataclysmic variables cvs in the lack of hydrogen lines from their spectra they show a broad continuum corresponding to hot stars with complex absorption or emission lines some stars show absorption lines and emission lines at different times am cvn stars have long been known to exhibit three types of behaviour an outbursting state a high state and a low state in the outbursting state stars show strong variability with periods of 20 40 minutes the stars v803 centauri and cr bo tis are stars that show outbursting behaviour these stars occasionally show longer and sometimes little brighter superoutbursts the interval between outbursts is longer on average for stars with longer periods the spectra show strong helium absorption lines during the outbursts with many weaker emission lines of

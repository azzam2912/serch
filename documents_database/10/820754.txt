aircraft have transponders to assist in identifying them on air traffic control radar collision avoidance systems have been developed to use transponder transmissions as a means of detecting aircraft at risk of colliding with each other air traffic control units use the term squawk when they are assigning an aircraft a transponder code e g squawk 7421 squawk thus can be said to mean select transponder code or squawking xxxx to mean i have selected transponder code xxxx the transponder receives interrogation from the secondary surveillance radar on 1030 mhz and replies on 1090 mhz secondary surveillance radar ssr is referred to as secondary to distinguish it from the primary radar that works by passively reflecting a radio signal off the skin of the aircraft primary radar determines range and bearing to a target with reasonably high fidelity but it cannot determine target elevation altitude reliably except at close range ssr uses an active transponder beacon to transmit a response to an interrogation by a secondary radar this response most often includes the aircraft s pressure altitude and a 4 digit octal identifier a pilot may be requested to squawk a given code by an air traffic controller via the

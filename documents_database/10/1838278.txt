it premiered at the venice film festival and haifa international film festival a palestinian family living in a small muslim village in galilee gathers to celebrate the wedding of one of their daughters as war rages between israel and lebanon its many members symbolise a community struggling to maintain its identity torn between modernity and tradition in the midst of it all is a forbidden love story between the youngest daughter hajar hafsia herzi who has returned from studying abroad and her christian lover tom payne when their father falls into a coma and inches toward death internal conflicts explode and the familial battles become as merciless as the outside war abbass has stated generally when you are speaking about palestinians you think of them in ramallah or the refugees in syria instead i wanted to tell this important part of society the palestinians of israel who feel partially excluded from the country in which they live which is why they try and preserve their identity through a strong family structure which makes them feel at home

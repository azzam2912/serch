initially envisioned as a companion piece to the album holy wood in the shadow of the valley of death it remained unreleased after a series of delays alleged by manson to have been caused by a publishing war describing the plot of the novel itself manson said the whole story if you take it from the beginning is parallel to my own but just told in metaphors and different symbols that i thought other people could draw from it s about being innocent and naive much like adam was in paradise before they fall from grace and seeing something like hollywood which i used as a metaphor to represent what people think is the perfect world and it s about wanting your whole life to fit into this world that doesn t think you belong that doesn t like you that beats you down every step of the way fighting and fighting and fighting and finally getting there everyone around you are the same people who kept you down in the first place so you automatically hate everyone around you you resent them for making you become part of this game you don t realize you were buying into you

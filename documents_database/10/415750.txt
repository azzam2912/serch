it is analogous to conventional fluorescence which is defined as the emission of a photon unit of light by an excited electron in an atom or molecule in the case of ige nuclear isomers can store significant amounts of excitation energy for times long enough for them to serve as nuclear fluorescent materials there are over 800 known nuclear isomers but almost all are too intrinsically radioactive to be considered for applications there were two proposed nuclear isomers that appeared to be physically capable of ige fluorescence in safe arrangements tantalum 180m and hafnium 178m2 induced gamma emission is an example of interdisciplinary research bordering on both nuclear physics and quantum electronics viewed as a nuclear reaction it would belong to a class in which only photons were involved in creating and destroying states of nuclear excitation it is a class usually overlooked in traditional discussions in 1939 pontecorvo and lazard reported the first example of this type of reaction indium was the target and in modern terminology describing nuclear reactions it would be written in in the product nuclide carries an m to denote that it has a long enough half life 4 5 h in this case to

the well known histogram equalization method is a special case in which the specified histogram is uniformly distributed it is possible to use histogram matching to balance detector responses as a relative detector calibration technique it can be used to normalize two images when the images were acquired at the same local illumination such as shadows over the same location but by different sensors atmospheric conditions or global illumination consider a grayscale input image x it has a probability density function p r where r is a grayscale value and p r is the probability of that value this probability can easily be computed from the histogram of the image by formula 1 where n is the frequency of the grayscale value r and n is the total number of pixels in the image now consider a desired output probability density function p z a transformation of p r is needed to convert it to p z each pdf can easily be mapped to its cumulative distribution function by where l is the total number of gray level 256 for a standard image the idea is to map each r value in x to the z value that has the

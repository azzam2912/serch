particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial electric lighting or from passive solar heating artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights where daylight is present or by automatically dimming switching off electric lights in response to the presence of daylight a process known as daylight harvesting the amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring illuminance on a grid or undertaking a daylight factor calculation computer programs such as radiance allow an architect or engineer to quickly calculate benefits of a particular design the human eye s response to light is non linear so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter the source of all daylight is the sun the proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight direct sunlight reaches a site without being scattered within earth s atmosphere light that is scattered in the atmosphere is diffused daylight ground reflected light also contributes to the daylight each

the vacant tooth socket collapses as it heals leaving an edentulous toothless area termed a ridge this collapse causes a loss in both height and width of the surrounding bone in addition when a maxillary molar or premolar is lost the maxillary sinus pneumatizes in this region which further diminishes the thickness of the underlying bone overall this leads to a loss in volume of bone that is available for implantation of dental implants which rely on osseointegration bone integration to replace missing teeth the goal of the sinus lift is to graft extra bone into the maxillary sinus so more bone is available to support a dental implant while there may be a number of reasons for wanting a greater volume of bone in the posterior maxilla the most common reason in contemporary dental treatment planning is to prepare the site for the future placement of dental implants sinus augmentation sinus lift is performed when the floor of the sinus is too close to an area where dental implants are to be placed this procedure is performed to ensure a secure place for the implants while protecting the sinus lowering of the sinus can be caused by long term

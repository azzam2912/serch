velocity moments can be used to aid automated identification of a shape in an image when information about the motion is significant in its description there are currently two established versions of velocity moments cartesian and zernike a cartesian moment of a single image is calculated by where formula 2 and formula 3 are the dimensions of the image formula 4 is the intensity of the pixel at the point formula 5 in the image and formula 6 is the basis function cartesian velocity moments are based on these cartesian moments a cartesian velocity moment formula 7 is defined by where formula 2 and formula 3 are again the dimensions of the image formula 11 is the number of images in the sequence and formula 12 is the intensity of the pixel at the point formula 5 in image formula 14 formula 15 is taken from central moments added so the equation is translation invariant defined as where formula 17 is the formula 18 coordinate of the centre of mass for image formula 14 and similarly for formula 20 formula 21 introduces velocity into the equation as where formula 23 is the formula 18 coordinate of the centre of mass

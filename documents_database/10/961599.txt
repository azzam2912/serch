hipims utilises extremely high power densities of the order of kw cm in short pulses impulses of tens of microseconds at low duty cycle on off time ratio of glow discharge where the discharge current density can reach several a cm whilst the discharge voltage is maintained at several hundred volts the discharge is homogeneously distributed across the surface of the cathode target however above a certain threshold of current density it becomes concentrated in narrow ionization zones that move along a path known as the target erosion racetrack hipims generates a high density plasma of the order of 10 ions cm containing high fractions of target metal ions the main ionisation mechanism is electron impact which is balanced by charge exchange diffusion and plasma ejection in flares the ionisation rates depend on the plasma density the ionisation degree of the metal vapour is a strong function of the peak current density of the discharge at high current densities sputtered ions with charge 2 and higher up to 5 for v can be generated the appearance of target ions with charge states higher than 1 is responsible for a potential secondary electron emission process that has a higher emission coefficient

many introductory programming and systems analysis texts introduce this as the most basic structure for describing a process a computer program is useful for another sort of process using the input process output model receives inputs from a user or other source does some computations on the inputs and returns the results of the computations in essence the system separates itself from the environment thus defining both inputs and outputs as one united mechanism the system would divide the work into three categories in other words such inputs may be materials human resources money or information transformed into outputs such as consumables services new information or money as a consequence an input process output system becomes very vulnerable to misinterpretation this is because theoretically it contains all the data in regards to the environment outside the system yet on practice the environment contains a significant variety of objects that a system is unable to comprehend as it exists outside the system s control as a result it is very important to understand where the boundary lies between the system and the environment which is beyond the system s understanding various analysts often set their own boundaries favoring their point of

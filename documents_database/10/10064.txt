particle radiation is referred to as a particle beam if the particles are all moving in the same direction similar to a light beam due to the wave particle duality all moving particles also have wave character higher energy particles more easily exhibit particle characteristics while lower energy particles more easily exhibit wave characteristics particles can be electrically charged or uncharged particle radiation can be emitted by an unstable atomic nucleus via radioactive decay or it can be the product from some other kind of nuclear reaction many types of particles may be emitted mechanisms that produce particle radiation include charged particles electrons mesons protons alpha particles heavier hze ions etc can be produced by particle accelerators ion irradiation is widely used in the semiconductor industry to introduce dopants into materials a method known as ion implantation particle accelerators can also produce neutrino beams neutron beams are mostly produced by nuclear reactors for the production of electromagnetic radiation there are many methods depending upon the wave length see electromagnetic spectrum in radiation protection radiation is often separated into two categories ionizing and non ionizing to denote the level of danger posed to humans ionization is the process of removing electrons

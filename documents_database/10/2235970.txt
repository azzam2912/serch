the use of md dsp is fundamental to many application areas such as digital image and video processing medical imaging geophysical signal analysis sonar radar lidar array processing computer vision computational photography and augmented and virtual reality however as the number of dimensions of a signal increases the computational complexity to operate on the signal increases rapidly this relationship between the number of dimensions and the amount of complexity related to both time and space as studied in the field of algorithm analysis is analogues to the concept of the curse of dimensionality this large complexity generally results in an extremely long execution run time of a given md dsp application rendering its usage to become impractical for many applications especially for real time applications this long run time is the primary motivation of applying parallel algorithmic techniques to md dsp problems due to the end of frequency scaling of processors which is largely attributed to the effect of dennard scaling around the year 2005 a common trend of processor manufacturers was to continue to exploit moore s law by increasing the number of processors on a single chip which are termed multi core processors as opposed to uniprocessors md

they were first studied by and given their name by the two smallest permutations that cannot be partitioned into an increasing and a decreasing sequence are 3412 and 2143 was the first to establish that a skew merged permutation can also be equivalently defined as a permutation that avoids the two patterns 3412 and 2143 a permutation is skew merged if and only if its associated permutation graph is a split graph a graph that can be partitioned into a clique corresponding to the descending subsequence and an independent set corresponding to the ascending subsequence the two forbidden patterns for skew merged permutations 3412 and 2143 correspond to two of the three forbidden induced subgraphs for split graphs a four vertex cycle and a graph with two disjoint edges respectively the third forbidden induced subgraph a five vertex cycle cannot exist in a permutation graph see for formula 1 the number of skew merged permutations of length formula 2 is from which it follows that the number of skew merged permutations of length formula 2 is given by the formula and that these numbers obey the recurrence relation another derivation of the generating function for skew merged permutations was given

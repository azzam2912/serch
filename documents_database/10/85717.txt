its pharmaceutical form is called protirelin inn trh is synthesized within parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus it is translated as a 242 amino acid precursor polypeptide that contains 6 copies of the sequence gln his pro gly flanked by lys arg or arg arg sequences to produce the mature form a series of enzymes are required first a protease cleaves to the c terminal side of the flanking lys arg or arg arg second a carboxypeptidase removes the lys arg residues leaving gly as the c terminal residue then this gly is converted into an amide residue by a series of enzymes collectively known as peptidylglycine alpha amidating monooxygenase concurrently with these processing steps the n terminal gln glutamine is converted into pyroglutamate a cyclic residue these multiple steps produce 6 copies of the mature trh molecule per precursor molecule for human trh 5 for mouse trh trh synthesizing neurons of the paraventricular nucleus project to the medial portion of the external layer of the median eminence following secretion at the median eminence trh travels to the anterior pituitary via the hypophyseal portal system where it binds to the trh receptor stimulating the release of thyroid

the most common example is the evolution of a population the only equilibrium is when there is no one left but if we model the number of people it is likely to remain stable for a long period of time before it eventually collapses we consider a markov process formula 1 taking values in formula 2 there is a measurable set formula 3of absorbing states and formula 4 we denote by formula 5 the hitting time of formula 6 also called killing time we denote by formula 7 the family of distributions where formula 8 has original condition formula 9 we assume that formula 6 is almost surely reached i e formula 11 the general definition is a probability measure formula 12 on formula 13 is said to be a quasi stationary distribution qsd if for every measurable set formula 14 contained in formula 13 formula 16where formula 17 in particular formula 18 from the assumptions above we know that the killing time is finite with probability 1 a stronger result than we can derive is that the killing time is exponentially distributed if formula 12 is a qsd then there exists formula 20 such that formula 21 moreover for

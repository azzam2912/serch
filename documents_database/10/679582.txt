this group of 4 codes is called a transmission word an ordered set is a transmission word that includes some combination of control k codes and data d codes each device has an arbitrated loop physical address al pa these addresses are defined by an 8 bit field but must have neutral disparity as defined in the 8b 10b coding scheme that reduces the number of possible values from 256 to 134 the 134 possible values have been divided between the fabric fc al ports and other special purposes as follows in addition to the transfer of data it is necessary for fibre channel communication to include some metadata this allows for the setting up of links sequence management and other control functions the meta data falls into two types primitives which consist of a 4 character transmission word and non data frames which are more complex structures all primitives are four characters in length they begin with the control character k28 5 followed by three data characters in some primitives the three data characters are fixed in others they can be varied to change the meaning or to act as parameters for the primitive in some cases the last

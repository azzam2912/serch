broadly speaking n acyl amides fall into several categories amino acid conjugates e g n arachidonoyl glycine neurotransmitter conjugates e g n arachidonoyl serotonin ethanolamine conjugates e g anandamide and taurine conjugates e g n palmitoyl taurine n acyl amides have pleiotropic signaling functions in physiology including in cardiovascular function metabolic homeostasis memory cognition pain motor control and others initial attention focused on n acyl amides present in mammalian organisms however recently lipid signaling systems consisting of n acyl amides have also been found to be present in invertebrates such as drosophila melanogaster n acyl amides play important roles in many biochemical pathways involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes as well as the metabolic enzymes transporters and receptors that regulate their signaling compound found in mammalian species compound found in invertebrate drosophila melanogaster species compound found in plant species the enzymatic biosynthesis of the n acyl amide class of metabolites is a topic of active research with various pathways being discovered for specific n acyl amides for example a proposed biosynthetic pathway for the n acyl ethanolamines naes has been the hydrolysis of an unusual phospholipid precursor n acyl phosphatidylethanolamine nape by a phospholipase d activity to

this socket supersedes intel s lga 775 socket t in the high end and performance desktop segments it also replaces the server oriented lga 771 socket j in the entry level and is superseded itself by lga 2011 lga stands for land grid array this socket has 1 366 protruding pins which touch contact points on the underside of the processor cpu and accesses up to three channels of ddr3 memory via the processor s internal memory controller socket 1366 socket b uses qpi to connect the cpu to a reduced function northbridge that serves mainly as a pci express controller a slower dmi is used to connect intel s most recent northbridge and southbridge components by comparison intel s socket 1156 socket h moves the qpi link and pci express controller onto the processor itself using dmi to interface a single component chipset now called pch that serves traditional southbridge functions the difference in pin number is mostly a reflection of the number of memory channels served in november 2008 intel released core i7 which was the first processor requiring this socket lga 1366 socket and processors were discontinued sometime in early 2012 having been superseded by the lga

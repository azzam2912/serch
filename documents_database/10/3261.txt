the following examples show how to solve differential equations in a few simple cases when an exact solution exists equations in the form formula 1 are called separable and solved by formula 2 and thus formula 3 prior to dividing by formula 4 one needs to check if there are stationary also called equilibrium solutions formula 5 satisfying formula 6 a separable linear ordinary differential equation of the first order must be homogeneous and has the general form where formula 8 is some known function we may solve this by separation of variables moving the y terms to one side and the t terms to the other side since the separation of variables in this case involves dividing by y we must check if the constant function y 0 is a solution of the original equation trivially if y 0 then y 0 so y 0 is actually a solution of the original equation we note that y 0 is not allowed in the transformed equation we solve the transformed equation with the variables already separated by integrating where c is an arbitrary constant then by exponentiation we obtain here formula 12 so formula 13 but we have independently checked

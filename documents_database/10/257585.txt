a logic family of monolithic digital integrated circuit devices is a group of electronic logic gates constructed using one of several different designs usually with compatible logic levels and power supply characteristics within a family many logic families were produced as individual components each containing one or a few related basic logical functions which could be used as building blocks to create systems or as so called glue to interconnect more complex integrated circuits a logic family may also refer to a set of techniques used to implement logic within vlsi integrated circuits such as central processors memories or other complex functions some such logic families use static techniques to minimize design complexity other such logic families such as domino logic use clocked dynamic techniques to minimize size power consumption and delay before the widespread use of integrated circuits various solid state and vacuum tube logic systems were used but these were never as standardized and interoperable as the integrated circuit devices the list of packaged building block logic families can be divided into categories listed here in roughly chronological order of introduction along with their usual abbreviations the families rtl dtl and ecl were derived from the logic circuits

the feature vector s homomorphic encryption allows search and match to be conducted in polynomial time on an encrypted dataset and the search result is returned as an encrypted match one or more computing devices may use an encrypted feature vector to verify an individual person 1 1 verify or identify an individual in a datastore 1 many identify without storing sending or receiving plaintext biometric data within or between computing devices or any other entity the purpose of private biometrics is to allow a person to be identified or authenticated while guaranteeing individual privacy and fundamental human rights by only operating on biometric data in the encrypted space biometric security strengthens user authentication but until recently also implied important risks to personal privacy indeed while compromised passwords can be easily replaced and are not personally identifiable information pii biometric data is considered highly sensitive due to its personal nature unique association with users and the fact that compromised biometrics biometric templates cannot be revoked or replaced private biometrics have been developed to address this challenge private biometrics provide the necessary biometric authentication while simultaneously minimizing user s privacy exposure through the use of one way fully homomorphic encryption the

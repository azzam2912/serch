fatigue remains a formidable enemy in theater operations due to its pervasive impact on cognitive effectiveness during flight incidents of fatigue related errors continue to affect the stability and effectiveness of pilots engaged in 24 7 operations approximately 20 of all air force air national guard aviation mishaps have fatigue as either a causal or contributing factor one solution to the issue of fatigue within sustained operations came when the united states department of defense dod sought to find a way to identify and quantify potential danger zones related to fatigue in 1996 the walter reed army institute of research wrair began work on the sleep performance model spm in order to perform analysis related to sleep deprivation and its effects on human performance it led to the development of the safte sleep activity fatigue and task effectiveness model a model which calculates effectiveness based on the human sleep work cycle in 2001 the air force research laboratory afrl through a small business innovation research sbir grant sponsored the development of the fatigue avoidance scheduling tool fast a user interface on the safte model the outputs rendered through fast identify time intervals represented through work and sleep durations fast was

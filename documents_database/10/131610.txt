biomolecules include large macromolecules or polyanions such as proteins carbohydrates lipids and nucleic acids as well as small molecules such as primary metabolites secondary metabolites and natural products a more general name for this class of material is biological materials biomolecules are usually endogenous produced within the organism but organisms usually need exogenous biomolecules for example certain nutrients to survive biology and its subfields of biochemistry and molecular biology study biomolecules and their reactions most biomolecules are organic compounds and just four elements oxygen carbon hydrogen and nitrogen make up 96 of the human body s mass but many other elements such as the various biometals are present in small amounts the uniformity of both specific types of molecules the biomolecules and of certain metabolic pathways are invariant features among the wide diversity of life forms thus these biomolecules and metabolic pathways are referred to as biochemical universals or theory of material unity of the living beings a unifying concept in biology along with cell theory and evolution theory a diverse range of biomolecules exist including nucleosides are molecules formed by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose or deoxyribose ring examples of these include cytidine c uridine u adenosine a

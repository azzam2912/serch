it is the ratio of the dilution of the disinfectant that kills a microorganism to the dilution of phenol that kills the organism in the same time under identical conditions the rideal walker coefficient determines the phenol coefficient utilizing the method test described by english chemists samuel rideal 1863 1929 and j t ainslie walker 1868 1930 the arbitrary choice of contact time sterilisation in 7 5 minutes diluent distilled water and test organism salmonella typhi then called bacillus typhosa did not reflect the conditions under which disinfectants were used because of this impossibly high values were obtained for disinfectant activity and quoted by disinfectant manufacturers the method was referred to by distinguished microbiologist sir ashley miles as at best a grossly over simplified answer to a very difficult problem and at worst little short of bacteriological prostitution it was replaced by a more realistic test devised by dame harriette chick and sir charles james martin which in turn was replaced by other tests not reliant on a comparison with phenol in attempts to assess the effectiveness of particular disinfectants for different purposes

the cmb distribution can be used to model both positive and negative association among the bernoulli summands the distribution was introduced by shumeli et al 2005 and the name conway maxwell binomial distribution was introduced independently by kadane 2016 and daly and gaunt 2016 the conway maxwell binomial cmb distribution has probability mass function where formula 3 formula 4 and formula 5 the normalizing constant formula 6 is defined by if a random variable formula 8 has the above mass function then we write formula 9 the case formula 10 is the usual binomial distribution formula 11 the following relationship between conway maxwell poisson cmp and cmb random variables generalises a well known result concerning poisson and binomial random variables if formula 12 and formula 13 are independent then formula 14 the random variable formula 9 may be written as a sum of exchangeable bernoulli random variables formula 16 satisfying where formula 18 note that formula 19 in general unless formula 10 let then the probability generating function moment generating function and characteristic function are given respectively by for general formula 25 there do not exist closed form expressions for the moments of the cmb distribution the following neat formula

it exists as the anhydrous salt the heptahydrate and the decahydrate these are white water soluble solids the decahydrate is a common ingredient in multivitamins and livestock feed as a source of selenium the anhydrous salt is used in the production of some glass although the selenates are much more toxic many physical properties of sodium selenate and sodium sulfate are similar sodium selenate is produced by oxidation of selenium first with nitric acid producing selenous acid the selenous acid is neutralized to form sodium selenite the sodium selenite is oxidized in a basic medium hydrogen peroxide to form a selenate which is then spray dried it was prepared shortly after the discovery of selenium by j ns jacob berzelius in 1817 one of the earliest applications of sodium selenate was in the glass industry selenium produces a red hue in glass the molten glass is treated with sodium selenate and then arsenic trioxide to reduce the compound and provide elemental selenium sodium selenate is also used as a decolorizing agent in glass production the red hue it gives glass is complementary to the green hue given by ferrous oxides in the manufacturing process when used together the two compound

the receptor is a non covalent heterodimer of two proteins the ecr protein and ultraspiracle protein usp it binds to and is activated by ecdysteroids insect ecdysone receptors are currently better characterized than those from other arthropods and mimics of ecdysteroids are used commercially as caterpillar selective insecticides pulses of 20 hydroxyecdysone occur during insect development whereupon this hormone binds to the ecdysone receptor a ligand activated transcription factor found in the nuclei of insect cells this in turn leads to the activation of many other genes as evidenced by puffing of polytene chromosomes at over a hundred sites ultimately the activation cascade causes physiological changes that result in ecdysis moulting the temporal expression of ecdysone receptor within neural stem cells mediates temporal patterning and neural diversity the receptor is a non covalent heterodimer of two proteins the ecr protein and ultraspiracle protein usp these nuclear hormone receptor proteins are the insect orthologs of the mammalian farnesoid x receptor fxr and retinoid x receptor rxr proteins respectively based on sequence homology considerations some researchers reserve the term usp for the ecr partner from lepidopteran and dipteran insects and use rxr in all other instances ecr and usp share the multi

its nerve fibres the olivocochlear bundle ocb form part of the vestibulocochlear nerve viiith cranial nerve also known as the auditory vestibular nerve and project from the superior olivary complex in the brainstem pons to the cochlea the olivocochlear bundle ocb originates in the superior olivary complex in the brainstem the vestibulocochlear anastomosis carries the efferent axons into the cochlea where they innervate the organ of corti oc the ocb contains fibres projecting to both the ipsilateral and contralateral cochleae prompting an initial division into crossed cocb and uncrossed ucocb systems more recently however the division of the ocb is based on the cell bodies site of origin in the brainstem relative to the medial superior olive mso the medioventral periolivary mvpo region also known as the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body a diffuse region of neurons located medial to the mso gives rise to the medial olivocochlear system mocs the lateral superior olive lso a distinct nucleus of neurons located lateral to the mso gives rise to the lateral olivocochlear system locs the mocs neurons are large multipolar cells while the locs are classically defined as composed of small spherical cells this division is viewed as being more

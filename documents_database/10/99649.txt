they have also been used to study the biochemical events that surround mitosis since all of the nuclei in a medium sized plasmodium divide in synchrony it has been observed that they can find their way through mazes by spreading out and choosing the shortest path an interesting example of information processing without a nervous system myxomycete plasmodia have also been used to study the genetics of asexual cell fusion the giant size of the plasmodial cells allows for easy evaluation of complete or partial cell fusion in 2006 researchers at the university of southampton and the university of kobe reported that they had built a six legged robot whose movement was remotely controlled by a physarum slime mold the mold directed the robot into a dark corner most similar to its natural habitat slime molds are sometimes studied in advanced mathematics courses slime mold aggregation is a natural process that can be approximated with partial differential equations members of the mycetozoa group are able to undergo sexual reproduction either by heterothallic or homothallic mating an analysis of meiosis related genes in the dictyostelium discoideum genome revealed that 36 of the 44 genes tested were present in the genome one

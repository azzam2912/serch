it was discovered by american astronomer reverend joel metcalf at taunton massachusetts usa on 13 september 1907 the s type asteroid orbits the sun at a distance of 2 7 3 7 au once every 5 years and 9 months 2 103 days its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0 15 and is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic a photometric light curve analysis from the 1980s and a provisional observation in 2004 rendered a rotation period of 32 6 and 34 4 hours respectively according to the surveys carried out by the infrared astronomical satellite iras the japanese akari satellite and the u s wide field infrared survey explorer with its subsequent neowise mission the asteroid has a dissimilar albedo in the range of 0 14 to 0 23 which leads to a varying estimate for its diameter from 28 to 36 kilometers the collaborative asteroid lightcurve link publishes an albedo of 0 23 from an alternative result of the supplemental iras minor planet survey simps and derives a slightly lower diameter of 27 9 kilometers the minor planet was named for two women of ancient roman history agrippina the elder 14 bce 33 was

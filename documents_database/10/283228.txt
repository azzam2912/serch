it was about long and in weight making it one of the largest theropods of its time individuals of this species may have grown even larger because the only known specimen probably represents a sub adult cryolophosaurus is known from a skull a femur and other material the skull and femur of which have caused its classification to vary greatly the femur possesses many primitive characteristics that have classified cryolophosaurus as a dilophosaurid or a neotheropod outside of dilophosauridae and averostra where as the skull has many advanced features leading the genus to be considered a tetanuran an abelisaurid a ceratosaur and even an allosaurid since its original description the consensus is that cryolophosaurus is either a primitive member of the tetanurae or a close relative of that group cryolophosaurus possessed a distinctive pompadour crest that spanned the head from side to side based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture it is thought that this bizarre crest was used for intra species recognition the brain of cryolophosaurus was also more primitive than those of other theropods cryolophosaurus was first excavated from antarctica s early jurassic sinemurian to pliensbachian aged hanson formation formerly the upper falla formation

animals in the family felidae including many species of large cat as well as domestic cats were long believed to be resistant to canine distemper until some researchers reported the prevalence of cdv infection in large felids both large felidae and domestic cats are now known to be capable of infection usually through close housing with dogs or possibly blood transfusion from infected cats but such infections appear to be self limiting and largely without symptoms in canines distemper affects several body systems including the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and the spinal cord and brain with common symptoms that include high fever eye inflammation and eye nose discharge labored breathing and coughing vomiting and diarrhea loss of appetite and lethargy and hardening of nose and footpads the viral infection can be accompanied by secondary bacterial infections and can present eventual serious neurological symptoms canine distemper is caused by a single stranded rna virus of the family paramyxoviridae the same family of the viruses that causes measles mumps and bronchiolitis in humans the disease is highly contagious via inhalation morbidity and mortality may vary greatly among animal species with up to 100 mortality in unvaccinated populations of ferrets in domestic dogs

dually the figures are said to be perspective from a line if the points of intersection of corresponding lines all lie on one line the proper setting for this concept is in projective geometry where there will be no special cases due to parallel lines since all lines meet although stated here for figures in a plane the concept is easily extended to higher dimensions the line which goes through the points where the figure s corresponding sides intersect is known as the axis of perspectivity perspective axis homology axis or archaically perspectrix the figures are said to be perspective from this axis the point at which the lines joining the corresponding vertices of the perspective figures intersect is called the center of perspectivity perspective center homology center pole or archaically perspector the figures are said to be perspective from this center if each of the perspective figures consists of all the points on a line a range then transformation of the points of one range to the other is called a central perspectivity a dual transformation taking all the lines through a point a pencil to another pencil by means of an axis of perspectivity is called an axial

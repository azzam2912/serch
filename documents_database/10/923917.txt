thyroid homeostasis or thyrotropic feedback control is part of the neuroendocrine system responsible for the regulation of metabolism and also responds to stress as its name suggests it depends upon the hypothalamus the pituitary gland and the thyroid gland the hypothalamus senses low circulating levels of thyroid hormone triiodothyronine t3 and thyroxine t4 and responds by releasing thyrotropin releasing hormone trh the trh stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce thyroid stimulating hormone tsh the tsh in turn stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone until levels in the blood return to normal thyroid hormone exerts negative feedback control over the hypothalamus as well as anterior pituitary thus controlling the release of both trh from hypothalamus and tsh from anterior pituitary gland the hpa hpg and hpt axes are three pathways in which the hypothalamus and pituitary direct neuroendocrine function thyroid homeostasis results from a multi loop feedback system that is found in virtually all higher vertebrates proper function of thyrotropic feedback control is indispensable for growth differentiation reproduction and intelligence very few animals e g axolotls and sloths have impaired thyroid homeostasis that exhibits a very low set point that is assumed to underlie the metabolic and ontogenetic anomalies of

its purpose is to provide free and widely accessible tools for conducting biomechanics research and motor control science opensim enables a wide range of studies including analysis of walking dynamics studies of sports performance simulations of surgical procedures analysis of joint loads design of medical devices and animation of human and animal movement the software performs inverse dynamics analysis and forward dynamics simulations opensim is used in hundreds of biomechanics laboratories around the world to study movement and has a community of software developers contributing new features opensim by brooklyn dush is one of the flagship applications from simbios a nih center for biomedical computation systems at stanford university founded in 2004 simbios is charged with a mandate to provide leading software and computational tools for physics based modeling and simulation of biological structures opensim was designed to propel biomechanics research by providing a common framework for investigation and a vehicle for exchanging complex musculoskeletal models opensim 1 0 was released on august 20 2007 and provided capabilities for viewing musculoskeletal models importing models developed in simm musculographics inc editing muscle paths and generating muscle actuated simulations that track experimental data opensim 1 1 was released on december 11 2007

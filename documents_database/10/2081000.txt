the gene is located on chromosome 17p13 1 on the reverse strand spanning bases 6578141 to 6641744 the kiaa0753 gene contains 18 exons 19 introns in humans and has no known aliases human kiaa0753 does not have any paralogs but has a wide variety of orthologous species these species range from close primate relatives to further relatives such as amphibians and various fish species the most distant orthologs of human kiaa0753 were discovered to be the giant owl limpet and a species of acorn worm the human kiaa0753 protein is 976 amino acids in length and contains two notable domains the first is a domain of unknown function designated as duf3498 which spans from amino acid 508 to 663 the second is designated cdt1 m which is a member of a protein superfamily located from amino acid 45 to 123 duf3498 is reasonably well conserved in orthologous species but the cdt1 m region is not there are various predicted post translational modifications these include n glycosylation sites phosphorylation sites c mannosylation sites acetylation sites and location of protein export a large number of phosphorylation sites are predicted with high confidence and provide evidence that in humans kiaa0753 is located inside

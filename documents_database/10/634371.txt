this dance has been traditionally designed for men although women may take part if there are not enough men the mee tuu paki resembles a kind of war dance albeit it is done with little symbolic paddles as opposed to arms the dress for this dance invariably is a large sheet of ngatu wrapped around the body from chest to ankles a girdle of leaves around the waist sisi is often added the movements are largely with the paddles in the hand but the proper addition of the small and subtle movements with the head and legs make the difference between a good and poor performance the paddles are not used for row like gestures but are rotated around moved to left and right or up and down the dancers start in one row maybe two if there are many but from time to time split up the rows in what seems chaotic movements yet at the end they come back again in perfect unison it is usually the dance master who operates a little slit drum lali to keep the beat while the dancers themselves sing the song possibly with assistance of others the beat is always slow in

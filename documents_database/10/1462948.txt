the tool has been developed by bruno blanchet support is provided for cryptographic primitives including symmetric asymmetric cryptography digital signatures hash functions bit commitment and signature proofs of knowledge the tool is capable of evaluating reachability properties correspondence assertions and observational equivalence these reasoning capabilities are particularly useful to the computer security domain since they permit the analysis of secrecy and authentication properties emerging properties such as privacy traceability and verifiability can also be considered protocol analysis is considered with respect to an unbounded number of sessions and an unbounded message space the tool is capable of attack reconstruction when a property cannot be proved an execution trace which falsifies the desired property is constructed proverif has been used in the following case studies which include the security analysis of actual network protocols further examples can be found online alternative analysis tools include avispa for reachability and correspondence assertions kiss for static equivalence yapa for static equivalence cryptoverif for verification of security against polynomial time adversaries in the computational model the tamarin prover is a modern alternative to proverif with excellent support for diffie hellman equational reasoning and verification of observational equivalence properties

it is transparently white it contains about 8 whorls the protoconch is slightly eroded of which 4 form a brownish bleached nucleus subsequent whorls excepted last one practically exist only of the excavation which is sculptured by curved raised striae and is bordered just below the suture by a conspicuous spiral liration with laterally compressed fold like beads these become fainter towards the aperture just above the suture a second row of depressed slightly pointed tubercles form a keel below the excavation of the body whorl about 12 in number on that whorl where they form the top of short oblique axial ribs the lower part of the body whorl contains about 15 lirae and a few intermediate ones moreover fine growth striae and excessively small granules are visible on the whole shell by the aid of a strong lens the body whorl is regularly attenuated towards its base only slightly convex with a very short broad siphonal canal the aperture is obliquely oblong with a sharp angle above and a narrow gutterlike siphonal canal below the peristome is thin with a wide moderately deep sinus above the columellar margin is slightly concave above straighter and directed to the left

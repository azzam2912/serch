the nama basin is a peripheral foreland basin and the nama group was deposited in two early basins the zaris and witputs to the north while the south african vanrhynsdorp group was deposited in the southern third the nama group is made of fluvial and shallow water marine sediments both siliciclastic and carbonate la tinta group in argentina is considered equivalent to nama group the group extends from the gariep belt in the south to outcrops of pre damara basement in the north thrombolite stromatolite reefs in the nama group are best developed in the kuibis subgroup of the zaris subbasin and in the huns platform of the witputs subbasin the nama group is a series of interbedded shallow marine carbonates and siliciclastics deposited in a storm dominated ramp setting nama type preservation is an ediacaran type preservation that presents sandstone castings of fossil creatures in which organisms are preserved in three dimensions within fine grained beds that were deposited in single storm or mudflow events an example is ausia fenestrata analysis performed in 2018 on namacalathus and cloudina skeletons from the ediacaran omkyk member of the nama group demonstrates that both organisms originally produced aragonitic skeletons which later underwent

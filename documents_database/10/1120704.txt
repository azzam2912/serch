ip binds to and mediates the biological actions of prostacyclin also termed prostaglandin i pgi or when used as a drug epoprostenol ip is encoded in humans by the ptgir gene while possessing many functions as defined in animal model studies the major clinical relevancy of ip is as a powerful vasodilator stimulators of ip are used to treat severe and even life threatening diseases involving pathological vasoconstriction the gene is located on human chromosome 19 at position q13 32 i e 19q13 32 contains 6 exons and codes for a g protein coupled receptor gpcr of the rhodopsin like receptor family subfamily a14 see rhodopsin like receptors subfamily a14 ip is most highly expressed in brain and thymus and is readily detected in most other tissues it is found throughout the vascular network on endothelium and smooth muscle cells standard prostanoids have the following relative efficacies as receptor ligands in binding to and activating ip pgi pgd2 pge2 pgf2 txa2 in typical binding studies pgi has one half of its maximal binding capacity and cell stimulating actions at 1 nanomolar whereas the other prostaglandins are 50 fold to 100 fold weaker than this however pgi is very unstable spontaneously

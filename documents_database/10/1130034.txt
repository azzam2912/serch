these domains are separated by an intervening region that interacts with uhrf1 an e3 ubiquitin ligase and usp7 a de ubiquinating enzyme dna methylation is the major modification of eukaryotic genomes and plays an essential role in mammalian development human proteins mecp2 mbd1 mbd2 mbd3 and mbd4 this gene comprise a family of nuclear proteins related by the presence in each of a methyl cpg binding domain mbd each of these proteins with the exception of mbd3 is capable of binding specifically to methylated dna mbd4 may function to mediate the biological consequences of the methylation signal in addition mbd4 has protein sequence similarity to bacterial dna repair enzymes and thus may have some function in dna repair further mbd4 gene mutations are detected in tumors with primary microsatellite instability msi a form of genomic instability associated with defective dna mismatch repair and mbd4 gene meets 4 of 5 criteria of a bona fide mis target gene bases in dna decay spontaneously and this decay includes hydrolytic deamination of purines and pyrimidines that contain an exocyclic amino group see image hypoxanthine and xanthine are generated at a relatively slow rate by deamination of adenine and guanine respectively however deamination of

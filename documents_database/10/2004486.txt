gene drives can arise through a variety of mechanisms they have been proposed to provide an effective means of genetically modifying specific populations and entire species the technique can employ adding deleting disrupting or modifying genes proposed applications include exterminating insects that carry pathogens notably mosquitoes that transmit malaria dengue and zika pathogens controlling invasive species or eliminating herbicide or pesticide resistance as with any potentially powerful technique gene drives can be misused in a variety of ways or induce unintended consequences for example a gene drive intended to affect only a local population might spread across an entire species gene drives used to eradicate populations of invasive species in their non native habitats may have consequences for the population of the species as a whole even in its native habitat any accidental return of individuals of the species to its original habitats through natural migration environmental disruption storms floods etc accidental human transportation or purposeful relocation could unintentionally drive the species to extinction if the relocated individuals carried harmful gene drives gene drives can be built from many naturally occurring selfish genetic elements that use a variety of molecular mechanisms these naturally occurring mechanisms induce similar segregation distortion in

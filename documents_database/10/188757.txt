these drugs are generally administered by an anaesthetist anesthesiologist in order to induce or maintain general anaesthesia to facilitate surgery general anaesthetics have been widely used in surgery since 1842 when crawford long for the first time administered diethyl ether to a patient and performed a painless operation it has long been believed that general anaesthetics exert their effects analgesia amnesia immobility by modulating the activity of membrane proteins in the neuronal membrane however the exact location and mechanism of this action are still largely unknown although much research has been done in this area there are a number of theories both outdated and modern that attempt to explain anaesthetic action the concept of specific interactions between receptors and drugs first introduced by paul ehrlich states that drugs act only when they are bound to their targets receptors however this concept does not seem to apply in the case of general anaesthetics because all these common features of general anaesthetics made it hard for early researchers to believe that general anaesthetics act in a specific manner and their action on neuronal membrane was thought to be global through nonspecific perturbation of lipid membrane of cns neurons rather than through specific

the hsi uses equations which incorporate the intensity of the winds and the size of the area covered by the winds the hsi attempts to demonstrate that two hurricanes of similar intensity may have different destructive capability due to variances in size and furthermore that a less intense but very large hurricane may in fact be more destructive than a smaller more intense hurricane hsi was developed by a private company program in competition with the national weather service s accumulated cyclone energy index development of the hurricane severity index began in 2005 after the 2005 atlantic hurricane season by chris hebert and bob weinzapfel two impactweather acquired by stormgeo meteorologists and hurricane experts impactweather stormgeo officially announced the hsi in 2006 their goal was to create a new index that rates the severity of all types of tropical cyclones not just hurricanes based on both their intensity and size of wind field the idea behind the hurricane severity index is that the size of a hurricane is as important as the strength of its winds thus the index uses a 50 point scale with half of the total based on wind intensity and half based on the wind fields

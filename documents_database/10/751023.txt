in response these receptors work with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes thereby controlling the development homeostasis and metabolism of the organism nuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to dna and regulate the expression of adjacent genes hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors the regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors generally only happens when a ligand a molecule that affects the receptor s behavior is present more specifically ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor which in turn activates the receptor resulting in up or down regulation of gene expression a unique property of nuclear receptors that differentiates them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic dna as a consequence nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis as discussed below nuclear receptors may be classified according to either mechanism or homology nuclear receptors are specific to metazoans animals and are not found in protists algae fungi or plants amongst the early branching animal lineages with sequenced genomes two have been reported from the sponge amphimedon queenslandica two from the

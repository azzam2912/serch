the tumor and the surrounding microenvironment are closely related and interact constantly tumors can influence the microenvironment by releasing extracellular signals promoting tumor angiogenesis and inducing peripheral immune tolerance while the immune cells in the microenvironment can affect the growth and evolution of cancerous cells the importance of a stromal microenvironment especially wound or regenerating tissue has been recognized since the late 1800s the interplay between the tumor and its microenvironment was part of stephen paget s 1889 seed and soil theory in which he postulated that metastases of a particular type of cancer the seed often metastasizes to certain sites the soil based on the similarity of the original and secondary tumor sites its role in blunting an immune attack awaited the discovery of adaptive cellular immunity in 1960 klein and colleagues found that in mice primary methylcholanthrene induced sarcomas exhibited an antitumor immune response mediated by lymph node cells to cancer cells derived from the primary tumor this immune response did not however affect the primary tumor the primary tumor instead established a microenvironment that is functionally analogous to that of certain normal tissues such as the eye later mice experiments by halachmi and witz showed that for

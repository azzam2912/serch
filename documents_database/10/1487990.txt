galectin 3 is a member of the lectin family of which 14 mammalian galectins have been identified galectin 3 is approximately 30 kda and like all galectins contains a carbohydrate recognition binding domain crd of about 130 amino acids that enable the specific binding of galactosides galectin 3 gal 3 is also a member of the beta galactoside binding protein family that plays an important role in cell cell adhesion cell matrix interactions macrophage activation angiogenesis metastasis apoptosis galectin 3 is encoded by a single gene lgals3 located on chromosome 14 locus q21 q22 galectin 3 is expressed in the nucleus cytoplasm mitochondrion cell surface and extracellular space galectin 3 has an affinity for beta galactosides and exhibits antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi this protein has been shown to be involved in the following biological processes cell adhesion cell activation and chemoattraction cell growth and differentiation cell cycle and apoptosis given galectin 3 s broad biological functionality it has been demonstrated to be involved in cancer inflammation and fibrosis heart disease and stroke studies have also shown that the expression of galectin 3 is implicated in a variety of processes associated with heart failure including myofibroblast proliferation fibrogenesis tissue

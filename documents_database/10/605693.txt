published in 1998 by the angiosperm phylogeny group it was replaced by the improved apg ii in 2003 apg iii system in 2009 and apg iv system in 2016 the original apg system is unusual in being based not on total evidence but on the cladistic analysis of the dna sequences of three genes two chloroplast genes and one gene coding for ribosomes although based on molecular evidence only its constituent groups prove to be supported by other evidence as well for example pollen morphology supports the split between the eudicots and the rest of the former dicotyledons the system is rather controversial in its decisions at the family level splitting a number of long established families and submerging some other families it also is unusual in not using botanical names above the level of order that is an order is the highest rank that will have a formal botanical name in this system higher groups are defined only as clades with names such as monocots eudicots rosids asterids the apg system was superseded in 2003 by a revision the apg ii system in 2009 by a next revision the apg iii system and then in 2016 by a further

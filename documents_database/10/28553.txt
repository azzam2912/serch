it is broadly used in telecommunications and computer networking and especially in cryptography protocol developers define data structures in asn 1 modules which are generally a section of a broader standards document written in the asn 1 language the advantage is that the asn 1 description of the data encoding is independent of a particular computer or programming language other than asn 1 because asn 1 is both human readable and machine readable an asn 1 compiler can compile modules into libraries of code codecs that decode or encode the data structures some asn 1 compilers can produce code to encode or decode several encodings e g packed ber or xml asn 1 is a joint standard of the international telecommunication union telecommunication standardization sector itu t and iso iec originally defined in 1984 as part of ccitt x 409 1984 in 1988 asn 1 moved to its own standard x 208 due to wide applicability the substantially revised 1995 version is covered by the x 680 series the latest revision of the x 680 series of recommendations is the 5 0 edition published in 2015 asn 1 is a data type declaration notation it does not define how to

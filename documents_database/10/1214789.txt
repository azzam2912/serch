the use of coaxial cable for ethernet has been deprecated by 2011 research in ethernet transmission over coaxial cable continued as both consumers and telecommunications operators strive to use existing 75 ohm coaxial cable installations from cable television or catv to carry broadband data into and through the home and into multiple dwelling unit mdu installations most eoc technologies are being developed for in home or on premises networking and are expected to be operated within the domain of a single operator the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee maintains all official ethernet standards in the 802 x family of protocols active work in ethernet over coax is ongoing homeplug av as well as the its later extension homeplug av2 both operate in a portions of the rf spectrum directly below what is commonly used for terrestrial fm radio broadcasting homeplug av uses bpsk qpsk 16 qam 64 qam 256 qam and 1024 qam modulation strategies between 2 mhz and 30 mhz while the more recent homeplug av2 standard extends the upper bound of its spectral use to 86 mhz the itu t g hn standard provides high speed up to 1 gigabit s local area networking over existing

c p miller it was originally developed to compute tables of the modified bessel function but also applies to bessel functions of the first kind and has other applications such as computation of the coefficients of chebyshev expansions of other special functions many families of special functions satisfy a recurrence relation that relates the values of the functions of different orders with common argument formula 1 the modified bessel functions of the first kind formula 2 satisfy the recurrence relation however the modified bessel functions of the second kind formula 4 also satisfy the same recurrence relation the first solution decreases rapidly with formula 6 the second solution increases rapidly with formula 6 miller s algorithm provides a numerically stable procedure to obtain the decreasing solution to compute the terms of a recurrence formula 8 through formula 9 according to miller s algorithm one first chooses a value formula 10 much larger than formula 11 and computes a trial solution taking initial conditionformula 12 to an arbitrary non zero value such as 1 and taking formula 13 and later terms to be zero then the recurrence relation is used to successively compute trial values for formula 14 formula 15 down

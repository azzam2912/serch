this state of little or no morphological change is called stasis when significant evolutionary change occurs the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species rather than one species gradually transforming into another punctuated equilibrium is commonly contrasted against phyletic gradualism the idea that evolution generally occurs uniformly and by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages called anagenesis in this view evolution is seen as generally smooth and continuous in 1972 paleontologists niles eldredge and stephen jay gould published a landmark paper developing their theory and called it punctuated equilibria their paper built upon ernst mayr s model of geographic speciation i michael lerner s theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis and their own empirical research eldredge and gould proposed that the degree of gradualism commonly attributed to charles darwin is virtually nonexistent in the fossil record and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species punctuated equilibrium originated as a logical consequence of ernst mayr s concept of genetic revolutions by allopatric and especially peripatric speciation as applied to the fossil record although

as such the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner a geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeated like a wallpaper design any of the senses may directly observe patterns conversely abstract patterns in science mathematics or language may be observable only by analysis direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns which are widespread in nature and in art visual patterns in nature are often chaotic never exactly repeating and often involve fractals natural patterns include spirals meanders waves foams tilings cracks and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection patterns have an underlying mathematical structure indeed mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern similarly in the sciences theories explain and predict regularities in the world in art and architecture decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer in computer science a software design pattern is a known solution to a class of problems in programming in fashion the pattern is a template used to create any number of similar garments nature provides examples

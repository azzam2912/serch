treating the coupling of the structure deformations and the fluid flow poses a number of challenging problems for numerical simulations the elastic boundary changes the flow of the fluid and the fluid moves the elastic boundary simultaneously in the immersed boundary method the fluid is represented on an eulerian coordinate and the structure is represented on a lagrangian coordinate for newtonian fluids governed by the incompressible navier stokes equations the fluid equations are and in case of incompressible fluids assuming constant density we have the condition the immersed structures are typically represented as a collection of one dimensional fibers denoted by formula 3 each fiber can be viewed as a parametric curve formula 4 where formula 5 is the parameter and formula 6 is time physics of the fiber is represented via the fiber force distribution formula 7 spring forces bending resistance or any other type of behavior can be built into this term the force exerted by the structure on the fluid is then interpolated as a source term in the momentum equation using where formula 9 is the dirac function the forcing can be extended to multiple dimensions to model elastic surfaces or three dimensional solids assuming a

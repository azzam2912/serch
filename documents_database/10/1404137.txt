the white spotting produced can range from flashy white markings like those made by w20 to patterns similar to sabino 1 to a fully white or almost fully white horse white horses are born with unpigmented pink skin and white hair usually with dark eyes under normal conditions at least one parent must be dominant white to produce dominant white offspring however most of the currently known alleles of dominant white can be linked to a documented spontaneous mutation in a single ancestor for many of the w alleles the white coats are as the name suggests inherited dominantly meaning that a horse only needs one copy of the allele to have a white or white spotted coat others such as w20 are incompletely dominant with horses with two copies having more white than horses with only one in addition different alleles which on their own give a white spotted but not completely white horse such as w5 and w10 can combine to make a horse completely white white can occur in any breed and has been studied in many different breeds camarillo white horses are characterized by their white coats white is both genetically and visually distinct from gray

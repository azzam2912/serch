lng gasification plants can be located on land as well as on floating barges floating barge mounted plants have the advantage that they can be towed to new offshore locations for better usage in response to changes in the business environment in a conventional lng is heated by sea water to convert it to natural gas methane gas in addition to regasification many valuable industrial byproducts can be produced using cold energy of lng cold energy of lng utilisation for extracting liquid oxygen and nitrogen gas from air makes lng regasification plants more viable when they are located near integrated steel plants and or urea plants cold energy of lng usage in lieu of massive and energy intensive cryogenic refrigeration units in natural gas processing plants is also more viable economically the natural gas processed with cold energy of lng and the imported lng can be readily injected into a conventional natural gas distribution system to reach the ultimate consumers the cold energy of lng can be used for cooling the exhaust fluid of the gas turbine which is working in closed joule cycle with argon gas as fluid thus near 100 conversion efficiency to electricity is achieved for the

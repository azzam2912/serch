james watt developed the design sporadically from 1763 to 1775 with support from matthew boulton watt s design saved so much more fuel compared with earlier designs that they were licensed based on the amount of fuel they would save watt never ceased developing the steam engine introducing double acting designs with two cylinders and various systems for taking off rotary power watt s design became synonymous with steam engines and it was many years before significantly new designs began to replace the basic watt design the first steam engines introduced by thomas newcomen in 1712 were of the atmospheric design at the end of the power stroke the weight of the object being moved by the engine pulled the piston to the top of the cylinder as steam was introduced then the cylinder was cooled by a spray of water which caused the steam to condense forming a partial vacuum in the cylinder atmospheric pressure on the top of the piston pushed it down lifting the work object watt noticed that it required significant amounts of heat to warm the cylinder back up to the point where steam could enter the cylinder without immediately condensing when the cylinder was

the three main examples are the circular orthogonal ensemble coe on symmetric unitary matrices the circular unitary ensemble cue on unitary matrices and the circular symplectic ensemble cse on self dual unitary quaternionic matrices the distribution of the unitary circular ensemble cue n is the haar measure on the unitary group u n if u is a random element of cue n then uu is a random element of coe n if u is a random element of cue 2n then uu is a random element of cse n where each element of a circular ensemble is a unitary matrix so it has eigenvalues on the unit circle formula 2 with formula 3 for k 1 2 n where the formula 4 are also known as eigenangles or eigenphases in the cse each of these n eigenvalues appears twice the distributions have densities with respect to the eigenangles given by on formula 6 symmetrized version where 1 for coe 2 for cue and 4 for cse the normalisation constant z is given by as can be verified via selberg s integral formula or weyl s integral formula for compact lie groups generalizations of the circular ensemble restrict the matrix elements

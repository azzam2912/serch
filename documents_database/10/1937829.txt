the distance between a reference point on the surface of the earth relative to these objects can be expressed as an infinite combination of periods and as the distance changes so does the tidal forcing an analysis of the changing distance by pierre simon de laplace in the 18th century shows that these periods at which gravity varies cluster into three species the semi diurnal and diurnal tide constituents which have periods of a day or less and the long period tidal constituents see also tide long period tidal constituents with relatively strong forcing include the lunar fortnightly mf and monthly ms as well as the solar semiannual ssa and annual sa constituents in addition to having periods longer than a day long period tidal forcing is distinguished from that of the first and second species by being zonally symmetric the long period tides are also distinguished by the way in which the oceans respond in contrast to the first and second species the long period tidal forcings occur sufficiently slowly that they do not excite surface gravity waves this property of exciting surface gravity waves is responsible for the high amplitude semi diurnal tides in the bay of fundy

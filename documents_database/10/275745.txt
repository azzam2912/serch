it was designed to carry ironstone from edge hill quarries to burton dassett where a junction was made with the stratford upon avon and midland junction railway it was never officially opened but began operating in 1922 in the middle of the line there was a cable worked inclined plane at 1 in 6 16 as the quarry was at the top of the incline the incline could be worked as self acting the weight of full ore wagons descending was sufficient to draw the empties back up within three years it was found that the iron ore deposits were uneconomic and the line ceased operating in 1925 it was not dismantled until 1946 a caretaker was employed until the late 1930s in the possibility that the line could be re opened in 1942 permanent way from the lower portion of the line was requisitioned for the construction of long marston army depot this had the effect of isolating the line and the remaining stock at the top of the incline from the main line and so they survived there until 1946

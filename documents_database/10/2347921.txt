his work principally in the nematode c elegans has used an interdisciplinary approach to investigate how small groups of neurons generate behavior and he has pioneered methodological approaches including optogenetic neuroimaging and automated behavioural phenotyping that have been widely influential in the broader neuroscience field he has made significant discoveries on the functional properties of ionotropic receptors in sensory transduction and on the roles of gap junctions and extrasynaptic modulation in neuronal microcircuits more recently he has applied theoretical ideas from network science and control theory to investigate the structure and function of simple neuronal connectomes with the goal of understanding conserved computational principles in larger brains he is an embo member welcome investigator and fellow of the academy of medical sciences schafer trained as a geneticist and biochemist at the university of california berkeley under the supervision of jasper rine during his phd research he discovered that caax box proteins in yeast including ras are prenlyated and showed that this modification is essential for membrane targeting and biological activity as a postdoc in the lab of cynthia kenyon he discovered that dopamine inhibits locomotion in c elegans and identified the first neuronal calcium channel mutant in a screen for

during adrenarche the adrenal glands secrete increased levels of weak adrenal androgens including dehydroepiandrosterone dhea dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate dhea s and androstenedione a4 but without increased cortisol levels adrenarche is the result of the development of a new zone of the adrenal cortex the zona reticularis adrenarche is a process related to puberty but distinct from hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis hpg axis maturation and function adrenarche occurs between the ages of 5 and 20 years after the first year of life the adrenal glands secrete very low levels of adrenal androgens adrenarche occurs on average at age 6 to 8 years and precedes puberty by about 2 years it continues throughout puberty with adrenal androgen levels progressively increasing until reaching maximal levels in young adulthood around the age of 20 years circulating dhea s levels specifically peak in humans at about age 19 or 20 years in females and around age 20 to 24 years in males levels of corticosteroids like cortisol do not change with adrenarche an initiator of adrenarche has not yet been identified researchers have unsuccessfully tried to identify a new pituitary peptide to be called adrenal androgen stimulating hormone others have proposed that adrenarchal maturation is a

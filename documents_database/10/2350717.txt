saddle point problems arise in the discretization of stokes flow and in the mixed finite element discretization of poisson s equation for positive definite problems like the unmixed formulation of the poisson equation most discretization schemes will converge to the true solution in the limit as the mesh is refined for saddle point problems however many discretizations are unstable giving rise to artifacts such as spurious oscillations the lbb condition gives criteria for when a discretization of a saddle point problem is stable the abstract form of a saddle point problem can be expressed in terms of hilbert spaces and bilinear forms let formula 1 and formula 2 be hilbert spaces and let formula 3 formula 4 be bilinear forms let formula 5 formula 6 where formula 7 formula 8 are the dual spaces the saddle point problem for the pair formula 9 formula 10 is to find a pair of fields formula 11 in formula 1 formula 13 in formula 2 such that for all formula 15 in formula 1 and formula 17 in formula 2 for example for the stokes equations on a formula 20 dimensional domain formula 21 the fields are the velocity formula 11 and pressure

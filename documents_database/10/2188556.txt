the sister group relationship between the choanoflagellates and animals has important implications for the origin of the animals the clade was identified in 2015 by graham budd and s ren jensen who used the name apoikozoa the 2018 revision of the classification first proposed by the international society of protistologists in 2012 recommends the use of the name choanozoa a close relationship between choanoflagellates and animals has long been recognised dating back at least to the 1840s a particularly striking and famous similarity between the single celled choanoflagellates and multicellular animals is provided by the collar cells of sponges and the overall morphology of the choanoflagellate cell the relationship has since been confirmed by multiple molecular analyses this proposed homology was however been thrown into some doubt in 2013 by the still controversial suggestion that ctenophores and not sponges are the sister group to all other animals more recent genomic work has suggested that choanoflagellates possess some of the important genetic machinery necessary for the multicellularity found in animals a synonym for the choanozoa apoikozoa derives from the ancient greek for colony and animal referring to the ability of both animals and some choanoflagellates to form multicellular units while animals

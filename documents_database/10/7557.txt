an important special case is when an endomorphism of sometimes the term linear operator refers to this case in another convention linear operator allows and to differ while requiring them to be real vector spaces sometimes the term linear function has the same meaning as linear map while in analytic geometry it does not a linear map always maps linear subspaces onto linear subspaces possibly of a lower dimension for instance it maps a plane through the origin to a plane straight line or point linear maps can often be represented as matrices and simple examples include rotation and reflection linear transformations in the language of abstract algebra a linear map is a module homomorphism in the language of category theory it is a morphism in the category of modules over a given ring let formula 1 and formula 2 be vector spaces over the same field formula 3 a function formula 4 is said to be a linear map if for any two vectors formula 5 and any scalar formula 6 the following two conditions are satisfied thus a linear map is said to be operation preserving in other words it does not matter whether the linear map is

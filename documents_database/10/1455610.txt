if formula 1 is an integer then an n ary fcsr of length formula 2 is a finite state device with a state formula 3 consisting of a vector of elements formula 4 in formula 5 and an integer formula 6 the state change operation is determined by a set of coefficients formula 7 and is defined as follows compute formula 8 express s as formula 9 with formula 10 in formula 11 then the new state is formula 12 by iterating the state change an fcsr generates an infinite eventually periodic sequence of numbers in formula 11 fcsrs have been used in the design of stream ciphers such as the f fcsr generator in the cryptanalysis of the summation combiner stream cipher the reason goresky and klapper invented them and in generating pseudorandom numbers for quasi monte carlo under the name multiply with carry mwc generator invented by couture and l ecuyer generalizing work of marsaglia and zaman fcsrs are analyzed using number theory associated with the fcsr is a connection integer formula 14 associated with the output sequence is the n adic number formula 15 the fundamental theorem of fcsrs says that there is an integer formula 16

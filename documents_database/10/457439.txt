its name is derived from the greek g rontos old man in reference to the bald head of these dark plumaged birds in english they are called bald ibises the genus was erected by the german naturalist johann georg wagler in 1832 the type species was subsequently designated as the southern bald ibis geronticus calvus like most ibises they are gregarious long legged wading birds with long down curved bills they form one subfamily of the threskiornithidae the other subfamily being the spoonbills the two geronticus species differ from other ibises in that they have unfeathered faces and heads breed on cliffs rather than in trees and prefer arid habitats to the wetlands used by their relatives their food contains fewer aquatic animals and more terrestrial ones they are known to gather together and feed on locust swarms killing many of these notorious pests this has also contributed to their decline however as they were much affected by indiscriminate pesticide spraying in the mid to late 20th century leading to their disappearance from many regions geronticus perplexus is by far the oldest fossil assigned to the present genus it is known only from a piece of distal right humerus found

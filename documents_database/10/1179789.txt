causes can be food price rises harvest failures incompetent food storage transport problems food speculation hoarding poisoning of food or attacks by pests hence the pathway between food related issues such as crop failure price hike or volatility and an actual riot is often complex some argue that volatile and high food price are just part of a perfect storm combining with climate change population growth resource scarcity and urbanization leading to social unrest when the public becomes too desperate in such conditions they may attack shops farms homes or government buildings to attain bread or other staple foods such as grain or salt as in the 1977 egyptian bread riots often it is more than an issue of hunger and the need to obtain bread for immediate caloric satisfaction food riots are part of a larger social movement such as the russian revolution or the french revolution thus in places with low political freedom there is an increased likelihood for social unrest when food prices are volatile or suddenly rise historically women have been heavily involved in leading food riots food riots have thus served as a form of female political action even in societies without women s suffrage

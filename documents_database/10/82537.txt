dirichlet characters are used to define dirichlet l functions which are meromorphic functions with a variety of interesting analytic properties if formula 2 is a dirichlet character one defines its dirichlet l series by where s is a complex number with real part 1 by analytic continuation this function can be extended to a meromorphic function on the whole complex plane dirichlet l functions are generalizations of the riemann zeta function and appear prominently in the generalized riemann hypothesis dirichlet characters are named in honour of peter gustav lejeune dirichlet they were later generalized by erich hecke to hecke characters also known as gr ssencharacter we say that a function formula 2 from the integers formula 5 to the complex numbers formula 6 is a dirichlet character if it has the following properties from this definition several other properties can be deduced by property 3 1 1 1 1 1 since gcd 1 k 1 property 2 says 1 0 so properties 3 and 4 show that every dirichlet character is completely multiplicative property 1 says that a character is periodic with period k we say that formula 2 is a character to the modulus k this is equivalent to

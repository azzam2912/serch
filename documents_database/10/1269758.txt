physically this measures the extent of spatial localization of the reference electron and provides a method for the mapping of electron pair probability in multielectronic systems elf s usefulness stems from the observation that it allows electron localization to be analyzed in a chemically intuitive way for example the shell structure of heavy atoms is obvious when plotting elf against the radial distance from the nucleus the elf for radon for example has six clear maxima whereas the electronic density decreases monotonically and the radially weighted density fails to show all shells when applied to molecules an analysis of the elf shows a clear separation between the core and valence electron and also shows covalent bonds and lone pairs in what has been called a faithful visualization of vsepr theory in action another feature of the elf is that it is invariant with respect to transformation of the molecular orbitals the elf was originally defined by becke and edgecombe in 1990 they first argued that a measure of the electron localization is provided by where is the electron spin density and the kinetic energy density the second term negative term is the bosonic kinetic energy density so d is the

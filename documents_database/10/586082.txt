radon is a significant contributor to environmental radioactivity mitigation of radon in the air is accomplished through ventilation either collected below a concrete floor slab or a membrane on the ground or by increasing the air changes per hour in the building treatment systems using aeration or activated charcoal are available to remove radon from domestic water supplies the first step in mitigation is testing to see if the indoor air and or domestic water radon concentrations should be reduced no level of radiation is considered completely safe but it cannot be totally eliminated so governments around the world have set various action levels to provide guidance on when radon concentrations should be reduced while recognizing that radon cannot be eliminated the world health organization s international radon project has recommended an action level of 2 7 pci l for radon in the air radon in the air is considered to be a larger health threat than radon in domestic water so the us environmental protection agency recommendation is to not test for radon in water unless a radon in air test is above the action level however some us states such as maine where radon levels are higher than

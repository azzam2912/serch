it has facilities for user defined operator syntax macros arbitrary precision arithmetic multiple precision numbers and compiling to native code through the llvm pure is free and open source software distributed mostly under the gnu lesser general public license version 3 or later pure comes with an interpreter and debugger provides automatic memory management has powerful functional and symbolic programming abilities and interfaces to libraries in c e g for numerics low level protocols and other such tasks at the same time pure is a small language designed from scratch its interpreter is not large and the library modules are written in pure the syntax of pure resembles that of miranda and haskell but it is a free format language and thus uses explicit delimiters rather than off side rule indents to denote program structure the pure language is a successor of the equational programming language q previously created by the same author albert gr f at the university of mainz germany relative to q it offers some important new features such as local functions with lexical scoping efficient vector and matrix support and the built in c interface and programs run much faster as they are compiled just in

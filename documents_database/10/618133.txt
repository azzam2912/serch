in logic programming we give a computer a set of facts and a set of inference rules about how these facts relate there are several different ways that we might want the computer to apply these rules the well founded semantics is one of these ways the well founded semantics was defined by van gelder et al in a 1991 paper the well founded semantics can be viewed as a three valued version of the stable model semantics instead of only assigning propositions true or false it also allows for a value representing ignorance for example if we know that codice 1 but we do not know whether or not specimen a flies during the day the well founded semantics would assign the proposition specimen a is a moth the value bottom which is neither true nor false the well founded semantics is also a way of making safe inferences in the presence of contradictory data such as noisy data or data acquired from different experts who may posit differing opinions many two valued semantics simply won t consider such a problem state workable the well founded semantics however has a built in mechanism to circumvent the presence of the

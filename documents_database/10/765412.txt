it differs from gene therapy in that gene modulation seeks to alter the expression of an endogenous gene perhaps through the introduction of a gene encoding a novel modulatory protein whereas gene therapy concerns the introduction of a gene whose product aids the recipient directly modulation of gene expression can be mediated at the level of transcription by dna binding agents which may be artificial transcription factors small molecules or synthetic oligonucleotides it may also be mediated post transcriptionally through rna interference an approach to therapeutic modulation utilizes agents that modulate endogenous transcription by specifically targeting those genes at the gdna level the advantage to this approach over modulation at the mrna or protein level is that every cell contains only a single gdna copy thus the target copy number is significantly lower allowing the drugs to theoretically be administered at much lower doses this approach also offers several advantages over traditional gene therapy directly targeting endogenous transcription should yield correct relative expression of splice variants in contrast traditional gene therapy typically introduces a gene which can express only one transcript rather than a set of stoichiometrically expressed spliced transcript variants additionally virally introduced genes can be targeted for gene

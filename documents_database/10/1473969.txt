sic tic or ternary carbides also known as max phases e g tialc tisic cdcs have also been derived from polymer derived ceramics such as si o c or ti c and carbonitrides such as si n c cdcs can occur in various structures ranging from amorphous to crystalline carbon from sp to sp bonded and from highly porous to fully dense among others the following carbon structures have been derived from carbide precursors micro and mesoporous carbon amorphous carbon carbon nanotubes onion like carbon nanocrystalline diamond graphene and graphite among carbon materials microporous cdcs exhibit some of the highest reported specific surface areas up to more than 3000 m g by varying the type of the precursor and the cdc synthesis conditions microporous and mesoporous structures with controllable average pore size and pore size distributions can be produced depending on the precursor and the synthesis conditions the average pore size control can be applied at sub angstrom accuracy this ability to precisely tune the size and shapes of pores makes cdcs attractive for selective sorption and storage of liquids and gases e g hydrogen methane co and the high electric conductivity and electrochemical stability allows these structures to be

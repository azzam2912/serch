it has not yet been synthesized without substituents but it is predicted to be kinetically stable in spite of its angle strain some stable derivatives including tetra tert butyl tetrahedrane a hydrocarbon and tetra trimethylsilyl tetrahedrane have been produced cubane ch has been synthesized although it has high angle strain cubane is quite kinetically stable due to a lack of readily available decomposition paths angle strain would make an octahedron highly unstable due to inverted tetrahedral geometry at each vertex there would also be no hydrogen atoms because four edges meet at each corner thus the hypothetical octahedrane molecule would be an allotrope of elemental carbon c and not a hydrocarbon the existence of octahedrane cannot be ruled out completely although calculations have shown that it is unlikely dodecahedrane ch has been synthesized and has almost zero angle strain the tetravalency 4 connectedness of carbon excludes an icosahedron because 5 edges meet at each vertex true pentavalent carbon is unlikely methanium nominally usually exists as the hypothetical icosahedral lacks hydrogen so it is not a hydrocarbon it is also an ion both icosahedral and octahedral structures have been observed in boron compounds such as the dodecaborate ion and some of

electromagnetic radiation from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a prism or diffraction grating into a spectrum exhibiting the rainbow of colors interspersed with spectral lines each line indicates a particular chemical element or molecule with the line strength indicating the abundance of that element the strengths of the different spectral lines vary mainly due to the temperature of the photosphere although in some cases there are true abundance differences the spectral class of a star is a short code primarily summarizing the ionization state giving an objective measure of the photosphere s temperature most stars are currently classified under the morgan keenan mk system using the letters o b a f g k and m a sequence from the hottest o type to the coolest m type each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with 0 being hottest and 9 being coolest e g a8 a9 f0 and f1 form a sequence from hotter to cooler the sequence has been expanded with classes for other stars and star like objects that do not fit in the classical system such as class d for white dwarfs and classes s and c for carbon stars in

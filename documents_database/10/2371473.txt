that is differentiable manifolds that can be differentiated enough times for the purposes on this page formula 5 formula 6 denote one point on each of the manifolds the boundary of a manifold formula 7 is a manifold formula 8 which has dimension formula 9 an orientation on formula 7 induces an orientation on formula 8 we usually denote a submanifold by formula 12 formula 13 is the tangent bundle of the smooth manifold formula 1 formula 15 formula 16 denote the tangent spaces of formula 1 formula 2 at the points formula 19 formula 20 respectively sections of the tangent bundles also known as vector fields are typically denoted as formula 21 such that at a point formula 5 we have formula 23 given an inner product formula 24 on each formula 15 the manifold becomes a riemannian manifold we call formula 26 the signature of the metric a riemannian manifold has formula 27 whereas minkowski space has formula 28 formula 29 forms are differential forms defined on formula 13 we denote the set of all formula 29 forms as formula 32 for formula 33 we usually write formula 34 formula 35 formula 36 formula 37 forms formula 38

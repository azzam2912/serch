he was professor of applied physics at stanford university and the wolf prize in physics recipient in 1984 5 conyers herring completed his ph d in physics from princeton university in 1937 submitting a dissertation entitled on energy coincidences in the theory of brillouin zones under the direction of eugene wigner in 1946 he joined the technical staff of bell laboratories in murray hill new jersey where he remained until 1978 then he joined the faculty at stanford university conyers herring played a major role in the development of solid state physics he laid the foundations of band structure calculations of metals and semiconductors culminating in the discovery of the orthogonalized plane wave method o p w in 1940 he was years ahead of his time in this contribution a great deal of modern solid state physics as produced today stems from this original and early paper his influence on the development of solid state physics extends to a deep understanding of many facets such as surface physics of thermionic emission of transport phenomena in semiconductors and of collective excitations in solids such as spin waves he created the theoretical physics division at bell telephone laboratory because of this the

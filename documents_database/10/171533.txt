they have found wide use in studies of genetics toxicity screening nutrition and gene expression particularly to express recombinant proteins cho cells are the most commonly used mammalian hosts for industrial production of recombinant protein therapeutics chinese hamsters had been used in research since 1919 where they were used in place of mice for typing pneumococci they were subsequently found to be excellent vectors for transmission of kala azar visceral leishmaniasis facilitating leishmania research in 1948 the chinese hamster was first used in the united states for breeding in research laboratories in 1957 theodore t puck obtained a female chinese hamster from dr george yerganian s laboratory at the boston cancer research foundation and used it to derive the original chinese hamster ovary cho cell line since then cho cells have been a cell line of choice because of their rapid growth in suspension culture and high protein production having a very low chromosome number 2n 22 for a mammal the chinese hamster is also a good model for radiation cytogenetics and tissue culture all cho cell lines are deficient in proline synthesis also cho cells do not express the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr which makes them ideal in

the complex is exposed across 30 miles 48 km of the north flank of the beartooth mountain range the complex has extensive reserves of chromium ore and has a history of being mined for chromium more recent mining activity has produced palladium and other platinum group elements the stillwater complex is a large layered intrusion with many similarities to the bushveld igneous complex of south africa the complex was intruded into existing gneisses during the archean at about 2700 ma host rocks on the northern side are archean sedimentary rocks while the southern boundary includes precambrian rocks of granite granite gneiss and schist the precambrian rock on its southern side is mostly provided by the beartooth mountains the region had a quartz monzonite intrusion and underwent extensive metamorphism faulting and folding during the archean at about 2500 mya the area was intruded by north trending mafic dikes before being unconformably covered by a middle cambrian sedimentary rock sequence the intrusion forms a linear body stretching some 30 miles 48 km and striking roughly n 60 w and dipping from 50 to near 90 to the northeast the exposed thickness is around 18 000 feet 5500 m with an additional estimated

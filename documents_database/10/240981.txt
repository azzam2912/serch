it was one of several passenger rail stations that served pittsburgh during the 20th century other stations included the pittsburgh lake erie railroad station the baltimore and ohio station and wabash pittsburgh terminal and it is the only surviving station in active use the current station replaced the original union station destroyed in 1877 unlike many union stations built in the u s to serve the needs of more than one railroad this facility connected the pennsylvania railroad with several subsidiary lines for that reason it was renamed in 1912 to match other pennsylvania stations thus union station is a misnomer as other major passenger rail carriers served travelers at other stations for instance the new york central used pittsburgh lake erie railroad station the wabash railroad used wabash pittsburgh terminal and the baltimore and ohio railroad used both the baltimore and ohio station and the pittsburgh lake erie railroad station the station building was designed by chicago architect daniel burnham and built 1898 1904 the materials were a grayish brown terra cotta that looked like brownstone and brick though burnham is regarded more as a planner and organizer rather than a designer of details which were left to draftsmen

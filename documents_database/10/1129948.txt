they are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of rna secondary structure such as translation initiation nuclear and mitochondrial splicing and ribosome and spliceosome assembly based on their distribution patterns some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis spermatogenesis and cellular growth and division this gene encodes a dead box protein which interacts specifically with hepatitis c virus core protein resulting a change in intracellular location this gene has a homolog located in the nonrecombining region of the y chromosome the protein sequence is 91 identical between this gene and the y linked homolog ddx3x is involved in many different types of cancer for example it is abnormally expressed in breast epithelial cancer cells in which its expression is activated by during increased expression of ddx3x by hif1a in hypoxia is initiated by the direct binding of hif1a to the hif1a as verified with and since the expression of ddx3x is affected by the activity of hif1a the co localization of these proteins has also been demonstrated in mda mb 231 tumor samples in ddx3x is reported to control cell cycle progression through more specifically ddx3x was shown to directly bind to the

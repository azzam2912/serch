some personal computer chipset manufacturers overcome this bottleneck by providing multiple usb 2 0 controllers within the southbridge according to routine testing performed by cnet write operations to typical hi speed hard drives can sustain rates of 25 30 mb s while read operations are at 30 42 mb s this is 70 of the total available bus bandwidth for usb 3 0 typical write speed is 70 90 mb s while read speed is 90 110 mb s mask tests also known as eye diagram tests are used to determine the quality of a signal in the time domain they are defined in the referenced document as part of the electrical test description for the high speed hs mode at 480 mbit s according to a usb if chairman at least 10 to 15 percent of the stated peak 60 mb s 480 mbit s of hi speed usb goes to overhead the communication protocol between the card and the peripheral overhead is a component of all connectivity standards tables illustrating the transfer limits are shown in chapter 5 of the usb spec for isochronous devices like audio streams the bandwidth is constant and reserved exclusively for a given

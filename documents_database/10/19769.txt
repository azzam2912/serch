animals with indirect development such as insects amphibians or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle the larva s appearance is generally very different from the adult form e g caterpillars and butterflies including different unique structures and organs that do not occur in the adult form their diet may also be considerably different larvae are frequently adapted to environments separate from adults for example some larvae such as tadpoles live almost exclusively in aquatic environments but can live outside water as adult frogs by living in a distinct environment larvae may be given shelter from predators and reduce competition for resources with the adult population animals in the larval stage will consume food to fuel their transition into the adult form in some species like barnacles adults are immobile but their larvae are mobile and use their mobile larval form to distribute themselves some larvae are dependent on adults to feed them in many eusocial hymenoptera species the larvae are fed by female workers in ropalidia marginata a paper wasp the males are also capable of feeding larvae but they are much less efficient spending more time and getting less food to the larvae the larvae

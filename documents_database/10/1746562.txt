isocitrate dehydrogenases catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2 oxoglutarate these enzymes belong to two distinct subclasses one of which uses nad as the electron acceptor and the other nadp five isocitrate dehydrogenases have been reported three nad dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases which localize to the mitochondrial matrix and two nadp dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases one of which is mitochondrial and the other predominantly cytosolic each nadp dependent isozyme is a homodimer the protein encoded by this gene is the nadp dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase found in the cytoplasm and peroxisomes it contains the pts 1 peroxisomal targeting signal sequence the presence of this enzyme in peroxisomes suggests roles in the regeneration of nadph for intraperoxisomal reductions such as the conversion of 2 4 dienoyl coas to 3 enoyl coas as well as in peroxisomal reactions that consume 2 oxoglutarate namely the alpha hydroxylation of phytanic acid the cytoplasmic enzyme serves a significant role in cytoplasmic nadph production alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene provided by refseq sep 2013 idh1 is one of three isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes the other two being idh2 and idh3 and encoded by one of five isocitrate dehydrogenase genes which

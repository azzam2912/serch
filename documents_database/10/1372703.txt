it is part of the phred phrap consed package phrap was originally developed by prof phil green for the assembly of cosmids in large scale cosmid shotgun sequencing within the human genome project phrap has been widely used for many different sequence assembly projects including bacterial genome assemblies and est assemblies phrap was written as a command line program for easy integration into automated data workflows in genome sequencing centers for users who want to use phrap from a graphical interface the commercial programs macvector for mac os x only and codoncode aligner for mac os x and microsoft windows are available a detailed albeit partially outdated description of the phrap algorithms can be found in the phrap documentation a recurring thread within the phrap algorithms is the use of phred quality scores phrap used quality scores to mitigate a problem that other assembly programs had struggled with at the beginning of the human genome project correctly assembling frequent imperfect repeats in particular alu sequences phrap uses quality scores to tell if any observed differences in repeated regions are likely to be due to random ambiguities in the sequencing process or more likely to be due to the sequences being

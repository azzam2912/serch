in 1941 geoffrey heighway invented and marketed a new concept in card models he took the available concept of card models and miniaturized them so that an entire train or building could be wrapped in a packet of post cards these packets usually sold for about a shilling or pocket change when he released his product in the 1940s it caught on and micro modeling became a national pastime the slogan your workshop in a cigar box is still widely quoted today among paper modelers their other slogan was three dimensional volumetric during the war years the models were especially popular as they were extremely portable and builders were able to work on them anywhere anecdotes say people liked them because they were small enough to take with you so if you got stuck in a bomb shelter during an air raid you had something interesting to do several of the railway micromodels were distributed in australia in the form of small stapled books rather than individual postcards the subjects of original micromodels included among other things trains planes ships boats buildings cars and a dragon there were 82 original micromodel packets from these packets one could make up 121

equation the equation is where h is the enthalpy t the absolute temperature and g the gibbs free energy of the system all at constant pressure p the equation states that the change in the g t ratio at constant pressure as a result of an infinitesimally small change in temperature is a factor h t the typical applications are to chemical reactions the equation reads with g as the change in gibbs energy and h as the enthalpy change considered independent of temperature the o denotes standard pressure 1 bar integrating with respect to t again p is constant it becomes this equation quickly enables the calculation of the gibbs free energy change for a chemical reaction at any temperature t with knowledge of just the standard gibbs free energy change of formation and the standard enthalpy change of formation for the individual components also using the reaction isotherm equation that is which relates the gibbs energy to a chemical equilibrium constant the van t hoff equation can be derived the definition of the gibbs function is where h is the enthalpy defined by taking differentials of each definition to find dh and dg then using the fundamental thermodynamic

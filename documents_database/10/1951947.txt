native species being considered having optimum ecological resilience for their native environment and the best potential to enhance biodiversity to determine natural vegetation scientists research the original vegetation of a land through retrospective ecology study of past ecosystems allowed to demonstrate for instance that numerous contemporary biotopes like the wild slovenian forests for instance supposedly largely untouched were in fact very remote from their natural vegetation no citation in japan prof akira miyawaki demonstrated after study that on the one hand long supposed native species had in fact been introduced on account of human intervention since over 1000 years especially coniferous being privileged over deciduous on the other hand that reforestation with original species gives good and often spectacular results no citation maps of potential natural vegetation are used worldwide for improved ecosystem comprehension and management us pnv map however the concept is subject to debate on similar grounds as for the climax theory critics argue that ecosystems are not static but ever dynamic as bioclimatic conditions constantly evolve it is illusory to define either a final or a primary stage of vegetation

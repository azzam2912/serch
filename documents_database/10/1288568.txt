the plot can be drawn by hand or by a mechanical or electronic plotter graphs are a visual representation of the relationship between variables which are very useful for humans who can then quickly derive an understanding which may not have come from lists of values graphs can also be used to read off the value of an unknown variable plotted as a function of a known one graphs of functions are used in mathematics sciences engineering technology finance and other areas plots play an important role in statistics and data analysis the procedures here can broadly be split into two parts quantitative and graphical quantitative techniques are the set of statistical procedures that yield numeric or tabular output examples of quantitative techniques include these and similar techniques are all valuable and are mainstream in terms of classical analysis there are also many statistical tools generally referred to as graphical techniques these include graphical procedures such as plots are a short path to gaining insight into a data set in terms of testing assumptions model selection model validation estimator selection relationship identification factor effect determination outlier detection statistical graphics give insight into aspects of the underlying structure of the data

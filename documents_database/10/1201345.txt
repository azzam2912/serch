it is denoted by psin let v v for n 2 be non zero euclidean vectors in n dimensional space that are directed from a vertex of a parallelotope forming the edges of the parallelotope the polar sine of the vertex angle is where the numerator is the determinant equal to the hyper volume of the parallelotope with vector edges and in the denominator the n fold product of the magnitudes v of the vectors equals the hypervolume of the n dimensional hyperrectangle with edges equal to the magnitudes of the vectors v v v not the vectors themselves also see ericksson the parallelotope is like a squashed hyperrectangle so it has less hypervolume than the hyperrectangle meaning see image for the 3d case and since this ratio can be negative psin is always bounded between 1 and 1 by the inequalities as for the ordinary sine with either bound only being reached in case all vectors are mutually orthogonal in case n 2 the polar sine is the ordinary sine of the angle between the two vectors a non negative version of the polar sine exists which works in any dimensional space for in this case the numerator in

these typically have amplitudes of the order of a magnitude for example cassiopeiae is usually about magnitude 2 5 and has varied between magnitudes 1 6 and 3 0 the variations are associated with changes in the spectrum between normal absorption spectra and be star spectra often also including shell star characteristics pleione and cassiopeiae itself are both variable stars that have intermittent shell episodes where strong shell features appear in the spectrum and the brightness increases or decreases significantly at other times the shell is not detectable in the spectrum and even the emission lines may disappear the general catalogue of variable stars gcvs categorises cassiopeiae stars as eruptive variables and describes them as rapidly rotating b class giants or subgiants although many of them are main sequence stars it distinguishes them from those be stars that only show smaller amplitude brightness variations the gcvs uses the code gcas to denote cassiopeiae variables cassiopeiae variables are understood to be hot stars which have equatorial decretion disks which periodically disappear and reform or possibly just change dramatically in scale they are probably all very rapid rotators and most can be classified as be stars they are often also shell stars

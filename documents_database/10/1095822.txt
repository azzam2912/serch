previously the genus was in the family marginellidae where it is still placed by many other malacologists shell minute to small white hyaline spire immersed to low lip thickened smooth or weakly denticulate external varix absent siphonal notch absent posterior notch absent lacking collabral parietal callus ridge columella multiplicate with combined usually 2 to 8 plications plus parietal lirae first plication usually strong and raised mantle smooth at least partially extending over external shell surface the type species of this genus is cystiscus capensis shell minute to small adult length 1 6 mm color white hyaline surface smooth glossy shape usually elliptic obovate or subtriangular weakly shouldered spire completely immersed to low aperture narrow to broad usually wider anteriorly lip slightly to distinctly thickened flared posteriorly in some species smooth on inside edge to weakly denticulate lacking lirae external varix absent shell lacking a siphonal notch and posterior notch shell with weak parietal callus wash or weak parietal callus deposits in some species but lacking collabral parietal callus ridge columella multiplicate with combined total 2 to 8 plications plus parietal lirae rarely to 17 in which the posteriormost are denticles one species with only 1 plication plications usually occupying less

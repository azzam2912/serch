appearing in its modern form in the 19th century the bassoon figures prominently in orchestral concert band and chamber music literature it is known for its distinctive tone colour wide range variety of character and agility one who plays the bassoon is called a bassoonist the word bassoon comes from french basson and from italian bassone basso with the augmentative suffix one however the italian name for the same instrument is fagotto in spanish and romanian it is fagot and in german fagott fagot is an old french word meaning a bundle of sticks the dulcian came to be known as fagotto in italy however the usual etymology that equates fagotto with bundle of sticks is somewhat misleading as the latter term did not come into general use until later however an early english variation faget was used as early as 1450 to refer to firewood 5 which is 100 years before the earliest recorded use of the dulcian 1550 6 further citation is needed to prove the lack of relation between the meaning bundle of sticks and fagotto italian or variants some think it may resemble the roman fasces a standard of bound sticks with an ax 7 8

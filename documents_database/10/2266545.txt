the increments can be seen as defined system capability changes deltas tax n et al 2011 the advantages compared to other incremental development models such as rup and scrum still apply such as short design cycles early testing and managing late requirement changes however idd adds pull to the concept and also has the advantage of optimizing the contents of each increment to allow early integration and testing pull in this context means that information is requested from the user when needed or is planned to be integrated and tested as opposed to delivered when it happens to be ready development planning has to adjust to the optimal order of integration system implementation is driven by what is going to be integrated and tested system design in turn is driven by the planned implementation and requirements by the planned system design steps by doing so artifacts will be delivered just in time thus enabling fast feedback idd is not used instead of other incremental models but rather as an enhancement that will make those models more efficient one obstacle when using idd is to create the integration plan the definition of what to develop and integrate at a given time

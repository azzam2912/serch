in the 10th paper he predicted that the purely electron stellar atmosphere emits a polarized light using thomson law of scattering the theory predicted that 11 percent polarization could be observed at maximum but when this is applied to a spherical star the net polarization effect was found to be zero because of the spherical symmetry but it took another 20 years to explain under what conditions this polarization can be observed j patrick harrington and george w collins ii showed that this symmetry is broken if we consider a rapidly rotating star or a binary star system in which the star is not exactly spherical but slightly oblate due to extreme rotation or tidal distortion in the case of binary system the symmetry is also broken in eclipsing binary star system attempts made to predict this polarization effect were initially unsuccessful but rather led to the prediction of interstellar polarization in 1983 scientists found the first evidence of this polarization effect on the star algol an eclipsing binary star system the polarization on rapidly rotating star was not found until 2017 since it required a high precision polarimeter on september 2017 a team of scientists from australia observed this

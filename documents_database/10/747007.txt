thymopoiesis is the process in the thymus by which thymocytes differentiate into mature t lymphocytes the primary function of thymocytes is the generation of t lymphocytes t cells the thymus provides an inductive environment which allows for the development and selection of physiologically useful t cells the processes of beta selection positive selection and negative selection shape the population of thymocytes into a peripheral pool of t cells that are able to respond to foreign pathogens and are immunologically tolerant towards self antigens thymocytes are classified into a number of distinct maturational stages based on the expression of cell surface markers the earliest thymocyte stage is the double negative stage negative for both cd4 and cd8 which more recently has been better described as lineage negative and which can be divided into four substages the next major stage is the double positive stage positive for both cd4 and cd8 the final stage in maturation is the single positive stage positive for either cd4 or cd8 in human circulating cd34 hematopoietic stem cells hsc reside in bone marrow they produce precursors of t lymphocytes which seed the thymus thus becoming thymocytes and differentiate under influence of the notch and its ligands

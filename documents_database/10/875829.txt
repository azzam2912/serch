the predictors are typically forecasts from a numerical weather prediction nwp model climatic data and if applicable recent surface observations thus output from nwp models can be transformed by the mos technique into sensible weather parameters that are familiar to the person on the street output directly from the nwp model s lowest layer s generally is not used by forecasters because the actual physical processes that occur within the earth s boundary layer are crudely approximated in the model i e physical parameterizations along with its relatively coarse horizontal resolution because of this lack of fidelity and its imperfect initial state forecasts of near surface quantities obtained directly from the model are subject to systematic bias and random model errors which tend to grow with time in the development of mos equations past observations and archived nwp model forecast fields are used with a screening regression to determine the best predictors and their coefficients for a particular predictand and forecast time by using archived model forecast output along with verifying surface observations the resulting equations implicitly take into account physical effects and processes which the underlying numerical weather prediction model cannot explicitly resolve resulting in much better forecasts of

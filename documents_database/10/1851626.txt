it is used for treatment of symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion for which it received fda approval on 17 october 2012 it works by dissolving the proteins that link the vitreous to the macula resulting in posterior detachment of the vitreous from the retina ocriplasmin is an injectable drug that is a truncated form of the human serine protease plasmin the protease plasmin still retains its enzymatic properties ocriplasmin consists of two polypeptide chains that are linked by disulfide bonds additionally the longer peptide chain has four disulfide bonds ocriplasmin is only moderately stable when injected and this is due to autolytic degradation ocriplasmin can degrade various structural proteins including laminin and fibronectin which are localized in the vitreoretinal surface here these two proteins are involved in vitreoretinal attachment ocriplasmin induces posterior vitreous detachment thrombogenics the manufacturer of ocriplasmin encountered several problems when trying to get approval for the drug in 2012 the fda brought up the problem of adverse side effects associated with the drug the fda stated that the adverse effects may not cause long term harm but that conclusion could not be definitively made several days later the fda endorsed ocriplasmin which was still an experimental drug the advisory

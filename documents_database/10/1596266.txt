by changing sodium channel activation the toxin promotes spontaneous and repetitive firing much like pyrethroid insecticides do birtoxin was isolated from the venom of the south african spitting scorpion it is a peptide that is moderately toxic but very abundant in the venom other peptide toxins found in the venom include dortoxin a lethal peptide bestoxin which causes writhing in mice and altitoxin a highly depressant peptide generally peptide neurotoxins can be divided into two major families the long chain neurotoxins lcn with 60 to 70 residue range and known to contain eight cysteine residues and the short chain neurotoxins scn with 30 to 40 peptides with six or eight cysteine residues birtoxin together with other birtoxin like peptides including bestoxin is 58 amino acid residues long close to the long chain family but with six cysteine residues birtoxin is reticulated by three disulfide bridges instead of four compared to other lcns therefore it is considered to be the evolutionary link between long chain and short chain families birtoxin affects the gating mechanism of sodium channels by binding to neurotoxin receptor site 4 of the channel resulting in the lowering of the voltage threshold of the channel and a reduction

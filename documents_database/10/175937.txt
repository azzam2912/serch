tree adjoining grammars are somewhat similar to context free grammars but the elementary unit of rewriting is the tree rather than the symbol whereas context free grammars have rules for rewriting symbols as strings of other symbols tree adjoining grammars have rules for rewriting the nodes of trees as other trees see tree graph theory and tree data structure tag originated in investigations by joshi and his students into the family of adjunction grammars ag the string grammar of zellig harris ags handle exocentric properties of language in a natural and effective way but do not have a good characterization of endocentric constructions the converse is true of rewrite grammars or phrase structure grammar psg in 1969 joshi introduced a family of grammars that exploits this complementarity by mixing the two types of rules a few very simple rewrite rules suffice to generate the vocabulary of strings for adjunction rules this family is distinct from the chomsky sch tzenberger hierarchy but intersects it in interesting and linguistically relevant ways the center strings and adjunct strings can also be generated by a dependency grammar avoiding the limitations of rewrite systems entirely the rules in a tag are trees with a special

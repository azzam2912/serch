although static data structures may provide very good functionality and fast queries their utility is limited because of their inability to grow shrink quickly thus making them inapplicable for the solution of dynamic problems where the amount of the input data changes dynamization techniques provide uniform ways of creating dynamic data structures we define problem formula 1 of searching for the predicate formula 2 match in the set formula 3 as formula 4 problem formula 1 is decomposable if the set formula 3 can be decomposed into subsets formula 7 and there exists an operation formula 8 of result unification such that formula 9 decomposition is a term used in computer science to break static data structures into smaller units of unequal size the basic principle is the idea that any decimal number can be translated into a representation in any other base for more details about the topic see decomposition computer science for simplicity binary system will be used in this article but any other base as well as other possibilities such as fibonacci numbers can also be utilized if using the binary system a set of formula 10 elements is broken down into subsets of sizes with elements

it is the most powerful gamma ray burst ever recorded the explosion had the energy of approximately 5900 type ia supernovae and the gas jets emitting the initial gamma rays moved at a minimum velocity of approximately 299 792 158 m s 0 999999c making this blast the most extreme recorded to date the 16 5 second delay for the highest energy gamma ray observed in this burst is consistent with some theories of quantum gravity which state that all forms of light may not travel through space at the same speed very high energy gamma rays may be slowed down as they propagate through the quantum turbulence of space time the explosion took place 12 2 billion light years light travel distance away that means it occurred 12 2 billion years ago when the universe was only about 1 5 billion years old the burst lasted for 23 minutes almost 700 times as long as the two second average for high energy grbs follow up observations were made 32 hours after the blast using the gamma ray burst optical near infrared detector grond on the 2 2 metre telescope at the european southern observatory in la silla chile allowing

it is a modified version of the hammett equation that accounts for enhanced resonance effects in electrophilic reactions of para and meta substituted organic compounds this equation does so by introducing a new term to the original hammett relation that provides a measure of the extent of resonance stabilization for a reactive structure that builds up charge positive or negative in its transition state the yukawa tsuno equation can take the following forms where and represent the rate constants for an x substituted and unsubstituted compound respectively represents the hammett reaction constant represents the hammett substituent constant and represent the hammett substituent constants for reactions in which positive or negative charges are built up at the reactive center respectively and represents the yukawa tsuno parameter the hammett substituent constant is composed of two independent terms an inductive effect and a resonance polar effect these components represent the consequences of the presence of a particular substituent on reactivity through sigma and pi bonds respectively for a particular substituent the value of is generally assumed to be a constant irrespective of the nature of the reaction however it has been shown that for reactions of para substituted compounds in which the transition

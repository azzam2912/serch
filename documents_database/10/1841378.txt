the primary star is a wolf rayet star and one of the most luminous stars known the secondary has been suspected of being a stellar mass black hole but may be a class o main sequence star wr 148 shows a classic wn8h spectrum but with the addition of weak central absorption on some of the emission lines n and n emission lines are stronger than n and he lines are stronger than he the balmer series hydrogen lines and some other lines have p cygni profiles wr 148 is erratically variable on timescales ranging from seconds to years but it shows consistent brightness and radial velocity variations with a period of 4 32 days there is little doubt that it is a binary system due to the regular variations and the presence of hard x ray radiation from colliding winds but the secondary is not clearly detectable in the spectrum one proposal for a companion that would match the faint absorption features would be a b3 subgiant but that is not compatible with the orbit an early calculated orbit based on faint absorption features gave a relatively large mass ratio which imply either a very high companion mass meaning

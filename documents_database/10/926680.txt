in the social sciences a result may be considered significant if its confidence level is of the order of a two sigma effect 95 while in particle physics there is a convention of a five sigma effect 99 99994 confidence being required to qualify as a discovery the three sigma rule of thumb is related to a result also known as the three sigma rule which states that even for non normally distributed variables at least 88 8 of cases should fall within properly calculated three sigma intervals it follows from chebyshev s inequality for unimodal distributions the probability of being within the interval is at least 95 by the vysochanskij petunin inequality there may be certain assumptions for a distribution that force this probability to be at least 98 these numerical values 68 95 99 7 come from the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution the prediction interval for any standard score z corresponds numerically to 1 1 z 2 for example 2 0 9772 or pr x 2 0 9772 corresponding to a prediction interval of 1 1 0 97725 2 0 9545 95 45 this is not a symmetrical interval this is merely the probability that

astor was a submarine launched wire guided nuclear torpedo designed by the united states navy for use against high speed deep diving enemy submarines this was one of several weapons recommended for implementation by project nobska a 1956 summer study on submarine warfare the diameter torpedo was fitted with a w34 nuclear warhead the need to maintain direct control over the warhead meant that a wire connection had to be maintained between the torpedo and submarine until detonation wire guidance systems were piggybacked onto this cable and the torpedo had no homing capability the design was completed in 1960 and 600 torpedoes were built between 1963 and 1976 when astor was replaced by the mark 48 torpedo this electrically propelled diameter torpedo was long and weighed the w34 nuclear warhead used in astor had an explosive yield of 11 kilotons the requirement for positive control of nuclear warheads meant that astor could only be detonated by a deliberate signal from the firing submarine which necessitated a wire link because of this the torpedo was only fitted with wire guidance systems transmitted over the same link and had no homing capability the torpedo had a range of by replacing the nuclear

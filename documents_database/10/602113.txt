rna polymerase ii holoenzyme is a form of eukaryotic rna polymerase ii that is recruited to the promoters of protein coding genes in living cells it consists of rna polymerase ii a subset of general transcription factors and regulatory proteins known as srb proteins before the start of transcription the transcription factor ii d tfiid complex binds to the tata box in the core promoter of the gene tfd is itself composed of tbp and several subunits called tata binding protein associated factors tbp associated factors or tafs in a test tube only tbp is necessary for transcription at promoters that contain a tata box tafs however add promoter selectivity especially if there is no tata box sequence for tbp to bind to tafs are included in two distinct complexes tfiid and b tfiid the tfiid complex is composed of tbp and more than eight tafs but the majority of tbp is present in the b tfiid complex which is composed of tbp and tafii170 btaf1 in a 1 1 ratio tfiid and b tfiid are not equivalent since transcription reactions utilizing tfiid are responsive to gene specific transcription factors such as sp1 while reactions reconstituted with b tfiid are

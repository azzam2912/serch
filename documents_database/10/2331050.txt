the definition is more complicated and technical than the one for complex manifolds due in part to the noncommutativity of the quaternions and in part to the lack of a suitable calculus of holomorphic functions for quaternions the most succinct definition uses the language of g structures on a manifold specifically a quaternionic n manifold can be defined as a smooth manifold of real dimension 4 n equipped with a torsion free formula 1 structure more na ve but straightforward definitions lead to a dearth of examples and exclude spaces like quaternionic projective space which should clearly be considered as quaternionic manifolds if we regard the quaternionic vector space formula 2 as a right formula 3 module we can identify the algebra of right formula 3 linear maps with the algebra of formula 5 quaternionic matrices acting on formula 6 from the left the invertible right formula 3 linear maps then form a subgroup formula 8 of formula 9 we can enhance this group with the group formula 10 of nonzero quaternions acting by scalar multiplication on formula 6 from the right since this scalar multiplication is formula 12 linear but not formula 3 linear we have another embedding of

prior to the start of the 2012 13 season the women s event was competed over a distance of 3 km by a team of 3 riders as with the individual pursuit the objective is to cover the distance in the fastest time or to catch and overtake the other team in a final riders in a team follow each other closely in line drafting to minimize total drag and periodically the lead rider who works the hardest peels off the front swings up the track banking and rejoins the team at the rear the position of the third rider is pivotal because final times are measured as the third team member s front wheel crosses the finishing line since the winning team is decided by the third rider it is common for one rider to take a death pull pedaling very hard before the finish to tow the teammates which means that this rider cannot maintain the group pace afterwards this allows their teammates to briefly recover behind them before they make a final three man acceleration towards the finish line the first round of the competition at major events is the qualifying round this still involves two teams

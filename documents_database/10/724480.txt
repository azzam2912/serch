the component of stress is the force in the x direction divided by the area of a plane perpendicular to that direction consider two adjacent volumes separated by such a plane the 11 component of stress on that interface is the sum of all pairwise forces between atoms on the two sides the volume averaged virial stress is then the ensemble average of the instantaneous volume averaged virial stress in an isotropic system at equilibrium the instantaneous atomic pressure is usually defined as the pressure then is the ensemble average of the instantaneous pressure this pressure is the average pressure in the volume formula 4 it s worth noting that some articles and textbook use a slightly different but equivalent version of the equation where formula 17 is the i component of the vector oriented from the formula 3 atoms to the k calculated via the difference formula 19 both equation being strictly equivalent the definition of the vector can still lead to confusion if the system is not homogeneous in a given volume the above volume averaged pressure is not a good measure for the pressure in inhomogeneous systems the pressure depends on the position and orientation of the

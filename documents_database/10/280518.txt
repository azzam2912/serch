neutron stars are detected by their pulsed radio and gamma ray emission as radio and or gamma ray pulsars they also might be observable as continuous gravitational wave sources if they are rapidly rotating and non axisymmetrically deformed einstein home examines radio telescope data from the arecibo observatory and has in the past analyzed data from parkes observatory searching for radio pulsars the project also analyses data from the fermi gamma ray space telescope to discover gamma ray pulsars the project runs on the berkeley open infrastructure for network computing boinc software platform and uses free software released under the gnu general public license version 2 einstein home is hosted by the university of wisconsin milwaukee and the max planck institute for gravitational physics albert einstein institute hannover germany the project is supported by the american physical society aps the us national science foundation nsf and the max planck society mpg the einstein home project director is bruce allen on august 12 2010 the first discovery by einstein home of a previously undetected radio pulsar j2007 2722 found in data from the arecibo observatory was published in science the project had discovered 55 radio pulsars as of november 2016 as

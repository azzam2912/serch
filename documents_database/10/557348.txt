this gpu features 3d acceleration based upon direct3d 9 0 and opengl 2 0 a major improvement in features and performance compared to the preceding r200 design r300 was the first fully direct3d 9 capable consumer graphics chip the processors also include 2d gui acceleration video acceleration and multiple display outputs the first graphics cards using the r300 to be released were the radeon 9700 it was the first time that ati marketed its gpu as a visual processing unit vpu r300 and its derivatives would form the basis for ati s consumer and professional product lines for over 3 years the integrated graphics processor based upon r300 is the xpress 200 ati had held the lead for a while with the radeon 8500 but nvidia retook the performance crown with the launch of the geforce 4 ti line a new high end refresh part the 8500xt r250 was supposedly in the works ready to compete against nvidia s high end offerings particularly the top line ti 4600 pre release information listed a 300 mhz core and ram clock speed for the r250 chip ati perhaps mindful of what had happened to 3dfx when they took focus off their rampage

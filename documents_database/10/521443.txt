miacids existed for approximately miacids are thought to have evolved into the modern carnivorous mammals of the order carnivora they were small carnivores superficially marten like or civet like with long lithe bodies and long tails some species were arboreal while others lived on the ground they probably fed on invertebrates lizards birds and smaller mammals like shrews and opossums their teeth and skulls show that the miacids were less developed than modern carnivorans they had carnivoran type carnassials but lacked fully ossified auditory bullae rounded protrusions miacidae as traditionally conceived is not a monophyletic group it is a paraphyletic array of stem taxa traditionally miacidae and viverravidae had been classified in a superfamily miacoidea today carnivora and miacoidea are grouped together in the crown clade carnivoramorpha and the miacoidea are regarded as basal carnivoramorphs some species of the genus miacis are closely related to the order carnivora but only the species miacis cognitus is a true carnivoran as it is classified in the caniformia the divergence of carnivorans from miacids is now inferred to have occurred in the middle eocene ca 42 million years ago traditionally the viverravidae viverravids had been thought to be the earliest carnivorans with fossil

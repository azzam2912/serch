a chemical mimic dupes an operator e g a predator by showing an adaptive chemical resemblance to an object of its environment and as a consequence receives selective advantage in all cases of chemical mimicry it has been found that the mimicking species is the only species to benefit from the reaction with either costs or no effect on the duped species this is by adapting to produce chemicals ex allomones pheromones odours etc that will cause a desirable behavioural reaction in the species being deceived and a selective advantage to the mimic chemical mimicry exists within many of the different forms of mimicry such as aggressive protective batesian and m llerian mimicry and can involve a number of different senses mimicking semiochemicals which cannot be seen make up some of the most widely used forms of chemical mimicry and is therefore less apparent than more visual forms as a result of this this topic has been relatively neglected in research and literature two examples of organisms displaying chemical mimicry include the mimicking of noctuid pheromones by bolas spiders in order to draw prey to the spider s location and the duping of insects within their own nests by mimicking

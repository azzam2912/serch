sugars or saccharides are essential components of all living things and aspects of the various roles they play in biology are researched in various medical biochemical and biotechnological fields according to oxford english dictionary the specific term glycobiology was coined in 1988 by prof raymond dwek to recognize the coming together of the traditional disciplines of carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry this coming together was as a result of a much greater understanding of the cellular and molecular biology of glycans however as early as the late nineteenth century pioneering efforts were being made by emil fisher to establish the structure of some basic sugar molecules sugars may be linked to other types of biological molecule to form glycoconjugates the enzymatic process of glycosylation creates sugars saccharides linked to themselves and to other molecules by the glycosidic bond thereby producing glycans glycoproteins proteoglycans and glycolipids are the most abundant glycoconjugates found in mammalian cells they are found predominantly on the outer cell wall and in secreted fluids glycoconjugates have been shown to be important in cell cell interactions due to the presence on the cell surface of various glycan binding receptors in addition to the glycoconjugates themselves in addition to their

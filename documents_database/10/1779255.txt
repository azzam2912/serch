the boundary knot method is different from the other methods based on the fundamental solutions such as boundary element method method of fundamental solutions and singular boundary method in that the former does not require special techniques to cure the singularity the bkm is truly meshfree spectral convergent numerical observations symmetric self adjoint pdes integration free and easy to learn and implement the method has successfully been tested to the helmholtz diffusion convection diffusion and possion equations with very irregular 2d and 3d domains the bkm is basically a combination of the distance function non singular general solution and dual reciprocity method drm the distance function is employed in the bkm to approximate the inhomogeneous terms via the drm whereas the non singular general solution of the partial differential equation leads to a boundary only formulation for the homogeneous solution without the singular fundamental solution the bkm removes the controversial artificial boundary in the method of fundamental solutions some preliminary numerical experiments show that the bkm can produce excellent results with relatively a small number of nodes for various linear and nonlinear problems consider the following problems where formula 4 is the differential operator formula 5 represents the computational domain

the in vitro protein synthesis environment is not constrained by a cell wall or homeostasis conditions necessary to maintain cell viability thus cfps enables direct access and control of the translation environment which is advantageous for a number of applications including co translational solubilisation of membrane proteins optimisation of protein production incorporation of non natural amino acids selective and site specific labelling due to the open nature of the system different expression conditions such as ph redox potentials temperatures and chaperones can be screened since there is no need to maintain cell viability toxic proteins can be produced common components of a cell free reaction include a cell extract an energy source a supply of amino acids cofactors such as magnesium and the dna with the desired genes a cell extract is obtained by lysing the cell of interest and centrifuging out the cell walls dna genome and other debris the remains are the necessary cell machinery including ribosomes aminoacyl trna synthetases translation initiation and elongation factors nucleases etc two types of dna can be used in cfps plasmids and linear expression templates lets plasmids are circular and only made inside cells lets can be made much more effectively via

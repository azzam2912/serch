computer simulations of a vibrating string that included a non linear term quadratic in one test cubic in another and a piecewise linear approximation to a cubic in a third they found that the behavior of the system was quite different from what intuition would have led them to expect fermi thought that after many iterations the system would exhibit thermalization an ergodic behavior in which the influence of the initial modes of vibration fade and the system becomes more or less random with all modes excited more or less equally instead the system exhibited a very complicated quasi periodic behavior they published their results in a los alamos technical report in 1955 enrico fermi died in 1954 and so this technical report was published after fermi s death the fput experiment was important both in showing the complexity of nonlinear system behavior and the value of computer simulation in analyzing systems the original paper names fermi pasta and ulam as authors although fermi died before the report was written with an acknowledgement to tsingou for her work in programming the maniac simulations mary tsingou s contributions to the fput problem were largely ignored by the community until published additional

complement components c3 c4 and c5 are large glycoproteins that have important functions in the immune response and host defense they have a wide variety of biological activities and are proteolytically activated by cleavage at a specific site forming a and b fragments a fragments form distinct structural domains of approximately 76 amino acids coded for by a single exon within the complement protein gene the c3a c4a and c5a components are referred to as anaphylatoxins they cause smooth muscle contraction vasodilation histamine release from mast cells and enhanced vascular permeability they also mediate chemotaxis inflammation and generation of cytotoxic oxygen radicals the proteins are highly hydrophilic with a mainly alpha helical structure held together by 3 disulfide bridges anaphylatoxins are able to trigger degranulation release of substances of endothelial cells mast cells or phagocytes which produce a local inflammatory response if the degranulation is widespread it can cause a shock like syndrome similar to that of an allergic reaction anaphylatoxins indirectly mediate important anaphylatoxins although some drugs morphine codeine synthetic acth and some neurotransmitters norepinephrine substance p are important mediators of degranulation of mast cells or basophils they are generally not called anaphylatoxins this term is reserved only for

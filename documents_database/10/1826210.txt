metric calculates et as a residual of the surface energy balance where et is estimated by keeping account of total net short wave and long wave radiation at the vegetation or soil surface the amount of heat conducted into soil and the amount of heat convected into the air above the surface the difference in these three terms represents the amount of energy absorbed during the conversion of liquid water to vapor which is et metric expresses near surface temperature gradients used in heat convection as indexed functions of radiometric surface temperature thereby eliminating the need for absolutely accurate surface temperature and the need for air temperature measurements the surface energy balance is internally calibrated using ground based reference et that is based on local weather or gridded weather data sets to reduce computational biases inherent to remote sensing based energy balance slope and aspect functions and temperature lapsing are used for application to mountainous terrain metric algorithms are designed for relatively routine application by trained engineers and other technical professionals who possess a familiarity with energy balance and basic radiation physics the primary inputs for the model are short wave and long wave thermal images from a satellite e

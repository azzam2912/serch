the same effect can be achieved with a low temperature and a long holding time or with a higher temperature and a short holding time in the hollomon jaffe parameter this exchangeability of time and temperature can be described by the following formula this formula is not consistent concerning the units the parameters must be entered in a certain manner t is in degrees celsius the argument of the logarithmic function has the unit hours c is a parameter unique to the material used the hollomon parameter itself is unitless and realistic numeric values vary between 15 and 21 where t is in kilokelvins t is in hours and c is the same as above holloman and jaffe determined the value of c experimentally by plotting hardness versus tempering time for a series of tempering temperatures of interest and interpolating the data to obtain the time necessary to yield a number of different hardness values this work was based on six different heats of plain carbon steels with carbon contents varying from 0 35 1 15 the value of c was found to vary somewhat for different steels and decrease linearly with the carbon content of a steel grade holloman

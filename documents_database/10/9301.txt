most nuvistors are basically thimble shaped but somewhat smaller than a thimble and much smaller than conventional tubes of the day almost approaching the compactness of early discrete transistor casings triodes and a few tetrodes were made the tube is made entirely of metal and ceramic making nuvistors requires special equipment since there is no intubation to pump gases out of the envelope instead the entire structure is assembled inserted into its metal envelope sealed and processed in a large vacuum chamber with simple robotic devices nuvistors are among the highest performing small signal receiving tubes they feature excellent vhf and uhf performance plus low noise figures and were widely used throughout the 1960s in television sets beginning with rca s new vista line of color sets in 1961 with the ctc 11 chassis radio and high fidelity equipment primarily in rf sections and oscilloscopes they competed with the solid state revolution and along with ge s compactron probably held it at bay for a few years rca discontinued their use in television tuners for its product line in late 1971 one famous application was in the ampex mr 70 a costly studio tape recorder whose entire electronics section was

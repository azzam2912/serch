in the 1980s he gained worldwide fame with his investigation of qpos his revolutionary discoveries have had an enormous impact in his field of research in effect they have made it what it is today van der klis pioneered special mathematical analysis techniques that are now regarded as the gold standard within his discipline van der klis s research focuses on x ray binaries pairs of stars orbiting each other that emit x ray radiation some binary star systems contain a compact object like a neutron star or a black hole by studying the dynamics of materials in the vicinity of such objects one can learn about their mass radius and rotational speed moreover this kind of research provides a testing ground for cosmology and general relativity van der klis made a number of breakthrough discoveries in 1984 he discovered the first type of qpos quasi periodic oscillations of the x ray emission of compact stars while he was working with esa s exosat satellite to study the strongest x ray sources near the centre of the milky way one of his achievements is the explanation in 1985 why x rays emitted from binary systems do not come in steady

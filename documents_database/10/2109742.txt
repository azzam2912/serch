the album was released on july 24 2015 by concord music group ashes dust was met with generally positive reviews from music critics thom jurek of allmusic said while ashes dust doesn t really add anything new to haynes musical profile fans already knew this was here there are some fine benchmarks his singing has never used such a range of dynamics before for once he lets the song dictate his expression others are tight songwriting and arranging craft especially when fleshed out by the almost limitless creativity of railroad earth ashes dust is a worthy and welcome addition to haynes catalog jonathan frahm of popmatters said someone most widely known by a wide margin for his work as a rocker haynes shows off his americana side in just as seamlessly great a manner as he had any other performance in the past in doing so he simultaneously proves his prowess as a competent musician given any platform to toy with and that labels in the first place might just be rather confounded matt bauer of exclaim said overall ashes and dust is undeniable proof of warren haynes growth as a songwriter and an affirmation of his continuing successful eclecticism

the acps are related in structure and mechanism to the peptidyl carrier proteins pcp from nonribosomal peptide synthases the protein is expressed in the inactive apo form and the 4 phosphopantetheine moiety must be post translationally attached to a conserved serine residue on the acp by the action of holo acyl carrier protein synthase acps a 4 phosphopantetheinyl transferase 4 phosphopantetheine is an essential prosthetic group of several acyl carrier proteins involved in pathways of primary and secondary metabolism including the acyl carrier proteins acp of fatty acid synthases acps of polyketide synthases and peptidyl carrier proteins pcp and aryl carrier proteins arcp of nonribosomal peptide synthetases nrps phosphopantetheine fulfills two demands in these biosynthetic pathways first the intermediates remain covalently linked to the synthases or synthetases in an energy rich linkage second the flexibility and length of the phosphopantetheine chain approximately 2 nm allows the covalently tethered intermediates to have access to spatially distinct enzyme active sites this increases the effective molarity of the intermediate and allows an assembly line like process the acps are small negatively charged helical bundle proteins with a high degree of structural and amino acid similarity the structures of a number of acyl carrier

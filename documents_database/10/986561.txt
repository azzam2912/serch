it is also commonly used in real time 3d rendering such as in video games to add additional effects video post processing is the process of changing the perceived quality of a video on playback done after the decoding process image scaling routines such as linear interpolation bilinear interpolation or cubic interpolation can for example be performed when increasing the size of images this involves either subsampling reducing or shrinking an image or zooming enlarging an image this helps reduce or hide image artifacts and flaws in the original film material it is important to understand that post processing always involves a trade off between speed smoothness and sharpness additionally post processing is commonly used in 3d rendering especially for video games instead of rendering 3d objects directly to the display the scene is first rendered to a buffer in the memory of the video card pixel shaders and optionally vertex shaders are then used to apply post processing filters to the image buffer before displaying it to the screen some post processing effects also require multiple passes gamma inputs vertex manipulation and depth buffer access post processing allows effects to be used that require awareness of the entire image

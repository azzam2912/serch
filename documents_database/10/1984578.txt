protein chemical shift prediction also known as protein chemical shift calculation is particularly useful in verifying protein chemical shift assignments adjusting mis referenced chemical shifts refining nmr protein structures via chemical shifts and assisting with the nmr assignment of unassigned proteins that have either had their structures or the structures of a homologous protein determined by x ray or nmr methods the shiftx web server takes atomic coordinates pdb s format of proteins as input and quickly diamagnetic proteins rather than paramagnetic proteins i e proteins with paramagnetic centers the shiftx web server is based on a program of the same name that was developed in 2003 by members of dr david wishart s laboratory 1 both the shiftx program and the shiftx web server make use of pre calculated empirically derived chemical shift tables relating 1h 13c and 15n chemical shifts to backbone torsion angles side chain orientations local secondary structure and nearest neighbor effects these tables were derived using data mining techniques from a large database of reference corrected protein chemical shifts called refdb 2 these sequence structure dependencies on chemical shifts which cannot easily be converted to analytical formulae are combined with standard classical or semi classical

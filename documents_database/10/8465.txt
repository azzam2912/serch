mgen is becoming increasingly common resistance to multiple antibiotics is occurring including azithromycin which until recently was the most reliable treatment the bacteria was first isolated from urogenital tract of humans in 1981 and was eventually identified as a new species of mycoplasma in 1983 it can cause negative health effects in men and women it also increases the risk factor for hiv spread with higher occurrences in homosexual men and those previously treated with the azithromycin antibiotics specifically it causes urethritis in both men and women and also cervicitis and pelvic inflammation in women it presents clinically similar symptoms to that of chlamydia trachomatis infection and has shown higher incidence rates compared to both chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in some populations its complete genome sequence was published in 1995 size 0 58 mbp with 475 genes it was regarded as a cellular unit with the smallest genome size in mbp until 2003 when a new species of archaea namely nanoarchaeum equitans was sequenced 0 49 mbp with 540 genes however mgen still has the smallest genome of any known naturally occurring self replicating organism and thus is often the organism of choice in minimal genome research the

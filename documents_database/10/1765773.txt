birds such as the arctic tern insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances dead reckoning navigating from a known position using only information about one s own speed and direction was suggested by charles darwin in 1873 as a possible mechanism in the 20th century karl von frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun by the polarization pattern of the blue sky and by the earth s magnetic field of these they rely on the sun when possible william tinsley keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use of a range of navigational cues including the sun earth s magnetic field olfaction and vision ronald lockley demonstrated that a small seabird the manx shearwater could orient itself and fly home at full speed when released far from home provided either the sun or the stars were visible several species of animal can integrate cues of different types to orient themselves and navigate effectively insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed direction from the earth s magnetic field

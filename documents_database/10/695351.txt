the bomb bay doors are opened and the bombs are dropped when over the target or at a specified launching point bomb bays were born of necessity early military aircraft suffered severe aerodynamic drag which would further slow down the already lumbering bomb laden aircraft with bombs hanging from the wings or below the fuselage so military aviation designers moved the bombs inside the aircraft before the introduction of stealth technology bomb bays were mostly used by dedicated bomber aircraft in fighters and attack airplanes bombs and rockets were hung from the wings or fuselage on pylons notable exceptions are the f 101 f 102 and f 106 interceptor aircraft all of which had bays used to store missiles or other weapons stores today many designers have moved previously external stores into internal multifunction weapons bays capable of carrying air to air missiles air to ground missiles drop tanks and other military stores and deploying them rapidly in a battle the principal reason for the change is to use stealth technology to make aircraft more difficult to detect on radar military fighters are now designed to have the smallest possible radar cross section which has decreased very substantially since attention

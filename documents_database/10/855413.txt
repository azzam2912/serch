the gambit implementation consists of a scheme interpreter and a compiler which compiles scheme into the language c which makes it cross platform software it conforms to the standards rrs rrs and institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee and to several scheme requests for implementations srfis gambit was released first in 1988 and gambit c gambit with a c backend was released first in 1994 they are free and open source software released under a gnu lesser general public license lgpl 2 1 and apache license 2 0 by compiling to an intermediate representation in this case portable c as do chicken and bigloo programs written in gambit can be compiled for common popular operating systems such as linux macos other unix like systems and windows gerbil scheme is a variant of scheme implemented on gambit c it supports current r rs standards and common srfis and has a state of the art macro and module system inspired by racket language termite scheme is a variant of scheme implemented on gambit c termite is intended for distributed computing it offers a simple and powerful message passing model of concurrency inspired by that of erlang while the gambit compiler produces

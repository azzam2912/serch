the spacecraft adheres to the 1u cubesat standard and is currently in a 93 inclination orbit dave will study the vibration of metal beams damped with tungsten particles in a micro gravity environment the test elements are driven by a piezoelectric actuator and vibration data is collected via an accelerometer at the tip of each beam dave was launched into a high inclination orbit as a secondary payload on the final flight of the delta ii launch vehicle as part of the elana 18 ride share mission with nasa s icesat 2 primary payload the launch occurred out of vandenberg air force base california on september 15 at 6 02 am local time dave was deployed alongside three other cubesat spacecraft university of central florida s surfsat and two elfin spacecraft from university of california los angeles as of november 2018 the spacecraft is active and in good health dave is a 1u cubesat spacecraft measuring approximately 10x10x11cm the spacecraft was integrated into a ppod poly picosatellite orbital deployer alongside the university of central florida s surfsat fixed solar panels on the sides of the spacecraft provide power to the avionics and transmitter dave is operated from uhf ground stations

pocis provides a means for estimating the toxicological significance of waterborne contaminants the pocis sampler mimics the respiratory exposure of organisms living in the aquatic environment and can provide an understanding of bioavailable contaminants present in the system pocis can be deployed in a wide range of aquatic environments and is commonly used to assist in environmental monitoring studies the first passive sampling devices were developed in the 1970s to determine concentrations of contaminants in the air in 1980 this technology was first adapted for the monitoring of organic contaminants in water the initial type of passive sampler developed for aquatic monitoring purposes was the semipermeable membrane device smpd spmd samplers are most effective at absorbing hydrophobic pollutants with a log octanol water partitioning coefficient kow ranging from 4 8 as the global emission of bioconcentratable persistent organic pollutants pops was shown to result in adverse ecological effects industry developed a wide range of increasing water soluble polar hydrophilic organic compounds hpocs to replace them these compounds generally have lower bioconcentration factors however there is evidence that large fluxes of these hpocs into aquatic environments may be responsible for a number of adverse effects to aquatic organisms such as altered

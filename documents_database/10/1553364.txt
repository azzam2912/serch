when representing positions relative to the earth it is often most convenient to represent vertical position height or depth separately and to use some other parameters to represent horizontal position there are also several applications where only the horizontal position is of interest this might e g be the case for ships and ground vehicles cars it is a type of geographic coordinate system there are several options for horizontal position representations each with different properties which makes them appropriate for different applications latitude longitude and utm are common horizontal position representations the horizontal position has two degrees of freedom and thus two parameters are sufficient to uniquely describe such a position however similarly to the use of euler angles as a formalism for representing rotations using only the minimum number of parameters gives singularities and thus three parameters are required for the horizontal position to avoid this the most common horizontal position representation is latitude and longitude the parameters are intuitive and well known and are thus suited for communicating a position to humans e g using a position plot however latitude and longitude should be used with care in mathematical expressions including calculations in computer programs the main

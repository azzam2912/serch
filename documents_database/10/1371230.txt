the basic objectives in geometric design are to optimize efficiency and safety while minimizing cost and environmental damage geometric design also affects an emerging fifth objective called livability which is defined as designing roads to foster broader community goals including providing access to employment schools businesses and residences accommodate a range of travel modes such as walking bicycling transit and automobiles and minimizing fuel use emissions and environmental damage geometric roadway design can be broken into three main parts alignment profile and cross section combined they provide a three dimensional layout for a roadway the alignment is the route of the road defined as a series of horizontal tangents and curves the profile is the vertical aspect of the road including crest and sag curves and the straight grade lines connecting them the cross section shows the position and number of vehicle and bicycle lanes and sidewalks along with their cross slope or banking cross sections also show drainage features pavement structure and other items outside the category of geometric design roads are designed in conjunction with design guidelines and standards these are adopted by national and sub national authorities e g states provinces territories and municipalities design guidelines take

this transformation can be accomplished in unsaturated carbonyl compounds via the conjugate addition of a nucleophile to the position followed by trapping of the resulting enolate with an electrophile at the position when the nucleophile is an enolate and the electrophile a proton the reaction is called michael addition vicinal difunctionalization reactions most generally lead to new bonds at two adjacent carbon atoms often this takes place in a stereocontrolled fashion particularly if both bonds are formed simultaneously as in the diels alder reaction activated double bonds represent a useful handle for vicinal difunctionalization because they can act as both nucleophiles and electrophiles one carbon is necessarily electron poor and the other electron rich in the presence of a nucleophile and an electrophile then the two carbons of a double bond can act as a relay mediating electron flow from the nucleophile to the electrophile with the formation of two rather than the usual one chemical bonds most often the nucleophile employed in this context is an organometallic compound and the electrophile is an alkyl halide the mechanism proceeds in two stages nucleophilic addition to the unsaturated carbonyl compound followed by electrophilic substitution at the carbon of the resulting enolate

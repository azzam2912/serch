pneumatic tools can also be driven by compressed carbon dioxide co2 stored in small cylinders allowing for portability most pneumatic tools convert the compressed air to work using a pneumatic motor compared to electric power tool equivalents pneumatic tools are safer to run and maintain without risk of sparks short circuiting or electrocution and have a higher power to weight ratio allowing a smaller lighter tool to accomplish the same task furthermore they are less likely to self destruct in case the tool is jammed or overloaded general grade pneumatic tools with a short life span are commonly less expensive and considered disposable tools in tooling industries while industrial grade pneumatic tools with long life span are more expensive in general pneumatic tools are cheaper than the equivalent electric powered tools regular lubrication of the tools is still needed however most pneumatic tools are to be supplied with compressed air at 4 to 6 bar pneumatic tools have many benefits which have contributed to their rise in popularity the benefits of using compressed air to power tools are the primary disadvantage of pneumatic tools is the need for an air compressor which can be expensive pneumatic tools also need to

especially well known in peanuts peas and pansy this behavior is most widespread in the grass family however the largest genus of cleistogamous plants is viola the more common opposite of cleistogamy or closed marriage is called chasmogamy or open marriage virtually all plants that produce cleistogamous flowers also produce chasmogamous ones the principal advantage of cleistogamy is that it requires fewer plant resources to produce seeds than does chasmogamy because development of petals nectar and large amounts of pollen is not required this efficiency makes cleistogamy particularly useful for seed production on unfavorable sites or adverse conditions impatiens capensis for example has been observed to produce only cleistogamous flowers after being severely damaged by grazing and to maintain populations on unfavorable sites with only cleistogamous flowers the obvious disadvantage of cleistogamy is that self fertilization occurs which may suppress the creation of genetically superior plants for genetically modified gm rapeseed researchers hoping to minimise the admixture of gm and non gm crops are attempting to use cleistogamy to prevent gene flow however preliminary results from co extra a current project within the eu research program show that although cleistogamy reduces gene flow it is not at the moment a

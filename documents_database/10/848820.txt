it allows software developers and software engineers to use a cuda enabled graphics processing unit gpu for general purpose processing an approach termed gpgpu general purpose computing on graphics processing units the cuda platform is a software layer that gives direct access to the gpu s virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements for the execution of compute kernels the cuda platform is designed to work with programming languages such as c c and fortran this accessibility makes it easier for specialists in parallel programming to use gpu resources in contrast to prior apis like direct3d and opengl which required advanced skills in graphics programming cuda also supports programming frameworks such as openacc and opencl when it was first introduced by nvidia the name cuda was an acronym for compute unified device architecture but nvidia subsequently dropped the common use of the acronym the graphics processing unit gpu as a specialized computer processor addresses the demands of real time high resolution 3d graphics compute intensive tasks by 2012 gpus had evolved into highly parallel multi core systems allowing very efficient manipulation of large blocks of data this design is more effective than general purpose central processing unit cpus for algorithms

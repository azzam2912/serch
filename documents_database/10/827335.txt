more precisely it defines the surface area as the derivative of enclosed volume in an appropriate sense the minkowski steiner formula is used together with the brunn minkowski theorem to prove the isoperimetric inequality it is named after hermann minkowski and jakob steiner let formula 1 and let formula 2 be a compact set let formula 3 denote the lebesgue measure volume of formula 4 define the quantity formula 5 by the minkowski steiner formula where denotes the closed ball of radius formula 8 and is the minkowski sum of formula 4 and formula 11 so that for sufficiently regular sets formula 4 the quantity formula 5 does indeed correspond with the formula 15 dimensional measure of the boundary formula 16 of formula 4 see federer 1969 for a full treatment of this problem when the set formula 4 is a convex set the lim inf above is a true limit and one can show that where the formula 20 are some continuous functions of formula 4 see quermassintegrals and formula 22 denotes the measure volume of the unit ball in formula 23 where formula 25 denotes the gamma function taking formula 26 gives the following well known formula for

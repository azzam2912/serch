it was originally developed at the distributed systems technology centre an australian co operative research centre based at the university of queensland which operated from 1992 until mid 2006 elvin is most distinguished from other such systems by its support of a sophisticated content based subscription system elvin clients subscribe to events using a language that resembles c boolean expressions for example this expression selects messages that have a field named department with a string value matching it and a percent disk free field with an integer value less than or equal to 10 the elvin subscription language supports a range of operations for matching numeric and string values including the use of regular expression matching elvin is oriented around providing a fast flexible event service that can be federated to form wide area event notification networks in order to achieve these goals it does not provide persistence durability or guaranteed delivery elvin can thought of as providing a middle ground between low level network multicast and higher level more complex event brokers such as jms in 2003 the research group that created elvin left dstc to found mantara software in order to develop commercial applications of elvin in november

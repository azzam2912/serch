a solid is represented as a collection of connected surface elements the boundary between solid and non solid boundary representation of models are composed of two parts topology and geometry surfaces curves and points the main topological items are faces edges and vertices a face is a bounded portion of a surface an edge is a bounded piece of a curve and a vertex lies at a point other elements are the shell a set of connected faces the loop a circuit of edges bounding a face and loop edge links also known as winged edge links or half edges which are used to create the edge circuits the edges are like the edges of a table bounding a surface portion compared to the constructive solid geometry csg representation which uses only primitive objects and boolean operations to combine them boundary representation is more flexible and has a much richer operation set in addition to the boolean operations b rep has extrusion or sweeping chamfer blending drafting shelling tweaking and other operations which make use of these the basic method for brep was developed independently in the early 1970s by both ian c braid in cambridge for cad and bruce

most blackout policies serve to protect local broadcasters primarily regional sports networks from competition by out of market networks that carry different teams by only allowing viewers to watch non national telecasts of teams within their designated markets with television providers blacking out regional telecasts of teams that are outside their market in turn encouraging viewers to purchase subscription based out of market sports packages and by allowing teams to black out national telecasts of games that are also being shown by a local broadcaster by contrast the blackout policies of the national football league serve to encourage attendance to games instead by only allowing them to be broadcast on television in a team s designated market if a certain percentage of their tickets are sold prior to the game similarly there is a blanket blackout on all telecasts of association football soccer in the united kingdom between 2 45 p m and 5 15 p m on saturday matchdays the term is also used in relation to situations where programming is removed or replaced on international feeds of a television service because the broadcaster does not hold the territorial rights to air the programs outside of their home country

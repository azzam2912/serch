they can be naturally occurring or synthesized through the individual expression of viral structural proteins which can then self assemble into the virus like structure combinations of structural capsid proteins from different viruses can be used to create recombinant vlps vlps derived from the hepatitis b virus and composed of the small hbv derived surface antigen hbsag were described in 1968 from patient sera vlps have been produced from components of a wide variety of virus families including parvoviridae e g adeno associated virus retroviridae e g hiv flaviviridae e g hepatitis c virus paramyxoviridae e g nipah and bacteriophages e g q ap205 vlps can be produced in multiple cell culture systems including bacteria mammalian cell lines insect cell lines yeast and plant cells vlps are used in studies to identify viral protein components vlps are a candidate delivery system for genes or other therapeutics these drug delivery agents have been shown to effectively target cancer cells in vitro it is hypothesized that vlps may accumulate in tumor sites due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect which could be useful for drug delivery or tumor imaging vlps are useful as vaccines vlps contain repetitive high density displays of

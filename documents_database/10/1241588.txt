aspnes developed fundamental theories of the linear and nonlinear optical properties of materials and thin films and the technology of spectroscopic ellipsometry se se is a metrology that is indispensable in the manufacture of integrated circuits aspnes grew up on a dairy farm in the madison area attending a one room country school aspnes earned bs 1960 and ms 1961 degrees in electrical engineering at the university of wisconsin madison having found that a good living could be made by doing work that wasn t dirty and dangerous he continued his education at the university of illinois at urbana champaign where he received a ph d degree in physics with a mathematics minor in 1965 aspnes spent a postdoctoral year at uiuc where he wrote several seminal papers on the effect of electric fields on the optical properties of materials and a second year at brown university where he began experimental work in the same field in 1967 he joined the research area of bell laboratories murray hill as a member of the technical staff at bell laboratories aspnes pursued his interest in the optical properties of materials and thin films and their use not only to characterize the type

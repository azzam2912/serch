derrick which shows that stationary localized solutions to a nonlinear wave equation or nonlinear klein gordon equation in spatial dimensions three and higher are unstable derrick s paper which was considered an obstacle to interpreting soliton like solutions as particles contained the following physical argument about non existence of stable localized stationary solutions to the nonlinear wave equation now known under the name of derrick s theorem the energy of the time independent solution formula 4 is given by a necessary condition for the solution to be stable is formula 6 suppose formula 4 is a localized solution of formula 8 define formula 9 where formula 10 is an arbitrary constant and write formula 11 formula 12 then whence formula 14 and since formula 15 that is formula 17 for a variation corresponding to a uniform stretching of the particle hence the solution formula 4 is unstable derrick s argument works for formula 19 formula 20 more generally let formula 21 be continuous with formula 22 denote formula 23 let be a solution to the equation in the sense of distributions then formula 26 satisfies the relation known as pohozaev s identity this result is similar to the virial theorem

cyr61 is capable of regulating a broad range of cellular activities including cell adhesion migration proliferation differentiation apoptosis and senescence through interaction with cell surface integrin receptors and heparan sulfate proteoglycans during embryonic development cyr61 is critical for cardiac septal morphogenesis blood vessel formation in placenta and vascular integrity in adulthood cyr61 plays important roles in inflammation and tissue repair and is associated with diseases related to chronic inflammation including rheumatoid arthritis atherosclerosis diabetes related nephropathy and retinopathy and many different forms of cancers cyr61 was first identified as a protein encoded by a serum inducible gene in mouse fibroblasts other highly conserved homologs were later identified to comprise the ccn protein family ccn intercellular signaling protein the ccn acronym is derived from the first three members of the family identified namely cyr61 ccn1 ctgf connective tissue growth factor or ccn2 and nov nephroblastoma overexpressed or ccn3 these proteins together with wisp1 ccn4 wisp2 ccn5 and wisp3 ccn6 comprise the six members of the family in vertebrates and have been renamed ccn1 6 in order of their discovery by international consensus ccn proteins function as matricellular proteins which are extracellular matrix proteins that play regulatory roles particularly in the context

he made it to resemble the black spleenwort asplenium adiantum nigrum the fern is one of the basic examples of self similar sets i e it is a mathematically generated pattern that can be reproducible at any magnification or reduction like the sierpinski triangle the barnsley fern shows how graphically beautiful structures can be built from repetitive uses of mathematical formulas with computers barnsley s 1988 book fractals everywhere is based on the course which he taught for undergraduate and graduate students in the school of mathematics georgia institute of technology called fractal geometry after publishing the book a second course was developed called fractal measure theory barnsley s work has been a source of inspiration to graphic artists attempting to imitate nature with mathematical models the fern code developed by barnsley is an example of an iterated function system ifs to create a fractal this follows from the collage theorem he has used fractals to model a diverse range of phenomena in science and technology but most specifically plant structures michael barnsley et al barnsley s fern uses four affine transformations the formula for one transformation is the following barnsley shows the ifs code for his black spleenwort fern

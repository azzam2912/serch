in the earth s atmosphere nitrogen acts as a buffer gas a buffer gas adds pressure to a system and controls the speed of combustion with any oxygen present any inert gas such as helium neon or argon will serve as a buffer gas buffer gases are commonly used in many applications from high pressure discharge lamps to reduce line width of microwave transitions in alkali atoms a buffer gas usually consists of atomically inert gases such as helium argon and nitrogen which are the primary gases used krypton neon and xenon are also used primarily for lighting in most scenarios buffer gases are used in conjunction with other molecules for the main purpose of causing collisions with the other co existing molecules in fluorescent lamps mercury is used as the primary ion from which light is emitted krypton is the buffer gas used in conjunction with the mercury which is used to moderate the momentum of collisions of mercury ions in order to reduce the damage done to the electrodes in the fluorescent lamp generally speaking the longest lasting lamps are those with the heaviest noble gases as buffer gases buffer gas loading techniques have been developed for use

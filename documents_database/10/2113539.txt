the album was released in four versions each with its own steampunk themed cover art and unique bonus content the album title is a reference to the maya calendar as described by springfield himself the album is in the end a relationship album viewed from the perspective of how the relationship is the thing that matters even though the world may be coming down around our ears that s the most important thing the idea for the album came after discussions with his writing partner matt bissonette we d been talking a lot about all the signs and all the things that have been happening all the wars the melting polar ice caps the food chain endangered overpopulation all the super bugs all those kind of things the songwriting process continued alongside the thoughts the two discussed however the album s dark subjects should not be taken as is the fact is that we re in a very precarious position now planet wise and it s pretty daunting all the stuff that s been going on springfield says but a lot of it is tongue in cheek one good thing about it is it s high energy rock n roll

it has an apparent visual magnitude of 3 27 which is bright enough to be viewed from urban areas in the southern hemisphere this star is close enough for its distance to be measured using parallax shifts which yields a value of roughly from the sun with a 5 margin of error alpha pictoris has the distinction of being the south pole star of the planet mercury with an estimated age of 660 million years this is a relatively young lambda bo tis star the stellar classification of shows this peculiarity with the ka6 notation indicating weaker than normal calcium k lines in the spectrum the n following the main sequence luminosity class of v indicates the absorption lines in the spectrum are broad and nebulous this is caused by the rapid spin of the star which has a high projected rotational velocity of 206 km s spectroscopy shows narrow time varying absorption features being caused by circumstellar gas moving toward the star this is not the result of interstellar matter but a shell of gas along the orbital plane alpha pictoris is categorized as a rapidly rotating shell star that may have recently ejected mass from its outer atmosphere

it is a knot invariant by way of example the unknot has crossing number zero the trefoil knot three and the figure eight knot four there are no other knots with a crossing number this low and just two knots have crossing number five but the number of knots with a particular crossing number increases rapidly as the crossing number increases tables of prime knots are traditionally indexed by crossing number with a subscript to indicate which particular knot out of those with this many crossings is meant this sub ordering is not based on anything in particular except that torus knots then twist knots are listed first the listing goes 3 the trefoil knot 4 the figure eight knot 5 5 6 etc this order has not changed significantly since p g tait published a tabulation of knots in 1877 there has been very little progress on understanding the behavior of crossing number under rudimentary operations on knots a big open question asks if the crossing number is additive when taking knot sums it is also expected that a satellite of a knot k should have larger crossing number than k but this has not been proven additivity of

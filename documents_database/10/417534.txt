it may also cleave polysaccharide chains between residues that are not the terminal residue although releasing oligosaccharides from conjugated protein and lipid molecules is more common it breaks the glycosidic bonds between two sugar monomer in the polymer it is different from exoglycosidase that it does not do so at the terminal residue hence it is used to release long carbohydrates from conjugated molecules if an exoglycosidase were used every monomer in the polymer would have to be removed one by one from the chain taking a long time an endoglycosidase cleaves giving a polymeric product protein x x x x x x x x x x x x the mechanism is an enzymatic hydrolysis that requires two critical molecules a proton donor most likely an acid and a nucleophile most likely a base the endoglycosidases mechanism has two forms an acid catalyzed protonation of the glycosidic oxygen yielding stereochemical retention at the anomeric carbon or an acid catalyzed protonation of the glycosidic oxygen with a concomitant attack of a water molecule activated by the base residue yielding a stereochemical inversion both mechanisms exhibit the same distance between the proton donor and the glycosidic oxygen situating the proton donor close

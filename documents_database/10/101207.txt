in the past gravel road surfaces cobblestone and granite setts were extensively used but these surfaces have mostly been replaced by asphalt or concrete laid on a compacted base course asphalt mixtures have been used in pavement construction since the beginning of the twentieth century road surfaces are frequently marked to guide traffic today permeable paving methods are beginning to be used for low impact roadways and walkways pavements are crucial to countries such as us and canada which heavily depend on road transportation therefore research projects such as long term pavement performance are launched to optimize the life cycle of different road surfaces asphalt specifically asphalt concrete sometimes called flexible pavement due to the nature in which it distributes loads has been widely used since the 1920s the viscous nature of the bitumen binder allows asphalt concrete to sustain significant plastic deformation although fatigue from repeated loading over time is the most common failure mechanism most asphalt surfaces are laid on a gravel base which is generally at least as thick as the asphalt layer although some full depth asphalt surfaces are laid directly on the native subgrade in areas with very soft or expansive subgrades such as clay

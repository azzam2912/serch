most catalytic converters are used for vehicle emissions control stationary catalytic converters can reduce air pollution from fossil fuel power stations monoliths for automotive catalytic converters are made of a ceramic that contains a large proportion of synthetic cordierite 2mgo 2alo 5sio which has a low coefficient of thermal expansion each monolith contains thousands of parallel channels or holes which are defined by many thin walls in a honeycomb structure the channels can be square hexagonal round or other shapes the hole density may be from 30 to 200 per cm and the separating walls can be 0 05 to 0 3 mm the many small holes have a much larger surface area than one large hole high surface area facilitates catalytic reaction or filtration the open spaces in the cross sectional area are 72 to 87 of the frontal area so resistance to the flow of gases through the holes is low which minimizes energy consumed forcing gases through the structure the monolith is a substrate that supports a catalyst after the monolith is complete a washcoat is applied that deposits oxides and catalyst s most commonly platinum palladium and or rhodium on the walls of the holes alternative

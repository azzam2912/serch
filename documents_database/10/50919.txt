it is conjectured that they are a type of magnetar or alternatively neutron stars with fossil disks around them on march 5 1979 a powerful gamma ray burst was noted as a number of receivers at different locations in the solar system saw the burst at slightly different times its direction could be determined and it was shown to originate from near a supernova remnant in the large magellanic cloud over time it became clear that this was not a normal gamma ray burst the photons were less energetic in the soft gamma ray and hard x ray range and repeated bursts came from the same region astronomer chryssa kouveliotou of the universities space research association usra at nasa s marshall space flight center decided to test the theory that soft gamma repeaters were magnetars according to the theory the bursts would cause the object to slow down its rotation in 1998 she made careful comparisons of the periodicity of soft gamma repeater sgr 1806 20 the period had increased by 0 008 seconds since 1993 and she calculated that this would be explained by a magnetar with a magnetic field strength of 8 10 teslas 8 10 gauss this

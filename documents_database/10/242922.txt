this is how transthyretin gained its name transports thyroxine and retinol the liver secretes transthyretin into the blood and the choroid plexus secretes ttr into the cerebrospinal fluid ttr was originally called prealbumin or thyroxine binding prealbumin because it ran faster than albumin on electrophoresis gels transthyretin protein is encoded by ttr gene located in the 18th chromosome it functions in concert with two other thyroid hormone binding proteins in the serum in cerebrospinal fluid ttr is the primary carrier of t ttr also acts as a carrier of retinol vitamin a through its association with retinol binding protein rbp in the blood and the csf less than 1 of ttr s t binding sites are occupied in blood which is taken advantage of below to prevent ttrs dissociation misfolding and aggregation which leads to the degeneration of post mitotic tissue numerous other small molecules are known to bind in the thyroxine binding sites including many natural products such as resveratrol drugs tafamidis or vyndaqel diflunisal flufenamic acid and toxicants pcb ttr is a 55kda homotetramer with a dimer of dimers quaternary structure that is synthesized in the liver choroid plexus and retinal pigment epithelium for secretion into the bloodstream

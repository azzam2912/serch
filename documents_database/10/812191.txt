phk phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase at two serine residues triggering a conformational shift which favors the more active glycogen phosphorylase a form over the less active glycogen phosphorylase b the protein is a hexadecameric holoenzyme that is a homotetramer in which each subunit is itself a tetramer arranged in an approximate butterfly shape each of the subunits is composed of an and subunit the subunit is the site of the enzyme s catalytic activity while the other three subunits serve regulatory functions when unmodified the and subunits inhibit the enzyme s catalysis but phosphorylation of both these subunits by protein kinase a pka or camp dependent protein kinase reduces their respective inhibitory activities the subunit is the ubiquitous eukaryotic protein calmodulin which itself has 4 calcium ion binding sites when cytosolic ca levels rise to as low as 10 m the subunit undergoes a large conformational change that activates the kinase s activity by binding to a complementary hydrophobic patch on the catalytic subunit phosphorylase kinase was the first protein kinase to be isolated and characterized in detail accomplished first by krebs graves and fischer in the 1950s at the time the scientific community was largely unaware of the importance of

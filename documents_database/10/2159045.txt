refractory ores require pre treatment before the gold can be adequately extracted the pressure oxidation process is used to prepare such ores for conventional gold extraction processes such as cyanidation it is performed in an autoclave at high pressure and temperature where high purity oxygen mixes with a slurry of ore when the original sulfide minerals are oxidized at high temperature and pressure it completely releases the trapped gold pressure oxidation has a very high gold recovery rate normally at least 10 higher than roasting the oxidation of the iron sulfide minerals produces sulfuric acid soluble compounds such as ferric sulfate and solids such as iron sulfate or jarosite the iron based solids produced pose an environmental challenge as they can release acid and heavy metals to the environment they can also make later precious metal recovery more difficult arsenic in the ore is converted to solid scorodite inside the autoclave allowing it to be easily disposed of this is an advantage over processes such as roasting where these toxic products are released as gases a disadvantage of pressure oxidation is that any silver in the feed material will often react to form silver jarosite inside the autoclave making it

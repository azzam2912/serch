however not all fallibilists believe that fallibilism extends to all domains of knowledge the term fallibilism is used in a variety of senses in contemporary epistemology the term was coined in the late nineteenth century by the american philosopher charles sanders peirce by fallibilism peirce meant the view that people cannot attain absolute certainty concerning questions of fact other theorists of knowledge have used the term differently thus fallibilism has been used to describe the claim that additionally some theorists embrace global versions of fallibilism claiming that no human beliefs have truth guaranteeing justification while others restrict fallibilism to particular areas of human inquiry such as empirical science or morality the claim that all scientific claims are provisional and open to revision in the light of new evidence is widely taken for granted in the natural sciences unlike many forms of skepticism fallibilism does not imply that we have no knowledge fallibilists typically deny that knowledge requires absolute certainty rather fallibilism is an admission that because empirical knowledge can be revised by further observation any of the things we take as empirical knowledge might turn out to be false some fallibilists make an exception for things that are necessarily true

the borough consisted of the town of corfe castle on the isle of purbeck once a market town but by the 19th century little more than a village where the main economic interests were clay and stone quarrying in 1831 the population of the borough was approximately 960 in 156 houses the portion of the town outside the borough contained another 141 houses the right to vote was exercised by all householders resident or not paying scot and lot in 1816 this amounted to only 44 voters and all but 14 of those were non resident the local landowners were able to exercise almost total influence in the late 18th and early 19th century the bankes family who had owned the castle since 1640 nominated the member for one of the seats and the bond family for the other corfe castle was abolished as a separate constituency by the reform act however the nearby borough of wareham kept one of its mps and corfe castle was included within the expanded boundaries of the revised wareham constituency notes

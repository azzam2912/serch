detnet operates at the ip layer 3 routed segments using a software defined networking layer to provide intserv and diffserv integration and delivers service over lower layer 2 bridged segments using technologies such as mpls and ieee 802 1 time sensitive networking deterministic networking aims to migrate time critical high reliability industrial control and audio video applications from special purpose fieldbus networks hdmi can bus profibus rs 485 rs 422 rs 232 and i c to packet networks and the ip in particular detnet will support both the new applications and existing it applications on the same physical network to support real time applications detnet implements reservation of data plane resources in intermediate nodes along the data flow path calculation of explicit routes that do not depend on network topology and redistribute data packets over time and or space to deliver data even with the loss of one path standard it infrastructure cannot efficiently handle latency sensitive data switches and routers use fundamentally uncertain algorithms for processing packet frames which may result in sporadic data flow a common solution for smoothing out these flows is to increase buffer sizes but this has negative effect on delivery latency because data has

it is a passage of ducts laid along the axis of main air stream to minimize the lateral velocity components caused by swirling motion in the air flow during entry the cross section shapes of these honeycombs may be of square circular and regular hexagonal cells a low cost flow straightener can be constructed using drinking straws as they have low cost and good efficiency the mythbusters television show used such a construction for their wind tunnel as did an experimental wind tunnel at mit maniet the straws should be cut to equal size and placed in a frame the effectiveness of honeycomb in reducing the swirl and turbulence level is studied by simulating the flow field using standard k turbulence model in commercial computational fluid dynamics cfd cfd is the most precise and economical approach to estimate the effectiveness of a honeycomb computational model a computational domain of honeycomb is created as shown in fig 1 we know computationally it is very difficult to provide the realistic non uniform flow at the entry of honeycomb as experienced in the experiments such random inlet conditions would essentially simulate the realistic case in which air can enter the honeycomb from any

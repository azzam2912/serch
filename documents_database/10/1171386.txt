it was launched from vandenberg air force base on 5 may 1967 aboard a scout rocket ariel 3 had an orbital period of approximately 95 minutes with an apogee of 608 km and a perigee of 497 km it initially spun at 31 rpm for stability though by the time the ariel 3 deorbited it had slowed to a rate of about 1 rpm ariel 3 carried five experiments the experiments measured properties of the thermosphere as well as detected terrestrial radio noise from thunderstorms and measured large scale galactic radio frequency noise experimental data was recorded on an onboard tape recorder then later transmitted to waiting observers on earth ariel 3 was also fitted with a series of mirrors to allow easy observation of the satellite on 24 october 1967 the tape recorder aboard ariel 3 began to malfunction this restricted observation to real time operation only ariel 3 suffered from a significant power failure in december 1968 restricting the satellite s operation to daylight hours only the satellite was completely shut down in september 1969 its orbit decayed steadily until on 14 december 1970 when ariel 3 re entered earth s atmosphere

this was first proved by jean jacques moreau in 1961 and moffatt derived it in 1969 without the knowledge of moreau s paper this helicity invariant is an extension of woltjer s theorem for magnetic helicity let formula 1 be the velocity field and formula 2 the corresponding vorticity field under the following three conditions the vortex lines are transported with or frozen in the flow i the fluid is inviscid ii either the flow is incompressible formula 3 or it is compressible with a barotropic relation formula 4 between pressure formula 5 and density formula 6 and iii any body forces acting on the fluid are conservative under these conditions any closed surface formula 7 on which formula 8 is like vorticity transported with the flow let formula 9 be the volume inside such a surface then the helicity in formula 9 is defined by for a localised vorticity distribution in an unbounded fluid formula 9 can be taken to be the whole space and formula 13 is then the total helicity of the flow formula 13 is invariant precisely because the vortex lines are frozen in the flow and their linkage and or knottedness is therefore conserved as

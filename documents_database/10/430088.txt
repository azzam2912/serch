it has survived from the 1970s until today in various forms and presentations it has slowly evolved into a concept that recognises and accepts large scale plate motions such as envisaged by plate tectonics but placing them in a framework where large mantle plumes are the major driving force of the system the initial followers of the concept during the first half of the 20th century are scientists like beloussov and van bemmelen and recently the concept has gained interest especially in japan through new compiled work on palaeomagnetism and is still advocaded by the group of scientists elaboration upon earth expansion it is nowadays generally not accepted as the main theory to explain the driving forces of tectonic plate movements although numerous modulations on the concept have been proposed the theory focuses on the movements of mantle plumes under tectonic plates viewing them as the major driving force of movements of parts of the earth s crust in its more modern form conceived in the 1970s it tries to reconcile in one single geodynamic model the horizontalistic concept of plate tectonics and the verticalistic concepts of mantle plumes by the gravitational movement of plates away from major domes of

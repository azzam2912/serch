one of the three diazines six membered heterocyclics with two nitrogen atoms in the ring it has the nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3 in the ring the other diazines are pyrazine nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 4 positions and pyridazine nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 2 positions in nucleic acids three types of nucleobases are pyrimidine derivatives cytosine c thymine t and uracil u the pyrimidine ring system has wide occurrence in nature as substituted and ring fused compounds and derivatives including the nucleotides cytosine thymine and uracil thiamine vitamin b1 and alloxan it is also found in many synthetic compounds such as barbiturates and the hiv drug zidovudine although pyrimidine derivatives such as uric acid and alloxan were known in the early 19th century a laboratory synthesis of a pyrimidine was not carried out until 1879 when grimaux reported the preparation of barbituric acid from urea and malonic acid in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride the systematic study of pyrimidines began in 1884 with pinner who synthesized derivatives by condensing ethyl acetoacetate with amidines pinner first proposed the name pyrimidin in 1885 the parent compound was first prepared by gabriel and colman in 1900 by

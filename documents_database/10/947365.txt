the differential equation is called oscillating if it has an oscillating solution the number of roots carries also information on the spectrum of associated boundary value problems the differential equation is oscillating as sin x is a solution oscillation theory was initiated by jacques charles fran ois sturm in his investigations of sturm liouville problems from 1836 there he showed that the n th eigenfunction of a sturm liouville problem has precisely n 1 roots for the one dimensional schr dinger equation the question about oscillation non oscillation answers the question whether the eigenvalues accumulate at the bottom of the continuous spectrum in 1996 gesztesy simon teschl showed that the number of roots of the wronski determinant of two eigenfunctions of a sturm liouville problem gives the number of eigenvalues between the corresponding eigenvalues it was later on generalized by kr ger teschl to the case of two eigenfunctions of two different sturm liouville problems the investigation of the number of roots of the wronski determinant of two solutions is known as relative oscillation theory classical results in oscillation theory are

ccps allow experts in computational research to come together and develop scientific software which can be applied to numerous research fields it is used as a tool in many research and development areas and hosts a variety of projects every ccp project is the result of years of valuable work by computational researchers it is advised for projects to have one application this helps users to search a category and classification system so they can find the right project for their work furthermore the project can be under up to three ccps provided it is a collaboration each classification category will have sub sections to filter the category further ccpforge projects such provide essential information which has been used in publications such as recent developments in r matrix applications to molecular processes and ab initio derivation of hubbard models for cold atoms in optical lattices in which codes from ccpq were used the joint information systems committee jisc and epsrc both fund the ccpforge project the scientific computing department scd of the science and technology facilities council is responsible for the development and maintenance of ccpforge and this is funded by a long term support grant from epsrc ccpq was

elegans d melanogaster x laevis and sea urchins the full length human protein has 270 amino acids 31 kda with a centrally located rna binding domain rbd the 75 amino acid rbd is well conserved across species however the remainder of slbp is highly divergent in most organisms and not homologous to any other protein in the eukaryotic genomes this gene encodes a protein that binds to the histone 3 utr stem loop structure in replication dependent histone mrnas histone mrnas do not contain introns or polyadenylation signals and are processed by a single endonucleolytic cleavage event downstream of the stem loop the stem loop structure is essential for efficient processing of the histone pre mrna but this structure also controls the transport translation and stability of histone mrnas slbp expression is regulated during s phase of the cell cycle increasing more than 10 fold during the latter part of g1 all slbp proteins are capable of forming a highly stable complex with histone stem loop rna complex formation with the histone mrna stem loop is achieved by a novel three helix bundle fold slbp proteins also recognize the tetraloop structure of the histone hairpin the base of the stem

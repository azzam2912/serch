in 1944 landau proposed an equation for the evolution of the magnitude of the disturbance which is now called as the landau equation to explain the transition to turbulence without providing a formal derivation and an attempt to derive this equation from hydrodynamic equations was done by stuart for plane poiseuille flow in 1958 the formal derivation to derive landau equation was given by stuart watson and palm in 1960 the perturbation in the vicinity of bifurcation is governed by the following equation where the landau equation is the equation for the magnitude of the disturbance can also be re written as similarly the equation for the phase is given by due to the universality of the equation the equation finds its application in many fields such as hydrodynamic stability chemical reactions such as belousov zhabotinsky reaction etc the landau equation is linear when written for the dependent variable formula 9 leading to the general solution for formula 11 where formula 13 as formula 14 the solution goes to a constant value independent of the initial condition i e formula 15 at large times

in case of free group these simpler elements are reduced words and in the case of free product of groups these are reduced sequences the precise definitions of these are given below as it turns out for a free group and for the free product of groups there exists a unique normal form i e each element is representable by a simpler element and this representation is unique this is the normal form theorem for the free groups and for the free product of groups the proof here of the normal form theorem follows the idea of artin and van der waerden let formula 1 be a free group with generating set formula 2 each element in formula 1 is represented by a word formula 4 where formula 5 definition a word is called reduced if it contains no string of the form formula 6 definition a normal form for a free group formula 1 with generating set formula 2 is a choice of a reduced word in formula 2 for each element of formula 1 proof an elementary transformation of a word formula 12 consists of inserting or deleting a part of the form formula 13 with formula 14

in its essence the term connotes a ubiquitous interactive equilibrium among molecules unbound ions and radicals signifying a process of mild unrestricted redox catalysis in aerobic redox enzymology murburn stands for mured burning connoting a closed burning and implies a spontaneous reaction equilibrium involving diffusible reactive oxygen species dros though quite akin to the oxygen assisted combustion of fuel unlike the flames produced in the open burning process the biological reaction occurs in enclosed premises is mild and may generate heat alone and no flames such a reaction could also incur selective and specific electron moiety transfers further though burning is a reaction that usually involves oxygen aerobic process burning flames produced by anoxic oxidants are also well known therefore the enzymes working via murburn scheme aerobic or anaerobic could be called murzymes while enzyme activities are classically defined by the interaction of the protein with its substrate at a defined active site murburn scheme obligatorily invokes a diffusible species or a reactive radical for carrying out this agenda the conventional enzyme substrate interaction scheme invokes fischer s lock and key type affinity or koshland s induced fit theory that is a substrate is identified by the enzyme by virtue

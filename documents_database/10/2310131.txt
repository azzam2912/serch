classifications systems are devised to describe patterns of injury which will behave in predictable ways to distinguish between conditions which have different outcomes or which need different treatments most wrist fracture systems have failed to accomplish any of these goals and there is no consensus about the most useful one at one extreme a stable undisplaced extra articular fracture has an excellent prognosis on the other hand an unstable displaced intra articular fracture is difficult to treat and has a poor prognosis without operative intervention eponyms such as colles smith s and barton s fractures are discouraged an anatomic description of the fracture is the easiest way to describe the fracture determine treatment and assess stability the articular joint s surface must be smooth for it to function properly irregularity may result in radiocarpal arthritis pain and stiffness more than 1 mm of incongruity places the patient at a high risk for post traumatic arthritis significant articular incongruity typically occurs in young patients after high energy injuries if the surface is very irregular and cannot be reconstructed then the only option may be a fusion of the joint a dorsal tilt of a distal radius fracture is shown in in

the schaku is superior in many ways to the aar janney knuckle coupler because it also automates electrical and pneumatic connections and disconnections however there is no standard for the placement of these electro pneumatic connections some rail operators have placed them on the sides while others have placed them above the mechanical portion of the coupler the main disadvantage of the scharfenberg coupler is the relatively low maximum tonnage it can support which makes it unsuitable for freight operations the face of the scharfenberg coupler has a protruding cone and a matching cup inside the cone there is a rigid metal hoop connected to a revolving spring loaded metal disk with a notch on the opposite side when ready to couple the spring turns the disk so the hoop is extended from the cone as the cars meet the hoop enters the cup on the other coupler stopping against the disk the hoops are then pressed back into their own coupler causing the disks to rotate until the notches align with the hoops after the hoops have entered the notches on the disks spring back into the hoop extended position locking the coupling in the coupled position forces on

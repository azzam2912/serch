subanalytic sets still have a reasonable local description in terms of submanifolds a subset v of a given euclidean space e is semianalytic if each point has a neighbourhood u in e such that the intersection of v and u lies in the boolean algebra of sets generated by subsets defined by inequalities f 0 where f is a real analytic function there is no tarski seidenberg theorem for semianalytic sets and projections of semianalytic sets are in general not semianalytic a subset v of e is a subanalytic set if for each point there exists a relatively compact semianalytic set x in a euclidean space f of dimension at least as great as e and a neighbourhood u in e such that the intersection of v and u is a linear projection of x into e from f in particular all semianalytic sets are subanalytic on an open dense subset subanalytic sets are submanifolds and so they have a definite dimension at most points semianalytic sets are contained in a real analytic subvariety of the same dimension however subanalytic sets are not in general contained in any subvariety of the same dimension on the other hand there is a

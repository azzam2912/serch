it is related to the dose response model in the medical literature generally speaking treatment levels may be finite or infinite as well as ordinal or cardinal which leads to a large collection of possible treatment effects to be studied in applications one example is the effect of different levels of program participation e g full time and part time in a job training program assume there exists a finite collection of multi valued treatment status formula 1 with j some fixed integer as in the potential outcomes framework denote formula 2 the collection of potential outcomes under the treatment j and formula 3 denotes the observed outcome and formula 4 is an indicator that equals 1 when the treatment equals j and 0 when it does not equal j leading to a fundamental problem of causal inference a general framework that analyzes ordered choice models in terms of marginal treatment effects and average treatment effects has been extensively discussed by heckman and vytlacil recent work in the econometrics and statistics literature has focused on estimation and inference for multivalued treatments and ignorability conditions for identifying the treatment effects in the context of program evaluation the propensity score has been

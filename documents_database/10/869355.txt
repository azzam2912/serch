it emphasizes the shared contributions of genes environment and epigenetic factors on developmental processes dst unlike conventional scientific theories is not directly used to help make predictions for testing experimental results instead it is seen as a collection of philosophical psychological and scientific models of development and evolution as a whole these models argue the inadequacy of the modern evolutionary synthesis on the roles of genes and natural selection as the principle explanation of living structures developmental systems theory embraces a large range of positions that expand biological explanations of organismal development and hold modern evolutionary theory as a misconception of the nature of living processes all versions of developmental systems theory espouse the view that in other words although it does not claim that all structures are equal development systems theory is fundamentally opposed to reductionism of all kinds in short developmental systems theory intends to formulate a perspective which does not presume the causal or ontological priority of any particular entity and thereby maintains an explanatory openness on all empirical fronts for example there is vigorous resistance to the widespread assumptions that one can legitimately speak of genes for specific phenotypic characters or that adaptation consists of evolution

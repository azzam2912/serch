thus activation is conceptually the opposite of protection in which the resulting state exhibits a decreased propensity to undergo a certain reaction the energy of activation specifies the amount of free energy the reactants must possess in addition to their rest energy in order to initiate their conversion into corresponding products that is in order to reach the transition state for the reaction the energy needed for activation can be quite small and often it is provided by the natural random thermal fluctuations of the molecules themselves i e without any external sources of energy the branch of chemistry that deals with this topic is called chemical kinetics in biochemistry activation specifically called bioactivation is where enzymes or other biologically active molecules acquire the ability to perform their biological function such as inactive proenzymes being converted into active enzymes that are able to catalyze their substrates reactions into products bioactivation may also refer to the process where inactive prodrugs are converted into their active metabolites or the toxication of protoxins into actual toxins an enzyme may be reversibly or irreversibly bioactivated a major mechanism of irreversible bioactivation is where a piece of a protein is cut off by cleavage producing

the enzyme released into the mouth along with the saliva catalyzes the first reaction in the digestion of dietary lipid with diglycerides being the primary reaction product however due to the unique characteristics of lingual lipase including a ph optimum 4 5 5 4 and its ability to catalyze reactions without bile salts the lipolytic activity continues through to the stomach enzyme release is signaled by autonomic nervous system after ingestion at which time the serous glands under the circumvallate and foliate lingual papillae on the surface of the tongue secrete lingual lipase to the grooves of the circumvallate and foliate papillae co localized with fat taste receptors the hydrolysis of the dietary fats is essential for fat absorption by the small intestine as long chain triacylglycerides cannot be absorbed and as much as 30 of fat is hydrolyzed within 1 to 20 minutes of ingestion by lingual lipase alone lingual lipase together with gastric lipase comprise the two acidic lipases lingual lipase uses a catalytic triad consisting of aspartic acid 203 asp histidine 257 his and serine 144 ser to initiate the hydrolysis of a triglyceride into a diacylglyceride and a free fatty acid first there is a series

for a diatomic molecule like co or hcl or a linear polyatomic molecule like ocs in its ground vibrational state the allowed rotational energies in the rigid rotor approximation are j is the quantum number for total rotational angular momentum and takes all integer values starting at zero i e formula 14 is the rotational constant and formula 15 is the moment of inertia here we are using b in energy units if it is expressed in frequency units replace b by hb in all the expression that follow where h is planck s constant if b is given in units of formula 16 then replace b by hcb where c is the speed of light in vacuum for each value of j we have rotational degeneracy formula 17 2j 1 so the rotational partition function is therefore for all but the lightest molecules or the very lowest temperatures we have formula 19 this suggests we can approximate the sum by replacing the sum over j by an integral of j treated as a continuous variable this approximation is known as the high temperature limit it is also called the classical approximation as this is the result for the canonical

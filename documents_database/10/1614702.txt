it was named after the astronomers fran ois and monique spite who published the discovery in 1982 the element lithium was first produced during the big bang that created the observable universe the cosmic abundance of lithium is of interest because it provides several constraints to the various big bang models those models that fail to satisfy these constraints are therefore subject to rejection or correction by the scientific community lithium is readily consumed by fusion with protons at temperatures above such as is found in the cores of stars thus if the convection zone of a main sequence star carries lithium to the core region the abundance of lithium in the star can decrease likewise lithium can be produced in interstellar matter by spallation collisions with cosmic rays or by the evolution of stars of moderate mass to obtain a good estimate of the primordial abundance of lithium astronomers fran ois and monique spite measured the abundance of lithium in old population ii stars or old halo stars such stars were formed early in the universe out of material that had not been significantly modified by other processes their results showed that the curve on a graph of the

g del s completeness theorem is about this latter kind of completeness complete theories are closed under a number of conditions internally modelling the t schema maximal consistent sets are a fundamental tool in the model theory of classical logic and modal logic their existence in a given case is usually a straightforward consequence of zorn s lemma based on the idea that a contradiction involves use of only finitely many premises in the case of modal logics the collection of maximal consistent sets extending a theory t closed under the necessitation rule can be given the structure of a model of t called the canonical model some examples of complete theories are

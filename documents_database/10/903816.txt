in physics from california institute of technology in 1966 and his ph d in physics from the university of pennsylvania in 1971 working with kondo superconductors he joined the physics faculty at the university of california los angeles in 1972 and studied thermopower density waves and high field phenomena mostly in organic superconductors the lure of actually seeing the microscopics of a system led him to soft matter he helped develop techniques to measure elasticity and motion and understand colloidal interactions hard and soft matter interests continued after joining the faculty at upenn 1983 the staff at exxon research 1983 and the faculty at princeton university 1988 his interests in geometry topology led to his founding contributions to diblock copolymer nanolithography and studies of defects annealing and pattern formation he helped demonstrate and explain why ellipsoids pack more densely than spheres in 2005 he helped found the center for soft matter research at new york university his more recent research centers on artificial self replication self assembly active matter dna nanotechnology topological defects on curved surfaces and quantifying order far from equilibrium he is currently a silver professor of physics at new york university principles of condensed matter physics with

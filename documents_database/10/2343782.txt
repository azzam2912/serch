these engagements were a part of the black sea campaigns between axis and soviet naval forces as during the first 1941 campaign and the following year campaign the soviet navy sent submarines against the axis supply lines along the western coast of the black sea once again axis defenses primarily consisted of romanian laid fields of mines at the beginning of the year the soviet navy had 18 operable submarines and 11 on refit and organized them into wolf packs of groups of 3 with an attempted coordination with aircraft though reports were often late at first soviet results were reduced due to effective german interception and the shallow drafts of many targets however better results were scored after the summer with introduction of new torpedo fuses german u boats of the 30th u boat flotilla operated on the eastern site of the black sea attacking soviet targets soviet submarines have been estimated to have sunk 20 targets 34 000 grt while suffering less losses a better result compared to the campaigns of 1941 and 1942 this improvement forced the germans to create a proper anti submarine warfare unit the 1 unterseebootsjagdflottille operating since june 1943 with 18 converted trawlers

the catalytic mechanism of the asparagine peptide lyases involves an asparagine residue acting as nucleophile to perform a nucleophilic elimination reaction rather than hydrolysis to catalyse the breaking of a peptide bond the existence of this seventh catalytic type of proteases in which the peptide bond cleavage occurs by self processing instead of hydrolysis was demonstrated with the discovery of the crystal structure of the self cleaving precursor of the tsh autotransporter from e coli these enzymes are synthesized as precursors or propeptides which cleave themselves by an autoproteolytic reaction the self cleaving nature of asparagine peptide lyases contradicts the general definition of an enzyme given that the enzymatic activity destroys the enzyme however the self processing is the action of a proteolytic enzyme notwithstanding the enzyme is not recoverable from the reaction all the proteolytic activity of the asparagine peptide lyases is only self cleavages then no further peptidase activity occurs the main residue of the active site is the asparagine and there are other residues involved in the catalytic mechanism which are different between the different families of asparagine peptide lyases the cleavage mechanism consists in the cyclization of the asparagine assisted by other active site residues in

squitter pulses were originally and are still used in the dme tacan air navigation systems squitter pulses because of their randomness and identical appearance to standard reply pulse pairs appear the same as unsolicited unsynchronised replies to other interrogating aircraft squitter was first used in the original iff systems these used a superregenerative receiver which greatly amplified input signals using positive feedback if the gain was set too high random radio noise like static would enter the amplifier and cause it to send out a signal creating random signals an automatic gain control system on subsequent models cured this problem primarily squitter is used to maintain a regular signal from the ground beacon in the tacan system signal strength variation due to rotation of the transmitting beam amplitude modulation determines the coarse bearing function this function would be lost without a constant 2700 4800 pulse pairs per second carrier like signal in cases of low or no interrogating aircraft in the mode s secondary surveillance radar system the term is used to describe messages that are unsolicited downlink transmissions from an automatic dependent surveillance broadcast ads b mode s transponder system mode s transponders transmit acquisition squitter unsolicited downlink transmissions

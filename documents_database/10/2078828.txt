in life all amphiaspidids are thought to be benthic animals that lived most of their lives mostly buried in the sediment of a series of hypersaline lagoons amphiaspids are easily distinguished from other heterostracans in that all of the plates of the cephalothoracic armor are fused into a single muff like unit so that the forebody of the living animal would have looked in the case of gabreyaspidids vaguely like a horseshoe crab with a pair of small or degenerated eyes with each flanked by a preorbital opening and a simple slit like mouth positioned slightly ventrally gabreyaspidids differ from the amphiaspidoid amphiaspids of amphiaspididae primarily due to ornamentation unique to each family and differs from amphiaspidoid amphiaspids of olbiaspididae in that gabreyaspidids mouths are ventrally positioned whereas the mouths of olbiaspidids are positioned anteriorly gabreyaspis tarda is the type species of the family and is known from several mostly complete cephalothoracic armors it has a woodgrain like ornamentation over its armor with several tesserae like units especially around the head region prosarctaspis taimyrica has a broad flat half circle shaped armor that looks vaguely like a horseshoe crab pelaspis teres differs from other gabreyaspidids in its unique ornamentation the

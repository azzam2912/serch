the original setting was for the riemann sphere where it was about the existence of regular differential equations with prescribed monodromy groups first the riemann sphere may be replaced by an arbitrary riemann surface and then in higher dimensions riemann surfaces are replaced by complex manifolds of dimension 1 there is a correspondence between certain systems of partial differential equations linear and having very special properties for their solutions and possible monodromies of their solutions such a result was proved for algebraic connections with regular singularities by pierre deligne 1970 and more generally for regular holonomic d modules by masaki kashiwara 1980 1984 and zoghman mebkhout 1980 1984 independently suppose that x is a smooth complex algebraic variety riemann hilbert correspondence for regular singular connections there is a functor sol called the local solutions functor that is an equivalence from the category of flat connections on algebraic vector bundles on x with regular singularities to the category of local systems of finite dimensional complex vector spaces on x for x connected the category of local systems is also equivalent to the category of complex representations of the fundamental group of x the condition of regular singularities means that locally constant

the device consists of an internal drain connected to a grenade shaped bulb via plastic tubing the purpose of a drain is to prevent fluid blood or other build up in a closed dead space which may cause either disruption of the wound and the healing process or become an infected abscess with either scenario possibly requiring a formal drainage repair procedure and possibly another trip to the operating room the drain is also used to evacuate an internal abscess before surgery when an infection already exists if the drainage tubing becomes clogged or otherwise clotted off the benefits are not realized from drainage the flexible bulb has a plug that can be opened to pour off collected fluid each time fluid is removed the patient caregiver or healthcare provider squeezes the air out of the bulb and replaces the plug before releasing the bulb the resulting vacuum creates suction in the drainage tubing which gradually draws fluid from the surgical site into the bulb the bulb may be repeatedly opened to remove the collected fluid and squeezed again to restore suction it is best to empty drains before they are more than half full to avoid the discomfort of

similar reactions occur when tertiary phosphines are treated with alkyl halides the reaction is the method of choice for the preparation quaternary ammonium salts some phase transfer catalysts ptc can be prepared according to the menshutkin reaction for instance the synthesis of triethyl benzyl ammonium chloride teba from triethylamine and benzyl chloride reactions are typically conducted in polar solvents such as alcohols alkyl iodides are superior alkylating agents relative to the bromides which in turn are superior to chlorides as is typical for an s2 process benzylic allylic and carbonylated alkyl halides are excellent reactants even though alkyl chlorides are poor alkylating agents gem dichlorides especially so amines should not be handled in chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane and dichloroethane especially at high temperatures due to the possibility of a menshutkin reaction sometimes kinetically facile reactions like acylations are sometimes conducted in chlorinated solvents nonetheless highly nucleophilic tertiary amines like dabco will react with dichloromethane at room temperature overnight and at reflux 39 40 c over several hours to give the quaternized product see the article on selectfluor due to steric hindrance and unfavorable electronic properties chloroform reacts very slowly with tertiary amines over a period of several weeks to

popular examples of xerophytes are cacti pineapple and some gymnosperm plants the structural features morphology and fundamental chemical processes physiology of xerophytes are variously adapted to conserve water also common to store large quantities of water during dry periods other species are able to survive long periods of extreme dryness or desiccation of their tissues during which their metabolic activity may effectively shut down plants with such morphological and physiological adaptations are xerophytes such as cacti are capable of withstanding extended periods of dry conditions as they have deep spreading roots and capacity to store water the leaves are waxy and thorny that prevents loss of water and moisture even their fleshy stems can store water plants absorb water from the soil which then evaporates from their shoots and leaves this process is known as transpiration in dry environments a typical mesophytic plant would evaporate water faster than the rate of water uptake from the soil leading to wilting and even death xerophytic plants exhibit a diversity of specialized adaptations to survive in such water limiting conditions they may use water from their own storage allocate water specifically to sites of new tissue growth or lose less water to the

at a combined magnitude 1 7 it is one of the brightest stars in the night sky and contains by far the closest and brightest wolf rayet star it has the traditional name suhail al muhlif and the modern name regor but neither is approved by the international astronomical union the velorum system includes a pair of stars separated by 41 each of which is also a spectroscopic binary system velorum the brighter of the visible pair contains the wolf rayet star and a blue supergiant while velorum contains a blue giant and an unseen companion gamma velorum is close enough to have accurate parallax measurements as well as distance estimates by more indirect means the hipparcos parallax for implies a distance of 342 pc a dynamical parallax derived from calculations of the orbital parameters gives a value of 336 pc similar to spectrophotometric derivations a vlti interferometry measurement of the distance gives a slightly larger value of 368 51 pc all these distances are somewhat less than the commonly assumed distance of 450 pc for the vela ob2 association which is the closest grouping of young massive stars the gamma velorum system is composed of at least four stars

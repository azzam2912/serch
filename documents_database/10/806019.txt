census totals for tolland county connecticut broken down by municipality from 1900 to 2000 like most areas of new england tolland county is and has been at all times since well before the 20th century entirely divided into incorporated municipalities there is no unincorporated territory there are three types of municipalities in connecticut towns boroughs and cities as in the other new england states towns are the basic unit of municipal government boroughs overlay towns and assume responsibility for some municipal services within their boundaries boroughs are not found in any of the other new england states and are not very common in connecticut today although they were somewhat more numerous in the past a number of boroughs have disincorporated over the years choosing to revert to full town control cities also overlay towns this is different from the other new england states where cities are a different type of municipality equivalent to a town this difference is related to cities having originally developed in connecticut from the borough model most current cities are coextensive with their parent town however such that the entire municipality functions as a city in practice these cities are really no different from cities in

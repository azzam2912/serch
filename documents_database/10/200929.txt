the first 43 star numbers are 1 13 37 73 121 181 253 337 433 541 661 793 937 1093 1261 1441 1633 1837 2053 2281 2521 2773 3037 3313 3601 3901 4213 4537 4873 5221 5581 5953 6337 6733 7141 7561 7993 8437 8893 9361 9841 10333 10837 the digital root of a star number is always 1 or 4 and progresses in the sequence 1 4 1 the last two digits of a star number in base 10 are always 01 13 21 33 37 41 53 61 73 81 or 93 unique among the star numbers is 35113 since its prime factors i e 13 37 and 73 are also consecutive star numbers geometrically the n th star number is made up of a central point and 12 copies of the n 1 th triangular number making it numerically equal to the n th centered dodecagonal number but differently arranged infinitely many star numbers are also triangular numbers the first four being s 1 t s 253 t s 49141 t and s 9533161 t infinitely many star numbers are also square numbers the first four being s 1 s 121 11 s 11881 109 and s

functionally the model 91 ran like any other large scale system 360 but the internal organization was the most advanced of the system 360 line and it was the first ibm computer to support out of order instruction execution it ran os 360 as its operating system it was designed to handle high speed data processing for scientific applications this included space exploration theoretical astronomy sub atomic physics and global weather forecasting the first model 91 was used at the nasa goddard space flight center in 1968 and at the time was the most powerful computer in user operation it was capable of performing up to 16 6 million instructions a second the cpu consisted of five autonomous units instruction floating point fixed point and two storage controllers for the overlapping memory units and the i o data channels the floating point unit made heavy use of instruction pipelining and was the first implementation of tomasulo s algorithm it was also one of the first computers to utilize multi channel memory architecture there were four models of the ibm system 360 model 91 they differed by their main memory configuration all using ibm s 2395 processor storage the 91k had

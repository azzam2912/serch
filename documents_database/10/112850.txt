the simplest example of the utility of operators is the study of symmetry which makes the concept of a group useful in this context because of this they are very useful tools in classical mechanics operators are even more important in quantum mechanics where they form an intrinsic part of the formulation of the theory in classical mechanics the movement of a particle or system of particles is completely determined by the lagrangian formula 1 or equivalently the hamiltonian formula 2 a function of the generalized coordinates q generalized velocities formula 3 and its conjugate momenta if either l or h is independent of a generalized coordinate q meaning the l and h do not change when q is changed which in turn means the dynamics of the particle are still the same even when q changes the corresponding momenta conjugate to those coordinates will be conserved this is part of noether s theorem and the invariance of motion with respect to the coordinate q is a symmetry operators in classical mechanics are related to these symmetries more technically when h is invariant under the action of a certain group of transformations g the elements of g are physical operators

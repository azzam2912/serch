they have sac like bodies and three distinctly different forms in different parts of their two stage life cycle they appear so different from other animals that they were assigned their own new phylum cycliophora shortly after they were discovered in 1995 this was the first new phylum of multicelled organism to be discovered since the loricifera in 1983 symbion was discovered in 1995 by reinhardt kristensen and peter funch on the mouthparts of the norway lobster nephrops norvegicus and other related species have since been discovered on the genus is so named because of its commensal relationship with the lobster a form of symbiosis it feeds on the leftovers from the lobster s own meals the genus symbion are peculiar microscopic animals with no obvious close relatives and which was therefore given its own phylum called cycliophora the phylogenetic position of symbion remains unclear originally the phyla ectoprocta and entoprocta were considered possible relatives of symbion based on structural similarities however genetic studies suggest that symbion may be more closely related to gnathifera symbion pandora has a bilateral sac like body with no coelom there are three basic life stages symbion can reproduce both asexually by budding and sexually

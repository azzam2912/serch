typically the leading edge also sweeps forward the forward swept configuration has a number of characteristics which increase as the angle of sweep increases the rearward location of the main wing spar would lead to a more efficient interior arrangement with more usable space air flowing over any swept wing tends to move spanwise towards the rearmost end of the wing on a rearward swept wing this is outwards towards the tip while on a forward swept wing it is inwards towards the root as a result the dangerous tip stall condition of a rearward swept design becomes a safer and more controllable root stall on a forward swept design this allows full aileron control despite loss of lift and also means that drag inducing leading edge slots or other devices are not required with the air flowing inwards wingtip vortices and the accompanying drag are reduced instead the fuselage acts as a very large wing fence and since wings are generally larger at the root this raises the maximum lift coefficient allowing a smaller wing as a result maneuverability is improved especially at high angles of attack at transonic speeds shockwaves build up first at the root rather than

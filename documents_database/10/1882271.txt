the basic kolsky model is used for its simplicity in seismic data processing however it does not rigorously satisfy the minimum phase criterion and cannot satisfy the kramers kronig relations but then the kolsky s modified model comes to our rescue producing an accurate representation of the velocity dispersion within the seismic frequency band the basic kolsky model is presented in kolsky s book stress waves in solids that are available as a google book stress waves in solids 1963 edition kolsky s modified model is presented in wang s book seismic inverse q filtering this book is also available as a google book seismic inverse q filtering 2008 the theoretical background for mathematical q models can be found in the wikipedia article mathematical q models here we found a function k w we can call a propagation constant in line with futterman k w can be linked to the phase velocity of the seismic wave with the formula to obtain a solution that can be applied to seismic k w must be connected to a function that represent the way the seismic wave propagates in the seismic media this functions can be regarded as a q model in his

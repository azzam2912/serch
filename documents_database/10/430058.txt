it a bright yellowish brown solid but its aqueous solutions are bright violet the related sodium salt i e disodium nitrosodisulfonate nds naon so cas rn 29554 37 8 is also referred to as fr my s salt regardless of the cations the salts are distinctive because aqueous solutions contain the radical on so fremy s salt being a long lived free radical is used as a standard in electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy e g for quantitation of radicals it intense epr spectrum is dominated by three lines of equal intensity with a spacing of about 13 g 1 3 mt the inorganic aminoxyl group is a persistent radical akin to tempo it has been used in some oxidation reactions e g for oxidation of some anilines and phenols it can also be used as a model for peroxyl radicals in studies that examine the antioxidant mechanism of action in a wide range of natural products fremy s salt is prepared from hydroxylaminedisulfonic acid oxidation of the conjugate base gives the purple dianion the synthesis can be performed by combining nitrite and bisulfite to give the hydroxylaminedisulfonate oxidation is typically conducted at low temperature either chemically or by electrolysis

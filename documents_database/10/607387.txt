standard tcp performs poorly in networks with a large bandwidth delay product it is unable to fully utilize available bandwidth hstcp makes minor modifications to standard tcp s congestion control mechanism to overcome this limitation when an ack is received in congestion avoidance the window is increased by formula 1 and when a loss is detected through triple duplicate acknowledgments the window is decreased by formula 2 where w is the current window size when the congestion window is small hstcp behaves exactly like standard tcp so a w is 1 and b w is 0 5 when tcp s congestion window is beyond a certain threshold a w and b w become functions of the current window size in this region as the congestion window increases the value of a w increases and the value of b w decreases this means that hstcp s window will grow faster than standard tcp and also recover from losses more quickly this behavior allows hstcp to be friendly to standard tcp flows in normal networks and also to quickly utilize available bandwidth in networks with large bandwidth delay products hstcp has the same slow start timeout behavior as standard tcp since only

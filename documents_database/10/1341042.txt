ventricular volume overload is approximately equivalent to an excessively high preload it is a cause of cardiac failure in accordance with the frank starling law of the heart the myocardium contracts more powerfully as the end diastolic volume increases stretching of the myofibrils in cardiac muscle causes them to contract more powerfully due to a greater number of cross bridges being formed between the myofibrils within cardiac myocytes this is true up to a point however beyond this there is a loss of contractile ability due to loss of connection between myofibrils see figure various pathologies listed below can lead to volume overload different mechanisms are involved depending on the cause however the common theme is that of a high cardiac output with a low or normal afterload the output may be high due to the inefficiency in valve disease or it may be high due to shunting of blood in left to right shunts and arteriovenous malformations left ventricular volume overload may produce inverted u waves on the electrocardiogram causes may be considered according to which chamber is affected left ventricular volume overload right ventricular volume overload

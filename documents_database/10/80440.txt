to some his discovery is considered the most important breakthrough of the twentieth century in the field of electronics since it has a wide area of application this is because all electronic devices vacuum tubes bipolar transistors and mos transistors are inherently nonlinear but they can be made substantially linear with the application of negative feedback negative feedback works by sacrificing gain for higher linearity or in other words smaller distortion intermodulation by sacrificing gain it also has an additional effect of increasing the bandwidth of the amplifier however a negative feedback amplifier can be unstable such that it may oscillate once the stability problem is solved the negative feedback amplifier is extremely useful in the field of electronics black published a famous paper stabilized feedback amplifiers in 1934 he was born in leominster massachusetts in 1898 he went to worcester polytechnic institute wpi for his first degree subsequently he received a b s s in electrical engineering from wpi in 1921 and then joined western electric which was the manufacturing arm of at t he joined bell labs 1925 where he was a member of technical staff until his retirement 1963 black started writing his autobiography with the tentative

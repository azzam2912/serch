in perceiving a sequence of consecutive stimuli subjects tend to overestimate the elapsed time between two successive stimuli when the distance between the stimuli is sufficiently large and to underestimate the elapsed time when the distance is sufficiently small the kappa effect can occur with visual e g flashes of light auditory e g tones or tactile e g taps to the skin stimuli many studies of the kappa effect have been conducted using visual stimuli for example suppose three light sources x y and z are flashed successively in the dark with equal time intervals between each of the flashes if the light sources are placed at different positions with x and y closer together than y and z the temporal interval between the x and y flashes is perceived to be shorter than that between the y and z flashes the kappa effect has also been demonstrated with auditory stimuli that move in frequency however in some experimental paradigms the auditory kappa effect has not been observed for example roy et al 2011 found that opposite to the prediction of the kappa effect increasing the distance between sound sources marking time intervals leads to a decrease of the

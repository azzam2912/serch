the hodgkin huxley model also shows accommodation sudden depolarisation of a nerve evokes propagated action potential by activating voltage gated fast sodium channels incorporated in the cell membrane if the depolarisation is strong enough to reach threshold the open sodium channels allow more sodium ions to flow into the cell and resulting in further depolarisation which will subsequently open even more sodium channels at a certain moment this process becomes regenerative vicious cycle and results in the rapid ascending phase of action potential in parallel with the depolarisation and sodium channel activation the inactivation process of the sodium channels is also driven by depolarisation since the inactivation is much slower than the activation process during the regenerative phase of action potential inactivation is unable to prevent the chain reaction like rapid increase in the membrane voltage during neuronal accommodation the slowly rising depolarisation drives the activation and inactivation as well as the potassium gates simultaneously and never evokes action potential failure to evoke action potential by ramp depolarisation of any strength had been a great puzzle until hodgkin and huxley created their physical model of action potential later in their life they received a nobel prize for their influential discoveries

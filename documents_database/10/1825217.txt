different methods are used to collect this data but all identify the ratios of different diatom colonies present in samples and match those samples with locations at the crime scene diatoms are diverse microscopic algae with silica cell walls that have different characteristics such as color shape and size there are 8 000 known species of diatoms without taking into account the variety of subspecies that have specialized within their specific environments diatoms do not have specialized nutrient and water conducting tissues which affects their dispersion throughout ecosystems these microscopic organisms mainly inhabit freshwater environments because of their inability to survive with the cleaning agents present in domestic water sources diatoms are identifiable based on each species unique silica cell walls and vary depending on their environment because they have determinant properties diatoms create flora profiles for scientists when these microscopic algae die their frustules silica cell walls becomes a part of the water sediment the presence of the frustules enables scientists to compare the cell walls of the deceased organisms with the living diatoms to determine characteristics of their environment in early spring and the fall the ratio of living diatoms to dead diatoms is high whereas in summer

landin and first described in his article the next 700 programming languages published in the communications of the acm in 1966 the acronym stands for if you see what i mean although not implemented it has proved very influential in the development of programming languages especially functional programming languages such as sasl miranda ml haskell and their successors and dataflow programming languages like lucid iswim is an imperative language with a functional core consisting of a syntactic sugaring of lambda calculus to which are added mutable variables and assignment and a powerful control mechanism the program point operator being based on lambda calculus iswim has higher order functions and lexically scoped variables the operational semantics of iswim are defined using landin s secd machine and use call by value that is eager evaluation a goal of iswim was to look more like mathematical notation so landin abandoned algol s semicolons between statements and codice 1 blocks and replaced them with the off side rule and scoping based on indentation a notationally distinctive feature of iswim is its use of where clauses an iswim program is a single expression qualified by where clauses auxiliary definitions including equations among variables conditional expressions

the limiting case in which part or all of the circumgon is a circular arc is permitted a circumgonal region is the union of those triangular regions every triangle is a circumgonal region because it circumscribes the circle known as the incircle of the triangle every square is a circumgonal region in fact every regular polygon is a circumgonal region as is more generally every tangential polygon but not every polygon is a circumgonal region for example a rectangle is not a circumgonal region need not even be a convex polygon for example it could consist of three triangular wedges meeting only at the circle s center all circumgons have common properties regarding area perimeter ratios and centroids it is these properties that make circumgons interesting objects of study in elementary geometry the concept and the terminology of a circumgon were introduced and their properties investigated first by tom m apostol and mamikon a mnatsakanian in a paper published in 2004 given a circumgon the circle which the circumgon circumscribes is called the incircle of the circumgon the radius of the circle is called the inradius and its center is called the incenter

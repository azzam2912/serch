three isotopes occur naturally stable k 93 3 and k 6 7 and the long lived radioisotope k 0 012 naturally occurring radioactive k decays to stable ar 10 72 of decays by electron capture or positron emission giving it the longest known positron emitter nuclide half life alternately and most of the time 89 28 it decays to stable ca by beta decay k has a half life of 1 248 10 years the long half life of this primordial radioisotope is caused by a highly spin forbidden transition k has a nuclear spin of 4 while both of its decay daughters are even even isotopes with spins of 0 k occurs in natural potassium and thus in some commercial salt substitutes in sufficient quantity that large bags of those substitutes can be used as a radioactive source for classroom demonstrations in healthy animals and people k represents the largest source of radioactivity greater even than c in a human body of 70 kg mass about 4 400 nuclei of k decay per second the decay of k to ar enables a commonly used method for dating rocks the conventional k ar dating method depends on the assumption that

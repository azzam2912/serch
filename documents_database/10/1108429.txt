it is also essential for v d j recombination lig4 forms a complex with xrcc4 and further interacts with the dna dependent protein kinase dna pk and xlf cernunnos which are also required for nhej the crystal structure of the lig4 xrcc4 complex has been resolved defects in this gene are the cause of lig4 syndrome the yeast homolog of lig4 is dnl4 in humans deficiency of dna ligase 4 results in a clinical condition known as lig4 syndrome this syndrome is characterized by cellular radiation sensitivity growth retardation developmental delay microcephaly facial dysmorphisms increased disposition to leukemia variable degrees of immunodeficiency and reduced number of blood cells accumulation of dna damage leading to stem cell exhaustion is regarded as an important aspect of aging deficiency of lig4 in pluripotent stem cells impairs non homologous end joining nhej and results in accumulation of dna double strand breaks and enhanced apoptosis lig4 deficiency in the mouse causes a progressive loss of haematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow cellularity during aging the sensitivity of haematopoietic stem cells to lig4 deficiency suggests that lig4 mediated nhej is a key determinant of the ability of stem cells to maintain themselves against physiological stress over

aem combines features of finite element method and discrete element method simulation with its own solver capabilities for the generation of pc based structural analysis in the els modeler the user has the ability to model using a variety of default structural components such as columns slabs walls windows steel sections reinforcement and 8 node objects pre stressing cables pre cracking and holes can also be added to models to reflect the required attributes of structures to aid the user in modeling attachments such as dxf stl dgn and jpeg can be easily imported models can also be imported from several fem based software programs such as abaqus ansys etabs gambit ideas ls dyna nastran patran sap2000 and staad els is building information modeling bim compatible with a plug in for autodesk revit structure allowing users to import previously created structural components the solver performs multi stage static and dynamic analysis in 2d and 3d static loading types include concentrated loads displacements hydrostatic pressures uniform pressures moving loads element removals and line loads available dynamic loading types include concentrated loads displacements seismic loads uniform pressures element removals and moving loads els comes with a predefined material library with both linear

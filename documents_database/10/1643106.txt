further studies found that sensitivity to phosphatidylcholine levels causes pctp to interact with select enzymes promoting their activation pctp stimulates the acyl coa thioesterase activity of thioesterase superfamily member 2 them2 acyl coa thioesterase 13 acot13 and the activity of homeodomain transcription factor paired box gene 3 pax3 protein kinase c phosphorylation promotes localization of pctp to the mitochondrion where it may activate them2 this soluble protein is 214 amino acids long it is almost entirely composed of a star related transfer domain start x ray crystallography shows that this domain forms a pocket that can bind a single molecule of phosphatidylcholine this protein also founds the stard2 subfamily of proteins this subfamily consists of pctp stard7 stard10 and collagen type iv alpha 3 binding protein or stard11 all of which bind phosphatidylcholine except for stard11 which prefers ceramide pctp is produced in all tissues in the body at various levels the protein is expressed at high levels in tissues engaged in high metabolism notably including the liver and macrophages no human patients with defects in pctp have been described to date mice lacking pctp exhibit a resistance to atherosclerosis linked to changes in plasma lipid levels and changes in

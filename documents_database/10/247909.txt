pipeline architectures belong to this type though a purist might say that the data is different after processing by each stage in the pipeline fault tolerance executing the same instructions redundantly in order to detect and mask errors in a manner known as task replication may be considered to belong to this type applications for this architecture are much less common than mimd and simd as the latter two are often more appropriate for common data parallel techniques specifically they allow better scaling and use of computational resources however one prominent example of misd in computing are the space shuttle flight control computers systolic arrays h t kung and charles e leiserson are an example of misd architecture in a typical systolic array parallel input data flows through a network of hard wired processor nodes resembling the human brain which combine process merge or sort the input data into a derived result systolic arrays are often hard wired for a specific operation such as multiply and accumulate to perform massively parallel integration convolution correlation matrix multiplication or data sorting tasks a systolic array typically consists of a large monolithic network of primitive computing nodes which can be hardwired or software

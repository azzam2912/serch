the concept is closely related to those of the life history development and ontogeny but differs from them in stressing renewal transitions of form may involve growth asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction in some organisms different generations of the species succeed each other during the life cycle for plants and many algae there are two multicellular stages and the life cycle is referred to as alternation of generations the term life history is often used particularly for organisms such as the red algae which have three multicellular stages or more rather than two life cycles that include sexual reproduction involve alternating haploid n and diploid 2 n stages i e a change of ploidy is involved to return from a diploid stage to a haploid stage meiosis must occur in regard to changes of ploidy there are 3 types of cycles the cycles differ in when mitosis growth occurs zygotic meiosis and gametic meiosis have one mitotic stage mitosis occurs during the n phase in zygotic meiosis and during the 2 n phase in gametic meiosis therefore zygotic and gametic meiosis are collectively termed haplobiontic single mitotic phase not to be confused with haplontic sporic meiosis on the other hand

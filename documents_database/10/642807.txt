it can then remove impurities from the syngas prior to the power generation cycle some of these pollutants such as sulfur can be turned into re usable byproducts through the claus process this results in lower emissions of sulfur dioxide particulates mercury and in some cases carbon dioxide with additional process equipment a water gas shift reaction can increase gasification efficiency and reduce carbon monoxide emissions by converting it to carbon dioxide the resulting carbon dioxide from the shift reaction can be separated compressed and stored through sequestration excess heat from the primary combustion and syngas fired generation is then passed to a steam cycle similar to a combined cycle gas turbine this process results in improved thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional pulverized coal combustion coal can be found in abundance in the usa and many other countries and its price has remained relatively constant in recent years of the traditional fossil fuels oil coal and natural gas coal is used as a feedstock for 40 of global electricity generation fossil fuel consumption and its contribution to large scale detrimental environmental changes is becoming a pressing issue especially in light of the paris agreement in particular coal contains more co

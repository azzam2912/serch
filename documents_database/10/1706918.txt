the pulsar planet is most likely composed largely of crystalline carbon but with a density far greater than diamond psr j1719 1438 b orbits so closely to its host star the planet s orbit would fit inside the sun the existence of such carbon planets had been theoretically postulated psr j1719 1438 was first observed in 2009 by a team headed by matthew bailes of swinburne university of technology in melbourne australia the orbiting planet was published in the journal science on august 25 2011 the planet was confirmed through pulsar timing in which small modulations detected in the highly regular pulsar signature are measured and extrapolated observatories in britain hawaii and australia were used to confirm these observations psr j1719 1438 is a pulsar some 4 000 light years away from earth in the serpens cauda constellation approximately one minute from the border with ophiuchus the pulsar completes more than 10 000 rotations a minute it is approximately 12 miles across but has a mass that is 1 4 solar masses psr j1719 1438 b was at the time of its august 25 2011 discovery the densest planet ever discovered at nearly 20 times the density of jupiter about

and fascination toys gifts the levitron top device is a commercial toy under this brand that displays the phenomenon known as spin stabilized magnetic levitation this method with moving permanent magnets is quite distinct from other versions which use changing electromagnetic fields levitating various items such as a rotating world globe model space shuttle or vw beetle and picture frame 750 000 units were sold from 1994 through 1999 the toy top is essentially a permanent magnetic ring and corresponding magnetic base plate with a ring or alternate geometric configuration functional parameters such as the top rotation rate or top weighting are stringent employing principles of the magnetic field and gyroscopic stabilization the levitron top induces levitation through a series of interactive steps the levitated top s stabilizing rotation undergoes natural gradual slowing so that the levitation phenomenon fails within four minutes unless external power is supplied to sustain rotation to levitate the top a plastic plate is placed on top of the magnetic base and the top is spun on the plate at between 25 50 rotations per second 1500 3000 rpm if too slow the top falls over and slides off sideways if too fast it does not

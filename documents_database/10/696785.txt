it is used by millions of people across the world including professionals who put their forecasts online meteorologists who work for news crews and surfers all over the world it is impossible to make an exact prediction of the surf shape and size of breaking waves but by knowing a few factors a good prediction can be made one needs to have an understanding of how waves are formed a basic knowledge of bathymetry and information such as tides location and weather about the surf spot being forecasted to accurately forecast the surf waves are created as wind blows over the ocean transferring its energy into the water the size of the swell is affected by three variables the velocity of the wind its duration and its fetch or distance the wind blows over there are two different types of swell that affect the surf conditions in general groundswell produces waves that are much better for surfing wind swell is usually smaller and almost always choppier and harder to surf than groundswell although both are present at most surf spots groundswell creates much better breaking waves and dominates the lineup this distinct separation occurs because groundswell originates far from the

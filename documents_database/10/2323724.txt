they released their debut album in this moment we are free cities on 20 october 2017 singer marcela bovio was initially part of the line up however when the recording of the band s debut album started bovio and van giersbergen wanted to take very different directions when it came to the sound and approach of the vocals after failing to find a compromise that would satisfy both creatively it was decided that bovio would leave the band as the two were afraid that doing otherwise would leave both regretful and hurt their friendship bovio made her departure official on april 11 2017 stating i m truly devastated because i m a huge fan of anneke and every single member of the band they re all incredibly sweet people as well as top notch musicians plus the songs are so fantastic this is going to be a revolutionary album but i have to follow my heart and choose for what i think in the future will bring me and the rest of the band happiness no matter how hard it feels right now anneke fer jord johan and ed you guys are the best i d wish you luck but

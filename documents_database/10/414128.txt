in traditional and classical logic domains are restrictedly non empty in order that certain theorems be valid interpretations with an empty domain are shown to be a trivial case by a convention originating at least in 1927 with bernays and sch nfinkel though possibly earlier but oft attributed to quine 1951 the convention is to assign any formula beginning with a universal quantifier the value truth while any formula beginning with an existential quantifier is assigned the value falsehood this follows from the idea that existentially quantified statements have existential import i e they imply the existence of something while universally quantified statements do not this interpretation reportedly stems from george boole in the late 19th century but this is debatable in modern model theory it follows immediately for the truth conditions for quantified sentences in other words an existential quantification of the open formula is true in a model iff there is some element in the domain of the model that satisfies the formula i e iff that element has the property denoted by the open formula a universal quantification of an open formula is true in a model iff every element in the domain satisfies that formula note

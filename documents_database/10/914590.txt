the term comes from the hit and run crime with auto vehicles in which the driver hits another car or person causing an accident and then flees the scene it is also known as making a drive by posting a play on the phrase drive by shooting the post often consists of a lengthy text making lots of claims that can be but are not always on topic another variety is the sole posting of a url or link that leads to material that might be used as a discussion primer but with no added opinion of the poster it differs from plain spam since forum spam often is posted by spambots while hit and run posting on the other hand is done by a real person also while spam mostly consists of advertising hit and run posts usually have at least some bearing on the topic at hand however since the poster doesn t stay around to defend the posted material or even discuss it it is considered disrespectful especially by forum regulars who tend to be angered by the fact that the hit and run doesn t become obvious until some or several replies already have been made

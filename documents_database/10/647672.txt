silver carbonate is yellow but typical samples are grayish due to the presence of elemental silver it is poorly soluble in water like most transition metal carbonates silver carbonate can be prepared by combining aqueous solutions of sodium carbonate with a deficiency of silver nitrate freshly prepared silver carbonate is colourless but the solid quickly turns yellow silver carbonate reacts with ammonia to give the explosive fulminating silver with hydrofluoric acid it gives silver fluoride the thermal conversion of silver carbonate to silver metal proceeds via formation of silver oxide the principal use of silver carbonate is for the production of silver powder for use in microelectronics it is reduced with formaldehyde producing silver free of alkali metals silver carbonate is used as a reagent in organic synthesis such as the koenigs knorr reaction in the f tizon oxidation silver carbonate on celite serves as an oxidising agent to form lactones from diols it is also employed to convert alkyl bromides into alcohols as a base it has been used in the wittig reaction and in c h bond activation

modern windshields are generally made of laminated safety glass a type of treated glass which consists of typically two curved sheets of glass with a plastic layer laminated between them for safety and bonded into the window frame motorbike windshields are often made of high impact polycarbonate or acrylic plastic windshields protect the vehicle s occupants from wind and flying debris such as dust insects and rocks and provide an aerodynamically formed window towards the front uv coating may be applied to screen out harmful ultraviolet radiation however this is usually unnecessary since most auto windshields are made from laminated safety glass the majority of uv b is absorbed by the glass itself and any remaining uv b together with most of the uv a is absorbed by the pvb bonding layer on motorbikes their main function is to shield the rider from wind though not as completely as in a car whereas on sports and racing motorcycles the main function is reducing drag when the rider assumes the optimal aerodynamic configuration with his or her body in unison with the machine and does not shield the rider from wind when sitting upright early windshields were made of ordinary window

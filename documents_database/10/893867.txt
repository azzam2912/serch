this release occurs through an ion channel within the membrane of the sr known as a ryanodine receptor ryr which opens upon activation this process is important as it helps to maintain ca concentration within the cell it also initiates muscle contraction in skeletal and cardiac muscles and muscle relaxation in smooth muscles ca sparks are important in physiology as they show how ca can be used at a subcellular level to signal both local changes known as local control as well as whole cell changes as mentioned above ca sparks depend on the opening of ryanodine receptors of which there are three types opening of the channel allows ca to pass from the sr into the cell this increases the local ca concentration around the ryr by a factor of 10 calcium sparks can either be evoked or spontaneous as described below electrical impulses known as action potentials travel along the cell membrane sarcolemma of muscle cells located in the sarcolemma of smooth muscle cells are receptors called dihydropyridine receptors dhpr in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells however these receptors are located within structures known as t tubules that are extensions of the plasma membrane penetrating deep into the

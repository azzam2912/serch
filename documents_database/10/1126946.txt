openxdf primarily focuses on electroencephalography and polysomnography neurotronics began work on openxdf in 2003 with the goal of providing a modern open and extensible file format with which clinicians and researchers can share physiological data and metadata such as signal data signal montages patient demographics and event logs neurotronics released the first draft of the openxdf specification just before the 18th meeting of the associated professional sleep societies in 2004 neurotronics has since relinquished control of the format to the openxdf consortium as of version 1 0 openxdf is 100 backward compatible with the european data format edf the current de facto standard format for physiological data exchange openxdf is a tiered framework designed to allow standardized and custom specializations of the format while enforcing a common foundation that provides a high level of compatibility between unrelated systems openxdf expands on edf by providing standardized support for extensive patient information display montages annotations and scoring information openxdf requires the use of a xml 1 0 compliant parser that supports utf 8 and utf 16 openxdf supports fully and independently configurable data signals each signal specifies its byte order whether its samples are signed the size of its samples and its

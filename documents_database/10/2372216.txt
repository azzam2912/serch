additionally the rnas are found in metagenomic sequences of dna isolated from cow rumen fibro purf motif rnas likely function as cis regulatory elements in view of their positions upstream of protein coding genes in fact instances of the fibro purf rna motif are often located nearby to the predicted shine dalgarno sequence of the downstream gene this arrangement is consistent with a model of cis regulation where the rna allosterically controls access to the shine dalgarno sequence thus regulating the gene translationally all known fibro purf rnas are found upstream of purf genes which encode amidophosphoribosyltransferase which participates in the biosynthesis of biological purine molecules the fibro purf motif is found only in closely related organisms as a result the rnas do not exhibit a high degree of mutations when compared and it was difficult to study the rna s secondary structure by covariation methods as a result the predicted secondary structure is uncertain in some places the fibro purf rna motif was considered a potential candidate riboswitch but no ligand has been established as of 2018

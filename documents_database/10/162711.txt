identification keys are also used in many other scientific and technical fields to identify various kinds of entities such as diseases soil types minerals or archaeological and anthropological artifacts traditionally identification keys have most commonly taken the form of single access keys these work by offering a fixed sequence of identification steps each with multiple alternatives the choice of which determines the next step if each step has only two alternatives the key is said to be dichotomous else it is polytomous modern multi access or interactive keys allow the user to freely choose the identification steps and their order at each step the user must answer a question about one or more features characters of the entity to be identified for example a step in a botanical key may ask about the color of flowers or the disposition of the leaves along the stems a key for insect identification may ask about the number of bristles on the rear leg identification errors may have serious consequences in both pure and applied disciplines including ecology medical diagnosis pest control forensics etc therefore identification keys must be constructed with great care in order to minimize the incidence of such errors whenever

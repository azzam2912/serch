originally the calabrian was a european faunal stage primarily based on mollusk fossils it has become the second geologic age in the early pleistocene many of the mammalian faunal assemblages of the early pleistocene start in the gelasian for example the platygonus and other blancan fauna appear first in the gelasian because sea shells are much more abundant as fossils 19th and early 20th century geo scientists used the plentiful and well differentiatable mollusca mollusks and brachiopods to identify stratigraphic boundaries thus the calabrian was originally defined as an assemblage of mollusk fossils most brachiopods being extinct by then efforts were then made to find the best representation of that assemblage in a stratigraphic section by 1948 scientists used the initial appearance of cool water northern invertebrate faunas in mediterranean marine sediments as the beginning marker for the calabrian the 18th international geological congress in london 1948 placed the base of the pleistocene at the base of the marine strata of the calabrian faunal stage and denominated a type section in southern italy however it was discovered that the original type section was discontinuous at that point and that the base of the calabrian stage as defined by fauna assemblages

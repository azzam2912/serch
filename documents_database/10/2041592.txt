they were developed at the max planck institute for the structure and dynamics of matter in hamburg germany and at the university of toronto with the teams led by professor r j d miller the brightness of an electron beam is defined for any given point as the current per unit area normal to the given direction per unit solid angle mathematically this is defined using limits as the area and solid angle tend to 0 the general formula is formula 1 an ultrabright electron beam has been defined as having 10 a cm 2 with spatial coherence of 1 nm this level of energy in that small of a coherence is a large technical problem not only in the production of such a beam but also how to use the beam without destroying the sample in the process of characterization the singular problem of sample destruction was taken care of by studying reactions that are photo active and prepared in such a way that reduced potential barriers in non relativistic electrons the problems of achieving ultrabrightness was overcome by utilizing the natural chirp that occurs in electron shot bunches to capitalize on this chirp the developed gun was made

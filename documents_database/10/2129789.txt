it has been characterized as the most abundant diatom in the antarctic seas fragilariopsis kerguelensis is a unicellular phototrophic microalga with a range in size of 10 80 m it is encased in a heavily silicified cell wall called the frustule and is identified by its unique theca raphe and striations which distinguish it from other diatoms they are native to pelagic environments of the southern ocean within a temperature range of 1 to 18 c f kerguelensis is known to form community chains that consist of 20 100 cells and can be up to 300 m long fragilariopsis kerguelensis is well preserved in the fossil record and commonly referenced as a paleoceanographic or paleoclimatic proxy f kerguelensis comprises the largest deposit of biogenic silica in the world 75 despite only accounting for 20 of global production it is an open water species and is found in its highest abundance between the antarctic circumpolar current and the subtropical front this along with its tendency to increase valve size near polar fronts makes f kerguelensis an ideal indicator of paleoclimate polar front or low carbon high silica exporting regimes modern assemblages with f kerguelensis can be used to calculate past sea

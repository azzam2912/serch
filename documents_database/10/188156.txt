the bush is directly north and west of lion s park and less than one kilometre northwest of the confluence of the nith and the grand rivers consisting of a mix of both coniferous and deciduous trees common to the carolinian forests of southwestern ontario the bush itself is riddled with extensive bike and hiking trails which are used frequently especially so through the warmer months typically late spring through early fall the vast majority of barkers bush is located on private property however trespassing has generally been accepted and the public has used the trails extensively for many years historically the only public land entrance to the bush was through lion s park however this changed in 2002 when the local municipality built a steel footbridge from the east banks of the nith to the west banks located in the bush itself the skeletal remains of the river dam found at the southeastern edge of the bush are a relic from an era when shipping traffic was common on the nith

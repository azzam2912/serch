once this happens the sequence must continue periodically by repeating the same sequence of values from to cycle detection is the problem of finding and given and several algorithms for finding cycles quickly and with little memory are known robert w floyd s tortoise and hare algorithm moves two pointers at different speeds through the sequence of values until they both point to equal values alternatively brent s algorithm is based on the idea of exponential search both floyd s and brent s algorithms use only a constant number of memory cells and take a number of function evaluations that is proportional to the distance from the start of the sequence to the first repetition several other algorithms trade off larger amounts of memory for fewer function evaluations the applications of cycle detection include testing the quality of pseudorandom number generators and cryptographic hash functions computational number theory algorithms detection of infinite loops in computer programs and periodic configurations in cellular automata and the automated shape analysis of linked list data structures the figure shows a function that maps the set to itself if one starts from and repeatedly applies one sees the sequence of values the cycle in this

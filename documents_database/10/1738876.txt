either or both of these parts may become retracted the retracted segment of eardrum is often known as a retraction pocket the terms atelectasis or sometimes adhesive otitis media can be used to describe retraction of a large area of the pars tensa tympanic membrane retraction is fairly common and has been observed in one quarter of a population of british school children retraction of both eardrums is less common than having a retraction in just one ear it is more common in children with cleft palate tympanic membrane retraction also occurs in adults attempts have been made to categorise the extent of tympanic membrane retraction though the validity of these classifications is limited the majority of tympanic membrane retractions do not cause any symptoms some cause hearing loss by restricting sound induced vibrations of the eardrum permanent conductive hearing loss can be caused by erosion of the ossicles hearing bones discharge from the ear often indicates that the retraction pocket has developed into a cholesteatoma three factors must occur for the tympanic membrane to become retracted when gas pressure within the middle ear is less than atmospheric pressure the eardrum can become sucked into the middle ear space this

pcts thus contrast with explanatory clinical trials which focus more on causation through deconfounding the pragmatic versus explanatory distinction is a spectrum or continuum rather than a dichotomy each study can fall toward one end or the other but the distinction is nonetheless important to evidence based medicine ebm because physicians have found that treatment effects in explanatory clinical trials do not always translate to outcomes in typical practice decision makers including individual physicians deciding what to do next for a particular patient developers of clinical guidelines and health policy directors hope to build a better evidence base to inform decisions by encouraging more pcts to be conducted the distinction between pragmatic and explanatory trials is not the same as the distinction between randomized and nonrandomized trials any trial can be either randomized or nonrandomized and have any degree of pragmatic and explanatory power depending on its study design with randomization being preferable if practicably available however most randomized controlled trials rcts to date have leaned toward the explanatory side of the pragmatic explanatory spectrum largely because of the value traditionally placed on proving causation by deconfounding as part of proving efficacy but sometimes also because attempts to minimize cost

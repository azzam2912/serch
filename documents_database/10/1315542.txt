an earlier theorem proved independently by tits and weiss showed that a moufang polygon must be a generalized 3 gon 4 gon 6 gon or 8 gon so the purpose of the aforementioned book was to analyze these four cases a moufang 3 gon can be identified with the incidence graph of a moufang projective plane in this identification the points and lines of the plane correspond to the vertices of the building real forms of lie groups give rise to examples which are the three main types of moufang 3 gons there are four real division algebras the real numbers the complex numbers the quaternions and the octonions of dimensions 1 2 4 and 8 respectively the projective plane over such a division algebra then gives rise to a moufang 3 gon these projective planes correspond to the building attached to sl r sl c a real form of a and to a real form of e respectively in the first diagram the circled nodes represent 1 spaces and 2 spaces in a three dimensional vector space in the second diagram the circled nodes represent 1 space and 2 spaces in a 3 dimensional vector space over the quaternions

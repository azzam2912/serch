this periodinane has several advantages over chromium and dmso based oxidants that include milder conditions room temperature neutral ph shorter reaction times higher yields simplified workups high chemoselectivity tolerance of sensitive functional groups and a long shelf life however use on an industrial scale is made difficult by its cost and its potentially explosive nature it is named after the american chemists daniel benjamin dess and james cullen martin who developed the reagent in 1983 it is based on ibx but due to the acetate groups attached to the central iodine atom dmp is much more reactive than ibx and is much more soluble in organic solvents the most friendly synthesis of ibx has been determined to be treating 2 iodobenzoic acid with oxone in water at elevated temperatures for 3 hours ibx is then acylated using ireland and liu s the classic method presented by boeckman and mullins involved heating a solution of potassium bromate sulfuric acid 2 iodobenzoic acid to afford ibx 1 hydroxy 1 2 benziodoxol 3 1h one 1 oxide 2 iodoxybenzoic acid ibx was then acylated using acetic acid and acetic anhydride dess martin periodinane is mainly used as an oxidant for complex sensitive and

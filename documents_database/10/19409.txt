for example the set of numbers satisfying is an interval which contains and all numbers in between other examples of intervals are the set of real numbers formula 1 the set of negative real numbers and the empty set real intervals play an important role in the theory of integration because they are the simplest sets whose size or measure or length is easy to define the concept of measure can then be extended to more complicated sets of real numbers leading to the borel measure and eventually to the lebesgue measure intervals are central to interval arithmetic a general numerical computing technique that automatically provides guaranteed enclosures for arbitrary formulas even in the presence of uncertainties mathematical approximations and arithmetic roundoff intervals are likewise defined on an arbitrary totally ordered set such as integers or rational numbers the notation of integer intervals is considered in the special section below an open interval does not include its endpoints and is indicated with parentheses for example means greater than and less than a closed interval is an interval which includes all its limit points and is denoted with square brackets for example means greater than or equal to and less than

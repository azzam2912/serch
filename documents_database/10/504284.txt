it occurs naturally in the tars obtained by the distillation of resinous woods it crystallizes in large plates which melt at 98 5 c and boil at 390 c it is readily soluble in warm ether and in hot glacial acetic acid sodium and boiling amyl alcohol reduce it to a tetrahydroretene but if it heated with phosphorus and hydriodic acid to 260 c a dodecahydride is formed chromic acid oxidizes it to retene quinone phthalic acid and acetic acid it forms a picrate that melts at 123 124 c retene is derived by degradation of specific diterpenoids biologically produced by conifer trees the presence of traces of retene in the air is an indicator of forest fires it is a major product of pyrolysis of conifer trees it is also present in effluents from wood pulp and paper mills retene together with cadalene simonellite and ip ihmn is a biomarker of higher plants which makes it useful for paleobotanic analysis of rock sediments the ratio of retene cadalene in sediments can reveal the ratio of the genus pinaceae in the biosphere a recent study has shown retene which is a component of the amazonian organic pm10 is cytotoxic to

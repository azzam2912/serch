the name is an acronym for formulating on line calculations in algebraic language focal was very similar to joss in terms of the commands it supported and the general syntax of the language it differed in that many of joss advanced features like ranges and user defined functions were removed to simplify the parser some of the keywords were renamed so that they all started with a unique first letter this allowed users to type in programs using single character statements further reducing memory needs this was an important consideration on the pdp 8 which was often limited to a few kilobytes kb and focal was popular on dec machines for this reason like joss and later basics focal on the pdp 8 was a complete environment that included a line editor the interpreter itself and input output routines the package as a whole was referred to focal 8 which also ran on the pdp 5 and pdp 12 when ported to the pdp 11 the resulting focal 11 relied on the underlying operating system rt 11 to provide file support and editing the language definition itself was updated twice to focal 69 and a very slightly modified focal 71

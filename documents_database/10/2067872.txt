the basic example would be the three integers 0 1 and 1 together with the operation of multiplication multiplication of integers is associative and the product of any two of these three integers is again one of these three integers there are 18 inequivalent ways to define an associative operation on three elements while there are altogether a total of 3 19683 different binary operations that can be defined only 113 of these are associative and many of these are isomorphic or antiisomorphic so that there are essentially only 18 possibilities one of these is c the cyclic group with three elements the others all have a semigroup with two elements as subsemigroups in the example above the set 1 0 1 under multiplication contains both 0 1 and 1 1 as subsemigroups the latter is a sub group c six of these are bands meaning that all three elements are idempotent so that the product of any element with itself is itself again two of these bands are commutative therefore semilattices one of them is the three element totally ordered set and the other is a three element semilattice that is not a lattice the other four come in

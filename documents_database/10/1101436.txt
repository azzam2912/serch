this type of spiders is located in almost every area of the world argiotoxin can be classified according to the 1980s classification of spider venoms as a toxin of the acylpolyamines family which contains more than 100 different chemical structures of closely related toxins acylpolyamines are neurotoxic compounds that are found only in the venom glands of spiders at a picomolar level argiotoxins are classified into three different categories according to its chromophore s nature the argiopine type the argiopinine type and the pseudoargiopinine type it is a low molecular weight neurotoxin which has highly functional polar groups free phenolic oh and amine and guanidine residues it also possesses arginine free nh connected to a nh ch 3 nh c 3nh ch 5 nh one through a peptide bond polyamine the polyamine is connected to the asparagine s carboxyl group the amino group of this aminoacid is linked to 2 4 dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid its structure was established using spectroscopy 1h c rmn mass spectrometry and elemental aminoacid analysis a complete synthesis strategy of argiotoxin and derivatives was developed in order to make biological tests in different living beings a noted type of argiotoxin the arg 636 which molecular formula

nickel can be in different or even mixed oxidation states ranging from 1 2 3 to 4 the anions can contain a single nickel ion or multiple to form a cluster ion the solid mixed oxide compounds are often ceramics but can also be metallic they have a variety of electrical and magnetic properties rare earth elements form a range of perovskite nickelates in which the properties vary systematically as the rare earth element changes fine tuning of properties is achievable with mixtures of elements applying stress or pressure or varying the physical form inorganic chemists call many compounds that contain nickel centred anions nickelates these include the chloronickelates fluoronickelates tetrabromonickelates tetraiodonickelates cyanonickelates nitronickelates and other nickel organic acid complexes such as oxalatonickelates the lithium nickelates are of interest to researchers as cathodes in lithium cells as these substance can hold a variable amount of lithium with the nickel varying in oxidation state rare earth nickelates with nickel in a 1 oxidation state have an electronic configuration to same as for cuprates and so are of interest to high temperature superconductor researchers other rare earth nickelates can function as fuel cell catalysts the ability to switch between an insulating and

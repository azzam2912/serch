the events of the war are recorded by the historian polybius it is considered the greatest war in cretan history during antiquity the prelude to the conflict in crete was the commercial war between the cities of rhodes and byzantium about the toll introduced by the byzantines for all ships passing through the bosporus on their way to the pontus euxinus posing a huge threat to hellenistic trade the conflict was ended in 220 bc with a compromise meanwhile in crete the allied cities of cnossus and gortys had gained control of the whole island except for the spartan colony of lyttos which alone resisted when the rhodian navarch polemocles returned from the war against byzantium the cnossians thought that he could be helpful to their efforts against lyttos so they asked the rhodians for assistance and polemocles arrived with three decked and three undecked ships soon after his arrival however the people of eleutherna accused him of assassinating a citizen timarchus and in response they declared war on the rhodians meanwhile the cnossians and their allies had moved against lyttos but then for some unknown reason the alliance broke up and the cretans began to quarrel with each other

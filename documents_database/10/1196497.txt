r r tolkien created many languages for his elves which eventuated in the creation of a mythology expounded in his books complete with races to speak the languages he had constructed the language has quickly spread among modern day use resulting in quenya and sindarin to become legally stated languages his interest was primarily philological and he said his stories grew out of his languages the languages were the first thing tolkien created for his mythos starting with what he originally called qenya the first primitive form of elvish this was later called quenya high elven and is one of the two most complete of tolkien s languages the other being sindarin or grey elven the phonology and grammar of quenya are strongly influenced by finnish latin greek and elements of ancient germanic languages and sindarin is strongly influenced by welsh tolkien conceived a family tree of elvish languages all descending from a common ancestor called primitive quendian he worked extensively on how the languages diverged from primitive quendian over time in phonology and grammar in imitation of the development of real language families in addition to quenya and sindarin he sketched several other elvish languages in far less detail

for this reason in a finite dimensional vector space it is equivalent to define eigenvalues and eigenvectors using either the language of matrices or the language of linear transformations geometrically an eigenvector corresponding to a real nonzero eigenvalue points in a direction in which it is stretched by the transformation and the eigenvalue is the factor by which it is stretched if the eigenvalue is negative the direction is reversed loosely speaking in a multidimensional vector space the eigenvector is not rotated however in a one dimensional vector space the concept of rotation is meaningless if is a linear transformation from a vector space over a field into itself and is a vector in that is not the zero vector then is an eigenvector of if is a scalar multiple of this condition can be written as the equation where is a scalar in the field known as the eigenvalue characteristic value or characteristic root associated with the eigenvector if the vector space is finite dimensional then the linear transformation can be represented as a square matrix a and the vector by a column vector rendering the above mapping as a matrix multiplication on the left hand side and a

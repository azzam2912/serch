geological survey modular finite difference flow model which is a computer code that solves the groundwater flow equation the program is used by hydrogeologists to simulate the flow of groundwater through aquifers the source code is free public domain software written primarily in fortran and can compile and run on microsoft windows or unix like operating systems since its original development in the early 1980s the usgs has made four major releases and is now considered to be the de facto standard code for aquifer simulation there are several actively developed commercial and non commercial graphical user interfaces for modflow modflow was constructed in what was in 1980 s called a modular design this means it has many of the attributes of what came to be called object oriented programming for example capabilities called packages that simulate subsidence or lakes or streams can easily be turned on and off and the execution time and storage requirements of those packages go away entirely if a programmer wants to change something in modflow the clean organization makes it easy indeed this kind of innovation is exactly what was anticipated when modflow was designed importantly the modularity of modflow makes it possible for

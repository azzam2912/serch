baker et al showed that bphi a member of this family from burkholderia xenovorans lb400 was able to utilize 4 hydroxy 2 oxohexanoate hoha with equal catalytic efficiency as 4 hydroxy 2 oxopentanoate producing propionaldehyde pyruvate furthermore the enzyme was also able to catalyze the cleavage of 4 hydroxy 2 oxoheptanoate hohep forming butyraldehyde pyruvate baker et al we also able to show that acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde are not released into the bulk solvent but are channeled to an associated acetaldehyde dehydrogenase known as bphj this is the first demonstration of substrate channeling in this family of enzymes this enzyme belongs to the family of lyases specifically the oxo acid lyases which cleave carbon carbon bonds the systematic name of this enzyme class is 4 hydroxy 2 oxopentanoate pyruvate lyase acetaldehyde forming other names in common use include 4 hydroxy 2 ketovalerate aldolase hoa dmpg bphi 4 hydroxy 2 oxovalerate pyruvate lyase and 4 hydroxy 2 oxopentanoate pyruvate lyase this enzyme participates in 8 metabolic pathways phenylalanine metabolism benzoate degradation via hydroxylation biphenyl degradation toluene and xylene degradation 1 4 dichlorobenzene degradation fluorene degradation carbazole degradation and styrene degradation

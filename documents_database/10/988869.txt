the client and server use different address spaces so parameters used in a function procedure call have to be converted otherwise the values of those parameters could not be used because pointers to parameters in one computer s memory would point to different data on the other computer the client and server may also use different data representations even for simple parameters e g big endian versus little endian for integers stubs perform the conversion of the parameters so a remote procedure call looks like a local function call for the remote computer stub libraries must be installed on both the client and server side a client stub is responsible for conversion marshalling of parameters used in a function call and deconversion of results passed from the server after execution of the function a server skeleton the stub on the server side is responsible for deconversion of parameters passed by the client and conversion of the results after the execution of the function stubs can be generated in one of two ways a server program that implements a procedure in an interface is said to export the interface and a client program that calls procedures from an interface is said

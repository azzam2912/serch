it is a member of the actinide and transuranium element series it is named after the city of berkeley california the location of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory then the university of california radiation laboratory where it was discovered in december 1949 berkelium was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium plutonium curium and americium the major isotope of berkelium bk is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high flux nuclear reactors mainly at the oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee usa and at the research institute of atomic reactors in dimitrovgrad russia the production of the second most important isotope bk involves the irradiation of the rare isotope cm with high energy alpha particles just over one gram of berkelium has been produced in the united states since 1967 there is no practical application of berkelium outside scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides a 22 milligram batch of berkelium 249 was prepared during a 250 day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at oak ridge in 2009 this sample was used to synthesize the new element tennessine for the first time in 2009 at the joint

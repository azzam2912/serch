a star trail photograph shows individual stars as streaks across the image with longer exposures yielding longer arcs typical shutter speeds for a star trail range from 15 minutes to several hours requiring a bulb setting on the camera to open the shutter for a period longer than usual however a more practised technique is to blend a number of frames together to create the final star trail image star trails have been used by professional astronomers to measure the quality of observing locations for major telescopes star trail photographs are captured by placing a camera on a tripod pointing the lens toward the night sky and allowing the shutter to stay open for a long period of time star trails are considered relatively easy for amateur astrophotographers to create photographers generally make these images by using an slr camera with its lens focus set to infinity a cable release allows the photographer to hold the shutter open for the desired amount of time typical exposure times range from 15 minutes to many hours long depending on the desired length of the star trail arcs for the image even though star trail pictures are created under low light conditions long

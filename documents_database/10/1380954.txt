the desired effect of this method is to generate hybrid polymers that bear the properties of both polymer chains such as a high melting point accompanied by high elasticity it is a relatively new method the first instance of its use being reported by arriola et al in may 2006 olefin polymers such as polypropylene and polyethylene have seen widespread use in the plastics industry in the past 50 years a way to enhance the properties of these olefin polymers was first discovered by the scientists karl ziegler and giulio natta ziegler discovered the original titanium based catalyst essential for olefin polymerization while natta used the catalyst to alter and control the stereochemistry tacticity of the olefin polymers hence ziegler natta catalyst by controlling the tacticity of the polymer a chain can for example either be semi crystalline or amorphous rigid or elastic heat resistant or have a low glass transition temperature much research since has been dedicated to predicting and creating polymers based on this work living polymerization is the term coined to describe the use of specially made catalysts often involving transition metal centers in olefin polymerization since the polymer chains self propagate in the presence of the

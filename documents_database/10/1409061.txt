instead of integrating over spheres one integrates over generalized spheres for a homogeneous space x g h a generalized sphere centered at a point x is an orbit of the isotropy group of x the model case for orbital integrals is a riemannian symmetric space g k where g is a lie group and k is a symmetric compact subgroup generalized spheres are then actual geodesic spheres and the spherical averaging operator is defined as where orbital integrals of suitable functions can also be defined on homogeneous spaces g k where the subgroup k is no longer assumed to be compact but instead is assumed to be only unimodular lorentzian symmetric spaces are of this kind the orbital integrals in this case are also obtained by integrating over a k orbit in g k with respect to the haar measure of k thus is the orbital integral centered at x over the orbit through y as above g is a group element that represents the coset x a central problem of integral geometry is to reconstruct a function from knowledge of its orbital integrals the funk transform and radon transform are two special cases when g k is a riemannian

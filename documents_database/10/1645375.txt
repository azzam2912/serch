this model is not as time consuming to solve as the rigid body system and uses a force system axial spin and an estimate of the yaw of repose the principal aim of this agreement is to standardize the exterior ballistic trajectory simulation methodology for nato naval and army forces the modified point mass model will be used for spin stabilized projectiles and the five degrees of freedom model will be used for fin stabilized rockets this facilitates the exchange of exterior ballistic data and fire control information the custodian of this stanag is integrated capability group indirect fires sub group 2 within the nato army armaments group naag the most recent promulgated copy is edition 3 dated 17 april 2009 implementation of the stanag is often accomplished by adoption of components of the sg2 shareable fire control software suite s4 for a description of how stanag 4355 relates to other stanags in the areas of ballistics and meteorology please see the following preview also shown in slide 4 of the following presentation

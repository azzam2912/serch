using s and i one can construct a new semigroup by collapsing i into a single element while the elements of s outside of i retain their identity the new semigroup obtained in this way is called the rees factor semigroup of s modulo i and is denoted by s i the concept of rees factor semigroup was introduced by david rees in 1940 a subset formula 1 of a semigroup formula 2 is called an ideal of formula 2 if both formula 4 and formula 5 are subsets of formula 1 let formula 1 be an ideal of a semigroup formula 2 the relation formula 9 in formula 2 defined by is an equivalence relation in formula 2 the equivalence classes under formula 9 are the singleton sets formula 13 with formula 14 not in formula 1 and the set formula 1 since formula 1 is an ideal of formula 2 the relation formula 9 is a congruence on formula 2 the quotient semigroup formula 21 is by definition the rees factor semigroup of formula 2 modulo formula 1 for notational convenience the semigroup formula 24 is also denoted as formula 25 the rees factor semigroup has underlying set

it is composed of several thermocouples connected usually in series or less commonly in parallel such a device works on the principle of the thermoelectric effect i e generating a voltage when its dissimilar metals thermocouples are exposed to a temperature difference thermocouples operate by measuring the temperature differential from their junction point to the point in which the thermocouple output voltage is measured once a closed circuit is made up of more than one metal and there is a difference in temperature between junctions and points of transition from one metal to another a current is produced as if generated by a difference of potential between the hot and cold junction thermocouples can be connected in series as thermocouple pairs with a junction located on either side of a thermal resistance layer the output from the thermocouple pair will be a voltage that is directly proportional to the temperature difference across the thermal resistance layer and also to the heat flux through the thermal resistance layer adding more thermocouple pairs in series increases the magnitude of the voltage output thermopiles can be constructed with a single thermocouple pair composed of two thermocouple junctions or multiple thermocouple pairs thermopiles do

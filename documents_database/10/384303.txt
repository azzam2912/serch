halo nuclei form at the extreme edges of the table of nuclides the neutron drip line and proton drip line and have short half lives measured in milliseconds these nuclei are studied shortly after their formation in an ion beam typically an atomic nucleus is a tightly bound group of protons and neutrons however in some nuclides there is an overabundance of one species of nucleon in some of these cases a nuclear core and a halo will form often this property may be detected in scattering experiments which show the nucleus to be much larger than the otherwise expected value normally the cross section corresponding to the classical radius of the nucleus is proportional to the cube root of its mass as would be the case for a sphere of constant density specifically for a nucleus of mass number a the radius r is approximately where formula 2 is 1 2 fm one example of a halo nucleus is li which has a half life of 8 6 ms it contains a core of 3 protons and 6 neutrons and a halo of two independent and loosely bound neutrons it decays into be by the emission of an antineutrino

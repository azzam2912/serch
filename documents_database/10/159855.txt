the householder transformation was introduced in 1958 by alston scott householder its analogue over general inner product spaces is the householder operator the reflection hyperplane can be defined by a unit vector formula 1 a vector with length formula 2 which is orthogonal to the hyperplane the reflection of a point formula 3 about this hyperplane is the linear transformation where formula 1 is given as a column unit vector with hermitian transpose formula 6 the matrix constructed from this transformation can be expressed in terms of an outer product as is known as the householder matrix where formula 8 is the identity matrix the householder matrix has the following properties in geometric optics specular reflection can be expressed in terms of the householder matrix specular reflection vector formulation householder transformations are widely used in numerical linear algebra to perform qr decompositions and is the first step of the qr algorithm they are also widely used for tridiagonalization of symmetric matrices and for transforming non symmetric matrices to a hessenberg form householder reflections can be used to calculate qr decompositions by reflecting first one column of a matrix onto a multiple of a standard basis vector calculating the transformation matrix

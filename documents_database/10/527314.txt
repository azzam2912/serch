that is it is left adjoint to the forgetful functor the free lie algebra on a set x is naturally graded the 0 graded component of the free lie algebra is just the free vector space on that set one can alternatively define a free lie algebra on a vector space v as left adjoint to the forgetful functor from lie algebras over a field k to vector spaces over the field k forgetting the lie algebra structure but remembering the vector space structure the universal enveloping algebra of a free lie algebra on a set x is the free associative algebra generated by x by the poincar birkhoff witt theorem it is the same size as the symmetric algebra of the free lie algebra meaning that if both sides are graded by giving elements of x degree 1 then they are isomorphic as graded vector spaces this can be used to describe the dimension of the piece of the free lie algebra of any given degree witt showed that the number of basic commutators of degree k in the free lie algebra on an m element set is given by the necklace polynomial where formula 7 is the m

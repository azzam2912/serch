by the end of the war only a pilot production of five units had been completed unlike earlier self propelled anti aircraft guns it had a fully enclosed rotating turret the need for a specialised self propelled anti aircraft gun capable of keeping up with the armoured divisions had become increasingly urgent for the german armed forces as from 1943 on the german air force was less and less able to protect itself against enemy fighter bombers therefore a multitude of improvised and specially designed self propelled anti aircraft guns were built many on the panzer iv chassis starting with the flakpanzer iv m belwagen and progressing through the wirbelwind and ostwind models however these designs were tall open topped stopgap designs with no protection for the crew these flaws were to be eliminated in the kugelblitz the final development of the flakpanzer iv the first proposal for the kugelblitz envisioned mounting a modified anti aircraft turret developed for u boats on the panzer iv chassis which was armed with dual 30 mm mk 303 brunn guns a configuration known as doppelflak dual flak this was however abandoned as impractical as development of this gun had not yet been completed

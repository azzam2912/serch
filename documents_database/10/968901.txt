one enzyme that utilizes this reaction is phosphofructokinase pfk which catalyses the phosphorylation of fructose 6 phosphate to fructose 1 6 bisphosphate a key regulatory step in the glycolytic pathway it is allosterically inhibited by atp and allosterically activated by amp thus indicating the cell s energetic needs when it undergoes the glycolytic pathway pfk exists as a homotetramer in bacteria and mammals where each monomer possesses 2 similar domains and as an octomer in yeast where there are 4 alpha pfk1 and 4 beta chains pfk2 the latter like the mammalian monomers possessing 2 similar domains this protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation pfk is about 300 amino acids in length and structural studies of the bacterial enzyme have shown it comprises two similar alpha beta lobes one involved in atp binding and the other housing both the substrate binding site and the allosteric site a regulatory binding site distinct from the active site but that affects enzyme activity the identical tetramer subunits adopt 2 different conformations in a closed state the bound magnesium ion bridges the phosphoryl groups of the enzyme products adp and fructose 1 6 bisphosphate and in an open state the magnesium

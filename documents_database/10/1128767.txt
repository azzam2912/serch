all class iia bacteriocins are produced by food associated strains isolated from a variety of food products of industrial and natural origins including meat products dairy products and vegetables class iia bacteriocins are all cationic display anti listeria activity and kill target cells by permeabilizing the cell membrane class iia bacteriocins contain between 37 and 48 residues based on their primary structures the peptide chains of class iia bacteriocins may be divided roughly into two regions a hydrophilic cationic and highly conserved n terminal region and a less conserved hydrophobic amphiphilic c terminal region the n terminal region contains the conserved y g n g v l pediocin box motif and two conserved cysteine residues joined by a disulfide bridge it forms a three stranded antiparallel beta sheet supported by the conserved disulfide bridge this cationic n terminal beta sheet domain mediates binding of the class iia bacteriocin to the target cell membrane the c terminal region forms a hairpin like domain that penetrates into the hydrophobic part of the target cell membrane thereby mediating leakage through the membrane the two domains are joined by a hinge which enables movement of the domains relative to each other some proteins known

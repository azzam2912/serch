2009 to help understand the origins of many diseases and the links between them hidalgo et al 2009 defined diseases as specific sets of phenotypes that affect one or several physiological systems and compiled data on pairwise comorbidity correlations for more than 10 000 diseases reconstructed from over 30 million medical records hidalgo et al 2009 presented their data in the form of a network with diseases as the nodes and comorbidity correlations as the links intuitively the phenotypic disease network pdn can be seen as a map of the phenotypic space whose structure can contribute to the understanding of disease progression during the last decade several papers were published that aim at understanding the origins and interrelatedness of diseases using the analytical tools of network science interactions between disease associated genes proteins and gene expressions have been explored however phenotypic information was essentially overlooked despite the fact that there exist extensive high quality data on it in the form of clinical histories until the seminal paper of hidalgo et al 2009 introducing the human phenotypic disease network hidalgo et al 2009 used medicare hospital claims based on the medpar records on hospitalizations for the period 1990 1993 for the

they are frequently cytotoxic i e they kill cells as they create unregulated pores in the membrane of targeted cells pfts can be divided into two categories depending on the alpha helical or beta barrel architecture of their transmembrane channel that can consist either of other categories according to tcdb there are following families of pore forming toxins pfts are so named because of their structural characteristics they are composed mostly of strand based domains they have divergent sequences and are classified by pfam into a number of families including leukocidins etx mtx2 toxin 10 and aegerolysin x ray crystallographic structures have revealed some commonalities hemolysin and panton valentine leukocidin s are structurally related similarly aerolysin and clostridial epsilon toxin and mtx2 are linked in the etx mtx2 family the pfts include a number of toxins of commercial interest for the control of pest insects these toxins are potent but also highly specific to a limited range of target insects making them safe biological control agents insecticidal members of the etx mtx2 family include mtx2 and mtx3 from lysinibacillus sphaericus that can control mosquito vectors of human diseases and also cry15 cry23 cry33 cry38 cry45 cry51 cry60 cry64 and cry74

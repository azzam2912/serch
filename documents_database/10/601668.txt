the table shows the number of such ways of rolling a given value formula 1 crazy dice is a mathematical exercise in elementary combinatorics involving a re labeling of the faces of a pair of six sided dice to reproduce the same frequency of sums as the standard labeling the sicherman dice are crazy dice that are re labeled with only positive integers if the integers need not be positive to get the same probability distribution the number on each face of one die can be decreased by k and that of the other die increased by k for any natural number k giving infinite solutions the table below lists all possible totals of dice rolls with standard dice and sicherman dice one sicherman die is coloured for clarity 1 2 2 3 3 4 and the other is all black 1 3 4 5 6 8 the sicherman dice were discovered by george sicherman of buffalo new york and were originally reported by martin gardner in a 1978 article in scientific american the numbers can be arranged so that all pairs of numbers on opposing sides sum to equal numbers 5 for the first and 9 for the second

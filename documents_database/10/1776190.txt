it is the average short term correlation if the signals have multiple components slow and fast scaled coefficient of correlation can be computed only for the fast components of the signals ignoring the contributions of the slow components this filtering like operation has the advantages of not having to make assumptions about the sinusoidal nature of the signals for example in the studies of brain signals researchers are often interested in the high frequency components beta and gamma range 25 80 hz and may not be interested in lower frequency ranges alpha theta etc in that case scaled correlation can be computed only for frequencies higher than 25 hz by choosing the scale of the analysis s to correspond to the period of that frequency e g s 40 ms for 25 hz oscillation scaled correlation between two signals is defined as the average correlation computed across short segments of those signals first it is necessary to determine the number of segments formula 1 that can fit into the total length of the signals formula 2 for a given scale formula 3 next if formula 5 is pearson s coefficient of correlation for segment formula 6 the scaled correlation across

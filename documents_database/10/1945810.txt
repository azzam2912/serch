it is commonly found in indoor environments and soil isolated cases of human infection resulting from a ustus have been described however the majority of these are nail infections colonies of a ustus appear dull brown sometimes with a purplish to grey brown or dark brown with a yellow to brown reverse side colonies are flat to furrowed often with a cental bump microscopically the fungus is characterized by elongated conidial heads with bent h lle cells scattered throughout the pigmented mycelium the conidia are rough walled and spherical ranging in color from green to yellow brown the vesicles range from 7 15 m in diameter and are hemispherical to almost round although a ustus is able to grow at human body temperature other species in this group such as a baeticus and a pseudoustus require relatively low temperature for growth and thus are unlikely to cause human infection despite that a ustus has long been recognized as a common soil associated fungus knowledge of its biochemistry remained poor until recently one of the first metabolites to be isolated and characterized from this fungus ustic acid cho reacts with iron iii chloride to form a deep purple colored compound ustic

it involves the development and application of mathematical statistical and data analytical methods for modelling and simulation of biological structures the field is broadly defined and includes foundations in anatomy applied mathematics and pure mathematics machine learning computational mechanics computational science biological imaging neuroscience physics probability and statistics it also has strong connections with fluid mechanics and geometric mechanics additionally it complements newer interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics and neuroinformatics in the sense that its interpretation uses metadata derived from the original sensor imaging modalities of which magnetic resonance imaging is one example it focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged rather than the medical imaging devices it is similar in spirit to the history of computational linguistics a discipline that focuses on the linguistic structures rather than the sensor acting as the transmission and communication medium s in computational anatomy the diffeomorphism group is used to study different coordinate systems via coordinate transformations as generated via the lagrangian and eulerian velocities of flow in formula 1 the flows between coordinates in computational anatomy are constrained to be geodesic flows satisfying the principle of least action for the kinetic energy of the flow the kinetic energy is defined through a sobolev

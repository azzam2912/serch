quarks interact with each other by the strong force due to their color charge mediated by gluons gluons themselves possess color charge and can mutually interact the gluon field strength tensor is a rank 2 tensor field on the spacetime with values in the adjoint bundle of the chromodynamical su 3 gauge group see vector bundle for necessary definitions throughout latin indices typically take values 1 2 8 for the eight gluon color charges while greek indices typically take values 0 for timelike components and 1 2 3 for spacelike components of four vectors and four dimensional spacetime tensors throughout all equations the summation convention is used on all color and tensor indices unless explicitly stated there is no sum to be taken below the definitions and most of the notation follow k yagi t hatsuda y miake and greiner sch fer the tensor is denoted or or some variant and has components defined proportional to the commutator of the quark covariant derivative where in which different authors choose different signs expanding the commutator gives substituting formula 7 and using the commutation relation formula 8 for the gell mann matrices with a relabeling of indices in which are the structure

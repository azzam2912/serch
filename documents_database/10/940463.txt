it is only observed in reptiles and teleost fish tsd differs from the chromosomal sex determination systems common among vertebrates it is the most popular and most studied type of environmental sex determination esd some other conditions e g density ph and environmental background color are also observed to alter sex ratio which could be classified either as temperature dependent sex determination or temperature dependent sex differentiation depending on the involved mechanisms as sex determining mechanisms tsd and genetic sex determination gsd should be considered in an equivalent manner which can lead to reconsidering the status of fish species that are claimed to have tsd when submitted to extreme temperatures instead of the temperature experienced during development in the wild since changes in sex ratio with temperature variation are ecologically and evolutionally relevant while tsd has been observed in many reptile and fish species the genetic differences between sexes and molecular mechanisms of tsd have not been disclosed the cortisol mediated pathway and epigenetic regulatory pathway are thought to be the potential mechanisms involved in tsd the eggs are affected by the temperature at which they are incubated during the middle one third of embryonic development this critical period of

the type has been produced in side valve ioe overhead valve sleeve valve and overhead cam configurations a straight eight can be timed for inherent primary and secondary balance with no unbalanced primary or secondary forces or moments however crankshaft torsional vibration present to some degree in all engines is sufficient to require the use of a harmonic damper at the accessory end of the crankshaft without such damping fatigue cracking near the rear main bearing journal may occur leading to engine failure although an inline six cylinder engine can also be timed for inherent primary and secondary balance a straight eight develops more power strokes per revolution and as a result will run more smoothly under load than an inline six also due to the even number of power strokes per revolution a straight eight does not produce unpleasant odd order harmonic vibration in the vehicle s driveline at low engine speeds the smooth running characteristics of the straight eight made it popular in luxury and racing cars of the past however the engine s length demanded the use of a long engine compartment making the basic design unacceptable in modern vehicles also due to the length of the

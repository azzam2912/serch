the principal difference when compared to using ordinary microprocessors is the ability to make substantial changes to the datapath itself in addition to the control flow on the other hand the main difference from custom hardware i e application specific integrated circuits asics is the possibility to adapt the hardware during runtime by loading a new circuit on the reconfigurable fabric the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s when gerald estrin s paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of reconfigurable hardware the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware the latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task such as image processing or pattern matching as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware once the task was done the hardware could be adjusted to do some other task this resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware in the 1980s and 1990s there was a renaissance in this area of research with many proposed reconfigurable architectures developed in industry and academia such as copacobana matrix garp elixent ngen polyp meregen pact xpp silicon hive montium

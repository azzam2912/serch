it is the first member of the family of organosulfur oxoacids which also include sulfinic acids and sulfonic acids rsoh and rsoh respectively the base member of the sulfenic acid series with r h is hydrogen thioperoxide in contrast to sulfinic and sulfonic acids simple sulfenic acids such as methanesulfenic acid chsoh are highly reactive and cannot be isolated in solution in the gas phase the lifetime of methanesulfenic acid is about one minute the gas phase structure of methanesulfenic acid was found by microwave spectroscopy rotational spectroscopy to be ch s o h sulfenic acids can be stabilized through steric effects which prevent the sulfenic acid from condensing with itself to form thiosulfinates rs o sr such as allicin from garlic through the use of x ray crystallography the structure of such stabilized sulfenic acids were shown to be r s o h the stable sterically hindered sulfenic acid 1 triptycenesulfenic acid has been found to have a p k of 12 5 and an o h bond dissociation energy bde of 71 9 0 3 kcal mol which can be compared to a p k of 14 and o h bde of 88 kcal mol for the valence

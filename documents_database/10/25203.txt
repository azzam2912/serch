it is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code an example is an adapter that converts the interface of a document object model of an xml document into a tree structure that can be displayed the adapter design pattern is one of the twenty three well known gof design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object oriented software that is objects that are easier to implement change test and reuse the adapter design pattern solves problems like often an already existing class can t be reused only because its interface doesn t conform to the interface clients require the adapter design pattern describes how to solve such problems the key idea in this pattern is to work through a separate codice 1 that adapts the interface of an already existing class without changing it clients don t know whether they work with a codice 3 class directly or through an codice 1 with a class that does not have the codice 3 interface see also the uml class diagram below an adapter allows two incompatible interfaces to work together this is the real world definition

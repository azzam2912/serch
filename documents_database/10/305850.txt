the group psl 2 c of 2 by 2 complex matrices of determinant 1 modulo its center has several natural representations as conformal transformations of the riemann sphere and as orientation preserving isometries of 3 dimensional hyperbolic space h and as orientation preserving conformal maps of the open unit ball b in r to itself therefore a kleinian group can be regarded as a discrete subgroup acting on one of these spaces the theory of general kleinian groups was founded by and who named them after felix klein the special case of schottky groups had been studied a few years earlier in 1877 by schottky by considering the ball s boundary a kleinian group can also be defined as a subgroup of pgl 2 c the complex projective linear group which acts by m bius transformations on the riemann sphere classically a kleinian group was required to act properly discontinuously on a non empty open subset of the riemann sphere but modern usage allows any discrete subgroup when is isomorphic to the fundamental group formula 1 of a hyperbolic 3 manifold then the quotient space h becomes a kleinian model of the manifold many authors use the terms kleinian model

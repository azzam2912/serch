the dpms clients do so through dpms services provided by a previously loaded dpms server the necessary size of the remaining stub depends on the type of driver but often can be reduced downto a few hundred bytes for just the header even for complex drivers by executing the driver in extended memory and freeing up conventional memory dpms not only allows very large drivers to load and take advantage of the available memory but also to leave more memory available for normal dos drivers to load or non extended dos applications to execute within the space constraints of the conventional memory area this will also help increase the amount of free system resources under windows providing unified interfaces for the software to allocate and use memory in protected mode without having to tunnel all requests through real mode dos dpms at the same time can help improve system performance as well dpms was originally developed by novell s digital research gmbh germany in 1992 it is compatible with any dos and can coexist with memory managers and dos extenders such as dpmi vcpi etc the dpms api is reentrant and compatible with multitaskers such as the dr dos multitasker

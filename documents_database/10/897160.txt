this information allows a symbolic debugger to gain access to information from the source code of the binary such as the names of identifiers including variables and routines the symbolic information may be compiled together with the module s binary file or distributed in a separate file or simply discarded during the compilation and or linking this information can be helpful while trying to investigate and fix a crashing application or any other fault debug symbols typically include not only the name of a function or global variable but also the name of the source code file in which the symbol occurs as well as the line number at which it is defined other information includes the type of the symbol integer float function exception etc the scope block scope or global scope the size and for classes the name of the class and the methods and members in it all of this additional information can take up quite a bit of space especially the filenames and line numbers thus binaries with debug symbols can become quite large often several times the stripped file size to avoid this extra size most operating system distributions ship binaries that are stripped i

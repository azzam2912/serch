it is based on measurement of the product of the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium k into argon ar potassium is a common element found in many materials such as micas clay minerals tephra and evaporites in these materials the decay product is able to escape the liquid molten rock but starts to accumulate when the rock solidifies recrystallizes the amount of argon sublimation that occurs is a function of the purity of the sample the composition of the mother material and a number of other factors these factors introduce error limits on the upper and lower bounds of dating so that final determination of age is reliant on the environmental factors during formation melting and exposure to decreased pressure and or open air time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of accumulated to the amount of remaining the long half life of allows the method to be used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years the quickly cooled lavas that make nearly ideal samples for k ar dating also preserve a record of the direction and intensity of the local magnetic field as the sample cooled

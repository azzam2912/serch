that is a functional differential equation is an equation that contains some function and some of its derivatives to different argument values functional differential equations find use in mathematical models that assume a specified behavior or phenomenon depends on the present as well as the past state of a system in other words past events explicitly influence future results for this reason functional differential equations are used to in many applications rather than ordinary differential equations ode in which future behavior only implicitly depends on the past unlike ordinary differential equations which contain a function of one variable and its derivatives evaluated with the same input functional differential equations contain a function and its derivatives evaluated with different input values the simplest type of functional differential equation called the retarded functional differential equation or retarded differential difference equation is of the form where formula 5 are constants formula 6 is some continuous function and formula 7 is a scalar below is a table with a comparison of several ordinary and functional differential equations functional differential equation is the general name for a number of more specific types of differential equations that are used in numerous applications there are delay differential

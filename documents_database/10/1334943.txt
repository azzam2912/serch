the next morning melissa goes about her day but as time passes slowly becomes aware that those around her have changed since the meteorites fell it s as if their minds are no longer their own for example melissa s supervisor samantha seduces her into a passionate lesbian encounter even though samantha had never shown any signs of being a lesbian melissa soon realizes that the townsfolk have been replaced by a race of aliens known as pod people the aliens grow in large seed pods and gradually take the form of a particular person eventually taking over their bodies once the growth process is complete the pod people try to take control of melissa but she flees the town to warn humanity of the invasion in progress stefan birgir stefansson of sbs is heavily criticized the film writing that it looks like it was made by a film student who thinks he s the real deal even though he can t crasp sic how light or sound really works an idiotic remake that puts everyone involved to shame and perhaps a place in hell and yes pod people lesbians dread central wrote a mixed review as they felt it

the flammable mixture of fuel and air is ignited by a sparkplug and the gases expand as a result of the combustion process the gases are forced into a turbine which drives a compressor the exhaust gas of a jet engine contains approx 17 oxygen in a second stage combustion chamber more fuel is injected and ignited as a result of this process all oxygen is consumed and what remains is an inert gas this process takes place in a 7 meter long combustion tube which is cooled by water the heated water is injected at the end of the cooling tube and consequently the water is turned into water vapor and steam as a result the steamexfire produces up to 25 cubic meters of inert steam and water vapor per second the fore runner of the steamexfire is called the gag unit the steamexfire has been deployed to fight underground mine fires at the goedehoop mine fire in south africa and at the svea nord mine fire on spitsbergen island

the essential difference between the two approaches is the choice of the auxiliary system having the same density formula 1 as the real physical one in kohn sham dft this system is composed by non interacting electrons for which the kinetic energy can be calculated exactly and the interaction term has to be approximated in sce dft instead the starting point is totally the opposite one the auxiliary system has infinite electronic correlation and zero kinetic energy to understand how the sce system is constructed it is useful to first think in terms of a simple example consider a collection of formula 2 identical classical charges with repulsive coulomb interaction confined in some container with a given shape if let alone the charges will distribute themselves within the container until they reach the spatial configuration that minimizes their interaction energy in equilibrium their kinetic energy is zero of course the equilibrium position of the charges will depend on the shape of the container suppose now that in this classical system one of the formula 2 charges which we can label as number 1 is pinned at some arbitrary position formula 4 inside the container clearly the equilibrium position of the

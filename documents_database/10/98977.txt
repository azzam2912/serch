they devised several other algorithms they published the book pi and the agm a study in analytic number theory and computational complexity these two are examples of a ramanujan sato series the related chudnovsky algorithm uses a discriminant with class number 1 start by setting then each additional term of the partial sum yields approximately 25 digits start by setting then each additional term of the series yields approximately 50 digits start by setting then iterate then p converges quadratically to that is each iteration approximately doubles the number of correct digits the algorithm is not self correcting each iteration must be performed with the desired number of correct digits for s final result start by setting then iterate then a converges cubically to 1 that is each iteration approximately triples the number of correct digits start by setting then iterate then a converges quartically against 1 that is each iteration approximately quadruples the number of correct digits the algorithm is not self correcting each iteration must be performed with the desired number of correct digits for s final result one iteration of this algorithm is equivalent to two iterations of the gauss legendre algorithm a proof of these algorithms

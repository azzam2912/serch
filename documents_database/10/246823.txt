this orange red water soluble cerium salt is a specialised oxidizing agent in organic synthesis and a standard oxidant in quantitative analysis the anion is generated by dissolving in hot concentrated hno the salt consists of the anion and a pair of nh counter ions the ammonium ions are not involved in the oxidising reactions of this salt in the anion each nitrate group is chelated to the cerium atom in a bidentate manner as shown below the anion has t idealized o molecular symmetry the ceo core defines an icosahedron ce is a strong one electron oxidizing agent in terms of its redox potential e 1 61 v vs n h e it is even stronger oxidizing agent than cl e 1 36 v few shelf stable reagents are stronger oxidants in the redox process ce iv is converted to ce iii a one electron change signaled by the fading of the solution color from orange to a pale yellow providing that the substrate and product are not strongly colored in organic synthesis can is useful as an oxidant for many functional groups alcohols phenols and ethers as well as c h bonds especially those that are benzylic alkenes

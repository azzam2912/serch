the 555 can be used to provide time delays as an oscillator and as a flip flop element derivatives provide two 556 or four 558 timing circuits in one package introduced in 1972 by signetics the 555 is still in widespread use due to its low price ease of use and stability it is now made by many companies in the original bipolar and in low power cmos technologies it was estimated that 1 billion units were manufactured every year the 555 is the most popular integrated circuit ever manufactured the ic was designed in 1971 by hans r camenzind under contract to signetics later acquired by philips semiconductors now nxp in 1962 camenzind joined pr mallory s laboratory for physical science in burlington massachusetts he designed a pulse width modulation pwm amplifier for audio applications however it was not successful in the market because there was no power transistor included he became interested in tuners such as a gyrator and a phase locked loop pll he was hired by signetics to develop a pll ic in 1968 he designed an oscillator for plls such that the frequency did not depend on the power supply voltage or temperature signetics subsequently

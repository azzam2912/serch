it can be considered as the conjuncture of mechanical engineering and biological engineering it spans from cells to organs covering diverse aspects of the functionality of systemic physiology including cardiovascular respiratory reproductive urinary musculoskeletal and neurological systems etc biofluid dynamics and its simulations in computational fluid dynamics cfd apply to both internal as well as external flows internal flows such as cardiovascular blood flow and respiratory airflow and external flows such as flying and aquatic locomotion i e swimming biological fluid dynamics or biofluid dynamics involves the study of the motion of biological fluids e g blood flow in arteries animal flight fish swimming etc it can be either circulatory system or respiratory systems understanding the circulatory system is one of the major areas of research the respiratory system is very closely linked to the circulatory system and is very complex to study and understand the study of biofluid dynamics is also directed towards finding solutions to some of the human body related diseases and disorders the usefulness of the subject can also be understood by seeing the use of biofluid dynamics in the areas of physiology in order to explain how living things work and about their motions in

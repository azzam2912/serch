the degeneracy of a graph is the smallest value of k for which it is k degenerate the degeneracy of a graph is a measure of how sparse it is and is within a constant factor of other sparsity measures such as the arboricity of a graph degeneracy is also known as the k core number width and linkage and is essentially the same as the coloring number or szekeres wilf number named after k degenerate graphs have also been called k inductive graphs the degeneracy of a graph may be computed in linear time by an algorithm that repeatedly removes minimum degree vertices the connected components that are left after all vertices of degree less than k have been removed are called the k cores of the graph and the degeneracy of a graph is the largest value k such that it has a k core every finite forest has either an isolated vertex incident to no edges or a leaf vertex incident to exactly one edge therefore trees and forests are 1 degenerate graphs every 1 degenerate graph is a forest every finite planar graph has a vertex of degree five or less therefore every planar graph is

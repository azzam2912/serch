natriuretic peptides anp bnp and cnp are a family of hormone paracrine factors that are structurally related the main function of anp is causing a reduction in expanded extracellular fluid ecf volume by increasing renal sodium excretion anp is synthesized and secreted by cardiac muscle cells in the walls of the atria in the heart these cells contain volume receptors which respond to increased stretching of the atrial wall due to increased atrial blood volume reduction of blood volume by anp can result in secondary effects such as reduction of extracellular fluid ecf volume edema improved cardiac ejection fraction with resultant improved organ perfusion decreased blood pressure and increased serum potassium these effects may be blunted or negated by various counter regulatory mechanisms operating concurrently on each of these secondary effects brain natriuretic peptide bnp a misnomer it is secreted by cardiac muscle cells in the heart ventricles is similar to anp in its effect it acts via the same receptors as anp does but with 10 fold lower affinity than anp the biological half life of bnp however is twice as long as that of anp and that of nt probnp is even longer making these peptides better choices

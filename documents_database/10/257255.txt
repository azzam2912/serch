in the general case one can consider instead formula 6 which is called a muirhead mean an n n matrix p is doubly stochastic precisely if both p and its transpose p are stochastic matrices a stochastic matrix is a square matrix of nonnegative real entries in which the sum of the entries in each column is 1 thus a doubly stochastic matrix is a square matrix of nonnegative real entries in which the sum of the entries in each row and the sum of the entries in each column is 1 muirhead s inequality states that a b for all x such that x 0 for every i 1 n if and only if there is some doubly stochastic matrix p for which a pb furthermore in that case we have a b if and only if a b or all x are equal the latter condition can be expressed in several equivalent ways one of them is given below the proof makes use of the fact that every doubly stochastic matrix is a weighted average of permutation matrices birkhoff von neumann theorem because of the symmetry of the sum no generality is lost by sorting the exponents into

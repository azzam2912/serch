such maps have been in use since the mid 19th century and are used for research and weather forecasting purposes maps using isotherms show temperature gradients which can help locate weather fronts isotach maps analyzing lines of equal wind speed on a constant pressure surface of 300 or 250 hpa show where the jet stream is located use of constant pressure charts at the 700 and 500 hpa level can indicate tropical cyclone motion two dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds at various levels show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern a popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure cloud codes are translated into symbols and plotted on these maps along with other meteorological data that are included in synoptic reports sent by professionally trained observers the use of weather charts in a modern sense began in the middle portion of the 19th century in order to devise a theory on storm systems during the crimean war a storm devastated the french fleet at balaklava and the french

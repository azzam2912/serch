its binding affinity ki value to tspo is comparable with pk11195 gml 1 is selective for tspo versus the central benzodiazepine receptor cbr gabaa receptor the compound gml 1 was the most active of a series of 1 arylpyrrolo 1 2 a pyrazine 3 carboxamides and its anxiolytic effects were examined using the open field test oft and the elevated plus maze epm test the epm test is a general anxiety test measuring the time spent by animals in the open or the enclosed arms when compound was administered to cd 1 mice at the dose of 1 0 mg kg it significantly increased the percentage of open arm entries and the time spent in the open arms gml 1 is a potential antianxiety agent the tspo mechanism of anxiolytic action of gml 1 was proved by inhibitor analysis with tspo antagonist pk11195 that blocks effect of gml 1 the involvement of neurosteroids in the mechanism of action of gml 1 was confirmed by co administration of gml 1 with neurosteroid synthesis inhibitors the anxiolytic effect of gml 1 in elevated plus maze tests was completely blocked by the neurosteroidogenic enzyme inhibitors trilostane and finasteride the tablet dosage form of

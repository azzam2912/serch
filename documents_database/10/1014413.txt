other members of the janus family include jak1 jak2 and tyk2 janus kinases jaks are relatively large kinases of approximately 1150 amino acids with apparent molecular weights of 120 130 kda they are cytosolic tyrosine kinases that are specifically associated with cytokine receptors since cytokine receptor proteins lack enzymatic activity they are dependent upon jaks to initiate signaling upon binding of their ligands e g cytokines the cytokine receptors can be divided into five major subgroups based on their different domains and activation motifs jak3 is required for signaling of the type i receptors that use the common gamma chain c as jak3 is expressed in hematopoietic and epithelial cells its role in cytokine signaling is thought to be more restricted than other jaks it is most commonly expressed in t cells and nk cells but has also been found in intestinal epithelial cells jak3 is involved in signal transduction by receptors that employ the common gamma chain c of the type i cytokine receptor family e g il 2r il 4r il 7r il 9r il 15r and il 21r mutations that abrogate janus kinase 3 function cause an autosomal scid severe combined immunodeficiency disease while activating janus kinase

each bud has the potential to form shoots and may be specialized in producing either vegetative shoots stems and branches or reproductive shoots flowers once formed a bud may remain dormant for some time or it may form a shoot immediately an axillary bud is an embryonic or organogenic shoot which lies dormant at the junction of the stem and petiole of a plant it arises exogenously from outer layer of cortex of the stem axillary buds do not become actively growing shoots on plants with strong apical dominance the tendency to grow just the terminal bud on the main stem apical dominance occurs because the shoot apical meristem produces auxin which prevents axillary buds from growing the axillary buds begin developing when they are exposed to less auxin for example if the plant naturally has weak apical dominance if apical dominance is broken by removing the terminal bud or if the terminal bud has grown far enough away for the auxin to have less of an effect axillary buds can be used to differentiate if the plant is single leafed or multi leafed simply count the number of leaves after an axillary bud if there is only one leaf

the energy of the photon is smaller than that of the biexciton by the biexciton binding energy so the biexciton luminescence peak appears on the low energy side of the exciton peak the biexciton binding energy in semiconductor quantum dots has been the subject of extensive theoretical study because a biexciton is a composite of two electrons and two holes we must solve a four body problem under spatially restricted conditions the biexciton binding energies for cucl quantum dots as measured by the site selective luminescence method increased with decreasing quantum dot size the data were well fitted by the function where formula 12 is biexciton binding energy formula 13 is the radius of the quantum dots formula 14 is the binding energy of bulk crystal and formula 15 and formula 16 are fitting parameters in the effective mass approximation the hamiltonian of the system consisting of two electrons 1 2 and two holes a b is given by where formula 18 and formula 19 are the effective masses of electrons and holes respectively and where formula 21 denotes the coulomb interaction between the charged particles formula 22 and formula 23 formula 24 denote the two electrons and two holes

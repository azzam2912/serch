the impedance of a loudspeaker varies with frequency this means that if different sine wave tones are fed into the loudspeaker at the same voltage or the same current the amount of electric power consumed will vary by convention loudspeakers are designed to generate the same sound pressure level spl at the listener for the same voltage at varying frequencies regardless of the variation in electric power this permits a loudspeaker to be used with an amplifier having a low internal impedance and a flat frequency response is realized for the combined amplifier loudspeaker system however an amplifier with a low internal impedance delivers more electrical output power when the load impedance reduces until the impedances become approximately matched such high power levels could cause damage to either the amplifier or the amplifier s power supply or the circuit connected to the amplifier s output including the loudspeaker therefore an additional convention exists whereby loudspeaker manufacturers specify a conservative estimate of the average impedance that the loudspeaker will present while playing typical music this is called the nominal impedance amplifiers can therefore be safely specified to operate into a load that has this nominal impedance or higher but not lower

some geologists use the term plutonic rock synonymously with intrusive rock but other geologists subdivide intrusive rock by crystal size into coarse grained plutonic rock typically formed deeper in the earth s crust in batholiths and other plutons and medium grained subvolcanic or hypabyssal rock typically formed higher in the crust in dikes and sills intrusive rock forms within earth s crust from the crystallization of magma many mountain ranges such as the sierra nevada in california are formed mostly from large granite or related rock intrusions see sierra nevada batholith intrusions are one of the two ways igneous rock can form the other is extrusive rock that is a volcanic eruption or similar event technically speaking an intrusion is any formation of intrusive igneous rock rock formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of the planet in contrast an extrusion consists of extrusive rock rock formed above the surface of the crust large bodies of magma that solidify underground before they reach the surface of the crust are called plutons plutonic rocks form 7 of the earth s current land surface coarse grained intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the earth are called abyssal

as such they are used for various purposes in science engineering and art for example in a popular home experiment a glass rod is made almost invisible by immersing it in an index matched transparent fluid such as mineral spirits in light microscopy oil immersion is a technique used to increase the resolution of a microscope this is achieved by immersing both the objective lens and the specimen in a transparent oil of high refractive index thereby increasing the numerical aperture of the objective lens immersion oils are transparent oils that have specific optical and viscosity characteristics necessary for use in microscopy typical oils used have an index of refraction around 1 515 an oil immersion objective is an objective lens specially designed to be used in this way the index of the oil is typically chosen to match the index of the microscope lens glass and of the cover slip for more details see the main article oil immersion some microscopes also use other index matching materials besides oil see water immersion objective and solid immersion lens in fiber optics and telecommunications an index matching material may be used in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical

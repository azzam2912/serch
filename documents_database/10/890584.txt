removal of repression is called derepression this mechanism may occur at different stages in the expression of a gene with the result of increasing the overall rna or protein products dysregulation of derepression mechanisms can result in altered gene expression patterns which may lead to negative phenotypic consequences such as disease transcription can be repressed in a variety of ways and therefore can be derepressed in different ways as well a common mechanism is allosteric regulation this is when a substrate binds a repressor protein and causes it to undergo a conformational change if the repressor is bound upstream of a gene such as in an operator sequence then it would be repressing the gene s expression this conformational change would take away the repressor s ability to bind dna thus removing its repressive effect on transcription another form of transcriptional derepression uses chromatin remodeling complexes for transcription to occur rna polymerase needs to have access to the promoter sequence of the gene or it cannot bind the dna sometimes these sequences are wrapped around nucleosomes or are in condensed heterochromatin regions and are therefore inaccessible through different chromatin remodeling mechanisms these promoter sequences can become accessible to the rna

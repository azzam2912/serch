different configurations of scanning interferometer may be used to measure macroscopic objects with surface profiles measuring in the centimeter range to microscopic objects with surface profiles measuring in the micrometer range for large scale non interferometric measurement systems see structured light 3d scanner vertical scanning interferometry is an example of low coherence interferometry which exploits the low coherence of white light interference will only be achieved when the path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence time of the light source vsi monitors the fringe contrast rather than the shape of the fringes fig 2 illustrates a twyman green interferometer set up for white light scanning of a macroscopic object light from the test specimen is mixed with light reflected from the reference mirror to form an interference pattern fringes appear in the ccd image only where the optical path lengths differ by less than half the coherence length of the light source which is generally on the order of micrometers the interference signal correlogram is recorded and analyzed as either the specimen or reference mirror is scanned the focus position of any particular point on the surface of the specimen corresponds to the point of maximum

high velocity entry into martian air creates a co n plasma as opposed to o n for earth air mars entry is affected by the radiative effects of hot co gas and martian dust suspended in the air flight regimes for entry descent and landing systems include aerocapture hypersonic supersonic and subsonic thermal protection systems and atmospheric friction have been used historically to reduce most of the kinetic energy that needs to be lost prior to landing with parachutes and sometimes a final bit of retropropulsion used in the final landing high altitude high velocity retropropulsion is being researched for future transport flights landing heavier cargos for example mars pathfinder entered in 1997 about 30 minutes prior to entry the cruise stage and entry capsule separated when the capsule hit the atmosphere it de accelerated from about 7 3 km s to 0 4 km s 16330 mph to 900 mph over three minutes as it descended the parachute opened to slow it down further and soon after the heat shield was released during entry a signal was relayed back to earth including semaphore signals for important events some examples of spacecraft that have attempted to land on the surface

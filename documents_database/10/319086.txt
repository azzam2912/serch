departure of such a variable from its setpoint is one basis for error controlled regulation using negative feedback for automatic control the set point is usually abbreviated to sp and the process value is usually abbreviated to pv cruise control the sp pv error can be used to return a system to its norm an everyday example is the cruise control on a road vehicle where external influences such as gradients cause speed changes pv and the driver also alters the desired set speed sp the automatic control algorithm restores the actual speed to the desired speed in the optimum way without delay or overshoot by altering the power output of the vehicle s engine in this way the sp pv error is used to control the pv so that it equals the sp a widespread use of sp pv error control is the pid controller industrial applications special consideration must be given for engineering applications in industrial systems physical or process restraints may limit the determined set point for example a reactor which operates more efficiently at higher temperatures may be rated to withstand 500 c however for safety reasons the set point for the reactor temperature control loop

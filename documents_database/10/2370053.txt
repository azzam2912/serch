ecsit is a cytosolic adaptor protein involved in inflammatory responses embryonic development and the assembly and stabilization of mitochondrial nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex i ecsit is located on the p arm of chromosome 19 in position 13 2 and has 9 exons the ecsit gene produces a 49 kda protein composed of 431 amino acids ecsit s interactions with p65 p50 nf b proteins is dependent on lysine 372 ubiquitination ecsit also contains an n terminal targeting signal that causes it to localize to mitochondria where only the 45 kda mitochondrial ecsit is found to interact ecsit has been found to play multiple roles in cell signaling including those that utilize toll like receptors tlrs tgf and bmp ecsit plays a regulatory role as part of the tak1 ecsit traf6 complex that is involved in the activation of nf b by the tlr4 signal and through its interactions with trim59 to negatively regulate nf b irf 3 and irf 7 mediated signal pathways additionally ecsit appears to contribute to bactericidal activity in tlr signaling through its interaction with tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 traf6 importantly ubiquitination of ecsit has shown itself to be necessary for the activation of

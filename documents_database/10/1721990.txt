they are the result of circadian rhythms cycling into a phase of wakefulness for example many people experience the effects of a second wind in the early morning even after an entire night without sleep because it is the time when they would normally wake up while most winds coincide with the 24 hour cycle those experiencing extended sleep deprivation over multiple days have been known to experience a fifth day turning point the second wind phenomenon may have evolved as a survival mechanism as part of the fight or flight response allowing sleep deprived individuals briefly to function at a higher level than they would without sleep deprivation one study presented a series of tasks of increasing difficulty to 16 young adults who had not slept in 35 hours and observed heightened activity in several brain regions using magnetic resonance imaging researcher sean p a drummond commented that the ability to summon a second wind allowed them to call on cognitive resources they have that they normally don t need to use to do a certain task he also noted that their performance though an improvement considering their state of sleep deprivation were below what it would be had

the technology s defining characteristics are its extremely high limit of detection sensitivity and dynamic range sofia s sensitivity is measured at the attogram level 10 g making it about one billion times more sensitive than conventional diagnostic techniques based on its enhanced dynamic range sofia is able to discriminate levels of analyte in a sample over 10 orders of magnitude facilitating accurate titering as a diagnostic platform sofia has a broad range of applications several studies have already demonstrated sofia s unprecedented ability to detect naturally occurring prions in the blood and urine of disease carriers this is expected to lead to the first reliable ante mortem screening test for vcjd bse scrapie cwd and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies given the technology s extreme sensitivity additional unique applications are anticipated including in vitro tests for other neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer s and parkinson s disease sofia was developed as a result of a joint collaborative research project between los alamos national laboratory and state university of new york and was supported by the department of defense s national prion research program the conventional method of performing laser induced fluorescence as well as other types of spectroscopic measurements such

for a given number of unknowns the number of solutions to a system of linear equations depends only on the rank of the matrix representing the system and the rank of the corresponding augmented matrix specifically according to the rouch capelli theorem any system of linear equations is inconsistent has no solutions if the rank of the augmented matrix is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix if on the other hand the ranks of these two matrices are equal the system must have at least one solution the solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables otherwise the general solution has k free parameters where k is the difference between the number of variables and the rank hence in such a case there are an infinitude of solutions an augmented matrix may also be used to find the inverse of a matrix by combining it with the identity matrix let c be the square 2 2 matrix to find the inverse of c we create c i where i is the 2 2 identity matrix we then reduce the part of c i corresponding to c to the identity matrix using only

it is generally located 4 8 km below the ocean floor and the major lithologies are mafic ultramafic and gabbroic rocks which derive from melts rising from the earth s mantle this part of the oceanic crust is an important zone for processes such as melt accumulation and melt modification fractional crystallisation and crustal assimilation and the recycling of this part of the oceanic crust together with the upper mantle has been suggested as a significant source component for tholeiitic magmas in hawaiian volcanoes although the lower oceanic crust builds the link between the mantle and the morb and can t be neglected for the understanding of morb evolution the complex processes operating in this zone remain unclear and there is an ongoing debate in earth sciences about this the lower oceanic crust connects the earth s mantle with the morb where around 60 of the total magma production of the earth happens the three main processes happening in this region of the oceanic crust are partial melting of the earth s mantle melt accumulation at various depths and the chemical modification of this melts during ascent this three processes do not happen in a strict order but occur all

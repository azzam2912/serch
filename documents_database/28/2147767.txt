this year 6 possibly 7 asteroids traveled nearer than this most notably which approached a mere 1 25 earth radii 8000 km from the surface while most asteroids on this list are confirmed well observed unconfirmed objects with a 50 or greater chance of passing within 1 ld of the earth are included as well this list does not include any of the 32 objects that collided with earth in 2016 none of which were discovered in advance but were recorded by sensors designed to detect detonation of nuclear devices of the 32 objects detected 4 had an impact energy greater than that of a 1 kiloton device the number of asteroids listed here are significantly less than those of asteroids that approach earth for several reasons asteroids that approach earth not only move faster but are brighter and are easier to detect with modern surveys because these factors severely limit the amount of moon approaching asteroids to a level many times lower than the asteroids detected passing as close to earth an example list of near earth asteroids that passed more than 1 lunar distance 384 400 km or 0 00256 au from earth in 2016 xf38fac satellite 2015

the canal lies between the prinsengracht and the lijnbaansgracht the jordaan between the outer canal and the town wall was part of a major urban development at the start of the 17th century the canals and streets were not laid out on a new plan but were enlargements of the existing polder ditches and pathways in the jordaan many canals and streets are named after flowers this canal is named for an eglantine rose rosa rubiginosa during construction of the canal belt a pattern was followed that curved around the old city center in a semicircle as a result the egelantiersgracht is slanted in relation to the canal belt and does not connect directly to the bridges over the prinsengracht the houses in this neighborhood were partly built for artisans and skilled tradespeople the houses are built on a smaller scale than the great mansions on herengracht keizersgracht and prinsengracht for this reason they are in great demand as residences there has been some new development but the egelantiersgracht has kept much of its original character six of the eleven jordaan canals were filled in in the 19th century the egelantiersgracht bloemgracht lauriergracht looiersgracht and passeerdersgracht maintained open water connections

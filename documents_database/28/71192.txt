many are extremophiles living in places long imagined inhospitable to life they are of particular interest to astrobiologists who theorize that endolithic environments on mars and other planets constitute potential refugia for extraterrestrial microbial communities the term endolith which defines an organism that colonizes the interior of any kind of rock has been further classified into three subclasses endoliths have been found in rock down to a depth of though it is unknown if that is their limit due to the cost involved in digging so deep the main threat to their survival seems not to result from the pressure at such depth but from the increased temperature judging from hyperthermophile organisms the temperature limit is at about 120 c strain 121 can reproduce at 121 c which limits the possible depth to 4 4 5 km below the continental crust and 7 or 7 5 km below the ocean floor endolithic organisms have also been found in surface rocks in regions of low humidity hypolith and low temperature psychrophile including the dry valleys and permafrost of antarctica the alps and the rocky mountains endoliths can survive by feeding on traces of iron potassium or sulfur as well as some

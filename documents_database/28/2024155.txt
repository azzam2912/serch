its available for ios and android the gameplay is very similar to tetris except players are able to cut out their own tetromino shapes from the wall and let them drop to clear rows the game has a metacritic score of 86 based on 8 critic reviews slidetoplay said regardless of the mode dream of pixels is a fresh and fun take on the tried and true falling blocks game appadvice said if you re in the mood for a fantastic falling blocks puzzle game then i highly recommend you drop everything that you re doing right now and buy dream of pixels in fact if you can only get one game this week make it this one you won t regret it toucharcade wrote the only potential flaws or suggestions i have for dream of pixels would be to allow players to switch out their tetromino or see upcoming tetrominoes for tactical strategies maybe it s not necessary but seeing multiple pieces only in the puzzle mode s hud made me miss them when they weren t in the others 148apps wrote it s amazing how fresh a classic puzzle game can feel with a little change in perspective

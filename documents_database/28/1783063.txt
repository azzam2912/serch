rise in blood glucose spike after an oral intake of glucose the peak of this spike being high enough to cause transient symptom free glycosuria i e detectable glucose in urine but this hyperglycemia reverses rapidly and may even go to hypoglycemia in the later phase this sharp downstroke overshooting towards hypoglycemia distinguishes this pathologic phenomenon from the artificial hyperglycemia inducible by an intravenous bolus dose of a large amount of glucose solution early dumping syndrome patients usually have oxyhyperglycemia associated with any meal or ogtt the greek root oxy means sharp or pointy the ogtt curve in this condition appears sharp and somewhat pointy at least relative to the other forms of hyperglycemia hence this name dorlands dictionary defines oxyhyperglycemia as a blood level of approximately 180 mg dl is the renal glucose threshold below which all glucose is reabsorbed from glomerular filtrate but at blood concentrations above the renal threshold sugar starts appearing in the urine oxyhyperglycemia like other forms of impaired glucose tolerance has also been suggested to be a prediabetic condition oxyhyperglycemia is most commonly caused by early dumping syndrome but it can rarely caused by other conditions like graves disease it was first described by

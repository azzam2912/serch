for a long time it was believed that cecusi is a singlet d wave superconductor but since the mid 2010s this notion has been strongly contested in the early eighties many more unconventional heavy fermion superconductors were discovered including ube upt and urusi in each of these materials the anisotropic nature of the pairing is implicated by the power law dependence of the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr relaxation rate and specific heat capacity on temperature the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap of upt was confirmed in 1986 from the polarization dependence of the ultrasound attenuation the first unconventional triplet superconductor organic material tmtsf pf was discovered by denis jerome and klaus bechgaard in 1979 recent experimental works by paul chaikin s and michael naughton s groups as well as theoretical analysis of their data by andrei lebed have firmly confirmed unconventional nature of superconducting pairing in tmtsf x x pf clo etc organic materials high temperature singlet d wave superconductivity was discovered by j g bednorz and k a m ller in 1986 who discovered that the lanthanum based cuprate perovskite material labacuo develops superconductivity at a critical temperature t of approximately 35 k 238 degrees celsius this

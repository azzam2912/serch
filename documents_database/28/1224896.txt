some examples are the evolution of herbivory vast changes in plate tectonic rates or orbital motion or different evolutionary mechanisms in force hox genes regulate the operation of other genes by switching them on or off in various parts of the body for example make an eye here or make a leg there very similar hox genes are found in all animals from cnidaria e g jellyfish to humans although mammals have four sets of hox genes while cnidaria have only one hox genes in different animal groups are so similar that for example one can transplant a human make an eye pax6 gene into a fruitfly embryo and it still causes an eye to form but it is a fruitfly eye because the genes that the transplanted hox gene activates are fruitfly genes the fact that all animals have such similar hox genes strongly suggests that the last common ancestor of all bilaterians had similar hox genes this led to speculation that the evolution of hox genes may have paved the way for the development of complex body forms this is where molecular dating can be useful a rough estimate of the age of a lineage and indeed genes

one defines the width of the surface in a given direction to be the perpendicular distance between the parallels perpendicular to that direction thus a surface of constant width is the three dimensional analogue of a curve of constant width a two dimensional shape with a constant distance between pairs of parallel tangent lines more generally any compact convex body d has one pair of parallel supporting planes in a given direction a supporting plane is a plane that intersects the boundary of d but not the interior of d one defines the width of the body as before if the width of d is the same in all directions then one says that the body is of constant width and calls its boundary a surface of constant width and the body itself is referred to as a spheroform a sphere a surface of constant radius and thus diameter is a surface of constant width contrary to common belief the reuleaux tetrahedron is not a surface of constant width however there are two different ways of smoothing subsets of the edges of the reuleaux tetrahedron to form meissner tetrahedra surfaces of constant width these shapes were conjectured by to have

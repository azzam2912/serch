like its relatives in the family weigeltisauridae members of this genus possessed long rod like ossifications along the edge of the body these bony rods were not extensions of the ribs but were instead newly developed bones derived from the skin of the animal a feature which is unique to the genus and its close relatives it is believed that during life these structures were covered with skin forming wing like surfaces which coelurosauravus could use for gliding coelurosauravus was originally known from a single species c elivensis which was named in 1926 based on fossils from the sakamena formation of madagascar many other genera of weigeltisaurids have been lumped into coelurosauravus since its original discovery most notable of these was weigeltisaurus jaekeli originally described from germany in 1930 this european species is now known from numerous specimens found in germany and one in england of which some were very well preserved in 1987 weigeltisaurus jaekeli was synonymized with coelurosauravus as a second species coelurosauravus jaekeli however a 2015 study reinstated weigeltisaurus as a separate genus for coelurosauravus jaekeli coelurosauravus specimens had an average length of the body was long and flat suitable for gliding the skull was lizard like

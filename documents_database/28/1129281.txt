it is encoded by the gene rhoc it is prenylated at its c terminus and localizes to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane it is thought to be important in cell locomotion it cycles between inactive gdp bound and active gtp bound states and function as molecular switches in signal transduction cascades rho proteins promote reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and regulate cell shape and motility rhoc can activate formins such as mdia1 and fmnl2 to remodel the cytoskeleton overexpression of rhoc is associated with cell proliferation and causing tumors to become malignant it causes degradation and reconstruction of the extracellular matrix ecm which helps cells escape the tissue they are currently in it enhances cell motility giving it the ability to become invasive it has been found to have a direct relationship to advanced tumor stage and metastasis with increases in stage being related to increases in rhoc expression rhoc deficient mice can still develop tumors but these fail to metastasize arguing that rhoc is essential for metastasis it has also been found to enhance the creation of angiogenic factors such as vegf which is necessary for a tumor to become malignant in a study by vega rhoc was knocked

the poly 3 hydroxybutyrate p3hb form of phb is probably the most common type of polyhydroxyalkanoate but other polymers of this class are produced by a variety of organisms these include poly 4 hydroxybutyrate p4hb polyhydroxyvalerate phv polyhydroxyhexanoate phh polyhydroxyoctanoate pho and their copolymers phb is produced by microorganisms such as cupriavidus necator methylobacterium rhodesianum or bacillus megaterium apparently in response to conditions of physiological stress mainly conditions in which nutrients are limited the polymer is primarily a product of carbon assimilation from glucose or starch and is employed by microorganisms as a form of energy storage molecule to be metabolized when other common energy sources are not available microbial biosynthesis of phb starts with the condensation of two molecules of acetyl coa to give acetoacetyl coa which is subsequently reduced to hydroxybutyryl coa this latter compound is then used as a monomer to polymerize phb phas granules are then recovered by disrupting the cells most commercial plastics are synthetic polymers derived from petrochemicals they tend to resist biodegradation phb derived plastics are attractive because they are compostable and derived from renewables and are bio degradable ici had developed the material to pilot plant stage in the 1980s but interest

this may be done varying direction on one or several axes cutter head speed and pressure milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines on scales from small individual parts to large heavy duty gang milling operations it is one of the most commonly used processes for machining custom parts to precise tolerances milling can be done with a wide range of machine tools the original class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine often called a mill after the advent of computer numerical control cnc in the 1960s milling machines evolved into machining centers milling machines augmented by automatic tool changers tool magazines or carousels cnc capability coolant systems and enclosures milling centers are generally classified as vertical machining centers vmcs or horizontal machining centers hmcs the integration of milling into turning environments and vice versa began with live tooling for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning operations this led to a new class of machine tools multitasking machines mtms which are purpose built to facilitate milling and turning within the same work envelope milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a

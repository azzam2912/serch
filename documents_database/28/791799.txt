the term ferroin is used loosely and includes salts of other anions such as chloride this coordination compound is used as an indicator in analytical chemistry the active ingredient is the fe o phen ion which is a chromophore that can be oxidized to the ferric derivative fe o phen the potential for this redox change is 1 06 volts in 1 m hso it is a popular redox indicator for visualizing oscillatory belousov zhabotinsky reactions ferroin is suitable as a redox indicator as the color change is reversible very pronounced and rapid and the ferroin solution is stable up to 60 c it is the main indicator used in cerimetry nitroferroin the complex of iron ii with 5 nitro 1 10 phenanthroline has transition potential of 1 25 volts it is more stable than ferroin but in sulfuric acid with ce ion it requires significant excess of the titrant it is however useful for titration in perchloric acid or nitric acid solution where cerium redox potential is higher the redox potential of the iron phenanthroline complex can be varied between 0 84 v and 1 10 v by adjusting the position and number of methyl groups on the phenanthroline

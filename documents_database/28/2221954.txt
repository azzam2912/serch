it is a relatively rare example of religious poetry in the englyn form in the assessment of jenny rowland the narrator persona displays very human foibles including the attempt to deny them this naturalism makes it tempting to view the poem as a personal lyric but it is undoubtedly misleading the slightly bumbling overly sincere narrator of kintaw geir has a shrewd observer of human nature behind him the incredible impression of spontaneity also conceals art and very tight organization the poem opens with the pilgrim preparing himself for his journey and seeking god s protection perhaps alluding to other journey prayers like the old english journey charm however his preparations are disturbed by a sneeze which seems clearly to have been viewed as a bad omen in stanzas 4 7 he contemplates the journey to rome before him and in 8 10 prepares his horse however he continues to worry about bad omens revealing his inner anxiety the poem closes in 11 13 with the narrator successfully focusing his thoughts on the religious purpose of his journey with an appropriate escalation in the elaborateness of the verse closing with a prayer of intercession as edited and translated by jenny

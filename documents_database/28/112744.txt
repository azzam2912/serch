but even if it were the case that no infinities arose in loop diagrams in quantum field theory it could be shown that renormalization of mass and fields appearing in the original lagrangian is necessary for example an electron theory may begin by postulating an electron with an initial mass and charge in quantum field theory a cloud of virtual particles such as photons positrons and others surrounds and interacts with the initial electron accounting for the interactions of the surrounding particles e g collisions at different energies shows that the electron system behaves as if it had a different mass and charge than initially postulated renormalization in this example mathematically replaces the initially postulated mass and charge of an electron with the experimentally observed mass and charge mathematics and experiments prove that positrons and more massive particles like protons exhibit precisely the same observed charge as the electron even in the presence of much stronger interactions and more intense clouds of virtual particles renormalization specifies relationships between parameters in the theory when parameters describing large distance scales differ from parameters describing small distance scales in high energy particle accelerators like the cern large hadron collider the concept named pileup

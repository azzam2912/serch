the source supernova was a star 20 times more massive than the sun which exploded around 8 000 years ago the remnants have since expanded to cover an area of the sky roughly 3 degrees in diameter about 6 times the diameter or 36 times the area of the full moon the distance to the nebula is not precisely known but far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer fuse data supports a distance of about 1 470 light years the hubble space telescope captured several images of the nebula the analysis of the emissions from the nebula indicate the presence of oxygen sulfur and hydrogen the cygnus loop is also a strong emitter of radio waves and x rays on 24 september 2015 new images and videos of the veil nebula were released with an explanation of the images in modern usage the names veil nebula cirrus nebula and filamentary nebula generally refer to all the visible structure of the remnant or even to the entire loop itself the structure is so large that several ngc numbers were assigned to various arcs of the nebula there are three main visual components ngc 6974 and ngc 6979 are luminous knots in a fainter patch

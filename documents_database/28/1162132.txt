for the technological aims of integrating a global network to act effectively as a single instrument and maximizing the scientific return by applying the newest developments in e science robonet adopted the intelligent agent architecture devised and maintained by the estar project with the flexible scheduling and short response time of robotic telescopes being ideal for time domain astronomy robonet 1 0 had two major science goals that critically depend on these requirements the determination of origin and nature of gamma ray bursts and the detection of cool extra solar planets by means of gravitational microlensing apart from their science use the telescopes forming the robonet 1 0 have also been made available for two educational programmes the faulkes telescope project and the national schools observatory the robonet microlensing programme led by the university of st andrews engages in a common campaign with the planet collaboration since 2005 with the official end of robonet 1 0 in october 2007 and the earlier acquisition of the two faulkes telescopes by las cumbres observatory global telescope network the microlensing programme is carried on as robonet ii starting in 2008 robonet ii has been using the expert system for microlensing anomaly detection that

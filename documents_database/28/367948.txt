in the case of cen x 3 the pulse period is decreasing over a timescale of 3 4 10 years defined as formula 1 where formula 2 is the rotation period and formula 3 is the rate of change in the rotation period ever since the detection of the first millisecond pulsar msp it has been theorized that msps are neutron stars that have been spun up by accretion in a close binary system the change in rotational period of the neutron star comes from the transition region between the magnetosphere and the plasma flow from the companion star in this context the magnetosphere is defined as the region of space surrounding the neutron star in which the magnetic field determines the motion of the plasma inside the magnetic field the plasma will eventually co rotate with the neutron star while in the transition region angular momentum from the accretion disk will be transferred via the magnetic field to the neutron star leading to the spin up stellar spin down

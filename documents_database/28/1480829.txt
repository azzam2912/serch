reducing the rotational speed of the rotor reduces the drag enabling the aircraft to go faster and or fly more economically rotors of conventional helicopters are designed to operate at a fixed rpm within just a few percent causing suboptimal operation in large parts of the flight envelope two main issues restrict the speed of rotorcraft these and other problems limit the practical speed of helicopters to around at the extreme the theoretical top speed for a rotary winged aircraft is about just above the current official speed record for a conventional helicopter held by a westland lynx which flew at in 1986 where its blade tips were nearly mach 1 for rotorcraft advance ratio or mu symbol formula 1 is defined as the aircraft forward speed v divided by its relative blade tip speed upper mu limit is a critical design factor for rotorcraft and the optimum for traditional helicopters is around 0 4 the relative blade tip speed u is the tip speed relative to the aircraft not the airspeed of the tip thus the formula for advance ratio is formula 2 where omega is the rotor s angular velocity and r is the rotor radius about the

it is also known as the g del solution or g del universe this solution has many unusual properties in particular the existence of closed timelike curves that would allow time travel in a universe described by the solution its definition is somewhat artificial in that the value of the cosmological constant must be carefully chosen to match the density of the dust grains but this spacetime is an important pedagogical example the solution was found in 1949 by kurt g del like any other lorentzian spacetime the g del solution presents the metric tensor in terms of some local coordinate chart it may be easiest to understand the g del universe using the cylindrical coordinate system presented below but this article uses the chart that g del originally used in this chart the metric or equivalently the line element is where formula 2 is a nonzero real constant which turns out to be the angular velocity of the surrounding dust grains around the y axis as measured by a non spinning observer riding one of the dust grains non spinning means that it doesn t feel centrifugal forces but in this coordinate frame it would actually be turning on

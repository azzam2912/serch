there are several different families of tsallis distributions yet different sources may reference an individual family as the tsallis distribution the q gaussian is a generalization of the gaussian in the same way that tsallis entropy is a generalization of standard boltzmann gibbs entropy or shannon entropy similarly if the domain of the variable is constrained to be positive in the maximum entropy procedure the q exponential distribution is derived the tsallis distributions have been applied to problems in the fields of statistical mechanics geology anatomy astronomy economics finance and machine learning the distributions are often used for their heavy tails note that tsallis distributions are obtained as box cox transformation over usual distributions with deformation parameter formula 1 this deformation transforms exponentials into q exponentials in a similar procedure to how the normal distribution can be derived using the standard boltzmann gibbs entropy or shannon entropy the q gaussian can be derived from a maximization of the tsallis entropy subject to the appropriate constraints see q gaussian see q exponential distribution see q weibull distribution

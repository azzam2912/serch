in maxeksat each clause has exactly k literals each with distinct variables and is in conjunctive normal form these are called k cnf formulas the problem is to determine the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied by a truth assignment to the variables in the clauses we say that an algorithm a provides an approximation to maxeksat if for some fixed positive less than or equal to 1 and every kcnf formula a can find a truth assignment to the variables of that will satisfy at least an fraction of the maximum number of satisfiable clauses of because the np hard k sat problem for k 3 is equivalent to determining if the corresponding maxeksat instance has a value equal to the number of clauses maxeksat must also be np hard meaning that there is no polynomial time algorithm unless p np a natural next question then is that of finding approximate solutions what s the largest real number p complexity algorithm always finds a solution of size opt where opt is the potentially hard to find maximizing assignment there is a simple randomized polynomial time algorithm that provides a formula 1 approximation to maxeksat independently set each

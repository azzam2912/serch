it is approximately 5 000 light years distant and is the brightest member of the open cluster ngc 2362 canis majoris lies at the center of the very young open cluster ngc 2362 which contains several hundred stars it is by far the brightest member of the cluster and the only one to have evolved away from the main sequence a number of stars were catalogued by john herschel as companions component b is a 10th magnitude star 8 6 arc seconds distant component c is a 14th magnitude star 14 2 arc seconds away and component d is an 8th magnitude star at 85 arc seconds these stars are all thought to be main sequence members of ngc 2362 a period of 94 000 years has been suggested for the ab pair assuming they are gravitationally bound in 1951 component a was resolved into a double separated by only 0 15 with an estimated orbital period of 250 years the washington double star catalogue lists the pair as magnitude 4 89 aa and magnitude 5 33 ab but the ccdm designates the components as a and p a 10th magnitude component e was discovered in 2010 it is less

it is long ovate regularly turreted and contains about six whorls these rise almost at right angles from the suture and have an angular or squarish nodulous shoulder usually distinctly carinated by a thin raised spiral keel which forms small but promineut nodules where it crosses the ribs below the shoulder the whorls are abruptly tlattened the subsutural band is usually little convex or nearly flat the ribs are numerous often 20 to 25 regular nearly straight below the shoulder but rounded separated by concave intervals of equal or greater width they extend entirely across the upper whorls but fade out below the middle of the body whorl above the shoulder they are slightly excurved and smaller across the subsutural band the whole surface is covered with regular and rather strong rounded elevated revolving cinguli which cross the ribs and produce on them small rounded nodes they give a pretty regularly and rather finely but strongly cancellated appearance to the whole surface on the penultimate whorl there are four or live cinguli below the angle the abruptly flattened subsulural hand above the shoulder is covered with numerous much finer and closer revolving lines on the anterior part of the body

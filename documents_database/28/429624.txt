in her 2005 classification in mammal species of the world simmons listed the genera cistugo and lasionycteris in the myotinae in addition to myotis itself however molecular data indicate that cistugo is distantly related to all other vespertilionidae so it was reclassified into its own family the cistugidae and that lasionycteris belongs in the vespertilioninae the genus submyotodon has since been added to the subfamily making it and myotis its only members their ears are normally longer than they are wide with a long and lance shaped tragus hence their english and zoological names in greek myotis and myosotis mean mouse ear the species within this genus vary in size from very large to very small for vesper bats with a single pair of mammary glands mouse eared bats are generally insectivores m vivesi and several members of the trawling bat subgenus leuconoe have relatively large feet with long toes and take small fish from the water surface they also take insects myotis species are remarkably long lived for their size in 2018 researchers revealed that a longitudinal study appears to indicate that myotis telomeres do not shrink with age and that telomerase does not appear to be present in

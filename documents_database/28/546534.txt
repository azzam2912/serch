negative for if is nonnegative resp nonpositive everywhere on a of course if is a nonnegative measure every element of is a positive set for in the light of radon nikodym theorem if is a finite positive measure such that a set a is a positive set for if and only if the radon nikodym derivative d d is nonnegative almost everywhere on a similarly a negative set is a set where d d 0 almost everywhere it follows from the definition that every measurable subset of a positive or negative set is also positive or negative also the union of a sequence of positive or negative sets is also positive or negative more formally if a is a sequence of positive sets then is also a positive set the same is true if the word positive is replaced by negative a set which is both positive and negative is a null set for if e is a measurable subset of a positive and negative set a then both e 0 and e 0 must hold and therefore e 0 the hahn decomposition theorem states that for every measurable space x with a signed measure there is a partition of

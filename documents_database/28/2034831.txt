they have evolved from the single skin metal cladding often associated with agricultural buildings to multi layer systems for industrial and leisure application trapezoidal profiles and cassettes have been known in europe for around 100 years today s characteristic profile shape came to europe from the usa in the 50s and has gained relevance since about 1960 at present the proportion of load bearing room sealing trapezoidal profiles used in the overall area of new and slightly sloping roofs amounts to 90 above all else the wide acceptance has resulted from the simple constructive training fast assembly and the low costs of the trapezoidal profile construction metal profile sheets are metal structural members that due to the fact they can have different profiles with different heights and different thickness engineers and architects can use them for a huge variety of buildings from a simple industrial building to a high demand design building trapezoidal profiles are large metal structural members which thanks to the profiling and its thickness retain their high load bearing capability they have been developed from the corrugated profile the profile programme offered by specific manufacturers covers a total of approx 60 profile shapes with different heights cassettes

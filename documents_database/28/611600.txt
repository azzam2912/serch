the etizolam molecule differs from a benzodiazepine in that the benzene ring has been replaced by a thiophene ring and triazole ring has been fused making the drug a thienotriazolodiazepine it possesses amnesic anxiolytic anticonvulsant hypnotic sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties it was patented in 1972 and approved for medical use in 1983 very rare abrupt or rapid discontinuation from etizolam as with benzodiazepines may result in the appearance of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including rebound insomnia neuroleptic malignant syndrome a rare event in benzodiazepine withdrawal has been documented in a case of abrupt withdrawal from etizolam this is particularly relevant given etizolam s short half life relative to benzodiazepines such as diazepam resulting in a more rapid drug level decrease in blood plasma levels in a study that compared the effectiveness of etizolam alprazolam and bromazepam for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder all three drugs retained their effectiveness over 2 weeks but etizolam became more effective from 2 weeks to 4 weeks a type of reverse tolerance administering 5 mg etizolam twice daily did not induce cognitive deficits over 3 weeks when compared to placebo when multiple doses of etizolam or lorazepam were administered to rat neurons

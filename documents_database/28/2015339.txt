she is known for her work on cp violation in the electroweak sector of the standard model introducing what is known as the jarlskog invariant and for her work on grand unified theories see georgi jarlskog mass relation she is mainly known for her study and expertise in theoretical particle physics her studies include research on the ways that sub atomic and electronic constituents of matter cohere or lose their symmetry matter and antimatter asymmetry mathematical physics neutrino physics and grand unification the jarlskog invariant or rephasing invariant cp violation parameter is an invariant quantity in particle physics which is in the order of 2 8 x 10 it is expressed as j im vvvv and is used in elementary particle physics or in quantifying cp violations it is one of jarlskog s foremost contributions to physics the other being the many years that she was an active member of cern she recalls her appreciation of cern s european organization for nuclear research international atmosphere being a part of this community gave her great opportunities to meet and talk with inspiring physicists from across the world she noted that she felt fortunate to have lived in a period when the

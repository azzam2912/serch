it was first proposed by edgar f codd as part of his relational model normalization entails organizing the columns attributes and tables relations of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints it is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis creating a new database design or decomposition improving an existing database design a basic objective of the first normal form defined by codd in 1970 was to permit data to be queried and manipulated using a universal data sub language grounded in first order logic sql is an example of such a data sub language albeit one that codd regarded as seriously flawed the objectives of normalization beyond 1nf first normal form were stated as follows by codd when an attempt is made to modify update insert into or delete from a relation the following undesirable side effects may arise in relations that have not been sufficiently normalized a fully normalized database allows its structure to be extended to accommodate new types of data without changing existing structure too much as a result applications interacting with the database are minimally affected normalized relations and the relationship between one

it is one of numerous phenomena that engineers and designers must consider when developing a range of structures in open air when a vehicle travels along air pushed aside can move in any direction except into the ground inside a tunnel air is confined by the tunnel walls to move along the tunnel behind the moving vehicle as air has been pushed away suction is created and air is pulled to flow into the tunnel in addition because of fluid viscosity the surface of the vehicle drags the air to flow with vehicle a force experienced as skin drag by the vehicle this movement of air by the vehicle is analogous to the operation of a mechanical piston as inside a reciprocating compressor gas pump hence the name piston effect the effect is also similar to the pressure fluctuations inside drainage pipes as waste water pushes air in front of it the piston effect is very pronounced in railway tunnels because the cross sectional area of trains is large and in many cases almost completely fills the tunnel cross section the wind felt by the passengers on underground railway platforms that do not have platform screen doors installed when a

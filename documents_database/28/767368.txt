it took over a decade before the first finnish film was produced and screened in 1907 after these first steps of finnish cinema the progress was very slow after 1907 there were two periods 1909 1911 and 1917 1918 when no finnish films were produced this was partly caused by the political situation as finland held a status as an autonomous part of the russian empire and was thus influenced by the worldwide political situation in 1917 finland became an independent country and in 1918 there was a civil war after the political situation had settled and stabilized finnish society and its cultural life began to develop this was very clear with cinematic arts more films were produced and they became an important part of finnish society the culmination of this development came soon after the silent era around the 1940s and 1950s when three major studios were producing films and competing for the market when society changed in the 1960s partly because of political trends and partly because of new forms of entertainment like television the appeal of films was threatened practically all studios were closed and films became political and too artistic for the masses as commercial production

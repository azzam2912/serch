the dots are short lived visible for a second or less and traveling short distances along seemingly random curvy paths some of them follow the same path as predecessors the dots may be elongated along the path like tiny worms the speed of the dots varies in sync with the pulse they briefly accelerate at each heart beat the dots appear in the central field of view within 15 degrees from the fixation point the left and right eye see different dots someone looking with both eyes sees a mixture most people are able to see this phenomenon in the sky although it is rather weak and many people do not notice it until asked to pay attention the dots are highly conspicuous against a monochromatic blue background 430 nm instead of the sky the dots are white blood cells moving in the capillaries in front of the retina of the eye blue light optimal wavelength 430 nm is absorbed by the red blood cells that fill the capillaries the eye and brain edit out the shadow lines of the capillaries partially by dark adaptation of the photoreceptors lying beneath the capillaries the white blood cells which are much rarer

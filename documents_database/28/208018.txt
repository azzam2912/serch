it reacts with isocyanates to form polyurethane polymers htpb is a translucent liquid with a color similar to wax paper and a viscosity similar to corn syrup the properties vary because htpb is a mixture rather than a pure compound and it is manufactured to meet customers specific requirements a typical htpb is r 45htlo this product consists of oligomeric units typically containing 40 50 butadiene molecules bonded together with each end of the chain terminated with a hydroxyl oh group r 45htlo has a functionality of 2 4 2 6 which means that there is approximately one additional hydroxyl group located along the chain for every two oligomeric units this provides side to side linkage for a stronger cured product htpb is usually cured by an addition reaction with di or poly isocyanate compounds polyurethanes prepared from htpb can be engineered for specific physical properties polyurethanes may be highly elastic or tough and rigid some products include rigid foam insulation panels durable elastomeric wheels and tires used for roller coasters escalators skateboards etc automotive suspension bushings electrical potting compounds high performance adhesives surface coatings and surface sealants synthetic fibers e g spandex carpet underlay hard plastic parts e g

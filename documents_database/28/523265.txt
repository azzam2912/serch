it is a form of electric current multiplication that can allow very large currents within materials which are otherwise good insulators it is a type of electron avalanche the avalanche process occurs when carriers in the transition region are accelerated by the electric field to energies sufficient to create mobile or free electron hole pairs via collisions with bound electrons materials conduct electricity if they contain mobile charge carriers there are two types of charge carriers in a semiconductor free electrons mobile electrons and electron holes mobile holes which are missing electrons from the normally occupied electron states a normally bound electron e g in a bond in a reverse biased diode may break loose due to a thermal fluctuation or excitation creating a mobile electron hole pair if there is a voltage gradient electric field in the semiconductor the electron will move towards the positive voltage while the hole will move towards the negative voltage usually the electron and hole will simply move to opposite ends of the crystal and enter the appropriate electrodes when the electric field is strong enough the mobile electron or hole may be accelerated to high enough speeds to knock other bound electrons free

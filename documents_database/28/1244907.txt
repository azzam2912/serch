the manifestations of exposure to health hazards during the production process often occurs at a low level and the effects of the toxins may take decades to surface a scientific advisory committee funded by the semiconductor industry association concluded there was no evidence of increased cancer risk to cleanroom workers although it could not rule out the possibility that circumstances might exist that could result in increased risk historically semiconductor fabrication and the production roles involved in creating integrated circuits have often been the role of women in the 1980s it was estimated that 68 of tech production jobs including semiconductor production were performed by women in southeast asia one of the largest producers of semiconductors in the world over 90 of the production jobs were said to be filled by women during this period today the trend of women dominating production roles in the semiconductor industry continues semiconductor fabrication as previously stated has a number of adverse impacts on workers health however these effects are realized to a greater extent in female workers then with men digital equipment one american producer of semiconductors found that women working in its factories had twice the chance of experiencing a miscarriage as

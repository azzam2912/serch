there are ten different isoforms of these proteins and ten genes coding them respectively in plasmodium plm i ii iii iv v vi vii ix x and hap it has been suggested that the plasmepsin family is smaller in other human plasmodium species expression of plm i ii iv v ix x and hap occurs in the erythrocytic cycle and expression of plm vi vii viii occurs in the exoerythrocytic cycle through their haemoglobin degrading activity they are an important cause of symptoms in malaria sufferers consequently this family of enzymes is a potential target for antimalarial drugs plasmepsins are aspartic acid proteases meaning their active site contains two aspartic acid residues these two aspartic acid residue act respectively as proton donor and proton acceptor catalysing the hydrolysis of peptide bond in proteins there are four types of plasmepsins closely related but varying in the specificity of cleavage site plasmepsins i and ii cleave hemoglobin between residues phenylalanine 33 and leucine 34 of globin subunit the name plasmepsin may come from plasmodium the organism and pepsin a common aspartic acid protease with similar molecular structure the closest non pathogenic enzymatic equivalent in humans is the beta secretase enzyme

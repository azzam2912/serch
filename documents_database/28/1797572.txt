they are very lightweight and thin until they come into contact with water then they begin to retain water until they have reached capacity the devices then resist any further water excess these can be used to absorb resist and redirect flowing water the hydrosack and the hydrosnake are made up of an outer fabric consisting of non woven polypropylene with a hydrophilic finish the internal pads are composed of pads containing wood pulp and a superabsorbent polymer sap in this form the hydrosack or hydrosnake weighs the hydrosack measures and the hydrosnake measures when a hydrosack or a hydrosnake comes into contact with water the sap crystallizes and absorbs the water hydrosacks take approximately 2 3 minutes to reach full capacity the hydrosack and the hydrosnake are very absorbent full capacity is between of water it retains this weight for up to six months hydrosacks can be stacked together to form a strong ballast it is used as a form of flood control and can be used to minimize the damage that flooding can cause the hydrosack has a three section structure with handles when a hydrosack is no longer needed the insides can be emptied into the earth

from such analyses measures can then be taken to reduce the likelihood of errors occurring within a system and therefore lead to an improvement in the overall levels of safety there exist three primary reasons for conducting an hra error identification error quantification and error reduction as there exist a number of techniques used for such purposes they can be split into one of two classifications first generation techniques and second generation techniques first generation techniques work on the basis of the simple dichotomy of fits doesn t fit in the matching of the error situation in context with related error identification and quantification and second generation techniques are more theory based in their assessment and quantification of errors hra techniques have been utilised in a range of industries including healthcare engineering nuclear transportation and business sector each technique has varying uses within different disciplines this is a time based model that describes the probability of a system operator s failure as a multiplicative function of 5 main factors these factors are as follows using these figures an overall human error probability hep can be calculated with the formulation provided below k1 x k2 x k3 x k4 x k5

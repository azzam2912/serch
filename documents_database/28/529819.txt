specifically it is a consecutive set of sectors called timecode frames on audio tracks on the disc containing a block of data one session may contain one or more tracks of the same or different types there are several kinds of tracks and there is also a sub track index for finding points within a track blu ray discs can also be written in a sequential session based mode modelled on cd and dvd a blu ray track refer to the entire physical storage of a blu ray layer the equivalent to tracks in cd sessions is called a logical track audio tracks are defined in the red book specification for cd digital audio which was the first cd specification one song or movement usually comprises one audio track containing audio in the form of raw pcm samples in 16 bit 44 1 khz resolution in 2 channels and a subcode multiplexed with the audio data in this mode each sector called a frame consists of 2352 bytes of audio data 1176 16 bit samples or 588 stereo samples which equals 1 75 second of audio therefore smpte time code equivalent for the audio data consists of hour minute sec

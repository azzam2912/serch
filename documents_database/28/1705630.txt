a squinted nonperpendicular mode is possible also slar can be fitted with a standard antenna real aperture radar or an antenna using synthetic aperture the platform of the radar moves in direction of the x axis the radar looks with the looking angle or so called off nadir angle the angle between x axis and the line of sight los is called cone angle the angle between the x axis and the projection of the line of sight to the x y plane is called azimuth angle cone and azimuth angle are related by cos cos cos on the earth surface the wave comes in at the nominal ellipsoidal incident angle with respect to the vertical axis at this point in some publications the incident angle is denominated to as the antenna illuminates an area the so called footprint the direction of the incoming wave relative to the horizontal plane may be measured also this angle 90 is called grazing angle the angle 90 is used for a mathematical description in a spherical coordinate system for the approximation of a flat earth which is usual for airborne radar with short to medium range the grazing angle and the depression angle

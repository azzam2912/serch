it is used to aid in the differential diagnosis of metabolic acidosis the term anion gap without qualification usually implies serum anion gap the urine anion gap is a different measure principally used to determine whether the kidneys are capable of appropriately acidifying urine urine anion gap is calculated by subtracting the urine concentration of chloride anions from the concentrations of sodium plus potassium cations where the concentrations are expressed in units of milliequivalents liter meq l in contrast to the serum anion gap equation the bicarbonate is excluded this is because urine is acidic so the bicarbonate level would be negligible determining the cause of a metabolic acidosis that lacks a serum anion gap often depends on determining whether the kidney is appropriately excreting acid the urine anion gap is an artificial and calculated measure that is representative of the unmeasured ions in urine usually the most important unmeasured ion in urine is nh since it is the most important form of acid excretion by the kidney urine nh is difficult to measure directly but its excretion is usually accompanied by the anion chloride a negative urine anion gap can be used as evidence of increased nh excretion in

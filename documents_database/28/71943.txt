he is known for statistically showing the existence of a redshift distance correlation for spiral galaxies as already vesto slipher in 1912 wirtz in 1918 observed a systematic redshift of spiral nebulae which was difficult to interpret in terms of a cosmological model in which the universe is filled more or less uniformly with stars and nebulae wirtz additionally used the equivalent in german of k correction the term continues to be used in present day observational cosmology but wirtz s observational evidence that the universe is expanding is not often mentioned he wrote in 1922 he wrote a paper where he argued that the observational results suggest that the redshifts of distant galaxies are becoming higher than more closer ones which he interpreted as an increase of their radial velocities with distance and that larger masses have smaller redshifts than smaller ones in another note of the same year he argued that counter clockwise spiraling galaxies have smaller redshifts than clockwise spiraling ones in 1924 he obtained more precise results and interpreted them both as a confirmation of an increase of radial velocities with distance but also as confirmation of a de sitter universe in which the increase of

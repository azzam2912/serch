the design was published in 1987 by c g g nther it is also known as the alternating stop and go generator linear feedback shift registers lfsrs are statistically speaking excellent pseudorandom generators with good distribution and simple implementation however they cannot be used as is because their output can be predicted easily an asg comprises three linear feedback shift registers which we will call lfsr0 lfsr1 and lfsr2 for convenience the output of one of the registers decides which of the other two is to be used for instance if lfsr2 outputs a 0 lfsr0 is clocked and if it outputs a 1 lfsr1 is clocked instead the output is the exclusive or of the last bit produced by lfsr0 and lfsr1 the initial state of the three lfsrs is the key customarily the lfsrs use primitive polynomials of distinct but close degree preset to non zero state so that each lfsr generates a maximum length sequence under these assumptions the asg s output demonstrably has long period high linear complexity and even distribution of short subsequences example code in c an asg is very simple to implement in hardware in particular contrary to the shrinking generator and self

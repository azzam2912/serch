therefore by authenticating the signature and seal of this final official a foreign jurisdiction can authenticate the entire chain of verifications back to the entity responsible for issuing the original document without scrutinizing each link individually take for example john who wishes to obtain a divorce in canada but got married in brazil canadian law mandates that john must supply a copy of his marriage certificate in order to move ahead with divorce proceedings in that country john s marriage certificate was issued by the local authority in his wife s hometown in the brazilian countryside it would be risky and impractical for canadian judicial officials to seek confirmation about the authenticity of john s marriage certificate by attempting to liaise directly with the village government in brazil the solution then is to have john submit his document to a controlled sequential process of verification legalization the first step in this example is to have the certificate notarized by licensed brazilian notary the signature and seal of the notary are in turn attested to by the brazilian ministry of external relations who also affix a stamp and signature to the marriage certificate finally john brings the document to the legalization

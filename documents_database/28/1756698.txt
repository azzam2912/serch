the primary cause of airflow is the existence of pressure gradients air behaves in a fluid manner meaning particles naturally flow from areas of higher pressure to those where the pressure is lower atmospheric air pressure is directly related to altitude temperature and composition in engineering airflow is a measurement of the amount of air per unit of time that flows through a particular device the flow of air can be induced through mechanical means such as by operating an electric or manual fan or can take place passively as a function of pressure differentials present in the environment like any fluid air may exhibit both laminar and turbulent flow patterns laminar flow occurs when air can flow smoothly and exhibits a parabolic velocity profile turbulent flow occurs when there is an irregularity such as a disruption in the surface across which the fluid is flowing which alters the direction of movement turbulent flow exhibits a flat velocity profile the reynolds number a ratio indicating the relationship between viscous and inertial forces in a fluid can be used to predict the transition from laminar to turbulent flow this number and related concepts can be applied to studying flow in systems

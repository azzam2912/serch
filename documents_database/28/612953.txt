since viruses are obligate intracellular parasites they must develop direct methods of transmission between hosts in order to survive the mobility of animals increases the mechanisms of viral transmission that have evolved whereas plants remain immobile and thus plant viruses must rely on environmental factors to be transmitted between hosts the structural differences between plant and animal cells have resulted in a variety of transmission routes being exploited enabling the virus to be passed between different host plants the main difference from the point of view of a virus is the cell wall this forms a tough barrier between the intracellular components and the extracellular environment which has to be penetrated these differences combined with the fact that plants are immobile have resulted in plant viruses relying on the wind and soil to transmit seeds as well as vectors vectors either transmit the virus propagative transmission which results in an amplification of the virus by replication within the cells of the vector or non propagative transmission which simply carries the virus between the plants without viral replication common vectors include bacteria fungi nematodes arthropods and arachnids furthermore human intervention including grafting and experimental mechanical damage physically damages the cell wall

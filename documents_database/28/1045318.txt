in tlingit culture a heavy emphasis is placed upon family and kinship and on a rich tradition of oratory wealth and economic power are important indicators of status but so is generosity and proper behavior all signs of good breeding and ties to aristocracy art and spirituality are incorporated in nearly all areas of tlingit culture with even everyday objects such as spoons and storage boxes decorated and imbued with spiritual power and historical associations the tlingit kinship system like most northwest coast societies is based on a matrilineal structure and describes a family roughly according to morgan s crow system of kinship the society is wholly divided into two distinct moieties termed raven y il and eagle wolf ch aak ghooch the former identifies with the raven as its primary crest but the latter is variously identified with the wolf the eagle or some other dominant animal crest depending on location occasionally this moiety is simply called the not raven people there is a general tendency among younger tlingits of identifying all eagle wolf clans with eagle in preference to wolf or other crests something deprecated by most elders but reinforced by modern associations between tlingit and their tsimshian

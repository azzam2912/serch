ismail was one of the new crop of umar ii s competent governors with instructions to improve the kairouan administration and pursue the integration of non arab muslims into the empire rather than treat them as conquered peoples as such ismail encouraged conversions among the berbers of north africa and curbed the abuses of the arab military caste ismail adhered to islamic law and eliminated extraordinary taxes and slave tributes on berber populations he is credited for completing the conversion of the berber population to islam in a curious note ismail ibn abd allah was the first and only umayyad governor of ifriqiya who was not given supervisory authority over iberia al andalus in an unusual step caliph umar ii decided to appoint al samh ibn malik al khawlani as the governor of al andalus directly and made him directly answerable to damascus rather than going through kairouan ismail ibn abd allah s tenure was competent but short he was relieved of his post in 720 by umar ii s successor caliph yazid ii and replaced by the dubious yazid ibn abi muslim as governor in kairouan

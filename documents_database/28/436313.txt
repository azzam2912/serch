put another way if two objects are set in motion along two initially parallel trajectories the presence of a tidal gravitational force will cause the trajectories to bend towards or away from each other producing a relative acceleration between the objects mathematically the tidal force in general relativity is described by the riemann curvature tensor and the trajectory of an object solely under the influence of gravity is called a geodesic the geodesic deviation equation relates the riemann curvature tensor to the relative acceleration of two neighboring geodesics in differential geometry the geodesic deviation equation is more commonly known as the jacobi equation to quantify geodesic deviation one begins by setting up a family of closely spaced geodesics indexed by a continuous variable s and parametrized by an affine parameter that is for each fixed s the curve swept out by as varies is a geodesic when considering the geodesic of a massive object it is often convenient to choose to be the object s proper time if x s are the coordinates of the geodesic then the tangent vector of this geodesic is if is the proper time then t is the four velocity of the object traveling along

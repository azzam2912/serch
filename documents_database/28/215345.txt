it is a distributed algorithm that coordinates all the processes that participate in a distributed atomic transaction on whether to commit or abort roll back the transaction it is a specialized type of consensus protocol the protocol achieves its goal even in many cases of temporary system failure involving either process network node communication etc failures and is thus widely used however it is not resilient to all possible failure configurations and in rare cases manual intervention is needed to remedy an outcome to accommodate recovery from failure automatic in most cases the protocol s participants use logging of the protocol s states log records which are typically slow to generate but survive failures are used by the protocol s recovery procedures many protocol variants exist that primarily differ in logging strategies and recovery mechanisms though usually intended to be used infrequently recovery procedures compose a substantial portion of the protocol due to many possible failure scenarios to be considered and supported by the protocol in a normal execution of any single distributed transaction i e when no failure occurs which is typically the most frequent situation the protocol consists of two phases note that the two phase commit 2pc

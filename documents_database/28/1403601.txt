the genus has a collectively widespread distribution and contains about 40 species the name means having the appearance of ramaria ramariopsis was originally defined as a subgenus of clavaria by dutch mycologist marinus anton donk in 1933 several european species similar to the type clavaria kunzei were included clavaria subtilis clavaria pyxidata clavaria angulispora and clavaria pulchella in donk s concept defining characteristics of the group included small branching fruitbodies with a stipe and an almost cartilaginous consistency to the flesh spores are small and hyaline translucent spherical to ellipsoid and have a surface ornamentation ranging from echinulate spiny to verruculose covered with small warts e j h corner promoted the subgenus to generic status in his 1950 world monograph of clavarioid fungi ron petersen emended the genus in 1966 to include smooth spored species such as r minutula three years later he proposed the subgenus laevispora to contain the smooth spored species in 1985 pegler and young used electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructural details of the spore surface which revealed that the spores considered smooth with conventional light microscopy were ornamented at the ultrastructural level they determined that the genus could be divided into three groups based on

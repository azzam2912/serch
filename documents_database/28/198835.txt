the nucleus ambiguus contains the cell bodies of neurons that innervate the muscles of the soft palate pharynx and larynx which are associated with speech and swallowing as well as motor neurons the nucleus ambiguus contains preganglionic parasympathetic neurons which innervate postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the heart it is a region of histologically disparate cells located just dorsal posterior to the inferior olivary nucleus in the lateral portion of the upper rostral medulla it receives upper motor neuron innervation directly via the corticobulbar tract this nucleus gives rise to the branchial efferent motor fibers of the vagus nerve cn x terminating in the laryngeal pharyngeal muscles and musculus uvulae as well as to the efferent motor fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve cn ix terminating in the stylopharyngeus muscle the nucleus ambiguus controls the motor innervation of ipsilateral muscles of the soft palate pharynx larynx and upper esophagus lesions of nucleus ambiguus results in nasal speech dysphagia dysphonia and deviation of the uvula toward the contralateral side preganglionic parasympathetics to the heart also flow through the external formation of the nucleus the muscles supplied by the vagus included with this is the cranial root of the accessory nerve such as levator

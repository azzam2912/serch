angiogenesis continues the growth of the vasculature by processes of sprouting and splitting vasculogenesis is the embryonic formation of endothelial cells from mesoderm cell precursors and from neovascularization although discussions are not always precise especially in older texts the first vessels in the developing embryo form through vasculogenesis after which angiogenesis is responsible for most if not all blood vessel growth during development and in disease angiogenesis is a normal and vital process in growth and development as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue however it is also a fundamental step in the transition of tumors from a benign state to a malignant one leading to the use of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of cancer the essential role of angiogenesis in tumor growth was first proposed in 1971 by judah folkman who described tumors as hot and bloody illustrating that at least for many tumor types flush perfusion and even hyperemia are characteristic sprouting angiogenesis was the first identified form of angiogenesis it occurs in several well characterized stages first biological signals known as angiogenic growth factors activate receptors on endothelial cells present in pre existing blood vessels second the activated endothelial cells

this bacteria is ubiquitous in the environment where it can act as either a saprophyte when free living within the environment or as a pathogen when entering a host organism many non coding rnas have been identified within the bacteria genome where several of these have been classified as novel non coding rnas and may contribute to pathogenesis tiling arrays and mutagenesis identified many non coding rnas within the l monocytogenes genome and the location of these non coding rnas within the bacterial genome was confirmed by race rapid amplification of cdna ends analysis these studies showed that the expression of many non coding rnas was dependent on the environment and that several of these non coding rnas act as cis regulatory elements comparisons between previously characterized non coding rnas and those present in the l monocyotogenes genome identified 50 novel non coding rnas in l monocyotogenes an additional comparative study between the pathogenic l monocytogenes strain and the non pathogenic l innocua strain identified several non coding rnas that are only present within l monocytogenes which suggests that these ncrnas may have a role in pathogenesis the tables below summarizes the location flanking genes and also the characteristics of

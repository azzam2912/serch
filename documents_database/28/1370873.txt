vela satellites after these satellites detected fifteen other grbs ray klebesadel of the los alamos national laboratory published the first paper on the subject observations of gamma ray bursts of cosmic origin as more and more research was done on these mysterious events hundreds of models were developed in an attempt to explain their origins gamma ray bursts were discovered in the late 1960s by the u s vela nuclear test detection satellites the velas were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapon tests in space the united states suspected that the ussr might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the nuclear test ban treaty in 1963 while most satellites orbited at about 500 miles above earth s surface the vela satellites orbited at an altitude of 65 000 miles at this height the satellites orbited above the van allen radiation belt which reduced the noise in the sensors the extra height also meant that the satellites could detect explosions behind the moon a location where the united states government suspected the soviet union would try to conceal nuclear weapon tests the vela system generally had four satellites operational at any given time such that

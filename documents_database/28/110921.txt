as nodules can be found in vast quantities and contain valuable metals deposits have been identified as having economic interest nodules vary in size from tiny particles visible only under a microscope to large pellets more than across however most nodules are between in diameter about the size of hen s eggs or potatoes their surface textures vary from smooth to rough they frequently have botryoidal mammilated or knobby texture and vary from spherical in shape to typically oblate sometimes prolate or are otherwise irregular the bottom surface buried in sediment is generally rougher than the top due to a different type of growth nodules lie on the seabed sediment often partly or completely buried they vary greatly in abundance in some cases touching one another and covering more than 70 of the sea floor the total amount of polymetallic nodules on the sea floor was estimated at 500 billion tons by alan a archer of the london geological museum in 1981 polymetallic nodules are found in both shallow e g the baltic sea and deeper waters e g the central pacific even in lakes and are thought to have been a feature of the seas and oceans at least

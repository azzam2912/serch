lithoautotrophs are a type of lithotrophs with autotrophic metabolic pathways lithoautotrophs are exclusively microbes macrofauna do not possess the capability to use mineral sources of energy most lithoautotrophs belong to the domain bacteria while some belong to the domain archaea for lithoautotrophic bacteria only inorganic molecules can be used as energy sources the term lithotroph is from greek lithos meaning rock and meaning consumer literally it may be read eaters of rock many lithoautotrophs are extremophiles but this is not universally so lithoautotrophs are extremely specific in using their energy source thus despite the diversity in using inorganic molecules in order to obtain energy that lithoautotrophs exhibit as a group one particular lithoautotroph would use only one type of inorganic molecule to get its energy lithoautotrophs participate in many geological processes such as the weathering of parent material bedrock to form soil as well as biogeochemical cycling of sulfur potassium and other elements they may be present in the deep terrestrial subsurface they have been found well over 3 km below the surface of the planet in soils and in endolith communities as they are responsible for the liberation of many crucial nutrients and participate in the formation of soil

the remote location of the volcano has meant that even the most recent eruption in 1993 was not recorded until two years later it is also the only volcano in the galapagos to have erupted rhyolite and basaltic lava the volcano has the largest number of wild tortoises of any of the volcanoes in the galapagos though their genetic diversity is amongst the lowest of any of the breeds in the archipelago the habitat of the tortoises was threatened when feral goats crossed from southern isabela island in the 1970s and then reproduced rapidly it is believed that alcedo volcano emerged from the sea approximately 313 000 years ago based on its sub aerial volume of 234 km and average eruption rate of 1x10 m per year this has produced a volcano that is 1130m high with a caldera that measures 6 1 x 7 4 km alcedo volcano is similar to its neighbours to the north darwin and to the south sierra negra which also have shallow slopes for the majority of their height it is also similar to these two in that the depth of the caldera is less than 25 of the height of the volcano this

the exact borders are not fully clear as the regions are not official political or administrative units they are delimited by culture such as country traditions traditional lifestyle songs tales etc to some extent regions correspond to the zones of lithuanian language dialects this correspondence however is by no means strict for example although the dz kian dialect is called south auk taitian it does not mean that dz kija is part of auk taitija in certain parts of some regions dialects of other regions are spoken while for example in samogitia there are three indigenous dialects southern northern and western samogitian some of which are subdivided into subdialects no region except for samogitia has ever been a political or an administrative entity however some work was done recently to delimit their boundaries more clearly as there is a project to change the system of counties in lithuania into ethnographic regions which would be called lands singular em plural em s this project is also supported by the view that with the limited functions of counties 10 of them are not needed for lithuania another supporting argument is that in other countries historical territories are being revived while in lithuania

while von neumann bernays g del set theory restricts the bound variables in the schematic formula appearing in the axiom schema of class comprehension to range over sets alone morse kelley set theory allows these bound variables to range over proper classes as well as sets as first suggested by quine in 1940 for his system ml morse kelley set theory is named after mathematicians john l kelley and anthony morse and was first set out by and later in an appendix to kelley s textbook general topology 1955 a graduate level introduction to topology kelley said the system in his book was a variant of the systems due to thoralf skolem and morse morse s own version appeared later in his book a theory of sets 1965 while von neumann bernays g del set theory is a conservative extension of zermelo fraenkel set theory zfc the canonical set theory in the sense that a statement in the language of zfc is provable in nbg if and only if it is provable in zfc morse kelley set theory is a proper extension of zfc unlike von neumann bernays g del set theory where the axiom schema of class comprehension can

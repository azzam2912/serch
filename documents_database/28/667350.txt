its original goal was to provide further evidence for the wave nature of light beyond those provided by thomas young and augustin jean fresnel in the experiment light from a monochromatic slit source reflects from a glass surface at a small angle and appears to come from a virtual source as a result the reflected light interferes with the direct light from the source forming interference fringes it is the optical wave analogue to a sea interferometer lloyd s mirror is used to produce two source interference patterns that have important differences from the interference patterns seen in young s experiment in a modern implementation of lloyd s mirror a diverging laser beam strikes a front surface mirror at a grazing angle so that some of the light travels directly to the screen blue lines in fig 1 and some of the light reflects off the mirror to the screen red lines the reflected light forms a virtual second source that interferes with the direct light in young s experiment the individual slits display a diffraction pattern on top of which is overlaid interference fringes from the two slits fig 2 in contrast the lloyd s mirror experiment does not

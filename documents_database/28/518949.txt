the ratio is linked to water temperature of ancient oceans which in turn reflects ancient climates cycles in the ratio mirror climate changes in geologic history oxygen chemical symbol o has three naturally occurring isotopes o o and o where the 16 17 and 18 refer to the atomic mass the most abundant is o with a small percentage of o and an even smaller percentage of o oxygen isotope analysis considers only the ratio of o to o present in a sample the calculated ratio of the masses of each present in the sample is then compared to a standard which can yield information about the temperature at which the sample was formed see proxy climate for details o is two neutrons heavier than o and causes the water molecule in which it occurs to be heavier by that amount the addition of more energy is required to vaporize ho than ho and ho liberates more energy when it condenses in addition ho tends to diffuse more rapidly because ho requires less energy to vaporize and is more likely to diffuse to the liquid surface the first water vapor formed during evaporation of liquid water is enriched in ho

peanut agglutinin may also be referred to as arachis hypogaea lectin lectins recognise and bind particular sugar sequences in carbohydrates peanut agglutinin binds the carbohydrate sequence gal 1 3 galnac the name peanut agglutinin originates from its ability to stick together agglutinate cells such as neuramidase treated erythrocytes which have glycoproteins or glycolipids on their surface which include the gal 1 3 galnac carbohydrate sequence the protein is 273 amino acids in length with the first 23 residues acting and a signal peptide which is subsequently cleaved it has a uniprot accession of p02872 there are over 20 structures of this protein in the pdb which reveal and all beta sheet protein with a tetrameric quaternary structure it is a member of the lectin legb pfam family available structures of peanut agglutinin because peanut agglutinin specifically binds a particular carbohydrate sequence it finds use in a range of methods for cell biology and biochemistry for example in pna affinity chromatography the binding specificity of peanut agglutinin is used to isolate glycosylated molecules which have the sugar sequence gal 1 3 galnac peanut agglutinin activity is inhibited by lactose and galactose which compete for the binding site other uses include

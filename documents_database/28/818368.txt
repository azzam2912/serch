it is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that is a potent survival factor for neurons and oligodendrocytes and may be relevant in reducing tissue destruction during inflammatory attacks a mutation in this gene which results in aberrant splicing leads to ciliary neurotrophic factor deficiency but this phenotype is not causally related to neurologic disease in addition to the predominant monocistronic transcript originating from this locus the gene is also cotranscribed with the upstream zfp91 gene cotranscription from the two loci results in a transcript that contains a complete coding region for the zinc finger protein but lacks a complete coding region for ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf has also been shown to be expressed by cells on the bone surface and to reduce the activity of bone forming cells osteoblasts in 2001 it was reported that in a human study examining the usefulness of cntf for treatment of motor neuron disease cntf produced an unexpected and substantial weight loss in the study subjects further investigation revealed that cntf could reduce food intake without causing hunger or stress making it a candidate for weight control in leptin resistant subjects as cntf is believed to operate like leptin but by a non leptin pathway a

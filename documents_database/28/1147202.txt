it attempts to describe categories in terms of the size a cardinal number of the operations needed to generate their objects the theory originates in the work of grothendieck completed by 1969 and gabriel and ulmer 1971 it has been further developed in 1989 by michael makkai and robert par with motivation coming from model theory a branch of mathematical logic a standard text book by ad mek and rosick appeared in 1994 accessible categories also have applications in homotopy theory grothendieck continued the development of the theory for homotopy theoretic purposes in his still partly unpublished 1991 manuscript les d rivateurs some properties of accessible categories depend on the set universe in use particularly on the cardinal properties and vop nka s principle let formula 1 be an infinite regular cardinal i e a cardinal number that is not the sum of a smaller number of smaller cardinals examples are formula 4 aleph 0 the first infinite cardinal number and formula 5 the first uncountable cardinal a partially ordered set formula 6 is called formula 1 directed if every subset formula 8 of formula 9 of cardinality less than formula 1 has an upper bound in formula 9 in

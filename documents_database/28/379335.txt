a common purpose of modern brain implants and the focus of much current research is establishing a biomedical prosthesis circumventing areas in the brain that have become dysfunctional after a stroke or other head injuries this includes sensory substitution e g in vision other brain implants are used in animal experiments simply to record brain activity for scientific reasons some brain implants involve creating interfaces between neural systems and computer chips this work is part of a wider research field called brain computer interfaces brain computer interface research also includes technology such as eeg arrays that allow interface between mind and machine but do not require direct implantation of a device neural implants such as deep brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation are increasingly becoming routine for patients with parkinson s disease and clinical depression respectively brain implants electrically stimulate block or record or both record and stimulate simultaneously signals from single neurons or groups of neurons biological neural networks in the brain the blocking technique is called intra abdominal vagal blocking this can only be done where the functional associations of these neurons are approximately known because of the complexity of neural processing and the lack of access to

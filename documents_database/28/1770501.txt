as a rfp mcherry was derived from dsred of discosoma sea anemones unlike green fluorescent proteins gfps which are often derived from aequoera victoria jellyfish fluorescent proteins are used to tag components in the cell so they can be studied using fluorescence spectroscopy mcherry absorbs light between 540 590 nm and emits light in the range of 550 650 nm mcherry belongs to the group of fluorescent protein chromophores used as instruments to visualize genes and analyze their functions in experiments genome editing has been improved greatly through the precise insertion of these fluorescent protein tags into the genetic material of many diverse organisms most comparisons between the brightness and photostability of different fluorescent proteins have been made in vitro removed from biological variables that affect protein performance in cells or organisms it is hard to perfectly simulate cellular environments in vitro and the difference in environment could have an effect on the brightness and photostability mrfps like mcherry are useful because they have a lower molecular weight and will fold faster than tetramers do this results in the monomeric fluorescent proteins disturbing the target system less dsred is isolated from discosoma sea anemones and is a tetrameric protein most

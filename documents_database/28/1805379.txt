the concept is named for c c tsen who introduced their study in 1936 we consider a system of m polynomial equations in n variables over a field f assume that the equations all have constant term zero so that 0 0 0 is a common solution we say that f is a t field if every such system of degrees d d has a common non zero solution whenever the tsen rank of f is the smallest i such that f is a t field we say that the tsen rank of f is infinite if it is not a t field for any i for example if it is formally real we define a norm form of level i on a field f to be a homogeneous polynomial of degree d in n d variables with only the trivial zero over f we exclude the case n d 1 the existence of a norm form on level i on f implies that f is of tsen rank at least i 1 if e is an extension of f of finite degree n 1 then the field norm form for e f is a norm form of level 1

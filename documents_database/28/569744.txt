for example the brans dicke theory of gravitation uses both a scalar field and a tensor field to mediate the gravitational interaction modern physics tries to derive all physical theories from as few principles as possible in this way newtonian mechanics as well as quantum mechanics are derived from hamilton s principle of least action in this approach the behavior of a system is not described via forces but by functions which describe the energy of the system most important are the energetic quantities known as the hamiltonian function and the lagrangian function their derivatives in space are known as hamiltonian density and the lagrangian density going to these quantities leads to the field theories modern physics uses field theories to explain reality these fields can be scalar vectorial or tensorial an example of a scalar field is the temperature field an example of a vector field is the wind velocity field an example of a tensor field is the stress tensor field in a stressed body used in continuum mechanics in physics forces as vectorial quantities are given as the derivative gradient of scalar quantities named potentials in classical physics before einstein gravitation was given in the same way

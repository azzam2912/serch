crumeyrolle 1919 1992 was a french mathematician and professor of mathematics at the paul sabatier university known for his contributions to spinor structures and clifford algebra crumeyrolle was a student of andr lichnerowicz under whose supervision he completed a thesis in 1961 his first important paper after completing his doctorate addressed spinor structures using methods of clifford algebras developed by claude chevalley crumeyrolle is known for his major contributions to theories of clifford algebras and spinor structures in 1975 he laid the foundations for symplectic clifford algebra and the symplectic spinor an earlier publication by two other authors nouaz and revoy had appeared three years before in which weyl algebras were treated from a cliffordian point of view crumeyrolle however drew more attention to the topic and as emphasized by jacques helmstetter he contributed original ideas of his own his work on symplectic clifford algebras however came under serious critique on mathematical grounds the mathematician artibano micali recalled crumeyrolle stating that periodicity of clifford algebras should play a similar role for elementary particle physics as the periodic classification of elements by dmitri mendeleev has played for the periodic table of elements crumeyrolle taught in iran in 1966 in several europe

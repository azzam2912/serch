within the standard model of elementary particle physics such a dipole is predicted to be non zero but very small at most where e stands for the elementary charge the existence of a non zero electron electric dipole moment would imply a violation of both parity invariance and time reversal invariance in the standard model the electron edm arises from the cp violating components of the ckm matrix the moment is very small because the cp violation involves quarks not electrons directly so it can only arise by quantum processes where virtual quarks are created interact with the electron and then are annihilated if neutrinos are majorana particles a larger edm around is possible in the standard model many extensions to the standard model have been proposed in the past two decades these extensions generally predict larger values for the electron edm for instance the various technicolor models predict d that ranges from 10 to 10 e cm some supersymmetric models predict that but some other parameter choices or other supersymmetric models lead to smaller predicted values the present experimental limit therefore eliminates some of these technicolor supersymmetric theories but not all further improvements or a positive result would place

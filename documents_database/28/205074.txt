often ad hoc hypothesizing is employed to compensate for anomalies not anticipated by the theory in its unmodified form scientists are often skeptical of theories that rely on frequent unsupported adjustments to sustain them this is because if a theorist so chooses there is no limit to the number of ad hoc hypotheses that they could add thus the theory becomes more and more complex but is never falsified this is often at a cost to the theory s predictive power however ad hoc hypotheses are often characteristic of pseudoscientific subjects an ad hoc hypothesis is not necessarily incorrect in some cases a minor change to a theory was all that was necessary for example albert einstein s addition of the cosmological constant to general relativity in order to allow a static universe was ad hoc although he later referred to it as his greatest blunder it may correspond to theories of dark energy naturally some gaps in knowledge and even some observations that contradict a theory must be temporarily tolerated while research continues to temper ad hoc hypothesizing in science common practice includes falsificationism somewhat in the philosophy of occam s razor falsificationism means scientists become more likely to

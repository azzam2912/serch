it is not to be confused with other ocular based technologies iris recognition commonly called an iris scan and eye vein verification that uses scleral veins the human retina is a thin tissue composed of neural cells that is located in the posterior portion of the eye because of the complex structure of the capillaries that supply the retina with blood each person s retina is unique the network of blood vessels in the retina is not entirely genetically determined and thus even identical twins do not share a similar pattern although retinal patterns may be altered in cases of diabetes glaucoma or retinal degenerative disorders the retina typically remains unchanged from birth until death due to its unique and unchanging nature the retina appears to be the most precise and reliable biometric aside from dna the national center for state courts estimate that retinal scanning has an error rate of one in ten million a retinal scan is performed by casting an unperceived beam of low energy infrared light into a person s eye as they look through the scanner s eyepiece this beam of light traces a standardized path on the retina because retinal blood vessels absorb light

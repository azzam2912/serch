cerevisiae also known as rad51c is a protein which in humans is encoded by the rad51c gene the rad51c protein is one of five paralogs of rad51 including rad51b rad51l1 rad51c rad51l2 rad51d rad51l3 xrcc2 and xrcc3 they each share about 25 amino acid sequence identity with rad51 and each other the rad51 paralogs are all required for efficient dna double strand break repair by homologous recombination and depletion of any paralog results in significant decreases in homologous recombination frequency rad51c forms two distinct complexes with other related paralogs bcdx2 rad51b rad51c rad51d xrcc2 and cx3 rad51c xrcc3 these two complexes act at two different stages of homologous recombinational dna repair the bcdx2 complex is responsible for rad51 recruitment or stabilization at damage sites the bcdx2 complex appears to act by facilitating the assembly or stability of the rad51 nucleoprotein filament the cx3 complex acts downstream of rad51 recruitment to damage sites the cx3 complex was shown to associate with holliday junction resolvase activity probably in a role of stabilizing gene conversion tracts the rad51c gene is one of genes four localized to a region of chromosome 17q23 where amplification occurs frequently in breast tumors overexpression of the four genes

this contrasts with diagnostic endoscopy where the aim of the procedure is purely to visualize a part of the gastrointestinal respiratory or urinary tract in order to aid diagnosis in practice a procedure which starts as a diagnostic endoscopy may become a therapeutic endoscopy depending on the findings such as in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or the finding of polyps during colonoscopy a number of different techniques have been developed to allow treatment to be carried out endoscopically to treat disorders such as bleeding strictures and polyps endoscopic injection of bleeding peptic ulcers with adrenaline has been practised since the 1970s endoscopic heater probes have been used since the 1980s and argon plasma coagulation has been used since the 1990s more recently adrenaline injection tends to be combined with either heater probe coagulation or argon plasma coagulation to minimize the chance of an ulcer rebleeding the disadvantage of this treatment is a low risk of perforation of the gastric wall and a low risk of peritonitis combined therapy may work better than epinephrine alone however there is no evidence that one kind of treatment is more effective than the other injection sclerotherapy has been used to treat esophageal varices

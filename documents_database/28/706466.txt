it is a yellow solid the crystal structure of scs is closely related to that of sodium chloride in that it is based on a cubic close packed array of anions whereas nacl has all the octahedral interstices in the anion lattice occupied by cations scs has one third of them vacant the vacancies are ordered but in a very complicated pattern leading to a large orthorhombic unit cell belonging to the space group fddd metal sulfides are usually prepared by heating mixtures of the two elements but in the case of scandium this method yields scandium monosulfide scs scs can be prepared by heating scandium iii oxide under flowing hydrogen sulfide in a graphite crucible to 1550 c or above for 2 3 hours the crude product is then purified by chemical vapor transport at 950 c using iodine as the transport agent scandium iii sulfide can be prepared by reacting scandium iii chloride with dry hydrogen sulfide at elevated temperature above 1100 c scs loses sulfur forming nonstoichiometric compounds such as scs

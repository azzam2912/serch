despite consideration of hidden variables as a possible resolution of this contradiction some aspects of entangled quantum states have been demonstrated irreproducible by any local hidden variable theory bell s theorem is one such demonstration which has been verified by experiment experiments have generally favoured quantum mechanics as a description of nature over local hidden variable theories any physical theory that supersedes or replaces quantum theory must make similar experimental predictions and must therefore also be nonlocal in this sense quantum nonlocality is a property of the universe that is independent of our description of nature quantum nonlocality does not allow for faster than light communication and hence is compatible with special relativity however it prompts many of the foundational discussions concerning quantum theory in 1935 einstein podolsky and rosen published a thought experiment with which they hoped to expose the incompleteness of the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics in relation to the violation of local causality at the microscopic scale that it described afterwards einstein presented a variant of these ideas in a letter to erwin schr dinger which is the version that is presented here the state and notation used here are more modern and akin to bohm

they act as intermediate targets for long and complex axonal growths by creating short and easy pathways leading axon growth cones towards their target area in 1976 guideposts cells were identified in both grasshopper embryos and drosophilia single guidepost cells acting like stepping stones for the extension of ti1 pioneer growth cones to the cns were first discovered in grasshopper limb bud however guidepost cells can also act as a group there is a band of epithelial cells called floor plate cells present in the neural tube of drosophilia available for the binding of growing axons these studies have defined guidepost cells as non continuous landmarks located on future paths of growing axons by providing high affinity substrates to bind to for navigation guidepost cells are typically immature glial cells and neuron cells that have yet to grown an axon they can either be labeled as short range cells or axon dependent cells to qualify as a guidepost cell neurons hypothesized to be influenced by a guidance cell are examined during development to test the guidance cell in question neural axon growth and migration is first examined in the presence of the guidance cell then the guidance cell is destroyed

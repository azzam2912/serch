historically a bellwether seat between labour and the conservatives in the 2010 general election the seat became the closest three way marginal in the north of england with less than 1 000 votes between the labour and liberal democrat candidates in terms of 2nd and 3rd place although with a significant conservative majority for 1st place the seat s three way marginal status did not last as the labour vote increased significantly in both 2015 and 2017 while the liberal democrat vote collapsed dramatically over the same period despite this the conservatives retained the seat in both elections in line with national trends and as a result the seat has maintained its bellwether status

the theorem was developed by topologists samuel eilenberg and saunders maclane they discovered that when topologists were writing proofs to establish equivalence of various homology theories there were numerous similarities in the processes eilenberg and maclane then discovered the theorem to generalize this process it can be used to prove the eilenberg zilber theorem this leads to the idea of the model category let formula 1 be an arbitrary category and formula 2 be the category of chain complexes of formula 3 modules let formula 4 be covariant functors such that then the following assertions hold what is above is one of the earliest versions of the theorem another version is the one that says that if formula 27 is a complex of projectives in an abelian category and formula 28 is an acyclic complex in that category then any map formula 29 extends to a chain map formula 30 unique up to homotopy this specializes almost to the above theorem if one uses the functor category formula 31 as the abelian category free functors are projective objects in that category the morphisms in the functor category are natural transformations so the constructed chain maps and homotopies are all natural

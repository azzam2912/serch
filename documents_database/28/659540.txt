the hyperbolic distance function admits a simple expression in this model the hyperboloid model of the n dimensional hyperbolic space is closely related to the beltrami klein model and to the poincar disk model as they are projective models in the sense that the isometry group is a subgroup of the projective group if x x x is a vector in the dimensional coordinate space r the minkowski quadratic form is defined to be the vectors such that form an n dimensional hyperboloid s consisting of two connected components or sheets the forward or future sheet s where x 0 and the backward or past sheet s where x bilinear form b is the polarization of the minkowski quadratic form q explicitly the hyperbolic distance between two points u and v of s is given by the formula where is the inverse function of hyperbolic cosine a straight line in hyperbolic n space is modeled by a geodesic on the hyperboloid a geodesic on the hyperboloid is the non empty intersection of the hyperboloid with a two dimensional linear subspace including the origin of the n 1 dimensional minkowski space if we take u and v to be basis vectors

saturation divers typically breathe a helium oxygen mixture to prevent nitrogen narcosis in saturation diving the divers live in a pressurized environment which can be a saturation system on the surface or an ambient pressure underwater habitat when not in the water transfer to and from the pressurised surface living quarters to the equivalent depth is done in a closed pressurised diving bell this may be maintained for up to several weeks and they are decompressed to surface pressure only once at the end of their tour of duty by limiting the number of decompressions in this way the risk of decompression sickness is significantly reduced and the time spent decompressing is minimised it is a very specialized form of diving of the 3 300 commercial divers employed in the united states in 2015 only 336 were saturation divers on december 22 1938 edgar end and max nohl made the first intentional saturation dive by spending 27 hours breathing air at 101 feet sea water fsw 30 8 msw in the county emergency hospital recompression facility in milwaukee wisconsin their decompression lasted five hours leaving nohl with a mild case of decompression sickness that resolved with recompression albert r behnke

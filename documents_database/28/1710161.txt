it is present in transcription regulators of the luxr fixj family of response regulators the domain is named after vibrio fischeri luxr a transcriptional activator for quorum sensing control of luminescence luxr type hth domain proteins occur in a variety of organisms the dna binding hth domain is usually located in the c terminal region of the protein the n terminal region often containing an autoinducer binding domain or a response regulatory domain most luxr type regulators act as transcription activators but some can be repressors or have a dual role for different sites luxr type hth regulators control a wide variety of activities in various biological processes the luxr type dna binding hth domain forms a four helical bundle structure the hth motif comprises the second and third helices known as the scaffold and recognition helix respectively the hth binds dna in the major groove where the n terminal part of the recognition helix makes most of the dna contacts the fourth helix is involved in dimerisation of gere and trar signalling events by one of the four activation mechanisms described below lead to multimerisation of the regulator the regulators bind dna as multimers luxr type hth proteins can

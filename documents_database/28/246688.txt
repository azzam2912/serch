these cavities known collectively as the ventricular system consist of the left and right lateral ventricles the third ventricle and the fourth ventricle the fourth ventricle extends from the cerebral aqueduct aqueduct of sylvius to the obex and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid csf the fourth ventricle has a characteristic diamond shape in cross sections of the human brain it is located within the pons or in the upper part of the medulla oblongata csf entering the fourth ventricle through the cerebral aqueduct can exit to the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord through two lateral apertures and a single midline median aperture the fourth ventricle has a roof at its upper posterior surface and a floor at its lower anterior surface and side walls formed by the cerebellar peduncles nerve bundles joining the structure on the posterior side of the ventricle to the structures on the anterior side the caudal tip of the fourth ventricle where it becomes the spinal canal is known as the obex the obex is also a marker for the level of the foramen magnum of the skull and therefore is a marker for the imaginary dividing line between the medulla and spinal cord the

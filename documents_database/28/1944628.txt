its use in europe peaked in the middle of the 19th century the name strontian comes from the scottish village strontian where the source mineral strontianite strontium carbonate was first found strontium carbonate is a recycled coreactant in this process there are two types of strontium saccharide one at low temperature the strontium monosaccharide and the second at high temperature the strontium disaccharide molasses is the first stage output of several different sugar production processes and contains more than 50 sugar the french chemists hippolyte leplay and augustin pierre dubrunfaut developed a process for extracting sugar from molasses reacting them with barium oxide to give the insoluble barium saccharates in 1849 they expanded their patent to include strontium salts apparently this patent application had the only purpose to legally secure the so called baryte process since the strontian process from leplay and dubrunfaut probably wouldn t work as described only later through the works of carl scheibler was it possible to apply the strontian process in an industrial basis according to scheibler the procedure must be carried out at boiling temperatures the scheibler procedure came into use in the dessauer sugar refinery in dessau through emil fleischer in the region

it is used to increase the transfection efficiency of rna including mrna and sirna or plasmid dna into in vitro cell cultures by lipofection lipofectamine contains lipid subunits that can form liposomes in an aqueous environment which entrap the transfection payload e g dna plasmids lipofectamine consists of a cationic liposome formulation which complexes with negatively charged nucleic acid molecules to allow them to overcome the electrostatic repulsion of the cell membrane lipofectamine s cationic lipid molecules are formulated with a neutral co lipid helper lipid the dna containing liposomes positively charged on their surface can fuse with the negatively charged plasma membrane of living cells due to the neutral co lipid mediating fusion of the liposome with the cell membrane allowing nucleic acid cargo molecules to cross into the cytoplasm for replication or expression in order for a cell to express a transgene the nucleic acid must reach the nucleus of the cell to begin transcription however the transfected genetic material may never reach the nucleus in the first place instead being disrupted somewhere along the delivery process in dividing cells the material may reach the nucleus by being trapped in the reassembling nuclear envelope following mitosis but also

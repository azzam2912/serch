generally abbreviated cod this diene is a useful precursor to other organic compounds and serves as a ligand in organometallic chemistry it is a colorless liquid with a strong odor 1 5 cyclooctadiene can be prepared by dimerization of butadiene in the presence of a nickel catalyst a coproduct being vinylcyclohexene approximately 10 000 tons were produced in 2005 cod reacts with borane to give 9 borabicyclo 3 3 1 nonane commonly known as 9 bbn a reagent in organic chemistry used in hydroborations cod adds scl or similar reagents to give 2 6 dichloro 9 thiabicyclo 3 3 1 nonane the resulting dichloride can be further modified as the diazide or dicyano derivative in a nucleophilic substitution aided by anchimeric assistance 1 5 cod binds to low valent metals via both alkene groups metal cod complexes are attractive because they are sufficiently stable to be isolated often being more robust than related ethylene complexes the stability of cod complexes is attributable to the chelate effect the cod ligands are easily displaced by other ligands such as phosphines ni cod is prepared by reduction of anhydrous nickel acetylacetonate in the presence of the ligand using triethylaluminium the related pt cod

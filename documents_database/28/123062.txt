let formula 4 be a linear transformation then where one can refine this theorem via the splitting lemma to be a statement about an isomorphism of spaces not just dimensions since formula 8 matrices immediately come to mind when discussing linear maps in the case of an formula 9 matrix the dimension of the domain is formula 10 the number of columns in the matrix thus the rank nullity theorem for a given matrix formula 11 immediately becomes here we provide two proofs the first operates in the general case using linear maps the second proof looks at the homogeneous system formula 13 for formula 14 with rank formula 15 and shows explicitly that there exists a set of formula 16 linearly independent solutions that span the kernel of formula 17 while the theorem requires that the domain of the linear map be finite dimensional there is no such assumption on the codomain this means that there are linear maps not given by matrices for which the theorem applies despite this the first proof is not actually more general than the second since the image of the linear map is finite dimensional we can represent the map from its domain

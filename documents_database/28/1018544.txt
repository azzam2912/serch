reporter neil offen was hired by bouton to research the material and he and bouton made the selections themselves bouton s candor in crediting offen is much like his style of writing in ball four the book is also unusual in how it lampoons the publishing industry bouton writes that the book existed solely because playboy press thought that a baseball book with bouton s name on it would sell enough to make a tidy profit bouton turned the tables on the publishers when he demanded complete control of the project and demanded that he alone would hire a researcher and then he met offen at bloomingdale s while shopping for clothes bouton was well aware of offen s talents plus he knew that offen had just recently been fired so would work hard on the project in creating the book bouton and offen agreed that they would select stories that met their personal tastes not just vapid pieces glorifying their subjects bouton even apologizes to the late new york yankees manager miller huggins because they found no interesting stories written about him so he was not included in the book also bouton wrote introductions to each selection as well

but unlike the cylinder both hypersurfaces of a regular duocylinder are congruent its dual is a duospindle constructed from two circles one at the xy plane and the other in the zw plane the duocylinder is bounded by two mutually perpendicular 3 manifolds with torus like surfaces respectively described by the formulae and the duocylinder is so called because these two bounding 3 manifolds may be thought of as 3 dimensional cylinders bent around in 4 dimensional space such that they form closed loops in the xy and zw planes the duocylinder has rotational symmetry in both of these planes a regular duocylinder consists of two congruent cells one square flat torus face the ridge zero edges and zero vertices the ridge of the duocylinder is the 2 manifold that is the boundary between the two bounding solid torus cells it is in the shape of a clifford torus which is the cartesian product of two circles intuitively it may be constructed as follows roll a 2 dimensional rectangle into a cylinder so that its top and bottom edges meet then roll the cylinder in the plane perpendicular to the 3 dimensional hyperplane that the cylinder lies in so that

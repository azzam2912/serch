it is endemic to new zealand the larvae feed on coprosma grandiflora coprosma lucida coprosma retusa coprosma robusta and coprosma tenuifolia they mine the leaves of their host plant the larva mines directly into the leaf through the bottom of the egg the mine starts as a long slender slightly tortuous gradually widening gallery the first part being on the under surface of the leaf close against the cuticle showing up white and silvery by reflected light the remainder of the mine however is on the upper surface in the last stage the gallery expands more or less abruptly into a large irregular blotch it usually follows the midrib or margin of the leaf along its greater extent sometimes being deflected by the coarser veins in this manner its course may be slightly tortuous but rarely markedly so the midrib forms an impassable barrier except at its upper end the colour of the mine is conspicuously white or light green sometimes discoloured a bright reddish brown but patchy in character that part of the leaf covering the blotch is in fleshy leaves more or less mottled in shades of green according to the closeness of the mine to the outer

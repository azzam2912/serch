although the engine suffered from technical problems it was later used to set a speed record for piston powered seaplanes that still stands today the italian 1931 schneider trophy entrant the macchi m c 72 required an engine of 2 300 horsepower 1 700 kw with the capability of producing up to 2 800 horsepower 2 090 kw while having a weight of not more than 840 kilograms 1 850 lb the contract was awarded to fiat but as their most powerful v engine to that date was the 1 000 horsepower 750 kw 12 cylinder fiat as 5 that had also been used for schneider trophy racing the company faced a difficult challenge the novel solution was to couple two as 5 v12 engines in tandem to produce a v 24 with each engine independently driving one of a pair of contra rotating propellers through co axial shafts except for sharing a common mechanical supercharger the unit was more a tandem v12 than a true v24 which would require all cylinders to power a single crankshaft rather than dual crankshafts rotating in opposite directions with independent crank and driveshafts or at least to have both cranks geared together to

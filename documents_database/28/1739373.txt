he attended dongrae high school graduating in the class of 1979 kim then graduated in 1983 and obtained his ms degree from seoul national university he received his ph d from the university of pennsylvania in 1989 kim s ph d thesis was supervised by alfred k mann and resulted in real time and directional measurement of solar neutrinos in the kamiokande ii detector and search for short time variation kim was a postdoctoral fellow and a research investigator at the university of michigan before moving to boston university in 1996 he took up his current position at seoul national university in 1998 he jointly led the efforts of discovering the top quark in 1994 and measuring its mass in 1995 using the fermilab tevatron hadron collider as a member of the cdf collaboration the top quark was the heaviest fundamental fermion yet to be observed before the experiment the observation and mass measurement of the particle opened a new field of top quark physics kim received his ph d degree in 1989 based on the successful measurement of solar neutrinos using the kamiokande ii detector which confirmed the existence of the solar neutrino problem he participated in the historical

it is similar to the method of undetermined coefficients but instead of guessing the particular solution in the method of undetermined coefficients the particular solution is determined systematically in this technique the phrase undetermined coefficients can also be used to refer to the step in the annihilator method in which the coefficients are calculated the annihilator method is used as follows given the ode formula 1 find another differential operator formula 2 such that formula 3 this operator is called the annihilator thus giving the method its name applying formula 2 to both sides of the ode gives a homogeneous ode formula 5 for which we find a solution basis formula 6 as before then the original inhomogeneous ode is used to construct a system of equations restricting the coefficients of the linear combination to satisfy the ode this method is not as general as variation of parameters in the sense that an annihilator does not always exist if formula 7 consists of the sum of the expressions given in the table the annihilator is the product of the corresponding annihilators given formula 8 formula 9 the simplest annihilator of formula 10 is formula 11 the zeros of formula 12

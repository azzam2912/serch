they occur in both freshwater and seawater have cylindrical bodies and typically have a large bell shaped anterior sucker with which they cling to their host some of the leeches in this family have external gills outgrowths of the body wall projecting laterally the only group of leeches to exchange gases in this way worldwide there are around sixty genera and one hundred species of leech in this family all parasitic on the blood of marine estuarine and freshwater fishes these leeches are less common in the tropics and are more abundant in temperate and polar waters historically piscicolidae has been divided into three subfamilies pontobdellinae characterised by two pairs of pulsatile vesicles on each urosome segment pontobdellinae characterised by a single pair of pulsatile vesicles on each urosome segment and platybdellinae with no pulsatile vesicles however molecular phylogenetic analyses performed by williams and burreson in 2006 does not support these subdivisions piscicolidae was confirmed as being monophyletic but platybdellinae was shown to be polyphyletic with four distinct clades piscicolinae was similarly polyphyletic again with four distinct clades and pontobdellinae was paraphyletic with respect to the genus oxytonostoma the piscicolidae are parasitic on the blood of fishes some species are

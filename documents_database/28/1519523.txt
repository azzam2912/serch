a sensor attached to the reel seat measures your rod speed and a palm pilot or palm cell phone then records the casting signature a palm application immediately analyzes the casting signature by breaking it down into its major parts by systematically measuring and analyzing fly rod motions that cannot easily be resolved by eye the fly casting analyzer provides new capabilities for teaching and learning fly casting the analyzer measures the most important part of a fly cast rod rotation which is the rod angle change during casting this is the only motion that is necessary to make a fly cast how the rod rotates acceleration speed deceleration largely determine the quality of a cast if this motion isn t done well an efficient effective cast cannot be made a small rate gyro is enclosed in a capsule that is attached to the fly rod rate gyros measure angular rotation the signal from the rate gyro is transferred via cable to a small data collection box that is held or clipped to the caster or instructor a palm pilot is attached to the box and data collected in transferred to the palm via infrared beaming the proprietary software installed

the epithet contorta is in regard to the twisted branches of the thallus niebla contorta is recognized by the thallus divided into relatively short tubular prismatic branches usually less than 3 5 cm high that arise from a central basal attachment area the branches often dilated or irregularly widened and compressed towards apex occasionally dividing or often with short secondary twisted branches short wavy undulate along margins especially the upper parts of branches or lobes black dot like pycnidia are common along the margins and cortical ridges of the upper parts of branches the cortical surface is recessed between the ridges the recessed area of the cortex appears to be related to the relatively thinner cortex usually 45 75 m thick in contrast to that of niebla eburnea a similar species that has turgid to slightly inflated branches with a mostly smooth cortex 65 150 m thick lichen substances are divaricatic acid with unidentified accessory triterpenes and pigments that blackened the basal area of the thallus other similar species are niebla caespitosa distinguished by the more flattened branches with jagged margins n undulata distinguished by its larger size and n dilatata that differs by its larger size and more rounded

this system is separate from but similar to the system designed by the pennsylvania railroad which is now operated by amtrak septa s trains can run over either system because the voltage and frequency presented to the locomotive are essentially identical however the ex reading system is not electrically connected to the ex prr system septa owns all of the substations described herein although septa also owns former prr substations along the media elwyn line and the chestnut hill west line as well as a new substation just north of 30th street station those facilities are electrically part of amtrak s 25 hz traction power system the reading railroad electrified its lines between reading terminal in philadelphia pennsylvania and norristown doylestown chestnut hill hatboro and west trenton in 1931 the electrification was extended to include the fox chase line in september 1966 electrification was again extended from hatboro to warminster in the early 1970s the reading s system used catenary electrified at like the competing pennsylvania railroad s 1915 initial electrification and 1930s mainline expansion unlike the prr s system which included multiple power sources and an extensive high voltage transmission network the reading s electrification was supplied solely by

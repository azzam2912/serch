in this phase the amphiphile molecules are aggregated into cylindrical structures of indefinite length and these cylindrical aggregates are disposed on a hexagonal lattice giving the phase long range orientational order in normal topology hexagonal phases which are formed by type i amphiphiles the hydrocarbon chains are contained within the cylindrical aggregates such that the polar apolar interface has a positive mean curvature inverse topology hexagonal phases have water within the cylindrical aggregates and the hydrocarbon chains fill the voids between the hexagonally packed cylinders normal topology hexagonal phases are denoted by h while inverse topology hexagonal phases are denoted by h when viewed by polarization microscopy thin films of both normal and inverse topology hexagonal phases exhibit birefringence giving rise to characteristic optical textures typically these textures are smoke like fan like or mosaic in appearance the phases are highly viscous and small air bubbles trapped within the preparation have highly distorted shapes size and shapes of lamellar micellar and hexagonal phases of lipid bilayer phase behavior and mixed lipid polymorphism in aqueous dispersions can be easily identified and characterized by negative staining transmission electron microscopy too

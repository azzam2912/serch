until 2014 the phenomenon was only known to occur in the arid grasslands of the namib desert in western parts of southern africa being particularly common in namibia in that year ecologists were alerted to similar rings of vegetation outside of africa in a part of the pilbara in western australia fairy circles typically occur in essentially monospecific grassy vegetation where conditions are particularly arid associated grasses commonly are species in the genus stipagrostis studies show that these circles pass through a life cycle of some 30 to 60 years they become noticeable at a diameter of about achieving a peak diameter of perhaps after which they mature and die as they undergo invasion mainly by grasses like the heuweltjies and mima mounds the cause of fairy circles has long been a puzzle and the investigation has proved challenging one favoured theory is that the distinct vegetation patterns are a population level consequence of competition for scarce water as the plants organise themselves to maximise access to scarce resources the circular barren patches capture water which then flows to the outer edges of the ring more water available increases biomass and roots which leads to the soil becoming looser the

it is claimed that troops equipped with the tvas are more effective than traditional whip antenna equipped troops due to better concealment of the equipment and mobility improvement to the operator tvas was developed by wearable antenna technologies inc in early 2008 the tactical vest antenna system is designed to be concealed within small arms protective insert pouches found on contemporary body armor such as interceptor body armor modular tactical vest full spectrum battle equipment and virtually any other type of body armor that utilizes sapi or esapi plates the radiating elements placement is barely noticeable due to their thinness approximately and their curved shape that lies flush against the shape of esapi plates hiding away the radiating elements brings more mobility to the operator when compared to whip antennas traditionally used military tvas is compatible with mbitr prc 152 and other common radios used by the u s military if power is increased over 7 watts there could be safety issues with temperature increase however at the operating frequencies of the antenna ionizing radiation is not a factor additionally the antenna is intended to be placed on the outside of sapi plates providing a significant barrier between the radiating

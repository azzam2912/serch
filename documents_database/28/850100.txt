it is usually experienced by islands and coastal areas 10 to 20 north and south of the equator there are two main seasons in a tropical marine climate the wet season and the dry season the annual rainfall is 1000 to over 1500 mm 39 to 59 inches the temperature ranges from 20 c to 35 c 68 to 95 f the trade winds blow all year round and are moist as they pass over warm seas these climatic conditions are found for example across the caribbean the eastern coasts of brazil madagascar and queensland and many islands in tropical waters during the dry season there is less rainfall than in the wet season but there is little variation in temperature between the two seasons tropical marine regions are influenced by anticyclones during the dry season and tropical waves during the wet season the ecosystems of the tropical marine climate have to adapt to the dry season plants during the dry season must conserve water moisture however the extent of the adaptation depends much on the annual rainfall hygrophytic ecosystems occur when there is a short dry period with a few rain showers the soil in this ecosystem holds adequate

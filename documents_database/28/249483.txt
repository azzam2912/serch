it has the distinction of being the first jet lift aircraft to fly anywhere in the world the design of the tmr is unique it was powered by a pair of nene turbojet engines which were mounted back to back horizontally within a steel framework in turn this framework was raised upon four legs fitted with castors for wheels the tmr lacked any lifting surfaces such as wings instead lift was generated purely by the thrust generated by the nene engines being directed downwards against the ground due to its unconventional appearance it was understandably nicknamed the flying bedstead the tmr had been envisioned specifically for conducting research specifically to explore the potential applications of then newly developed jet propulsion towards carrying out vertical flights first flying in august 1954 extensive studies were conducted during a series of test flights into how stabilisation could be performed during the aircraft s hover it contributed to a greater understanding of the level of power and appropriate manners of stabilisation involved in a vtol aircraft as well as proving the feasibility of the concept in general the man largely responsible for the development of the tmr was dr alan arnold griffith who had

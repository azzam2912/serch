no is an important cellular signaling molecule it helps modulate vascular tone insulin secretion airway tone and peristalsis and is involved in angiogenesis and neural development it may function as a retrograde neurotransmitter nitric oxide is mediated in mammals by the calcium calmodulin controlled isoenzymes enos endothelial nos and nnos neuronal nos the inducible isoform inos involved in immune response binds calmodulin at physiologically relevant concentrations and produces no as an immune defense mechanism as no is a free radical with an unpaired electron it is the proximate cause of septic shock and may function in autoimmune disease nos catalyzes the reaction nos isoforms catalyze other leak and side reactions such as superoxide production at the expense of nadph as such this stoichiometry is not generally observed and reflects the three electrons supplied per no by nadph noss are unusual in that they require five cofactors eukaryotic nos isozymes are catalytically self sufficient the electron flow in the no synthase reaction is nadph fad fmn heme o tetrahydrobiopterin provides an additional electron during the catalytic cycle which is replaced during turnover nos is the only known enzyme that binds flavin adenine dinucleotide fad flavin mononucleotide fmn heme tetrahydrobiopterin bh and

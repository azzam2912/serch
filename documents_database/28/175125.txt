they include diverse potentials such as receptor potentials electrotonic potentials subthreshold membrane potential oscillations slow wave potential pacemaker potentials and synaptic potentials which scale with the magnitude of the stimulus they arise from the summation of the individual actions of ligand gated ion chanace they do not typically involve voltage gated ion channel voltage gated voltage gated sodium channel sodium and voltage gated potassium channel potassium channels these impulses are incremental and may be excitatory or inhibitory they occur at the chemical synapse postsynaptic dendrite in response to presynaptic neuron action potential firing and release of neurotransmitter or may occur in skeletal muscle skeletal smooth muscle smooth or cardiac muscle in response to peripheral nervous system nerve input the magnitude of a graded potential is determined by the strength of the stimulus graded potentials that make the membrane potential less negative or more positive thus making the postsynaptic cell more likely to have an action potential are called excitatory postsynaptic potential s epsps depolarization depolarizing local potentials sum together and if the voltage reaches the threshold potential an action potential occurs in that cell epsps are caused by the influx of na or ca from the extracellular space into the

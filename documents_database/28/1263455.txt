the phenomenon was first described by bergman and stockman in 2003 the word spaser is an acronym for surface plasmon amplification by stimulated emission of radiation the first such devices were announced in 2009 by three groups a 44 nanometer diameter nanoparticle with a gold core surrounded by a dyed silica gain medium created by researchers from purdue norfolk state and cornell universities a nanowire on a silver screen by a berkeley group and a semiconductor layer of 90 nm surrounded by silver pumped electrically by groups at technical university of eindhoven and at arizona state university while the purdue norfolk state cornell team demonstrated the confined plasmonic mode the berkeley team and the eindhoven arizona state team demonstrated lasing in the so called plasmonic gap mode the spaser is a proposed nanoscale source of optical fields that is being investigated in a number of leading laboratories around the world spasers could find a wide range of applications including nanoscale lithography fabrication of ultra fast photonic nano circuits single molecule biochemical sensing and microscopy from nature photonics study of the quantum mechanical model of the spaser suggests that it should be possible to manufacture a spasing device analogous in function

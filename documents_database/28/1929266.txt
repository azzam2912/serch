however it is not opposite in the sense that the bond becomes stronger but in the sense that the molecule enters a state that is diametrically opposite to the bond softened state such states require laser pulses of high intensity in the range of 10 10 w cm and they disappear once the pulse is gone bond hardening and bond softening share the same theoretical basis which is described under the latter entry briefly the ground and the first excited energy curves of the h ion are dressed in photons the laser field perturbs the curves and turns their crossings into anticrossings bond softening occurs on the lower branches of the anticrossings and bond hardening happens if the molecule is excited to the upper branches see fig 1 to trap the molecule in the bond hardened state the anticrossing gap cannot be too small or too large if it is too small the system can undergo a diabatic transition to the lower branch of the anticrossing and dissociate via bond softening if the gap is too large the upper branch becomes shallow or even repulsive and the system can also dissociate this means that bound bond hardened states can exist

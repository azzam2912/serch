these models enable researchers to study the onset progression of the disease and understand in depth the molecular events that contribute to the development and spread of colorectal cancer they also provide a valuable biological system to simulate human physiological conditions suitable for testing therapeutics familial adenomatous polyposis fap is a hereditary disease that is characterized with development of numerous colon polyps a genetic analysis of some fap kindreds revealed that a common feature of the disease is a deletion of the apc gene further analysis of the apc gene revealed the existence of various mutations in cancer sufferers that also play a role in the onset of the sporadic form of colorectal cancer the first mouse mutant in the apc gene came from a colony of randomly mutagenized mice this mouse model is called min multiple intestinal neoplasia mouse it was found to carry a truncation mutation at codon 850 of the apc gene the min mouse can develop up to 100 polyps in the small intestine in addition to colon tumors later new knock out mutants of the apc gene were engineered a truncating mutation at codon 716 apc results in a mouse that develops more than 300

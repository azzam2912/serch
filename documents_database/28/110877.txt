it is believed that the rate of star formation during this period of galactic evolution will determine whether a galaxy is a spiral or elliptical galaxy a slower star formation tends to produce a spiral galaxy the smaller clumps of gas in a protogalaxy form into stars the term protogalaxy itself is generally accepted to mean progenitors of the present day normal galaxies in the early stages of formation however the early stages of formation is not a clearly defined phrase it could be defined as the first major burst of star formation in a progenitor of a present day elliptical galaxy the peak merging epoch of dark halos of the fragments which assemble to produce an average galaxy today a still gaseous body before any star formation has taken place or an over dense region of dark matter in the very early universe destined to become gravitationally bound and to collapse it is thought that the early universe began with a nearly uniform distribution each particle an equal distance from the next of matter and dark matter the dark matter then began to clump together under gravitational attraction due to the initial density perturbation spectrum caused by quantum fluctuations

it was formed approximately 360 million years ago as a shallow saucer shaped crater in diameter and about 150 m deep a large central hill highly deformed rim strata and a breccia lens in thickness were produced during formation over 2 km of flat lying middle and upper paleozoic limestone and dolomite were brecciated and mixed to a depth of and at least half of the breccia was ejected from the crater the remaining breccia contains fragments ranging in size from small grains to megabreccia blocks in length undisturbed strata lie 100 m below the original crater floor in the middle of the crater a sequence of steeply dipping folded faulted and brecciated middle ordovician limestone and dolomite has been uplifted to form a large central hill knox strata in the central uplift are raised above their normal position and locally contain shatter cones in the rim surrounding the crater ordovician limestone has been uplifted and is moderately to tightly folded into doubly plunging anticlines and synclines that have axes concentric to the crater walls in parts of the rim folds have resulted in radial shortening as great as 35 faulting is common in the rim strata and is usually

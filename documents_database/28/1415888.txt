the process heats oil shale in a sealed horizontal segmented vessel retort causing its decomposition into shale oil oil shale gas and spent residue the particularities of this process is a recovery of saline minerals from the oil shale and a doughnut shape of the retort the process is suitable for processing of mineral rich oil shales such as in the piceance basin it has a relatively high reliability and high oil yield the technology was developed by the american oil company superior oil the multimineral process was developed by superior oil company now part of exxonmobil for processing of the piceance basin s oil shale the technology tests were carried out in pilot plants in cleveland ohio in the 1970s superior oil planned a commercial size demonstration plant in the northern piceance basin area with a capacity of of shale oil per day however because of low crude oil price these plans were never implemented the process was developed to combine the shale oil production with production of sodium bicarbonate sodium carbonate and aluminum from nahcolite and dawsonite occurring in oil shales of the piceance basin in this process the nahcolite is recovered from the raw oil shale by

the protoconch contains more than one smooth whorl the whorls of the teleoconch are strongly rounded the sinus falls at the summit where the whorls are somewhat contracted the surface of the whorls of the teleoconch are marked with strong rounded protracted axial ribs which begin practically anterior to the sinus and extend strongly to the periphery they are scarcely defined anterior to this on the body whorl of these ribs 10 occur upon the first to fourth 12 upon the fifth to seventh and 14 upon the penultimate whorl the axial ribs are about as wide as the spaces that separate them in addition to these axial ribs the whorls are marked by numerous slender spiral threads of which about 5 occur in the area of the sinus on the last three turns these are finer than those that cover the rest of the turn between the sutures of the latter three occur on the first to third four on the fourth seven on the fifth and sixth eleven on the next and thirteen on the last turn the spaces between the spiral threads about equal the spiral threads in strength the surface between the spiral threads is covered

it does so using molecular oxygen o as well as iron fe and tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactors dopa is a precursor for dopamine which in turn is a precursor for the important neurotransmitters norepinephrine noradrenaline and epinephrine adrenaline tyrosine hydroxylase catalyzes the rate limiting step in this synthesis of catecholamines in humans tyrosine hydroxylase is encoded by the th gene and the enzyme is present in the central nervous system cns peripheral sympathetic neurons and the adrenal medulla tyrosine hydroxylase phenylalanine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase together make up the family of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases aaahs tyrosine hydroxylase catalyzes the reaction in which tyrosine is hydroxylated in the meta position to obtain 3 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine dopa the enzyme is an oxygenase which means it uses molecular oxygen to hydroxylate its substrates one of the oxygen atoms in o is used to hydroxylate the tyrosine molecule to obtain dopa and the other one is used to hydroxylate the cofactor like the other aromatic amino acid hydroxylases aaahs tyrosine hydroxylase use the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin bh under normal conditions although other similar molecules may also work as a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase the aaahs converts the cofactor 5 6 7 8 tetrahydrobiopterin bh into

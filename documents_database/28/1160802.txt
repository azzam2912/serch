historians of science such as peter j bowler have used the same phrase as a label for the period within the history of evolutionary thought from the 1880s to around 1920 when alternatives to natural selection were developed and explored as many biologists considered natural selection to have been a wrong guess on charles darwin s part or at least as of relatively minor importance an alternative term the interphase of darwinism has been proposed to avoid the largely incorrect implication that the putative eclipse was preceded by a period of vigorous darwinian research while there had been multiple explanations of evolution including vitalism catastrophism and structuralism through the 19th century four major alternatives to natural selection were in play at the turn of the 20th century theistic evolution largely disappeared from the scientific literature by the end of the 19th century as direct appeals to supernatural causes came to be seen as unscientific the other alternatives had significant followings well into the 20th century mainstream biology largely abandoned them only when developments in genetics made them seem increasingly untenable and when the development of population genetics and the modern synthesis demonstrated the explanatory power of natural selection ernst mayr

for example a top down cascade will occur if predators are effective enough in predation to reduce the abundance or alter the behavior of their prey thereby releasing the next lower trophic level from predation or herbivory if the intermediate trophic level is a herbivore the trophic cascade is an ecological concept which has stimulated new research in many areas of ecology for example it can be important for understanding the knock on effects of removing top predators from food webs as humans have done in many places through hunting and fishing a top down cascade is a trophic cascade where the top consumer predator controls the primary consumer population in turn the primary producer population thrives the removal of the top predator can alter the food web dynamics in this case the primary consumers would overpopulate and exploit the primary producers eventually there would not be enough primary producers to sustain the consumer population top down food web stability depends on competition and predation in the higher trophic levels invasive species can also alter this cascade by removing or becoming a top predator this interaction may not always be negative studies have shown that certain invasive species have begun

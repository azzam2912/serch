the project is being developed in three phases with the first phase completed mid 2013 the development is an open pit mining operation which will be developed in three stages at the first stage it will produce approximately with later expansions to more than it uses a froth treatment technology producing blended bitumen which will be transported to the edmonton area by enbridge s pipeline system diluent would be provided from edmonton through the inter pipeline owned long diameter pipeline supplying the athabasca oil sands project the kearl oil sands facilities would be connected with this pipeline by a long new branch at the first stage the development would involve capital spending of about c 8 billion with the final estimate being highly dependent on the final upgrading option selected an engineering procurement and construction management contract for the first phase was awarded to amec while fluor corp is responsible for the development of infrastructure and facilities when exxonmobil proposed the kearl project in 1997 estimated recoverable bitumen resources were 1 2 to later revisions place the actual established reserves at over energy resources conservation board 2010 the development is located on the following oil sands leases imperial oil resources

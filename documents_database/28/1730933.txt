the cofree coalgebra of any vector space over a field exists though it is more complicated than one might expect by analogy with the free algebra if v is a vector space over a field f then the cofree coalgebra c v of v is a coalgebra together with a linear map c v v such that any linear map from a coalgebra x to v factors through a coalgebra homomorphism from x to c v in other words the functor c is right adjoint to the forgetful functor from coalgebras to vector spaces the cofree coalgebra of a vector space always exists and is unique up to canonical isomorphism cofree cocommutative coalgebras are defined in a similar way and can be constructed as the largest cocommutative coalgebra in the cofree coalgebra c v may be constructed as a completion of the tensor coalgebra t v of v for k n 0 1 2 let t v denote the k fold tensor power of v with t v f and t v v then t v is the direct sum of all t v in addition to the graded algebra structure given by the tensor product isomorphisms t v t

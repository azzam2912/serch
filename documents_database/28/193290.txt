it is typically formed when two glaciers erode parallel u shaped valleys ar tes can also form when two glacial cirques erode headwards towards one another although frequently this results in a saddle shaped pass called a col the edge is then sharpened by freeze thaw weathering and the slope on either side of the arete steepened through mass wasting events and the erosion of exposed unstable rock the word ar te is actually french for edge or ridge similar features in the alps are described with the german equivalent term grat where three or more cirques meet a pyramidal peak is created a cleaver is a type of ar te that separates a unified flow of glacial ice from its uphill side into two glaciers flanking and flowing parallel to the ridge cleaver gets its name from the way it resembles a meat cleaver slicing meat into two parts a cleaver may be thought of as analogous to an island in a river a common situation has the two flanking glaciers melting to their respective ends before their courses can bring them back together the exceedingly rare analogy is a situation of the two branches of a river drying

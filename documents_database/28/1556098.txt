the term was coined by john horton conway for product prism the dimension of the space of a proprism equals the sum of the dimensions of all its product elements proprisms are often seen as k face elements of uniform polytopes the number of vertices in a proprism is equal to the product of the number of vertices in all the polytopes in the product the minimum symmetry order of a proprism is the product of the symmetry orders of all the polytopes a higher symmetry order is possible if polytopes in the product are identical a proprism is convex if all its product polytopes are convex in geometry of 4 dimensions or higher duoprism is a polytope resulting from the cartesian product of two polytopes each of two dimensions or higher the cartesian product of an a polytope a b polytope is an a b polytope where a and b are 2 polytopes polygon or higher most commonly this refers to the product of two polygons in 4 dimensions in the context of a product of polygons henry p manning s 1910 work explaining the fourth dimension called these double prisms the cartesian product of two polygons is the

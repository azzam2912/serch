that is using the notations of modular arithmetic the factorial formula 1 satisfies exactly when n is a prime number in other words any number n is a prime number if and only if n 1 1 is divisible by n this theorem was stated by ibn al haytham c 1000 ad and in the 18th century by john wilson edward waring announced the theorem in 1770 although neither he nor his student wilson could prove it lagrange gave the first proof in 1771 there is evidence that leibniz was also aware of the result a century earlier but he never published it for each of the values of n from 2 to 30 the following table shows the number n 1 and the remainder when n 1 is divided by n in the notation of modular arithmetic the remainder when m is divided by n is written m mod n the background color is blue for prime values of n gold for composite values a number formula 3 is either a prime or a composite that formula 4 shall be proven to be true if n were a prime and false if n were a composite the false case

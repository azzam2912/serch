some authors use this as the definition of a torsion element but this definition does not work well over more general rings a module m over a ring r is called a torsion module if all its elements are torsion elements and torsion free if zero is the only torsion element if the ring r is an integral domain then the set of all torsion elements forms a submodule of m called the torsion submodule of m sometimes denoted t m if r is not commutative t m may or may not be a submodule it is shown in that r is a right ore ring if and only if t m is a submodule of m for all right r modules since right noetherian domains are ore this covers the case when r is a right noetherian domain which might not be commutative more generally let m be a module over a ring r and s be a multiplicatively closed subset of r an element m of m is called an s torsion element if there exists an element s in s such that s annihilates m i e in particular one can take for s the set of

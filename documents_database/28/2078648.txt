power dissipation of a gate occurs in two ways static power dissipation and dynamic power dissipation glitch power comes under dynamic dissipation in the circuit and is directly proportional to switching activity glitch power dissipation is 20 70 of total power dissipation and hence glitching should be eliminated for low power design switching activity occurs due to signal transitions which are of two types functional transition and a glitch switching power dissipation is directly proportional to the switching activity load capacitance c supply voltage v and clock frequency f as switching activity means transition to different levels glitches are dependent on signal transitions and more glitches results in higher power dissipation as per above equation switching power dissipation can be controlled by controlling switching activity voltage scaling etc as discussed more transition results in more glitches and hence more power dissipation to minimize glitch occurrence switching activity should be minimized for example gray code could be used in counters instead of binary code since every increment in gray code only flips one bit gate freezing minimizes power dissipation by eliminating glitching it relies on the availability of modified standard library cells such as the so called f gate this method

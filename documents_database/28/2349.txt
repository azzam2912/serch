the bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions as in ionic bonds or through the sharing of electrons as in covalent bonds the strength of chemical bonds varies considerably there are strong bonds or primary bonds such as covalent ionic and metallic bonds and weak bonds or secondary bonds such as dipole dipole interactions the london dispersion force and hydrogen bonding since opposite charges attract via a simple electromagnetic force the negatively charged electrons that are orbiting the nucleus and the positively charged protons in the nucleus attract each other an electron positioned between two nuclei will be attracted to both of them and the nuclei will be attracted toward electrons in this position this attraction constitutes the chemical bond due to the matter wave nature of electrons and their smaller mass they must occupy a much larger amount of volume compared with the nuclei and this volume occupied by the electrons keeps the atomic nuclei in a bond relatively far apart as compared with the size of the nuclei themselves in general strong chemical bonding is associated with the sharing or transfer of electrons between the participating atoms the atoms in molecules crystals

this projection can be either an axon or a dendrite the term is frequently used when speaking of immature or developing neurons especially of cells in culture because it can be difficult to tell axons from dendrites before differentiation is complete the development of a neurite requires a complex interplay of both extracellular and intracellular signals at every given point along a developing neurite there are receptors detecting both positive and negative growth cues from every direction in the surrounding space the developing neurite sums together all of these growth signals in order to determine which direction the neurite will ultimately grow towards while not all of the growth signals are known several have been identified and characterized among the known extracellular growth signals are netrin a midline chemoattractant and semaphorin ephrin and collapsin all inhibitors of neurite growth young neurites are often packed with microtubule bundles the growth of which is stimulated by neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor ngf tau proteins can aid in the stabilization of microtubules by binding to the microtubules protecting them from microtubule serving proteins even after the microtubules have stabilized the cytoskeleton of the neuron remains dynamic actin filaments retain their dynamic

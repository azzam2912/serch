the main purpose of memory protection is to prevent a process from accessing memory that has not been allocated to it this prevents a bug or malware within a process from affecting other processes or the operating system itself protection may encompass all accesses to a specified area of memory write accesses or attempts to execute the contents of the area an attempt to access unowned memory results in a hardware fault called a segmentation fault or storage violation exception generally causing abnormal termination of the offending process memory protection for computer security includes additional techniques such as address space layout randomization and executable space protection segmentation refers to dividing a computer s memory into segments a reference to a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an offset within that segment the x86 architecture has multiple segmentation features which are helpful for using protected memory on this architecture on the x86 architecture the global descriptor table and local descriptor tables can be used to reference segments in the computer s memory pointers to memory segments on x86 processors can also be stored in the processor s segment registers initially x86 processors had 4 segment registers cs

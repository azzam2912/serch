examples include peroxides superoxide hydroxyl radical singlet oxygen and alpha oxygen the reduction of molecular oxygen o produces superoxide which is the precursor of most other reactive oxygen species dismutation of superoxide produces hydrogen peroxide ho hydrogen peroxide in turn may be partially reduced to hydroxyl radical oh or fully reduced to water in a biological context ros are formed as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signaling and homeostasis however during times of environmental stress e g uv or heat exposure ros levels can increase dramatically this may result in significant damage to cell structures cumulatively this is known as oxidative stress the production of ros is strongly influenced by stress factor responses in plants these factors that increase ros production include drought salinity chilling nutrient deficiency metal toxicity and uv b radiation ros are also generated by exogenous sources such as ionizing radiation ros are produced during a variety of biochemical reactions within the cell and within organelles such as mitochondria peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria convert energy for the cell into a usable form adenosine triphosphate atp the process of atp production in the mitochondria called oxidative phosphorylation

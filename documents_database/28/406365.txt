from greek the word can be broken up into three parts nano meaning dwarf lith meaning stone and graphy meaning to write or tiny writing onto stone today the word has evolved to cover the design of structures in the range of 10 to 10 meters or structures in the nanometer range essentially field is a derivative of lithography only covering significantly smaller structures all nanolithographic techniques can be separated into two categories those that etch away molecules leaving behind the desired structure and those that directly write the desired structure to a surface similar to the way a 3d printer creates a structure the field of nanolithography was born out of the need to increase the number of transistors in an integrated circuit in order to maintain moore s law while lithographic techniques have been around since the late 18th century none were applied to nanoscale structures until the mid 1950s with evolution of the semiconductor industry demand for techniques capable of producing micro and nano scale structures skyrocketed photolithography was applied to these structures for the first time in 1958 beginning the age of nanolithography since then photolithography has become the most commercially successful technique capable of producing

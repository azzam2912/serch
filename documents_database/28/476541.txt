these stars are usually hot blue white stars of spectral class b and should not be confused with cepheid variables which are named after delta cephei and are luminous supergiant stars beta cephei variables are main sequence stars of masses between about 7 and 20 m that is 7 20 times as massive as the sun among their number are some of the brightest stars in the sky such as beta crucis and beta centauri spica is also classified as a beta cephei variable but mysteriously stopped pulsating in 1970 typically they change in brightness by 0 01 to 0 3 magnitudes with periods of 0 1 to 0 3 days 2 4 7 2 hours the prototype of these variable stars beta cephei shows variation in apparent magnitude from 3 16 to 3 27 with a period of 4 57 hours the point of maximum brightness occurs when the star is smallest and hottest their variation in brightness is much greater up to 1 magnitude in ultraviolet wavelengths a small number of stars have been identified with periods shorter than one hour corresponding to 1 4 of the fundamental radial pulsation period and 3 8 of the fundamental period

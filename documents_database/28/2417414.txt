classified as an extramural center of the institute for basic science it is hosted by ewha womans university in seoul south korea their research focuses on exploring quantum properties of atoms and molecules on surfaces and interfaces and long term goals of quantum sensing and quantum computation in those areas their dedicated building started construction in 2018 and is set to officially open in 2019 during the ibs conference on quantum nanoscience within two years of their founding several published outcomes indicate growing leadership in the exploding field of quantum nanoscience for example they reduced digital memory down to a single holmium atom on mgo substrate using a scanning tunneling microscope at time of their publishing commercially available magnetic memory devices require approximately one million atoms to record the same amount of data this storage miniaturization has additional potential to serve as the basis of quantum computing researchers also coupled atom s nuclear spin and its electron counterpart which resulted in measuring the nuclear spin of single atoms of iron and titanium with an improvement of energy resolution by a fact of 10 000 this level of control could lead to a computational base unit of quantum computing working in

it was a 5 game series between canada and scotland game 1 was held in edinburgh scotland games 2 and 3 in perth and games 4 and 5 in falkirk the event was a contrast in curling styles with the canadians favouring a hitting game and the scots favouring the draw game the scots were also not used to the rubber hack and the canadian rules allowing a delivery to the length of the near hogline scottish rules at that point dictated the rock to be released by the front of the near house the canadian rules favoured the canadian team which allowed them a more accurate delivery which benefited them in the hitting game canada would win all five matches in their tour of scotland a slim crowd was on hand for the opening game held on 9 march in edinburgh the event was poorly promoted and the game was not the only match on the ice in fact figure skaters were practicing on a rink behind them the ice was keen but the richardsons were disappointed with the loose hacks the canadians were ahead 4 0 after a takeout miss in the 3rd end by the scottish skip

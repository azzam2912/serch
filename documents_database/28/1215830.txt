the failure of a material is usually classified into brittle failure fracture or ductile failure yield depending on the conditions such as temperature state of stress loading rate most materials can fail in a brittle or ductile manner or both however for most practical situations a material may be classified as either brittle or ductile though failure theory has been in development for over 200 years its level of acceptability is yet to reach that of continuum mechanics in mathematical terms failure theory is expressed in the form of various failure criteria which are valid for specific materials failure criteria are functions in stress or strain space which separate failed states from unfailed states a precise physical definition of a failed state is not easily quantified and several working definitions are in use in the engineering community quite often phenomenological failure criteria of the same form are used to predict brittle failure and ductile yields in materials science material failure is the loss of load carrying capacity of a material unit this definition introduces to the fact that material failure can be examined in different scales from microscopic to macroscopic in structural problems where the structural response may be beyond

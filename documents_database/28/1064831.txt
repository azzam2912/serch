the early use of the name plain table reflected its simplicity and plainness rather than its flatness the earliest mention of a plane table dates to 1551 in abel foullon s usage et description de l holom tre published in paris however since foullon s description was of a complete fully developed instrument it must have been invented earlier a brief description was also added to the 1591 edition of digge s pantometria the first mention of the device in english was by cyprian lucar in 1590 some have credited johann richter also known as johannes praetorius a nuremberg mathematician in 1610 with the first plane table but this appears to be incorrect the plane table became a popular instrument for surveying its use was widely taught some considered it a substandard instrument compared to other devices such as the theodolite since it was relatively easy to use by allowing the use of graphical methods rather than mathematical calculations it could be used by those with less education than other instruments the addition of a camera to the plane table as was done from 1890 by sebastian finsterwalder in conjunction with a phototheodolite established photogrammetry in spatial and temporal surveying

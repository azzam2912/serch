for example a species of plant may come in two varieties one which prefers wetter soil and one which prefers dryer soil during a period of wet years the wet variety will be more fit and produce more offspring and thereby increase the frequency of wet preferring plants if this wet period is followed by drought the dry variety will be selected for and its numbers will increase as periods of dryness and wetness fluctuate so too does selection on dry preferring and wet preferring plants fluctuating selection is also manifest at the genic level consider two alleles a and b which are found at the same locus fluctuating selection dynamics are at play when selection favors a at time t b at t and a again at t fluctuating selection has been characterized by several mathematical models under some circumstances fluctuating selection may lead to a balanced polymorphism when two species exert selection on one another e g a host and its parasite this can lead to fluctuating selection dynamics the red queen hypothesis describes coevolutionary arms races between antagonistic species predators and prey parasites and hosts competitors with overlapping niches emphasizing competition between species and populations rather than

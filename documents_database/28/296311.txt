it is a type of high intensity discharge hid gas discharge lamp developed in the 1960s they are similar to mercury vapor lamps but contain additional metal halide compounds in the quartz arc tube which improve the efficiency and color rendition of the light the most common metal halide compound used is sodium iodide once the arc tube reaches its running temperature the sodium dissociates from the iodine adding orange and reds to the lamp s spectrum from the sodium d line as the metal ionizes as a result metal halide lamps have high luminous efficacy of around 75 100 lumens per watt which is about twice that of mercury vapor lights and 3 to 5 times that of incandescent lights and produce an intense white light lamp life is 6 000 to 15 000 hours as one of the most efficient sources of high cri white light metal halides were the fastest growing segment of the lighting industry they are used for wide area overhead lighting of commercial industrial and public spaces such as parking lots sports arenas factories and retail stores as well as residential security lighting and automotive headlamps xenon headlights the lamps consist of a small

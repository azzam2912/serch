by controlling both major systems in a single unit many aspects of the engine s characteristics such as power fuel economy drivability and emissions can be improved often known as motronic basic motronic ml1 x was one of the first digital engine management systems developed by bosch these early motronic systems integrated the spark timing element with then existing jetronic fuel injection technology it was originally developed and first used in the bmw 7 series before being implemented on several volvo and porsche engines throughout the 1980s the components of the motronic ml1 x systems for the most part remained unchanged during production although there are some differences in certain situations the engine control module ecm receives information regarding engine speed crankshaft angle coolant temperature and throttle position an air flow meter also measures the volume of air entering the induction system if the engine is naturally aspirated an air temperature sensor is located in the air flow meter to work out the air mass however if the engine is turbocharged an additional charge air temperature sensor is used to monitor the temperature of the inducted air after it has passed through the turbocharger and intercooler in order to accurately

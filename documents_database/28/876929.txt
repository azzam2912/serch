these are often solved by computing the factorization formula 2 with l lower unitriangular and u upper triangular one then solves formula 3 formula 4 which can be done efficiently because the matrices are triangular for a typical sparse matrix the lu factors can be much less sparse than the original matrix a phenomenon called fill in the memory requirements for using a direct solver can then become a bottleneck in solving linear systems one can combat this problem by using fill reducing reorderings of the matrix s unknowns such as the cuthill mckee ordering an incomplete factorization instead seeks triangular matrices l u such that formula 5 rather than formula 2 solving for formula 7 can be done quickly but does not yield the exact solution to formula 1 so we instead use the matrix formula 9 as a preconditioner in another iterative solution algorithm such as the conjugate gradient method or gmres for a given matrix formula 10 one defines the graph formula 11 as which is used to define the conditions a sparsity patterns formula 13 needs to fulfill a decomposition of the form formula 15 where the following hold is called an incomplete lu decomposition w

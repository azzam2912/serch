funded by the united states national science foundation nsf it is a product of the network for computational nanotechnology ncn ncn supports research efforts in nanoelectronics nanomaterials nanoelectromechanical systems nems nanofluidics nanomedicine nanobiology and nanophotonics the network for computational nanotechnology was established in 2002 to create a resource for nanoscience and nanotechnology via online services for research education and professional collaboration initially a multi university initiative of eight member institutions including purdue university the university of california at berkeley the university of illinois at urbana champaign massachusetts institute of technology the molecular foundry at lawrence berkeley national laboratory norfolk state university northwestern university and the university of texas at el paso ncn now operates entirely at purdue the us national science foundation nsf provided grants of approximately 14 million from 2002 through 2010 with principal investigator mark s lundstrom continuing us nsf grants have been awarded since 2007 with principal investigator gerhard klimeck and co principal investigator alejandro strachan with total funding of over 20 million the web portal of ncn is nanohub org and is an instance of a hubzero hub it offers simulation tools course materials lectures seminars tutorials user groups and online meetings interactive simulation tools are

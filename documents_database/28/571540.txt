the structural system transfers loads through interconnected elements or members commonly used structures can be classified into five major categories depending on the type of primary stress that may arise in the members of the structures under major design loads however any two or more of the basic structural types described in the following may be combined in a single structure such as a building or a bridge in order to meet the structure s functional requirements the structural system of a high rise building is designed to cope with vertical gravity loads as well as lateral loads caused by wind or seismic activity the structural system consists only of the members designed to carry the loads and all other members are referred to as non structural a classification for the structural system of a high rise was introduced in 1969 by fazlur khan and was extended to incorporate interior and exterior structures the primary lateral load resisting system defines if a structural system is an interior or exterior one the following interior structures are possible the following exterior structures are possible

the term eddington valve has been used for this mechanism but this is increasingly obsolete here the greek letter kappa is used to indicate the radiative opacity at any particular depth of the stellar atmosphere in a normal star an increase in compression of the atmosphere causes an increase in temperature and density this produces a decrease in the opacity of the atmosphere allowing heat energy to escape more rapidly the result is an equilibrium condition where temperature and pressure are maintained in a balance however in cases where the opacity increases with temperature the atmosphere becomes unstable against pulsations if a layer of a stellar atmosphere moves inward it becomes denser and more opaque causing heat flow to be checked in return this heat increase causes a build up of pressure that pushes the layer back out again the result is a cyclic process as the layer repeatedly moves inward and then is forced back out again stellar non adiabatic pulsation resulting from the mechanism occurs in regions where hydrogen and helium are partly ionized or where there are negative hydrogen ions an example of such a zone is in rr lyrae variables where the partial second ionization of

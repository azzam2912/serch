to put it algebraically for a positive integer n there is a multiset of n integers a a for which the equalities formula 1 hold negative numbers are allowed in the multiset for example 5 is amenable since 5 1 1 1 1 5 all and only those numbers congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4 except 4 are amenable the first few amenable numbers are 1 5 8 9 12 13 a solution for integers of the form n 4 k 1 could be given by a set of 2 k 1 s and 2 k 1 s and n itself this generalizes the example of 5 given above although not obvious from the definition the set of amenable numbers is closed under multiplication the product of two amenable numbers is an amenable number all composite numbers would be amenable if the multiset was allowed to be of any length because even if other solutions are available one can always obtain a solution by taking the prime factorization expressed with repeated factors rather than exponents and add as many 1s as necessary to add up to n the product of this set of integers will yield n no matter

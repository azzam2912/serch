if not specified further the term is likely to refer to longitudinal effective shunt impedance to produce longitudinal coulomb forces which add up to the longitudinal acceleration voltage formula 1 an eigenmode of the resonator has to be excited leading to power dissipation formula 2 the definition of the longitudinal effective shunt impedance formula 3 then reads with the longitudinal effective acceleration voltage formula 5 the time independent shunt impedance formula 6 with the time independent acceleration voltage formula 7 is defined one can use the quality factor formula 9 to substitute formula 2 with an equivalent expression where w is the maximum energy stored since the quality factor is the only quantity in the right equation term that depends on wall properties the quantity formula 12is often used to design cavities omitting material properties at first see also cavity geometry factor when a particle is deflected in transverse direction the definition of the shunt impedance can be used with substitution of the longitudinal acceleration voltage by the transverse effective acceleration voltage taking into account transversal coulomb and lorentz forces this does not necessarily imply a change in particle energy since a particle can also be deflected by magnetic fields

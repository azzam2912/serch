in an ideal perfectly elastic collision there is no net conversion of kinetic energy into other forms such as heat noise or potential energy during the collision of small objects kinetic energy is first converted to potential energy associated with a repulsive force between the particles when the particles move against this force i e the angle between the force and the relative velocity is obtuse then this potential energy is converted back to kinetic energy when the particles move with this force i e the angle between the force and the relative velocity is acute collisions of atoms are elastic for example rutherford backscattering the molecules as distinct from atoms of a gas or liquid rarely experience perfectly elastic collisions because kinetic energy is exchanged between the molecules translational motion and their internal degrees of freedom with each collision at any instant half the collisions are to a varying extent inelastic collisions the pair possesses less kinetic energy in their translational motions after the collision than before and half could be described as super elastic possessing more kinetic energy after the collision than before averaged across the entire sample molecular collisions can be regarded as essentially elastic as long

braque was inspired to create this piece after visiting an avignon shop where he purchased a roll of faux bois paper simulating oak paneling and consisting of two kinds of printed motifs on a dark beige background braque may have been drawn to this paper because he was trained in a technique called trompe l oeil which allowed him to create pictorial effects that resemble woodgrain and marble finishes but are made with paint and a special wide comb braque then may have found it amusing to incorporate the woodgrain paper in his piece he may also have wished to use the paper to create a visual pun about the nature of representation he noticed that because the paper looks realistic and yet it is flat and pasted on it undermines spatial relationships it can act as the foreground the background or both in fruit dish and glass the glass filled with grapes and pears are flattened and distorted versions of actual objects braque used textures shapes and composition to construct a painting that is half recognizable and half symbolic the piece is based on the interaction of wallpaper glued to the support and charcoal lines which evoke both objects

it activates transcription by binding to the e box 5 canntg 3 dimerization with other bhlh proteins is required for efficient dna binding involved in the determination of the neuronal precursors in the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system ascl2 plays a critical role in early gestation with its products showing up in the oocyte and the two cell stage of the zygote this gene has its primary role after implantation of the developing embryo it is expressed in trophoblast cells on the maternal allele its expression is required for the progenitor cells within the ectoplacental cone epc which establishes the first functional maternal fetal interactions before placental development is completed the ectoplacental cone continues to develop and differentiate into other cell types which express the ascl2 gene in the differentiated derivatives it is specifically found in the spongiotrophoblast cells of the junctional zone in the mature placenta glycogen trophoblast gly2 cells are found in the junctional zone without ascl2 the glyt cells are not found and even though these cells develop later in gestation its progenitor cells are established early on if a null allele is inherited the embryo will fail to develop insufficient ascl2 function is

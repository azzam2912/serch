even if the symbol of the operation is omitted the order of and does matter unless is commutative a two sided property is fulfilled on both sides a one sided property is related to one unspecified of two sides although terms are similar left right distinction in algebraic parlance is not related either to left and right limits in calculus or to left and right in geometry a binary operation may be considered as a family of unary operators through currying depending on as a parameter it is the family of right operations similarly defines the family of left operations parametrized with if for some the left operation is identical then is called a left identity similarly if then is a right identity in ring theory a subring which is invariant under any left multiplication in a ring is called a left ideal similarly a right multiplications invariant subring is a right ideal over non commutative rings the left right distinction is applied to modules namely to specify the side where a scalar module element appear in the scalar multiplication the distinction is not purely syntactical because implies two different associativity rules the lowest row in the table which link

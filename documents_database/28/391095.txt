it is a practical alternative to the more popular stirling s approximation for calculating the gamma function with fixed precision the lanczos approximation consists of the formula for the gamma function with here g is a constant that may be chosen arbitrarily subject to the restriction that re z the coefficients p which depend on g are slightly more difficult to calculate see below although the formula as stated here is only valid for arguments in the right complex half plane it can be extended to the entire complex plane by the reflection formula the series a is convergent and may be truncated to obtain an approximation with the desired precision by choosing an appropriate g typically a small integer only some 5 10 terms of the series are needed to compute the gamma function with typical single or double floating point precision if a fixed g is chosen the coefficients can be calculated in advance and the sum is recast into the following form thus computing the gamma function becomes a matter of evaluating only a small number of elementary functions and multiplying by stored constants the lanczos approximation was popularized by numerical recipes according to which computing the

the precise definition depends on the nature of and in other words a linear fractional transformation is a transformation that is represented by a fraction whose numerator and denominator are linear in the most basic setting and are complex numbers in which case the transformation is also called a m bius transformation or more generally elements of a field the invertibility condition is then over a field a linear fractional transformation is the restriction to the field of a projective transformation or homography of the projective line when are integer or more generally belong to an integral domain is supposed to be a rational number or to belong to the field of fractions of the integral domain in this case the invertibility condition is that must be a unit of the domain that is or in the case of integers in the most general setting the and are square matrices or more generally elements of a ring an example of such linear fractional transformation is the cayley transform which was originally defined on the 3 x 3 real matrix ring linear fractional transformations are widely used in various areas of mathematics and its applications to engineering such as classical geometry

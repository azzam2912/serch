yield monitors are a part of the precision agriculture products available to producers today that provide producers with the tools to reduce costs increase yields and increase efficiency the present day grain yield monitor is designed to measure the harvested grain mass flow moisture content and speed to determine total grain harvested in most cases today this is coupled with global positioning system to record yield and other spatially variable information across a field this allows for the creation of a grain yield map which provides information on spatial variability and supports management decisions for producers grain mass flow is most commonly measured using a load cell with an impact plate attached to the load cell located at the top of the clean grain elevator as the clean grain elevator paddles rotate around the top of the clean grain elevator the grain is expelled from the elevator by centrifugal force and makes contact with the impact plate attached to the load cell the force applied by the grain is converted to an electrical signal by the load cell that is used to estimate the mass flow of the grain a calibration of the sensor to develop a relationship of the

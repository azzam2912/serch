it is a colorless faint ethereal and sweetish smelling liquid that boils around room temperature it was the first widely used refrigerant because of its high boiling point compared to most refrigerants it can be used in systems with a low operating pressure making the mechanical design of such systems less demanding than that of higher pressure refrigerants r 12 or r 22 trichlorofluoromethane is used as a reference compound for fluorine 19 nmr studies r 11 is assigned an ozone depletion potential of 1 0 and u s production was ended on january 1 1996 prior to the knowledge of the ozone depletion potential of chlorine in refrigerants and other possible harmful effects on the environment trichlorofluoromethane was sometimes used as a cleaning rinsing agent for low pressure systems trichlorofluoromethane was formerly used in the drinking bird novelty largely because it has a boiling point of 23 77 74 79 the replacement dichloromethane boiling point 39 6 103 3 requires a higher ambient temperature to work the substance was included in the production moratorium agreed in the montreal protocol of 1987 however in 2018 its atmospheric concentration was noted to be declining more slowly than expected and it subsequently

gpr64 is a member of the adhesion gpcr family adhesion gpcrs are characterized by an extended extracellular region often possessing n terminal protein modules that is linked to a tm7 region via a domain known as the gpcr autoproteolysis inducing gain domain the adhesion gpcr gpr64 is an orphan receptor characterized by a long n terminus with that has been suggested to be highly glycosylated gpr64 s n terminus has been reported to be cleaved at the gps domain to allow for trafficking to the plasma membrane after cleavage the n terminus is believed to remain non covalently associated with the 7tm gpr64 expression has been mostly reported in the male reproductive organs but more recently has been shown to be expressed in the central nervous system gpr64 is mainly expressed in human and mouse epididymis as well as human prostate and parathyroid gpr64 together with f actin scaffold locates at the nonciliated principal cells of the proximal male excurrent duct epithelia where reabsorption of testicular fluid and concentration of sperm takes place targeting of gpr64 in mice causes reduced fertility or infertility in males but the reproductive capacity was unaffected in females unchanged hormone expression in knockout males indicates

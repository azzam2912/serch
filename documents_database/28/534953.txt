according to its parallax of 29 83 milliarcseconds it is located at a distance of 109 light years from earth in 2004 a planet was announced to be orbiting the star in a 386 day orbit follow up work published in 2008 did not confirm the original candidate but instead found evidence of a planet in a 1349 day orbit the star bd 10 4351b located 192 arcseconds away from hd 196885 is located at the same distance and may be a physically bound companion star in which case hd 196885 is a triple system if it is bound then the separation is at least 6600 au the separation along the line of sight is unknown so this value represents a lower limit on the true separation hd 196885 a is an f6iv star it has a mass of 1 33 solar masses and a radius of 1 79 times that of our sun hd 196885 b is a red dwarf star separated by 0 7 arcseconds from the primary star at a distance of 112 light years this corresponds to a separation of 24 au between the stars since the separation along the line of sight is unknown this

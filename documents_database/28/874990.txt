its chemical structure consists of four nitro groups attached to one carbon atom in 1857 it was first synthesised by the reaction of sodium cyanoacetamide with nitric acid it has been investigated for use as an oxidizer in bipropellant rockets however its high melting point makes it unsuitable highly purified tetranitromethane cannot be made to explode but its sensitivity is increased dramatically by oxidizable contaminants such as anti freezing additives this makes it effectively unusable as a propellant in the laboratory it is used as a reagent for the detection of double bonds in organic compounds and as a nitrating reagent it has also found use as an additive to diesel fuel to increase the cetane number tnm is a pale yellow liquid that can be prepared in the laboratory by the nitration of acetic anhydride with anhydrous nitric acid chattaway s method this method was attempted on an industrial scale in the 1950s by nitroform products company in newark usa but the entire plant was destroyed by an explosion in 1953 the first industrial scale production was started in germany during world war ii in an effort to improve the cetane number of diesel fuel this process improved the

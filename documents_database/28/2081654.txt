the entire gene spans 5568 base pairs on the positive strand of chromosome 5 140019113 140024689bp but is alternately spliced into different variants there are three known variants for tmco6 variant 1 is the longest and variant 2 and 3 are spliced into shorter mrna strands there is also a predicted variants x1 x7 tmco6 is expressed in liver tissue and is found during the fetal stage of development in humans orthologs of the tmco6 protein have been found among sequenced organisms with the exception of invertebrates fungi plants and bacteria tmco6 transmembrane and coiled coil domains 6 rat genome database this includes close primates to some distant fish graphs show the evolutionary rate of tmco6 with respect to different species and compared to other proteins it is concluded that tmco6 is a fairly fast evolving protein similar to fibrinogen there are four known isoforms associated with this gene protein 1 2 3 and x2 the longest variant of tmco6 is variant 1 encoded by a 12 exon long 1 925 base pair mrna sequence variant 2 is the second longest at 1 907 base pairs in length and also consists of 12 exons this transcript variant has an alternate

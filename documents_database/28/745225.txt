it is located south of the planet s equator in the heavily cratered highlands of terra sirenum in the phaethontis quadrangle the crater was named in 1973 by the international astronomical union iau working group for planetary system nomenclature wgpsn in honor of british physicist sir isaac newton the impact that formed newton likely occurred more than 3 billion years ago the crater contains smaller craters within its basin and is particularly notable for gully formations that are presumed to be indicative of past liquid water flows many small channels exist in this area they are further evidence of liquid water on the basis of their form aspects positions and location amongst and apparent interaction with features thought to be rich in water ice many researchers believed that the processes carving the gullies involve liquid water however this remains a topic of active research as soon as gullies were discovered researchers began to image many gullies over and over looking for possible changes by 2006 some changes were found later with further analysis it was determined that the changes could have occurred by dry granular flows rather than being driven by flowing water with continued observations many more changes were

a graph is said to be rainbow connected or rainbow colored if there is a rainbow path between each pair of its vertices if there is a rainbow shortest path between each pair of vertices the graph is said to be strongly rainbow connected or strongly rainbow colored the rainbow connection number of a graph formula 1 is the minimum number of colors needed to rainbow connect formula 1 and is denoted by formula 3 similarly the strong rainbow connection number of a graph formula 1 is the minimum number of colors needed to strongly rainbow connect formula 1 and is denoted by formula 6 clearly each strong rainbow coloring is also a rainbow coloring while the converse is not true in general it is easy to observe that to rainbow connect any connected graph formula 1 we need at least formula 8 colors where formula 8 is the diameter of formula 1 i e the length of the longest shortest path on the other hand we can never use more than formula 11 colors where formula 11 denotes the number of edges in formula 1 finally because each strongly rainbow connected graph is rainbow connected we have that formula

sound waves that travel through a medium are scattered multiple times by heterogeneities in the medium or boundaries in a sample of limited size and generate slowly decaying waves called coda waves despite their noisy and chaotic appearance coda waves are highly repeatable such that if no change occurs in the medium over time the waveforms are identical if a change occurs such as a crack in the medium the change in the multiple scattered waves will result in an observable change in the coda waves in the article roel snieder described the theory of the coda wave interferometry he assumed that fields are considered as a sum of trajectories formula 1 considering that formula 2 where formula 3 is the elastic mean free path snieder demonstrated that medium perturbations acted as a propagation time change formula 4 in order to estimate a level of perturbations we used the correlation coefficient we consider a time window centered at time t and of 2t width the correlation coefficient is given by formula 5 where formula 6 is the reference measurement and formula 7 is the perturbed measurement the unperturbed travel time is given by formula 8 where formula 9 is the

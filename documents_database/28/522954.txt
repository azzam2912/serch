it is an integral domain in which the sum of two principal ideals is again a principal ideal this means that for every pair of elements a b zout identity holds and that every finitely generated ideal is principal any principal ideal domain pid is a b zout domain but a b zout domain need not be a noetherian ring so it could have non finitely generated ideals which obviously excludes being a pid if so it is not a unique factorization domain ufd but still is a gcd domain the theory of b zout domains retains many of the properties of pids without requiring the noetherian property b zout domains are named after the french mathematician tienne b zout a ring is a b zout domain if and only if it is an integral domain in which any two elements have a greatest common divisor that is a linear combination of them this is equivalent to the statement that an ideal which is generated by two elements is also generated by a single element and induction demonstrates that all finitely generated ideals are principal the expression of the greatest common divisor of two elements of a pid as a

the book is partly a memoir and an exploration of the impact the simpsons has had on popular culture planet simpson was written by canadian author chris turner who is a big fan of the simpsons although not even the biggest fan i know personally i think i am actually a pretty average hardcore fan what i brought to it was a sense that because the show is as well put together as it is it really offers a wide lens for looking at culture generally turner notes i can count on the simpsons to provide me with a solid thirty minutes of truth of righteous anger of hypocrisies deflated and injustices revealed of belly laughter and joy it is food for my soul seriously i think many simpsons fans would agree and that as far as i m concerned makes it a kind of religion he explains in the book he had previously written an essay during his time at shift entitled the simpsons generation which was syndicated across north america turner wrote planet simpson because there had not been a book that had looked at the genesis past characters and influence of the show only official episode guides

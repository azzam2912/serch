there also exists an equivalent formulation in terms of the number of floodlights needed to illuminate the body the hadwiger conjecture is named after hugo hadwiger who included it on a list of unsolved problems in 1957 it was however previously studied by and independently additionally there is a different hadwiger conjecture concerning graph coloring and in some sources the geometric hadwiger conjecture is also called the levi hadwiger conjecture or the hadwiger levi covering problem the conjecture remains unsolved even in three dimensions though the two dimensional case was resolved by formally the hadwiger conjecture is if k is any bounded convex set in the n dimensional euclidean space r then there exists a set of 2 scalars s and a set of 2 translation vectors v such that all s lie in the range 0 boltyansky the problem is equivalent to one of illumination how many floodlights must be placed outside of an opaque convex body in order to completely illuminate its exterior for the purposes of this problem a body is only considered to be illuminated if for each point of the boundary of the body there is at least one floodlight that is separated from the

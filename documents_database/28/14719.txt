these compound libraries can be made as mixtures sets of individual compounds or chemical structures generated by computer software combinatorial chemistry can be used for the synthesis of small molecules and for peptides strategies that allow identification of useful components of the libraries are also part of combinatorial chemistry the methods used in combinatorial chemistry are applied outside chemistry too synthesis of molecules in a combinatorial fashion can quickly lead to large numbers of molecules for example a molecule with three points of diversity r r and r can generate formula 1 possible structures where formula 2 formula 3 and formula 4 are the numbers of different substituents utilized the basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries although combinatorial chemistry has only really been taken up by industry since the 1990s its roots can be seen as far back as the 1960s when a researcher at rockefeller university bruce merrifield started investigating the solid phase synthesis of peptides in its modern form combinatorial chemistry has probably had its biggest impact in the pharmaceutical industry researchers attempting to optimize the activity profile of a

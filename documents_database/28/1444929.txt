it refers to the process of infusing vaccine primed t lymphocytes into lymphodepleted recipients for the purpose of enhancing the proliferation and function of those t cells and increasing immune protection induced by that vaccine the concept takes advantage of data from animal and studies in vaccinology and the homeostasis of t cells and has applications in the treatment of infectious disease immunodeficiency syndromes and cancer historically the effect of vaccines particularly against pathogens has been assessed by measurement of their induction of a b cell mediated or humoral immune response i e the production of pathogen specific antibodies in the study of both infectious diseases and cancer a majority of potential immune targets are only expressed intra cellularly and are thus inaccessible to antibody mediated elimination t cell mediated immunity by contrast has the potential to recognize targets expressed either extra or intra cellularly and has therefore been studied extensively for treatment of these diseases a number of pre clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that vaccines against pathogens bystander non pathogenic proteins tumor associated antigens or whole tumor cells can induce specific t cell mediated immune responses a number of approaches have been considered to amplify t cell

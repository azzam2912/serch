the form of this compound is common in cells upon entering the cell most glucose and fructose is converted to fructose 1 6 bisphosphate fructose 1 6 bisphosphate lies within the glycolysis metabolic pathway and is produced by phosphorylation of fructose 6 phosphate it is in turn broken down into two compounds glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate it is an allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase through distinct interactions of binding and allostery at the enzyme s catalytic site the numbering of the carbon atoms indicates the fate of the carbons according to their position in fructose 6 phosphate fructose 1 6 bisphosphate has only one biologically active isomer the form there are many other isomers analogous to those of fructose fructose 1 6 bis phosphate has also been implicated in the ability to bind and sequester fe ii a soluble form of iron whose oxidation to the insoluble fe iii is capable of generating reactive oxygen species via fenton chemistry the ability of fructose 1 6 bis phosphate to bind fe ii may prevent such electron transfers and thus act as an antioxidant within the body certain neurodegenerative diseases like alzheimer s and parkinson s have been linked to

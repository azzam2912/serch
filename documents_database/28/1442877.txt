after completing his undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science at harvard in 1995 he obtained his phd in applied mathematics from massachusetts institute of technology in 1999 where his advisor was shafi goldwasser his research centers around the interface between computational complexity theory and cryptography he focuses on the topics of pseudorandomness and zero knowledge proofs his work on zig zag product with omer reingold and avi wigderson was awarded the 2009 g del prize one of the main contribution of his work is a new type of graph product called the zig zag product taking a product of a large graph with a small graph the resulting graph inherits roughly its size from the large one its degree from the small one and its expansion properties from both iteration yields simple explicit constructions of constant degree expanders of every size starting from one constant size expander crucial to the intuition and simple analysis of the properties of the zig zag product is the view of expanders as functions which act as entropy wave propagators they transform probability distributions in which entropy is concentrated in one area to distributions where that concentration is dissipated in these terms the graph

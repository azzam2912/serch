it was the second successful experimental tiltrotor aircraft and the first to demonstrate the concept s high speed performance relative to conventional helicopters the idea of building vertical take off and landing aircraft using helicopter like rotors at the wingtips originated in the 1930s the first design resembling modern tiltrotors was patented by george lehberger in may 1930 but he did not develop the concept further in world war ii a german prototype called the focke achgelis fa 269 was developed starting in 1942 but it never flew two prototypes that made it to flight were the one seat transcendental model 1 g and two seat transcendental model 2 both powered by single reciprocating engines development started on the model 1 g in 1947 and it flew in 1954 the model 1 g flew until a crash in chesapeake bay on 20 july 1955 destroying the prototype aircraft but not seriously injuring the pilot the transcendental 1 g was the first tiltrotor aircraft to have flown and it accomplished most of a helicopter to aircraft transition in flight to within ten degrees of true horizontal aircraft flight the model 2 was developed and flew shortly afterward but it did not

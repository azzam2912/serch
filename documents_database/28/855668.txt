it describes an anisotropic universe without matter i e it is a vacuum solution it can be written in any spacetime dimension formula 1 and has strong connections with the study of gravitational chaos the metric in formula 1 spacetime dimensions is and contains formula 4 constants formula 5 called the kasner exponents the metric describes a spacetime whose equal time slices are spatially flat however space is expanding or contracting at different rates in different directions depending on the values of the formula 5 test particles in this metric whose comoving coordinate differs by formula 7 are separated by a physical distance formula 8 the kasner metric is an exact solution to einstein s equations in vacuum when the kasner exponents satisfy the following kasner conditions the first condition defines a plane the kasner plane and the second describes a sphere the kasner sphere the solutions choices of formula 5 satisfying the two conditions therefore lie on the sphere where the two intersect sometimes confusingly also called the kasner sphere in formula 12 spacetime dimensions the space of solutions therefore lie on a formula 13 dimensional sphere formula 14 there are several noticeable and unusual features of the kasner

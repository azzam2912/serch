benefits to using ctp over other methods are lower polydispersity and greater control over number average molecular weight in the resulting polymer sample but very few monomers have been demonstrated to undergo ctp the first reports of ctp came simultaneously from the labs of yokozawa and mccullough in 2004 with the recognition that polythiophene can be synthesized with low dispersity and control over molecular weight when a grignard thiophene monomer was polymerized with nickel 1 2 bis diphenylphosphino ethane dichloride this recognition sparked interest in the system and its expansion to other monomers despite major advances in the field relatively few polymers can be synthesized via ctp because the lack of a universal ctp catalyst means that every monomer must be paired with a different catalyst in order to obtain ideal living chain growth behavior this need to pair monomers to catalysts means most conjugated polymers are synthesized via palladium catalyzed step growth polycondensation cross coupling reactions ctp is exclusively performed on arene monomers to give conjugated polymers the polymers obtained from a true ctp are often low dispersity and contain consistent end groups two on each chain one put on the polymer chain end during initiation and the other

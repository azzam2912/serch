it can be prepared by homolysis of triphenylmethyl chloride 1 by a metal like silver or zinc in benzene or diethyl ether the radical 2 forms a chemical equilibrium with the quinoid type dimer 3 3 triphenylmethyl 6 diphenylmethylidene 1 4 cyclohexadiene gomberg s dimer in benzene the concentration of the radical is 2 solutions containing the radical are yellow when the temperature of the solution is raised the yellow color becomes more intense as the equilibrium is shifted in favor of the radical in accordance with le ch telier s principle when exposed to air the radical rapidly oxidizes to the peroxide and the color of the solution changes from yellow to colorless likewise the radical reacts with iodine to triphenylmethyl iodide the radical was discovered by moses gomberg in 1900 at the university of michigan he tried to prepare hexaphenylethane from triphenylmethyl chloride and zinc in benzene in a wurtz reaction and found that the product based on its behaviour towards iodine and oxygen was far more reactive than anticipated the discovered structure was used in the development of esr spectroscopy and confirmed by it the correct quinoid structure for the dimer was suggested as early as 1904

it is operated by the institute for radio astronomy of the national institute for astrophysics inaf of the government of italy the site includes the northern cross radio telescope croce del nord in italian is one of the largest transit radio telescopes in the world observations are focused around 408 mhz uhf band corresponding to 73 5 cm wavelength the older receivers of the telescope function with a 2 5 mhz wide frequency band while the upgraded parts have a 16 mhz bandwidth the telescope is steerable only in declination meaning that it can solely observe objects that are culminating on the local celestial meridian the telescope is t shaped and consists of the telescope can provide 22880 possible theoretical independent beams and has a field of view of 55 47 degrees east west by 1 8 degrees north south the resolution is around 4 5 arcminutes in the north south direction and 4 arcminutes in the east west direction while less than the resolution of large optical telescopes the amount of radiation which can be gathered with the northern cross is much greater proportional to the mirror surface of approximately 27400 square meters northern cross represents the largest uhf

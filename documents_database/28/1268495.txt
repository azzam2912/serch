euler spirals are also commonly referred to as spiros clothoids or cornu spirals euler spirals have applications to diffraction computations they are also widely used as transition curves in railroad engineering highway engineering for connecting and transitioning the geometry between a tangent and a circular curve a similar application is also found in photonic integrated circuits the principle of linear variation of the curvature of the transition curve between a tangent and a circular curve defines the geometry of the euler spiral to travel along a circular path an object needs to be subject to a centripetal acceleration e g the moon circles around the earth because of gravity a car turns its front wheels inward to generate a centripetal force if a vehicle traveling on a straight path were to suddenly transition to a tangential circular path it would require centripetal acceleration suddenly switching at the tangent point from zero to the required value this would be difficult to achieve think of a driver instantly moving the steering wheel from straight line to turning position and the car actually doing it putting mechanical stress on the vehicle s parts and causing much discomfort causing jerk on early railroads this

at an apparent visual magnitude of 3 41 epsilon lupi can be readily viewed from the southern hemisphere with sufficiently dark skies it is the fifth brightest star or star system in the constellation parallax measurements give a distance to this system of roughly this system is what astronomers term a double lined spectroscopic binary when the spectrum is examined the absorption line features of both stars can be viewed as a result of the doppler effect these lines shift back and forth in frequency as the two stars orbit around each other this allows some of their orbital elements to be deduced even though the individual stars have not been resolved with a telescope the pair share a close elliptical orbit with a period of 4 55970 days the orbital eccentricity is 0 277 which means that at the separation at closest approach or periapsis is only 57 of the distance at their greatest separation or apoapsis there is a third more distant companion at an angular separation of around 1 arcsecond that may be orbiting the pair with a period of about 64 years the pair that share the close orbit epsilon lupi aa and epsilon lupi ab

a common example is the lanthanum fluoride electrode in the lanthanum fluoride electrode the sensing element is a crystal of lanthanum fluoride laf doped with europium fluoride euf to create lattice vacancies such a crystal is an ionic conductor by virtue of the mobility of fluoride ions which jump between lattice vacancies an electrochemical cell may be constructed using such a crystal as a membrane separating two fluoride solutions this cell acts as a concentration cell with transference where the fluoride transport number is 1 as transference of charge through the crystal is almost exclusively due to fluoride the electrode is highly specific to fluoride the only ion which significantly interferes is hydroxide oh generally such alkaline error can be avoided by buffering the sample to a ph below 7 the cell diagram of a typical experimental arrangement is where some commercially available reference electrodes have an internal junction which minimizes the liquid junction potential between the sample solution and the electrolyte in the reference electrode kcl the internal electrolyte is at fixed composition and the electrode response is given by the nernst equation where martin s frant and james w ross jr electrode for sensing fluoride ion activity in

size is generally associated with age however there are variations in size at any particular age for most fish species making it difficult to estimate one from the other with precision therefore researchers interested in determining a fish age look for structures which increase incrementally with age the most commonly used techniques involve counting natural growth rings on the scales otoliths vertebrate fin spines eye lenses teeth or bones of the jaw pectoral girdle and opercular series even reliable aging techniques may vary among species often several different bony structures are compared among a population in order to determine the most accurate method aristotle ca 340 b c may have been the first scientist to speculate on the use of hard parts of fishes to determine age stating in historica animalium that the age of a scaly fish may be told by the size and hardness of its scales however it wasn t until the development of the microscope that more detailed studies were performed on the structure of scales antonie van leeuwenhoek developed improved lenses which he went use in his creation of microscopes he had a wide range of interests including the structure of fish scales from the

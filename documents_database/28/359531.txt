each key press results in a prediction rather than repeatedly sequencing through the same group of letters it represents in the same invariable order predictive text could allow for an entire word to be input by single keypress predictive text makes efficient use of fewer device keys to input writing into a text message an e mail an address book a calendar and the like the most widely used general predictive text systems are t9 itap ezitext and letterwise wordwise there are many ways to build a device that predicts text but all predictive text systems have initial linguistic settings that offer predictions that are re prioritized to adapt to each user this learning adapts by way of the device memory to a user s disambiguating feedback that results in corrective key presses such as pressing a next key to get to the intention most predictive text systems have a user database to facilitate this process theoretically the number of keystrokes required per desired character in the finished writing is on average comparable to using a keyboard this is approximately true providing that all words used are in its database punctuation is ignored and no input mistakes are made typing

for a property r that changes when the temperature changes by dt the temperature coefficient is defined by the following equation here has the dimension of an inverse temperature and can be expressed e g in 1 k or k if the temperature coefficient itself does not vary too much with temperature and formula 2 a linear approximation will be useful in estimating the value r of a property at a temperature t given its value r at a reference temperature t where t is the difference between t and t for strongly temperature dependent this approximation is only useful for small temperature differences t temperature coefficients are specified for various applications including electric and magnetic properties of materials as well as reactivity the temperature coefficient of most of the reactions lies between 2 3 most ceramics exhibit negative temperature dependence of resistance behaviour this effect is governed by an arrhenius equation over a wide range of temperatures where r is resistance a and b are constants and t is absolute temperature k the constant b is related to the energies required to form and move the charge carriers responsible for electrical conduction hence as the value of b increases

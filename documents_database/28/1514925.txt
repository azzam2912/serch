according to the constitution of 1952 the elections should have been held every 4 years that is in the spring of 1984 but since the internal political situation was still considered unstable even after the repealing in 1983 of the martial law the sejm voted to extend its own term at first indefinitely on february 13 1984 and then until august 31 1985 on december 3 1984 fixing the elections to be held not beyond the end of 1985 as was the case in previous elections only candidates approved by the communist regime coalesced under the patriotic movement for national rebirth replacing the similar front of national unity were permitted on the ballot the outcome was thus not in doubt nevertheless the regime was hoping for a high turnout which it could then claim as evidence of strong support for the government among the population the opposition from the solidarity movement called for a boycott of the elections according to official figures 78 9 of the electorate turned out to vote this turnout while relatively high was much lower than the nearly 100 turnout which was reported in previous elections the results like with the other elections in communist poland

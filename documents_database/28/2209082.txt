the depot is located on the west side of the line from woodlesford and is south of leeds railway station having housed steam locomotives since opening the introduction of diesels in the 1950s led to steam and diesel being serviced side by side but by 1977 a new two road diesel maintenance facility had replaced the original brick sheds so that in 1978 holbeck was typically host to up to 20 diesel locomotives on weekdays and up to 30 at weekends and around this time locomotives allocated here were outstationed at skipton as well as being used for duties around leeds city station however there were changes in the way that british rail was working so that the allocation from 1977 of 18 class 47s 39 class 45s 3 class 31s and 11 class 08 shunters had changed by 1985 when holbeck had no allocated locomotives with leeds being provided with shunters and hsts allocated to neville hill located on the other side of leeds city station around 1987 holbeck had an allocation of class 08 shunters and classes 31 45 and 47 could also usually be seen at the depot as of 2016 the depot has no allocation it

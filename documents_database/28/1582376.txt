stillwaterite was first discovered in the banded and upper zones of the stillwater igneous complex in montana united states and has been reported in the lac des iles area of ontario canada outside of north america this rare mineral has been found in northern finland stillwaterite has hexagonal symmetry meaning that it has four crystallographic axes three are horizontal axes of equal length and the fourth is a vertical axis of different length because it is opaque stillwaterite is most commonly viewed under reflected light appearing light creamy gray in color it is weakly anisotropic in air displaying dark gray to brownish gray color in oil immersion it shows distinct anisotropy with brownish black color and a blue to yellow brown tinge hexagonal minerals such as stillwaterite are referred to as uniaxial crystals because they have only one direction along the optic axis in which light is not reoriented since its discovery in the mid 1970s stillwaterite has been studied to better understand the characteristics of complex mineral assemblages of gold silicates and other palladium arsenides with which it is associated minerals containing palladium can have economic significance and are mined for use in industrial and commercial applications

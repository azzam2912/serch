however with cutolo s downfall a few years later the organization began operating separately under the leadership of giuseppe rogoli according to one account of rogoli s rise to leadership it is said that the legendary apulian crime boss was inspired by and allegedly sanctioned by various calabrian ndrangheta leaders imprisoned in the trani jail on the coast north of bari the capital of the region to form a new criminal organization based in apulia with himself at its head legend has it that on christmas day 1983 rogoli with several of his imprisoned followers and several calabrian mafia leaders one calabrian was rumoured to be the capobastone of the powerful bellocco clan came together in rogoli s cell where he was officially initiated and sanctioned as the supreme head of the newly formed scu however secret documents pertaining to the history of the scu were eventually seized by the italian law enforcement agencies and show that the reported ceremony actually took place in may 1983 not on the christmas day of legend the december 25th date was probably used by scu leaders to underline the great importance of the legendary ceremony whatever the correct date may be giuseppe rogoli

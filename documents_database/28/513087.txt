the degree constrained spanning tree problem is to determine whether a particular graph has such a spanning tree for a particular k input n node undirected graph g v e positive integer k n question does g have a spanning tree in which no node has degree greater than k this problem is np complete this can be shown by a reduction from the hamiltonian path problem it remains np complete even if k is fixed to a value 2 if the problem is defined as the degree must be k the k 2 case of degree confined spanning tree is the hamiltonian path problem on a weighted graph a degree constrained minimum spanning tree dcmst is a degree constrained spanning tree in which the sum of its edges has the minimum possible sum finding a dcmst is an np hard problem heuristic algorithms that can solve the problem in polynomial time have been proposed including genetic and ant based algorithms give an iterative polynomial time algorithm which given a graph formula 1 returns a spanning tree with maximum degree no larger than formula 2 where formula 3 is the minimum possible maximum degree over all spanning trees thus if

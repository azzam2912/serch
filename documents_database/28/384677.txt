the enamel organ is responsible for the formation of enamel initiation of dentine formation establishment of the shape of a tooth s crown and establishment of the dentoenamel junction the enamel organ has four layers the inner enamel epithelium outer enamel epithelium stratum intermedium and the stellate reticulum the dental papilla the differentiated ectomesenchyme deep to the enamel organ will produce dentin and the dental pulp the surrounding ectomesenchyme tissue the dental follicle is the primitive cementum periodontal ligament and alveolar bone beneath the tooth root the site where the internal enamel epithelium and external enamel epithelium coalesce is the cervical root important in proliferation of the dental root tooth development begins at week 6 in utero in the oral epithelium the process is divided into three stages at the end of week 7 i u localised proliferations of cells in the dental laminae form round and oval swellings known as tooth buds which will eventually develop into mesenchymal cells and surround the enamel organ each epithelial swelling and the surrounding mesenchymal cells form a tooth germ tooth germs are the primitive structure of teeth their formation is in three distinct stages bud stage cap stage bell stage the stages

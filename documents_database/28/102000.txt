the elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph in the special case of a finite simple graph the adjacency matrix is a 0 1 matrix with zeros on its diagonal if the graph is undirected the adjacency matrix is symmetric the relationship between a graph and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its adjacency matrix is studied in spectral graph theory the adjacency matrix should be distinguished from the incidence matrix for a graph a different matrix representation whose elements indicate whether vertex edge pairs are incident or not and degree matrix which contains information about the degree of each vertex for a simple graph with vertex set v the adjacency matrix is a square matrix a such that its element a is one when there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j and zero when there is no edge the diagonal elements of the matrix are all zero since edges from a vertex to itself loops are not allowed in simple graphs it is also sometimes useful in algebraic graph theory to replace the nonzero elements with algebraic variables the same concept can be extended to multigraphs and graphs

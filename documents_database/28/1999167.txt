this grouping describes a general engineering and manufacturing environment that is defined by its ability to manufacture and or assemble goods chiefly by machines integrated assembly lines and robotic arms these environments are also defined by their coordination with and usually their systematic integration with the required automatic equipment to form a complete system this system is essentially a solution for the automation and manufacturing of a particular production process of an intended output and or end product the automation process is a widely accepted form of production that has made great leaps and bounds in the production process as a whole automation has led to the production of sophisticated parts that have similar output qualities with little fluctuation in general tolerances the use of automation in the manufacturing process started by using such technologies as the pneumatic and hydraulic systems for use in applications where their mechanical advantages could be used to utilize a production for higher output quality and efficiency we have since created a complex and highly integrated systems composed of many different technologies and innovative procedures controlled under high language programming environments with sophisticated operation drivers these drivers are often running languages that support 6 7

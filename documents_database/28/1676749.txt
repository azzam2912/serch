as of 2019 samsung electronics and tsmc have begun commercial production of 5nm nodes 5nm nodes are based on multi gate mosfet mugfet technology the two types of mugfet technology used at 5nm are the finfet fin field effect transistor and the gaafet gate all around field effect transistor the 5 nm node was once assumed by some experts to be the end of moore s law transistors smaller than 7 nm will experience quantum tunnelling through the gate oxide layer due to the costs involved in development 5 nm is predicted to take longer to reach market than the two years estimated by moore s law beyond 7 nm it was initially claimed that major technological advances would have to be made to produce chips at this small scale in particular it is believed that 5 nm may usher in the successor to the finfet such as a gate all around architecture in 2009 intel s roadmap projected an end user release by approximately 2020 though intel has not yet revealed any specific plans to manufacturers or retailers single transistor devices below 7 nm were first demonstrated by researchers in the early 2000s in 2002 an ibm research team

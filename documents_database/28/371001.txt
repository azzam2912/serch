this is in contrast to direct electric action and electro pneumatic action which connect the key to the valve through an electrical link or an electrically assisted pneumatic system respectively or tubular pneumatic action which utilizes a change of pressure within lead tubing which connects the key to the valve pneumatic organs trace their history as far back as at least the 3rd century b c with an organlike device known as the hydraulis also known as a water organ or roman organ the hydraulis was an instrument in which water was used as a source of power to push wind through organ pipes it is not to be confused with the hydraulic action of a hydraulophone an instrument that actually uses water to produce the sound not just as a source of power while the control of air pressure was controlled by water pressure hence the name the action was a rudimentary form of modern action it was not until the mid 14th century that the action needed to be explored and expanded as finally more pipes were added as well as the addition of stops and ultimately multiple cases and keyboards this continued in the 17th and 18th

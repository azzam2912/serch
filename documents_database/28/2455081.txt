dva is a specific form of kinetic imaging it requires angiographic image series which are created by x ray or fluoroscopic imaging and by the administration of contrast media during various medical procedures the resulting single dva image visualizes the path of contrast agent with relatively low background noise between 2017 and 2019 two clinical studies has been performed to investigate the clinical usability of the dva method and these studies has found that it has the potential to be used for low dose radiographic imaging and carbon dioxide angiography in the future dva is currently under development by kinetic health ltd and semmelweis university budapest hungary in 2018 gy n m et al compared the quality of dva and dsa digital subtraction angiography images in a prospective observational crossover study which involved the analysis of 232 image pairs of 42 patients undergoing lower limb x ray angiography performed by using iodinated contrast agent between february and june 2017 methods included the measurement of snr signal to noise ratio and visual quality comparison although other factors like spatial resolution sharpness and object size may contribute to image quality and object perceptibility noise places a fundamental limitation on the ability to

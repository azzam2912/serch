infn was founded on 8 august 1951 to further the nuclear physics research tradition initiated by enrico fermi in rome in the 1930s the infn collaborates with cern fermilab and various other laboratories in the world in recent years it has provided important contributions to grid computing during the latter half of the 1950s the infn designed and constructed the first italian electron accelerator the electron synchrotron developed in frascati in the early 1960s it also constructed in frascati the first ever electron positron collider ada anello di accumulazione under the scientific leadership of bruno touschek in 1968 frascati began operating adone big ada which was the first high energy particle collider having a beam energy of 1 5 gev during the same period the infn began to participate in research into the construction and use of ever more powerful accelerators being conducted at cern the infn has sezioni sections in most major italian universities and four national laboratories it has personnel of its own but it is mostly the main funding agency for high energy physics in italy university personnel can be affiliated with infn and receive from it research grants

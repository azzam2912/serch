in spacetime developed by gregorio ricci curbastro and his student tullio levi civita it was used by albert einstein to develop his theory of general relativity contrasted with the infinitesimal calculus tensor calculus allows presentation of physics equations in a form that is independent of the choice of coordinates on the manifold tensor calculus has many real life applications in physics and engineering including elasticity continuum mechanics electromagnetism see mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field general relativity see mathematics of general relativity and quantum field theory working with a main proponent of the exterior calculus elie cartan the influential geometer shiing shen chern nicely summarizes the role of tensor calculusin our subject of differential geometry where you talk about manifolds one difficulty is that the geometry is described by coordinates but the coordinates do not have meaning they are allowed to undergo transformation and in order to handle this kind of situation an important tool is the so called tensor analysis or ricci calculus which was new to mathematicians in mathematics you have a function you write down the function you calculate or you add or you multiply or you can differentiate you have something very concrete in geometry the

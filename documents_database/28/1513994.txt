the fragments of a molecule cause a unique pattern in the mass spectrum these reactions are well documented over the decades and fragmentation pattern is useful to determine the molar weight and structural information of the unknown molecule fragmentation can occur in the ion source in source fragmentation where it is generally not a desired effect ion source conformation is an important criterion in the level of fragmentation observed desired fragmentation is made in the collision zone post source fragmentation of a tandem mass spectrometer it is a part of gas phase ion chemistry few different types of mass fragmentation are collision induced dissociation cid through collision with neutral molecule surface induced dissociation sid using fast moving ions collision with a solid surface laser induced dissociation which uses laser to induce the ion formation electron capture dissociation ecd due to capturing of low energy electrons electron transfer dissociation etd through electron transfer between ions negative electron transfer dissociation netd electron detachment dissociation edd photodissociation particularly infrared multiphoton dissociation irmpd using ir radiation for the bombardment and blackbody infrared radiative dissociation bird which use ir radiation instead of laser higher energy c trap dissociation hcd and charge remote fragmentation fragmentation is

a discontinuous affix is an affix whose phonetic components are not sequential within a word and instead are spread out between or around the phones that comprise the root the word root is often an abstract series of three consonants though single consonant biliteral and quadriliteral roots do exist an example of a triconsonantal root would be d r b in arabic which can be inflected to create forms such as daraba he beat and idribunna beat them feminine while triconsonantal roots are widely considered to be the most common state some linguists posit that biliteral roots may in fact be the default though at least one scholar is skeptical of the legitimacy of these claims transfixes are placed into these roots in assigned positions dictated by templates which are tied to the specific meaning of a given inflection or derivation the transfixes in the examples above are a a a and i i unna transfixes are different from prefixes suffixes and infixes in that a complete transfix is the entire structure which is placed into a root a transfix is not a combination of prefixes suffixes and infixes but its own unique structure which is split through a word

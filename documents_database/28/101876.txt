therefore playfair s axiom given a line l and a point p not on l there is exactly one line parallel to l that passes through p is fundamental in affine geometry comparisons of figures in affine geometry are made with affine transformations which are mappings that preserve alignment of points and parallelism of lines affine geometry can be developed in two ways that are essentially equivalent in synthetic geometry an affine space is a set of points to which is associated a set of lines which satisfy some axioms such as playfair s axiom affine geometry can also be developed on the basis of linear algebra in this context an affine space is a set of points equipped with a set of transformations that is bijective mappings the translations which forms a vector space over a given field commonly the real numbers and such that for any given ordered pair of points there is a unique translation sending the first point to the second the composition of two translations is their sum in the vector space of the translations in more concrete terms this amounts to having an operation that associates to any ordered pair of points a vector

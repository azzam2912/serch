the coins are stacked with pieces of electrolyte soaked paper in between see diagram at right the penny battery experiment is common during electrochemistry units in an educational setting each cell in a penny battery can produce up to 0 8 volt and many can be stacked together to produce higher voltages since the battery is a wet cell the effectiveness will be reduced when the electrolyte evaporates as the name implies canadian pennies from 1997 1999 may serve the zinc electrode and 1942 1996 pennies as the copper alternatively american pennies from 1982 present may be used as the zinc electrodes and 1944 1982 pennies as the copper electrodes a variety of other coins may also be used with varying results a penny battery can be useful in producing a small amount of voltage to make a penny battery it is crucial that there are two different kinds of metals with a substance in between them to begin scratch off the copper coating on one side of a penny exposing the metal zinc silver color this process will be difficult and will take some time it is beneficial to have at least 5 pennies so that enough volts can

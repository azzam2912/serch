they use the latest flow technology to ensure that the design flow rate is achieved at all times irrespective of any pressure changes within the system a cooling or heating water distribution system is in balance when the flow in the whole system through the component terminal lines distributing lines and main distributing lines corresponds to the flow rates that were specified for the design of the system if the correct balancing of the system is not established this will result in unequal distribution of the flow so that there will be a surplus effect in some of the terminals whereas the effect will be inadequate in others as a consequence the required heating or cooling will not be ensured in all parts of the installation practically it is not possible to achieve a completely balanced system by manipulation of the piping or alteration of the pipe dimensions only only a correct set of balancing valves can ensure the correct distribution of the flow in the system in a variable primary chilled water system the design flow rate is determined by the water flow velocity in the tube of the coils automatic balancing systems can be classified as constant flow

put simply creeth and his nottingham colleagues conducted chemical experiments which demonstrated the hydrogen pair bonding in the molecule in his phd thesis he additionally postulated and sketched a molecular structure for dna based on hydrogen bonds linking overlapped shorter chains together to form a longer almost double chain in creeth s model the hydrogen bonded bases are on the inside of the molecule which has a phosphate sugar backbone but there is no helical structure as the x ray data was not yet available to provide the data to imply the double helix formation later discerned by crick and watson given it was such a critical discovery the nottingham team and creeth s role in it have sometimes lacked recognition in the original version of the double helix watson admitted to initially having dismissed their work incorrectly only to find that a rereading of j m gulland s and d o jordan s papers made me finally realize the strength of their conclusion that a large fraction if not all of the bases formed hydrogen bonds to other bases once watson had recognised the key role of the hydrogen bonds then the correct solution to the decoding of dna

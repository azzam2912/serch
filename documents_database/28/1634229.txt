an nfp contains a cantilevered micro fluidic device terminated in a nanofountain the embedded microfluidics facilitates rapid and continuous delivery of molecules from the on chip reservoirs to the fountain tip when the tip is brought into contact with the substrate a liquid meniscus forms providing a path for molecular transport to the substrate by controlling the geometry of the meniscus through hold time and deposition speed various inks and biomolecules could be patterned on a surface with sub 100 nm resolution the advent of dip pen nanolithography dpn in recent years represented a revolution in nanoscale patterning technology with sub 100 nanometer resolution and an architecture conducive to massive parallelization dpn is capable of producing large arrays of nanoscale features as such conventional dpn and other probe based techniques are generally limited in their rate of deposition and by the need for repeated re inking during extended patterning to address these challenges nanofountain probe was developed by espinosa et al where microchannels were embedded in afm probes to transport ink or bio molecules from reservoirs to substrates realizing continuous writing at the nanoscale integration of continuous liquid ink feeding within the nfp facilitates more rapid deposition and eliminates the

measuring of the quantity of electricity coulombs is based on the changes of the mass of the mercury electrode mass of the electrode can be increased during cathodic deposition of the mercury ions or decreased during the anodic dissolution of the metal where this coulometer has different constructions but all of them are based on mass measurements the device consists of two reservoirs connected by a thin graduated capillary tube containing a solution of the mercury ii ions each of the reservoirs has an electrode immersed in a drop of mercury another small drop of mercury is inserted into the capillary when the current is turned on it initiates dissolution of the metallic mercury on one side of the drop in the capillary and deposition on the other side of the same drop this drop starts to move because of the high efficiency of the deposition dissolution of the mercury under the current influence the mass or volume of this small drop is constant and its movement is linearly correlated with the passed charge if the direction of the current is changed the drop moves in the opposite direction the sensitivity of this type of coulometer depends on the diameter

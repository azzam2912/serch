waveguides are hollow metal tubes inside which an electromagnetic wave may be transmitted filters are devices used to allow signals at some frequencies to pass the passband while others are rejected the stopband filters are a basic component of electronic engineering designs and have numerous applications these include selection of signals and limitation of noise waveguide filters are most useful in the microwave band of frequencies where they are a convenient size and have low loss examples of microwave filter use are found in satellite communications telephone networks and television broadcasting waveguide filters were developed during world war ii to meet the needs of radar and electronic countermeasures but afterwards soon found civilian applications such as use in microwave links much of post war development was concerned with reducing the bulk and weight of these filters first by using new analysis techniques that led to elimination of unnecessary components then by innovations such as dual mode cavities and novel materials such as ceramic resonators a particular feature of waveguide filter design concerns the mode of transmission systems based on pairs of conducting wires and similar technologies have only one mode of transmission in waveguide systems any number of modes are

hydrofuramide is a crystalline solid with a melting point of 118 119 c the molecule may be described as a diimine with three pendant furanyl rings hydrofuramide is a versatile specialty chemical with applications in diverse areas including rubber additives pharmaceutical intermediates preservatives and rodenticides hydrofuramide was prepared in 1960 by kapur via the reaction of furfural with aqueous ammonia in chilled ethanol solution the reactive imine double bonds of hydrofuramide are easily reduced reduction with aqueous sodium borohydride yields n n bisfurfuryl 2 furylmethanediamine useful as an antihypertensive drug compound catalytic hydrogenation of hydrofuramide with raney nickel in the presence of ammonia in ethanol yields mixtures of furfurylamine and difurfurylamine by contrast hydrogenation in acetic acid ethanol employing platinum oxide catalyst yielded the tertiary amine tri furfurylamine after neutralization furthermore lithium aluminium hydride reduction of hydrofuramide yields furfurin a tetracyclic compound hydrofuramide has shown effectiveness as a synergist with zinc stearate in enhancing the rate of vulcanization of styrene butadiene rubber similar synergistic effect was seen in the vulcanization of natural rubber with hydrofuramide sulfenamide activator where introduction of hydrofuramide reduced induction time scorch time and optimum cure time hydrofuramide has been found to be selectively toxic to rats

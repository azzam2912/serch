langford pairings are named after c dudley langford who posed the problem of constructing them in 1958 langford s problem is the task of finding langford pairings for a given value of n the closely related concept of a skolem sequence is defined in the same way but instead permutes the sequence 0 0 1 1 n 1 n 1 for example a langford pairing for n 3 is given by the sequence 2 3 1 2 1 3 langford pairings exist only when n is congruent to 0 or 3 modulo 4 for instance there is no langford pairing when n 1 2 or 5 the numbers of different langford pairings for n 1 2 counting any sequence as being the same as its reversal are as describes the problem of listing all langford pairings for a given n can be solved as an instance of the exact cover problem but for large n the number of solutions can be calculated more efficiently by algebraic methods used skolem sequences to construct steiner triple systems in the 1960s e j groth used langford pairings to construct circuits for integer multiplication

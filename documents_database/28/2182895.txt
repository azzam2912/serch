there are many different levels and scales of nuclear organisation at the smallest scale dna is packaged into units called nucleosomes the quantity and organisation of these nucleosomes can affect the accessibility of local chromatin this has a knock on effect on the expression of nearby genes additionally determining whether or not they can be regulated by transcription factors at slightly larger scales dna looping can physically bring together dna elements that would otherwise be separated by large distances these interactions allow regulatory signals to cross over large genomic distances for example from enhancers to promoters in contrast on a large scale the arrangement of chromosomes can determine their properties chromosomes are organised into two compartments labelled a active and b inactive each with distinct properties moreover entire chromosomes segregate into distinct regions called chromosome territories each human cell contains around two metres of dna which must be tightly folded to fit inside the cell nucleus however in order for the cell to function proteins must be able to access the sequence information contained within the dna in spite of its tightly packed nature hence the cell has a number of mechanisms in place to control how dna is organized

it was completed by 1819 to provide better access to the town but was not a commercial success and was abandoned in the 1880s after the arrival of the railways in 1578 john leslie the bishop of ross produced a map of scotland which was published in rome dingwall was of sufficient importance to be included on the map and when james vi awarded it a burgh charter in 1587 it mentioned cobles and small boats however there was a problem caused by the deposition of alluvium from the rivers conon and orrin which made access more difficult and by 1773 the burgh was in a depressed state there is some indication that improvements were made to the river soon afterwards on a plan dated 1777 but a major scheme was actioned in 1815 the river peffery was made deeper and wider to allow boats to reach the town the project was designed by the canal engineer thomas telford and involved diverting the river through a temporary cut so that a new course for it could be constructed the work was completed by 1819 at a total cost of 4 365 to which the burgh had contributed 100 in 1815

usage of precompiled headers may significantly reduce compilation time especially when applied to large header files header files that include many other header files or header files that are included in many translation units in the c and c programming languages a header file is a file whose text may be automatically included in another source file by the c preprocessor by the use of a preprocessor directive in the source file header files can sometimes contain very large amounts of source code for instance the header files codice 1 and codice 2 on microsoft windows and os x respectively this is especially true with the advent of large header libraries that make extensive use of templates like the eigen math library and boost c libraries they are written almost entirely as header files that the user codice 3s rather than being linked at runtime thus each time the user compiles their program the user is essentially recompiling numerous header libraries as well these would be precompiled into shared objects or dynamic link libraries in non header libraries to reduce compilation times some compilers allow header files to be compiled into a form that is faster for the compiler to

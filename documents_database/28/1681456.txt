the exemplar software encompasses laboratory information management electronic laboratory notebook molecular diagnostics biomarker discovery and data management sapio sciences was founded in 2004 to develop software tools to address the growing genotyping need for tools to assist in analyzing genetics data particularly in relation to genome wide association studies sapio s exemplar analytics software grew to incorporate over 50 different algorithms sapio was subsequently approached by customers to develop a laboratory information management system lims this led to the development of exemplar lims in june 2007 with several extensions since then the company targets highly regulated environments such as part 11 glp and clia laboratories exemplar was introduced in 2007 as a lims and electronic laboratory notebook product the software was subsequently expanded to perform additional tasks workflow and data tracking features were introduced in 2008 to allow the software to be used for scientific data management sdms statistics have also be implemented to perform detailed analysis of scientific data within the same environment the original exemplar workflow engine was optimised for tracking well defined and repeatable lab processes such as in clinical lab settings and these features are still retained in later software packages in 2015 sapio introduced the

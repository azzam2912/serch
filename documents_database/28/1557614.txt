powers of 3 represent movements by intervals of perfect fifths plus one octave which can be removed by multiplying by 1 2 i e 2 powers of 5 represent intervals of major thirds plus two octaves removable by multiplying by 1 4 i e 2 thus 5 limit tunings are constructed entirely from stacking of three basic purely tuned intervals octaves thirds and fifths since the perception of consonance seems related to low numbers in the harmonic series and 5 limit tuning relies on the three lowest primes 5 limit tuning should be capable of producing very consonant harmonies hence 5 limit tuning is considered a method for obtaining just intonation the number of potential intervals pitch classes pitches key centers chords and modulations available to 5 limit tunings is unlimited because no nonzero integer power of any prime equals any power of any other prime so the available intervals can be imagined to extend indefinitely in a 3 dimensional lattice one dimension or one direction for each prime if octaves are ignored it can be seen as a 2 dimensional lattice of pitch classes note names extending indefinitely in two directions however most tuning systems designed for acoustic instruments

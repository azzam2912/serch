features associated with it include faecal occult blood testing is usually positive laboratory investigations normally show anaemia and low albumin a mutation in the cytosolic phospholipase a2 gene pla2g4a has been identified as the cause of this disease in one family in this family the mutation was inherited as an autosomal recessive it is not yet known if this gene is the cause of this disease in other families the gene encoding cytosolic phospholipase a2 is found on chromosome 1 cytosolic phospholipase a2 acts on membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid a precursor in the synthesis of eicosanoids the eicosanoids are involved in multiple regulatory pathways this disease is characterised by multifocal stenosing ulceration of the small intestine the ulcers are circular or irregular in shape and their margins are always clear the intervening mucosa appears normal the lesions involve only the mucosa and submucosa and are confined to the jejunum and proximal ileum nonspecific inflammatory changes are present giant cells or other typical features of granulomatous inflammation are not found multiple stenoses are typically present mean 8 range 1 25 this may be difficult given the non specific nature of the presenting symptoms and the rarity of the condition

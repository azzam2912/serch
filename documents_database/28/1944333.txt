it involves the analysis of the changes in sound frequency generated when a solute dissolves in a solvent by harnessing the hot chocolate effect first described by frank s crawford the technique is partly based on the solubility difference of gas in pure solvents and in solutions the dissolution of a compound in a pure solvent results in the generation of gas bubbles in the solvent due to the lowering of gas solubility in the resulting solution as well as the introduction of gases with the solute the presence of these gas bubbles increases the compressibility of the solution thereby lowering the velocity of sound in the solution this effect can be monitored by means of the frequency change of acoustic resonances that are mechanically produced in the solvent water is approximately 800 times more dense than air however air is approximately 15 000 times more compressible than water the velocity of sound in a homogeneous liquid or gas is given by the following equation where is the mass density and k the compressibility of the gas or liquid k is given as where v is the volume of the medium and dv is the volume decrease due to the

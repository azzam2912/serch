the kinds of living organisms currently known on earth all use carbon compounds for basic structural and metabolic functions water as a solvent and dna or rna to define and control their form if life exists on other planets or moons it may be chemically similar it is also possible that there are organisms with quite different chemistries for instance involving other classes of carbon compounds compounds of another element or another solvent in place of water the possibility of life forms being based on alternative biochemistries is the topic of an ongoing scientific discussion informed by what is known about extraterrestrial environments and about the chemical behaviour of various elements and compounds it is also a common subject in science fiction the element silicon has been much discussed as a hypothetical alternative to carbon silicon is in the same group as carbon on the periodic table and like carbon it is tetravalent hypothetical alternatives to water include ammonia which like water is a polar molecule and cosmically abundant and non polar hydrocarbon solvents such as methane and ethane which are known to exist in liquid form on the surface of titan notes all information referenced and cited below perhaps

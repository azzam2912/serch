realisations of brownian excursion processes are essentially just realizations of a wiener process selected to satisfy certain conditions in particular a brownian excursion process is a wiener process conditioned to be positive and to take the value 0 at time 1 alternatively it is a brownian bridge process conditioned to be positive beps are important because among other reasons they naturally arise as the limit process of a number of conditional functional central limit theorems a brownian excursion process formula 1 is a wiener process or brownian motion conditioned to be positive and to take the value 0 at time 1 alternatively it is a brownian bridge process conditioned to be positive another representation of a brownian excursion formula 1 in terms of a brownian motion process w due to paul l vy and noted by kiyosi it and henry p mckean jr is in terms of the last time formula 3 that w hits zero before time 1 and the first time formula 4 that brownian motion formula 5 hits zero after time 1 let formula 7 be the time that a brownian bridge process formula 8 achieves its minimum on 0 1 vervaat 1979 shows that vervaat s

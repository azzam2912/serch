the with respect to part is necessary for drawing the strict nonstrict distinction a polygon nonstrictly monotone with respect to l is strictly monotone with respect to a line l rotated from l by a sufficiently small angle assume that l coincides with the x axis then the leftmost and rightmost vertices of a monotone polygon decompose its boundary into two monotone polygonal chains such that when the vertices of any chain are being traversed in their natural order their x coordinates are monotonically increasing or decreasing in fact this property may be taken for the definition of monotone polygon and it gives the polygon its name a convex polygon is monotone with respect to any straight line and a polygon which is monotone with respect to every straight line is convex a linear time algorithm is known to report all directions in which a given simple polygon is monotone it was generalized to report all ways to decompose a simple polygon into two monotone chains possibly monotone in different directions point in polygon queries with respect to a monotone polygon may be answered in logarithmic time after linear time preprocessing to find the leftmost and rightmost vertices a monotone

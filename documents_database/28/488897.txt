the arachnoid mater is a derivative of the neural crest mesectoderm in the embryo it is interposed between the two other meninges the more superficial and much thicker dura mater and the deeper pia mater from which it is separated by the subarachnoid space the delicate arachnoid layer is not attached to the inside of the dura but against it and surrounds the brain and spinal cord it does not line the brain down into its sulci folds as does the pia mater with the exception of the longitudinal fissure which divides the left and right cerebral hemispheres cerebrospinal fluid csf flows under the arachnoid in the subarachnoid space the arachnoid mater makes arachnoid villi small protrusions through the dura mater into the venous sinuses of the brain which allow csf to exit the subarachnoid space and enter the blood stream the arachnoid mater and dura mater are very close together throughout the cranium and spinal canal all the way to s2 where the two layers fuse into one and end in the filum terminale which attaches to the coccygeal end of the spinal canal sandwiched between the dura and arachnoid maters lie some veins that connect the brain s

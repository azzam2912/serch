this biotransformation involves a sulfotransferase enzyme catalyzing the transfer of a sulfo group from a donor cosubstrate usually 3 phosphoadenosine 5 phosphosulfate paps to a substrate molecule s hydroxyl or amine sulfation is involved in a variety of biological processes including detoxification hormone regulation molecular recognition cell signaling and viral entry into cells it is among the reactions in phase ii drug metabolism frequently effective in rendering a xenobiotic less active from a pharmacological and toxicological standpoint but sometimes playing a role in the activation of xenobiotics e g aromatic amines methyl substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons another example of biological sulfation is in the synthesis of sulfonated glycosaminoglycans such as heparin heparan sulfate chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate sulfation is also a possible posttranslational modification of proteins tyrosine sulfation is a posttranslational modification in which a tyrosine residue of a protein is sulfated by a tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase tpst typically in the golgi apparatus secreted proteins and extracellular parts of membrane proteins that pass through the golgi apparatus may be sulfated such sulfation was first discovered by bettelheim in bovine fibrinopeptide b in 1954 and later found be present in animals and plants but not in prokaryotes or in yeasts sulfation

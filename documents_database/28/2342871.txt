the equation is another form of the richardson richards equation the key difference being that the dependent variable is the position of the wetting front formula 1 which is a function of the water content and media properties the soil moisture velocity equation consists of two terms the first advection like term was developed by talbot and ogden and extended to the water table by ogden et al as verified against data collected in a column experimental that was patterned after the famous experiment by childs poulovassilis 1962 and against exact solutions the soil moisture velocity equation or smve is an alternative interpretation of the richards equation wherein the dependent variable is the position z of a wetting front of a particular moisture content formula 2 with time where the first term on the right hand side of the smve is called the advection like term while the second term is called the diffusion like term the advection like term of the soil moisture velocity equation is particularly useful for calculating the advance of wetting fronts for a liquid invading an unsaturated porous medium under the combined action of gravity and capillarity because it is convertible to an ordinary differential

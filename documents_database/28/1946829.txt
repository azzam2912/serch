it is a dark blue crystalline solid it is used as a catalyst for organic synthesis dichlorobis triphenylphosphine nickel ii is a commercially available reagent the blue isomer is prepared by treating hydrated nickel chloride with triphenylphosphine in alcohols or glacial acetic acid when allowed to crystallise from chlorinated solvents the tetrahedral isomer converts to the square planar isomer the square planar form is red and diamagnetic the phosphine ligands are trans with respective ni p and ni cl distances of 2 24 and 2 17 the blue form is paramagnetic and features tetrahedral ni ii centers in this isomer the ni p and ni cl distances are elongated at 2 32 and 2 21 as illustrated by the title complexes tetrahedral and square planar isomers coexist in solutions of various four coordinated nickel ii complexes weak field ligands as judged by the spectrochemical series favor tetrahedral geometry and strong field ligands favor the square planar isomer both weak field cl and strong field pph ligands comprise nicl pph hence this compound is borderline between the two geometries steric effects also affect the equilibrium larger ligands favoring the less crowded tetrahedral geometry the complex was first described by walter reppe

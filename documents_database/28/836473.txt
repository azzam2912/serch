terminal symbols are the elementary symbols of the language defined by a formal grammar nonterminal symbols or syntactic variables are replaced by groups of terminal symbols according to the production rules the terminals and nonterminals of a particular grammar are two disjoint sets terminal symbols are literal symbols which may appear in the outputs of the production rules of a formal grammar and which cannot be changed using the rules of the grammar applying the rules recursively to a source string of symbols will usually terminate in a final output string consisting only of terminal symbols consider a grammar defined by two rules using pictoric marks interacting with each other here codice 4 is a terminal symbol because no rule exists which would change it into something else on the other hand codice 1 has two rules that can change it thus it is nonterminal a formal language defined or generated by a particular grammar is the set of strings that can be produced by the grammar and that consist only of terminal symbols nonterminal symbols are those symbols which can be replaced they may also be called simply syntactic variables a formal grammar includes a start symbol a designated

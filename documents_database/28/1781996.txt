imagine an amoeba which undergoes symmetrical fission into two sister amoebae call them b and c we tend to think that before fission there was one amoeba call it a but what has happened to it it has not died for death is a biological state and there are no dead amoebae lying around after the fission in fact there is more life after the fission than there was before i e two live amoebae instead of just one has a somehow ceased to exist without dying is a still around and identical with either b or c it cannot be identified with both b and c for identity is a transitive relation and b is certainly not the same amoeba as c yet the fission was symmetrical so neither b nor c has any more or less claim to be a than the other this is the problem we seem to be forced to say that a has ceased to exist but the m o view provides us with another option consistent with all of the above considerations the m o view is that there were two distinct but coincident amoebae before fission occupying the same body of matter

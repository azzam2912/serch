esterases in turn are one type of the several hydrolases known thioesterases exhibit esterase activity splitting of an ester into acid and alcohol in the presence of water specifically at a thiol group thioesterases or thiolester hydrolases are identified as members of e c 3 1 2 the thioesterase activity is performed by members of the acyl coa thioesterase acot family the regulatory role of acot in fatty acid metabolism depends on their substrate specificity tissue expression and subcellular localization for example deactivation of fatty acids at the er may traffic fatty acids away from pathways associated with the er membrane such as glycerolipid biosynthesis two structurally different acot types lead to a similar enzymatic activity in vitro dividing the family into type i and type ii acots type i acots acot1 6 contain the hydrolase domain which is also present in many lipases and esterases type ii acots acot7 15 have a characteristic structural motif called the hotdog fold domain acetyl coa hydrolase palmitoyl coa hydrolase succinyl coa hydrolase formyl coa hydrolase acyl coa hydrolase are a few examples of this group of enzymes ubiquitin thiolesterase is a well known example whose structure has been analyzed humans genes which

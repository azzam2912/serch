one semi significant difference is that replacing sonny chiba you have kurata playing a martial arts master who joins the osone gang with his own agenda the opponents for our heroine are still the same selection of fighters with different talents each introduced with a caption describing their origin but these seem significantly more restrained than first time round outside of the transsexual killer with her lethal fingernails don anelli writing for the asian movie pulse stated while on the surface providing pretty much exactly what s needed in terms of fine martial arts battles and a simplistic story to set that up sister street fighter 2 comes off as a lower version of the original in most regards as it s still worthwhile and watchable give this a chance if you re a fan of the first one or a general film of these kinds of films from that era while viewers who aren t into martial arts efforts or weren t fans of the original should heed caution

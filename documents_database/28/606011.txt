rings are formed when weakly soluble salts are produced from reaction of two soluble substances one of which is dissolved in a gel medium the phenomenon is most commonly seen as rings in a petri dish or bands in a test tube however more complex patterns have been observed such as dislocations of the ring structure in a petri dish helices and saturn rings in a test tube despite continuous investigation since rediscovery of the rings in 1896 the mechanism for the formation of liesegang rings is still unclear the phenomenon was first noticed in 1855 by the german chemist friedlieb ferdinand runge he observed them in the course of experiments on the precipitation of reagents in blotting paper in 1896 the german chemist raphael e liesegang noted the phenomenon when he dropped a solution of silver nitrate onto a thin layer of gel containing potassium dichromate after a few hours sharp concentric rings of insoluble silver dichromate formed it has aroused the curiosity of chemists for many years when formed in a test tube by diffusing one component from the top layers or bands of precipitate form rather than rings the reactions are most usually carried out in test

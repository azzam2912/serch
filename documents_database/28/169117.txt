these changes are usually undesirable such as cracking and chemical disintegration of products or more rarely desirable as in biodegradation or deliberately lowering the molecular weight of a polymer for recycling the changes in properties are often termed aging in a finished product such a change is to be prevented or delayed degradation can be useful for recycling reusing the polymer waste to prevent or reduce environmental pollution degradation can also be induced deliberately to assist structure determination polymeric molecules are very large on the molecular scale and their unique and useful properties are mainly a result of their size any loss in chain length lowers tensile strength and is a primary cause of premature cracking today there are primarily seven commodity polymers in use polyethylene polypropylene polyvinyl chloride polyethylene terephthalate pet pete polystyrene polycarbonate and poly methyl methacrylate plexiglas these make up nearly 98 of all polymers and plastics encountered in daily life each of these polymers has its own characteristic modes of degradation and resistances to heat light and chemicals polyethylene polypropylene and poly methyl methacrylate are sensitive to oxidation and uv radiation while pvc may discolor at high temperatures due to loss of hydrogen chloride gas and

extremal graph theory studies extremal maximal or minimal graphs which satisfy a certain property extremality can be taken with respect to different graph invariants such as order size or girth more abstractly it studies how global properties of a graph influence local substructures of the graph for example a simple extremal graph theory question is which acyclic graphs on n vertices have the maximum number of edges the extremal graphs for this question are trees on n vertices which have n 1 edges more generally a typical question is the following given a graph property p an invariant u and a set of graphs h we wish to find the minimum value of m such that every graph in h which has u larger than m possess property p in the example above h was the set of n vertex graphs p was the property of being cyclic and u was the number of edges in the graph thus every graph on n vertices with more than n 1 edges must contain a cycle several foundational results in extremal graph theory are questions of the above mentioned form for instance the question of how many edges an n vertex graph

it is a widely used effect in graphics software typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail the visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen distinctly different from the bokeh effect produced by an out of focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination gaussian smoothing is also used as a pre processing stage in computer vision algorithms in order to enhance image structures at different scales see scale space representation and scale space implementation mathematically applying a gaussian blur to an image is the same as convolving the image with a gaussian function this is also known as a two dimensional weierstrass transform by contrast convolving by a circle i e a circular box blur would more accurately reproduce the bokeh effect since the fourier transform of a gaussian is another gaussian applying a gaussian blur has the effect of reducing the image s high frequency components a gaussian blur is thus a low pass filter the gaussian blur is a type of image blurring filter that uses a gaussian function which also expresses the normal distribution in statistics for calculating the transformation

an improvement on the earlier the boats had slight internal differences the most significant improvement was the use of thicker higher yield strength steel in the pressure hull skins and frames which increased their test depth to tang actually achieved a depth of during a test dive and exceeded that test depth when taking on water in the forward torpedo room while evading a destroyer the balao s were similar to the gato s except they were modified to increase test depth from to in late 1941 two of the navy s leading submarine designers captain andrew mckee and commander armand morgan met to explore increasing diving depth in a redesigned gato a switch to a new high tensile steel hts alloy combined with an increase in hull thickness from to would result in a test depth of and a collapse depth of however the limited capacity of the trim pump at deep depths and lack of time to design a new pump caused rear admiral e l cochrane chief of the bureau of ships to limit test depth to fortunately in 1944 a redesigned gould centrifugal pump replaced the noisy early war pump and effective diving depth was increased

branch and bound search computation on sparse matrices etc on distributed architectures it is distributed under the gpl pm2 adheres to the spmd single program multiple data programming model in a way very similar to the pvm and mpi communication libraries the user writes a single program text a copy of which is launched by a specific load command on each processing node of the current configuration it is up to the programmer to include branching so as to differentiate between the processing nodes this way it allows a network of heterogeneous machines to be used as a single distributed parallel processor it is primarily designed for medium size clusters of commodity processing nodes interconnected by high performance networks but nothing prevents the use on massively parallel mimd machines at one end of the spectrum or as a support for metacomputing over the internet on the other end it supports heterogeneous networking configurations such as sets of interconnected clusters distinguishing features of pm2 include its priority driven scheduling policy its thread migration mechanisms and its ability to ease the development of various load balancing policies it can manage several hundreds of threads on each available physical processor the pm2 interface

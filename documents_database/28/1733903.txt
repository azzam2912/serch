the invention of the telephone in 1876 created further demand for copper wire as an electrical conductor copper is the electrical conductor in many categories of electrical wiring copper wire is used in power generation power transmission power distribution telecommunications electronics circuitry and countless types of electrical equipment copper and its alloys are also used to make electrical contacts electrical wiring in buildings is the most important market for the copper industry roughly half of all copper mined is used to manufacture electrical wire and cable conductors electrical conductivity is a measure of how well a material transports an electric charge this is an essential property in electrical wiring systems copper has the highest electrical conductivity rating of all non precious metals the electrical resistivity of copper 16 78 n m at 20 c specially pure oxygen free electronic ofe copper is about 1 more conductive i e achieves a minimum of 101 iacs the theory of metals in their solid state helps to explain the unusually high electrical conductivity of copper in a copper atom the outermost 4s energy zone or conduction band is only half filled so many electrons are able to carry electric current when an electric

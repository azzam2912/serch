only about half of the known species are living taxa the others are fossils but they are known from all parts of the world undoubtedly many more await discovery as they are easily overlooked and difficult to study due to their extremely small size most have an overall length of around 0 3 mm virtually nothing is known about the biology of these insects but because of their size and simple ovipositors entomologists assume they are idiobiont parasitoids on the eggs of various insects they were originally treated as an aberrant subfamily of the chalcidoid family mymaridae but because of morphological differences are now usually considered in their own superfamily mymarommatoidea and their similarity to mymaridae is thought to be a result of convergent evolution as taxonomists have examined this group more closely they have become less certain about which other group of wasps represents the nearest living relatives of the mymarommatidae in recent years some have claimed the nearest relatives are the extinct family serphitidae and therefore claim the mymarommatidae are essentially living fossils the sole surviving lineage of an otherwise extinct superfamily serphitoidea it remains to be seen whether this change in classification will be accepted but it

one was the breda and the other was the cannone mitragliera da 20 77 scotti which was first designed in 1932 and produced by the swiss oerlikon company they originally used a 60 round drum that was eventually discarded in favor of 12 round trays for the ammunition compared to the breda the scotti was a far simpler weapon it resembled the oerlikon in some respects but used a different mechanism the scotti was easier to manufacture than the breda but despite using a longer barrel the scotti s overall performance was inferior the same ammunition type was used but based on the lower effective ceiling with a different propellant charge to balance this when used against targets at low altitude the rate of fire was slightly higher and for the benefit of the crew the scotti was made lighter the scotti was used in smaller numbers than the breda but by many other nations such as china and many of the south american countries after 1942 the ease of fabrication led to an increase in production totals but the type never seriously challenged the number of bredas in service before 1943 many scottis were used by german troops in

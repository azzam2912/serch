it describes the character of the representation of g a on the discrete part l g f g a of l g f g a in terms of geometric data where g is a reductive algebraic group defined over a global field f and a is the ring of adeles of f there are several different versions of the trace formula the first version was the unrefined trace formula whose terms depend on truncation operators and have the disadvantage that they are not invariant arthur later found the invariant trace formula and the stable trace formula which are more suitable for applications the simple trace formula is less general but easier to prove the local trace formula is an analogue over local fields jacquet s relative trace formula is a generalization where one integrates the kernel function over non diagonal subgroups in the rare case when g f g a is compact the representation splits as a direct sum of irreducible representations and the trace formula is similar to the frobenius formula for the character of the representation induced from the trivial representation of a subgroup of finite index in the compact case which is essentially due to selberg the

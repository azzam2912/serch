the first comprehensive review on the subject was published in 2017 by the chemist and soil scientist timothy a doane but the term photogeochemistry appeared a few years earlier as a keyword in studies that described the role of light induced mineral transformations in shaping the biogeochemistry of earth this indeed describes the core of photogeochemical study although other facets may be admitted into the definition the context of a photogeochemical reaction is implicitly the surface of earth since that is where sunlight is available although other sources of light such as chemiluminescence would not be strictly excluded from photogeochemical study reactions may occur among components of land such as rocks soil and detritus components of surface water such as sediment and dissolved organic matter and components of the atmospheric boundary layer directly influenced by contact with land or water such as mineral aerosols and gases visible and medium to long wave ultraviolet radiation is the main source of energy for photogeochemical reactions wavelengths of light shorter than about 290 nm are completely absorbed by the present atmosphere and are therefore practically irrelevant except in consideration of atmospheres different from that of earth today photogeochemical reactions are limited to chemical

depending on the acoustics of a venue certain frequencies may be resonant and will be more prone to feedback to ring out a room a sound technician will raise the gain or fader controls on a mixing desk to induce an audio system to feedback once feedback occurs the technician uses an equalizer usually a graphic equalizer to reduce the gain on the appropriate band or frequency the frequency of the feedback can be identified using a spectrum analyzer this is repeated until feedback is sufficiently reduced without compromising the quality of the sound ringing out is particularly important when mixing monitors or foldback as the performer or musician is usually behind the main pa system the monitors are so they can hear themselves as such a microphone is much more likely to feedback through the monitor loudspeakers than the main pa ringing out can become quite complex when working with a large number of microphones and monitors indeed with larger touring acts one of the major advantages of the rise in use of in ear monitors is the minimal ringing out that needs to be done hardware exists that can perform many of the same functions that ringing out

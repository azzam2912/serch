g9a catalyzes the mono and di methylated states of histone h3 at lysine residue 9 i e h3k9me1 and h3k9me2 and lysine residue 27 h3k27me1 and hek27me2 a cluster of genes bat1 bat5 has been localized in the vicinity of the genes for tnf alpha and tnf beta this gene is found near this cluster it was mapped near the gene for c2 within a 120 kb region that included a hsp70 gene pair these genes are all within the human major histocompatibility complex class iii region this gene was thought to be two different genes ng36 and g9a adjacent to each other but a recent publication shows that there is only a single gene the protein encoded by this gene is thought to be involved in intracellular protein protein interaction there are three alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene but only two are fully described g9a and g9a like protein another histone lysine n methyltransferase catalyze the synthesis of h3k9me2 which is a repressive mark g9a is an important control mechanism for epigenetic regulation within the nucleus accumbens nacc reduced g9a expression in the nacc plays a central role in mediating the development of an addiction g9a opposes

it precipitates on the sea floor or within the sediment as an authigenic mud thanks to physicochemical microbial photosynthetic and biochemical processes it has peculiar fabrics and uniform mineralogical and chemical composition automicrite deposits are found in different environments as lakes tidal flats or the aphotic zone of marine slopes and basins however the environment where automicrite is most common is in carbonate mud mounds a type of carbonate platform in this kind of carbonate platform common in the geological past but nearly absent today automicrite deposits made carbonate structures of many tens to hundreds of metres of relief called mud mounds automicritic mud mounds seemed to form more easily in areas of low sedimentation rate of siliciclastic extrabasinal sediment usually the presence of mud in sedimentary rocks is an indicator of low energy conditions in a depositional system so in high energy conditions it is nearly impossible to find mud instead automicrite can precipitate internally in cavities and sediment pores below the sediment water interface also in sediments that are formed in high energy condition automicrite can also crystallize in suspension within cavities and then deposit on the cavity bottom usually this process forms peloids a kind of carbonate

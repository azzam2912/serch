it has 12 regular decagonal faces 20 regular triangular faces 60 vertices and 90 edges this polyhedron can be formed from a dodecahedron by truncating cutting off the corners so the pentagon faces become decagons and the corners become triangles it is used in the cell transitive hyperbolic space filling tessellation the bitruncated icosahedral honeycomb the area a and the volume v of a truncated dodecahedron of edge length a are cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a truncated dodecahedron with edge length 2 2 centered at the origin are all even permutations of where is the golden ratio the truncated dodecahedron has five special orthogonal projections centered on a vertex on two types of edges and two types of faces hexagonal and pentagonal the last two correspond to the a and h coxeter planes the truncated dodecahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection this projection is conformal preserving angles but not areas or lengths straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane schlegel diagrams are similar with a perspective projection and straight edges it shares its vertex arrangement with three nonconvex uniform polyhedra

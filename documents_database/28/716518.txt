the enzyme structure and its two step catalytic irreversible mechanism have been well studied pep carboxylase is highly regulated both by phosphorylation and allostery the pep carboxylase enzyme is present in plants and some types of bacteria but not in fungi or animals including humans the genes vary between organisms but are strictly conserved around the active and allosteric sites discussed in the mechanism and regulation sections tertiary structure of the enzyme is also conserved the crystal structure of pep carboxylase in multiple organisms including zea mays maize and escherichia coli has been determined the overall enzyme exists as a dimer of dimers two identical subunits closely interact to form a dimer through salt bridges between arginine r438 exact positions may vary depending on the origin of the gene and glutamic acid e433 residues this dimer assembles more loosely with another of its kind to form the four subunit complex the monomer subunits are mainly composed of alpha helices 65 and have a mass of 106kda each the sequence length is about 966 amino acids the enzyme active site is not completely characterized it includes a conserved aspartic acid d564 and a glutamic acid e566 residue that non covalently bind

iupac prefers the term phosphinate in all cases however in practice hypophosphite is usually used to describe inorganic species e g sodium hypophosphite while phosphinate typically refers to organophosphorus species the hypophosphite ion is the salts are prepared by heating white phosphorus in warm aqueous alkali e g ca oh hypophosphites are reducing agents hypophosphites are used in electroless nickel plating as the reducing agent to deposit for example ni metal from ni salts the hypophosphite ion is thermodynamically unstable and disproportionates on heating to phosphine gas and phosphate salts organophosphinates are organophosphorus compounds with the formula op or r with the simplest example being methylphosphinic acid they can be synthesized by the michaelis arbuzov reaction phosphinites p or r can be oxidized into phosphinates dialkylphosphinic acids are organophosphorus compounds with the formula rpoh where r is any alkyl group they are phosphorus v compounds with tetrahedral molecular geometry under the brand names aerophine and cyanex they are used in extraction and separation i e hydrometallurgy of metal salts from ore extracts characteristically the organic substituents are branched to confer solubility and preclude crystallization the dithiodialkyphosphinic acids rpsh are related to the diorganodithiophosphates with the formula ro psh which are

the album was recorded in 2007 in englewood nj to celebrate his 70th birthday in 2008 and released on the times square label in the same year as his milestone birthday and his subsequent death in the winter george kanzler of jazz times noted this cd is an example of that dynamic at play in jazz a decade ago legendary trumpeter freddie hubbard s playing career seemed shot as he d burned out his lip and couldn t sustain the firebrand style that had always been his trademark especially not in the small group format graham l flanagan of all about jazz wrote while he certainly doesn t possess the fiery octave defying magic heard on early blue note dates hubbard still blows with the same passion and inspiration that cemented his reputation all those years ago his solos usually last for little more than a few choruses but this album is a true collaboration among a large gathering of talented musicians this final taste of hubbard s genius reveals a man who refused to give in to whatever physical limitations he may have been forced to endure responding with nothing but perseverance for the sake of artistry freddie hubbard

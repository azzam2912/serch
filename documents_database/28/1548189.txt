while the best response property in nash equilibrium is necessary for self enforceability it is not generally sufficient when players can jointly deviate in a way that is mutually beneficial the strong nash equilibrium is criticized as too strong in that the environment allows for unlimited private communication in the coalition proof nash equilibrium the private communication is limited formal definition i in a single player single stage game formula 1 formula 2 is a perfectly coalition proof nash equilibrium if and only if formula 3 maximizes formula 4 ii let n t 1 1 assume that perfectly coalition proof nash equilibrium has been defined for all games with m players and s stages where m s n t and m s n t a for any game formula 1 with formula 6 players and formula 7 stages formula 8 is perfectly self enforcing if for all j j s is a perfectly coalition proof nash equilibrium in the game s and if the restriction of s to any proper subgame forms a perfectly coalition proof nash equilibrium in that subgame b for any game with n players and t stages formula 8 is a perfectly coalition proof nash equilibrium

gene disease databases integrate human gene disease associations from various expert curated databases and text mining derived associations including mendelian complex and environmental diseases experts in different areas of biology and bioinformatics have been trying to comprehend the molecular mechanisms of diseases to design preventive and therapeutic strategies for a long time for some illnesses it has become apparent that it is the right amount of animosity is made for not enough to obtain an index of the disease related genes but to uncover how disruptions of molecular grids in the cell give rise to disease phenotypes moreover even with the unprecedented wealth of information available obtaining such catalogues is extremely difficult genetic broadly speaking genetic diseases are caused by aberrations in genes or chromosomes many genetic diseases are developed from before birth genetic disorders account for a significant number of the health care problems in our society advances in the understanding of this diseases have increased both the life span and quality of life for many of those affected by genetic disorders recent developments in bioinformatics and laboratory genetics have made possible the better delineation of certain malformation and mental retardation syndromes so that their mode of inheritance can

that is it measures the actinic or chemical intensity of light as opposed to radiometric or photometric amount of light the earliest actinographs were 24 hour recording devices using a rotating cylinder of photographic paper exposed through a wedged shaped slit to record a graph of actinic light during the period of a day hence the graph suffix in actinograph such devices were developed and described by robert hunt secretary of the royal cornwall polytechnic society in 1845 as an improvement on t b jordan s 1839 heliograph in 1888 ferdinand hurter and vero charles driffield patented a device for estimating the actinic power of sunlight and for computing exposure times and apertures for cameras based on the plate speed time of day time of year and latitude these were slide rules not measuring instruments and did not produce a graph but hurter and driffield adopted the same name for it in 1911 arthur william clayden m a fellow of the royal meteorological society and principal of the royal albert memorial university college of exeter developed a version of an actinograph for meteorologists to observe and record the change of radiation

cable set top boxes need a reliable source of out of band data for information such as program guides channel lineups and updated code images dsg is an extension of the docsis protocol governing cable modems and applies to all versions of docsis the principal features of dsg are the original docsis protocol supports only two way connectivity a cable modem that is unable to acquire an upstream channel will give up and resume scanning for new channels likewise persistent upstream errors will cause a cable modem to reinitialize its mac and scan for new downstream channels this behavior is appropriate for traditional cable modems but not for cable set top boxes a cable set top box still needs to acquire its out of band data even if the upstream channel is impaired the dsg specification introduced one way downstream only modes of operation when upstream errors occur the set top enters a downstream only state periodically attempting to reacquire the upstream channel set top out of band data is generally present only on certain downstream channels the set top needs a way to distinguish a valid downstream containing the set top s data from an invalid one used only

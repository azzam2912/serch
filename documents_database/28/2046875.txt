later on he added roses dahlias and other flowers to his breeding work this business is continued and expanded by his grandson arnaud delbard who is working close with the institut national de la recherche agronomique which is a french governmental organization as well as with other international collaboration for global selective breeding delbard was first in france to create a breeding program for disease resistant apple cultivars located near commentry france it is called delbard pepinieres international this is done internationally by screening selections and mutations of seedlings and variations of the domesticated apple some of which have adapted to resist certain apple diseases another approach is to find the resistant genes in certain species of crab apple which is the ancestor of the domesticated apple and to introduce those desired traits through backcrossing altogether the apples still needs to taste good as well so this involves years of experiments tasting and testing to provide a good apple for the consumer which should be disease resistant and of good flavor texture and looks jean paul reynoird delbard s research director says that only about twenty selections out of 2 000 hybrids initiated will make it till the end delbard

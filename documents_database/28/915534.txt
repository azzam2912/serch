and 0 7834305107 respectively the name sophomore s dream which appears in is in contrast to the name freshman s dream which is given to the incorrect identity the sophomore s dream has a similar too good to be true feel but is true the proofs of the two identities are completely analogous so only the proof of the second is presented here the key ingredients of the proof are in details one expands x as therefore formula 3 by uniform convergence of the power series one may interchange summation and integration to yield to evaluate the above integrals one may change the variable in the integral via the substitution formula 5 with this substitution the bounds of integration are transformed to formula 6 giving the identity by euler s integral identity for the gamma function one has so that summing these and changing indexing so it starts at n 1 instead of n 0 yields the formula the original proof given in and presented in modernized form in differs from the one above in how the termwise integral formula 10 is computed but is otherwise the same omitting technical details to justify steps such as termwise integration rather than

the comparative method has a long history in evolutionary biology indeed charles darwin used differences and similarities between species as a major source of evidence in the origin of species however the fact that closely related lineages share many traits and trait combinations as a result of the process of descent with modification means that lineages are not independent this realization inspired the development of explicitly phylogenetic comparative methods initially these methods were primarily developed to control for phylogenetic history when testing for adaptation however in recent years the use of the term has broadened to include any use of phylogenies in statistical tests although most studies that employ pcms focus on extant organisms many methods can also be applied to extinct taxa and can incorporate information from the fossil record pcms can generally be divided into two types of approaches those that infer the evolutionary history of some character phenotypic or genetic across a phylogeny and those that infer the process of evolutionary branching itself diversification rates though there are some approaches that do both simultaneously typically the tree that is used in conjunction with pcms has been estimated independently see computational phylogenetics such that both the relationships between

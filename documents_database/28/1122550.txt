it can be collated with the reafferent sensory input that results from the agent s movement enabling a comparison of actual movement with desired movement and a shielding of perception from particular self induced effects on the sensory input to achieve perceptual stability together with internal models efference copies can serve to enable the brain to predict the effects of an action an equal term with a different history is corollary discharge efference copies are important in enabling motor adaptation such as to enhance gaze stability they have a role in the perception of self and nonself electric fields in electric fish they also underlie the phenomenon of tickling a motor signal from the central nervous system cns to the periphery is called an efference and a copy of this signal is called an efference copy sensory information coming from sensory receptors in the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system is called afference on a similar basis nerves into the nervous system are afferent nerves and ones out are termed efferent nerves when an efferent signal is produced and sent to the motor system it has been suggested that a copy of the signal known as an efference

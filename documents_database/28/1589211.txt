it was discovered as an unstable gas and only in 2009 found to be a stable ligand combining with transition metals in the same way as carbon monoxide it is a subhalide containing fewer than the normal number of fluorine atoms compared with boron trifluoride it can also be called a borylene as it contains boron with two unshared electrons bf is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide and dinitrogen each molecule has 14 electrons the experimental b f bond length is 1 26267 despite being isoelectronic to the triple bonded species co and n computational studies generally agree that the true bond order is much lower than 3 one reported computed bond order for the molecule is 1 4 compared with 2 6 for co and 3 0 for n bf is unusual in that the dipole moment is inverted with fluorine having a positive charge even though it is the more electronegative element this is explained by the 2sp orbitals of boron being reoriented and having a higher electron density backbonding or the transfer of orbital electrons for the fluorine atom is not required to explain the polarization boron monofluoride can be prepared by passing boron trifluoride gas at 2000

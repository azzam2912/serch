in some cases line segments of the line itself are also allowed as edges as long as they connect only vertices that are consecutive along the line the use of the phrase arc diagram for this kind of drawings follows the use of a similar type of diagram by to visualize the repetition patterns in strings by using arcs to connect pairs of equal substrings however this style of graph drawing is much older than its name dating back to the work of and who used arc diagrams to study crossing numbers of graphs an older but less frequently used name for arc diagrams is linear embeddings write that arc diagrams may not convey the overall structure of the graph as effectively as a two dimensional layout but that their layout makes it easy to display multivariate data associated with the vertices of the graph as observed every embedding of a graph in the plane may be deformed into an arc diagram without changing its number of crossings in particular every planar graph has a planar arc diagram however this embedding may need to use more than one semicircle for some of its edges if a graph is drawn without

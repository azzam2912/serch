it is one of the three binary fluorides of xenon the other two being xef and xef all known are exergonic and stable at normal temperatures xef is the strongest fluorinating agent of the series it is a colorless solid that readily sublimes into intensely yellow vapors xenon hexafluoride can be prepared by heating of xef at about 300 c under 6 mpa 60 atmospheres of fluorine with as catalyst however this reaction can proceed at 120 c even in xenon fluorine molar ratios as low as 1 5 the structure of xef required several years to establish in contrast to the cases of and in the gas phase the compound is monomeric vsepr theory predicts that due to the presence of six fluoride ligands and one lone pair of electrons the structure lacks perfect octahedral symmetry and indeed electron diffraction combined with high level calculations indicate that the compound s point group is c it is a fluxional molecule o is only insignificantly higher indicating that the minimum on the energy surface is very shallow xe and f nmr spectroscopy indicates that in solution the compound assumes a tetrameric structure four equivalent xenon atoms are arranged in a tetrahedron

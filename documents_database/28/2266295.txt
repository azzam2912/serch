he started his research career as research scientist at hp labs in september 1998 sharma was born in delhi india he graduated with a b tech in computer science and engineering from indian institute of technology delhi in 1993 he earned his phd in computer science from the university of southern california during his doctoral studies he contributed to standardization of protocol independent multicast his ph d dissertation titled scaling control traffic in network protocols hypothesizes that unregulated growth of network control traffic such as routing signalling and end to end protocol can jeopardize the primary function of the networks to carry data traffic the dissertation presents designs for regulating network control traffic along three scaling dimensions 1 frequency 2 distribution scope and 3 information aggregation several network protocols use soft state paradigm for state management these protocols use periodic refresh messages to keep network state alive while adapting to changing network conditions however the scalability of protocols that use the soft state approach is a concern he co invented scalable timers approach for soft state protocols where timer values are adapted dynamically in accordance with the volume of control traffic and the available bandwidth on network link he was

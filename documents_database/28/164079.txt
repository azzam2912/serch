it is a replication initiation factor which promotes the unwinding of dna at oric the onset of the initiation phase of dna replication is determined by the concentration of dnaa dnaa accumulates during growth and then triggers the initiation of replication replication begins with active dnaa binding to 9 mer 9 bp repeats upstream of oric binding of dnaa leads to strand separation at the 13 mer repeats this binding causes the dna to loop in preparation for melting open by the helicase dnab the active form dnaa is bound to atp immediately after a cell has divided the level of active dnaa within the cell is low although the active form of dnaa requires atp the formation of the oric dnaa complex and subsequent dna unwinding does not require atp hydrolysis the oric site in e coli has three at rich 13 base pair regions dues followed by four 9 bp regions with the sequence ttat c or a ca c or a a around 10 dnaa molecules bind to the 9 bp regions which wrap around the proteins causing the dna at the at rich region to unwind there are 8 dnaa binding sites within oric to which

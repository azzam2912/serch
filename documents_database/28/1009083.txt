as described below the variables have been changed from q to and the functions u and w substituted by their counterparts and this solution has numerous applications such as the orbit of a small planet about two fixed stars under the influence of newtonian gravity the liouville dynamical system is one of several things named after joseph liouville an eminent french mathematician in classical mechanics euler s three body problem describes the motion of a particle in a plane under the influence of two fixed centers each of which attract the particle with an inverse square force such as newtonian gravity or coulomb s law examples of the bicenter problem include a planet moving around two slowly moving stars or an electron moving in the electric field of two positively charged nuclei such as the first ion of the hydrogen molecule h namely the hydrogen molecular ion or h the strength of the two attractions need not be equal thus the two stars may have different masses or the nuclei two different charges let the fixed centers of attraction be located along the x axis at a the potential energy of the moving particle is given by the two centers

examples are dopamine serotonin and epinephrine all monoamines are derived from aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan by the action of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase enzymes they are deactivated in the body by the enzymes known as monoamine oxidases which clip off the amine group monoaminergic systems i e the networks of neurons that use monoamine neurotransmitters are involved in the regulation of processes such as emotion arousal and certain types of memory it has also been found that monoamine neurotransmitters play an important role in the secretion and production of neurotrophin 3 by astrocytes a chemical which maintains neuron integrity and provides neurons with trophic support drugs used to increase or reduce the effect of monoamine neurotransmitters are used to treat patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders including depression anxiety schizophrenia and parkinson s disease specific transporter proteins called monoamine transporters that transport monoamines in or out of a cell exist these are the dopamine transporter dat serotonin transporter sert and the norepinephrine transporter net in the outer cell membrane and the vesicular monoamine transporter vmat1 and vmat2 in the membrane of intracellular vesicles after release into the synaptic cleft monoamine neurotransmitter action is ended by reuptake

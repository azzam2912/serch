putting it another way there should be infinitely many such formula 4 for which each of the sequence values are prime numbers some constraints are needed on the polynomials schinzel s hypothesis builds on the earlier bunyakovsky conjecture for a single polynomial and on the hardy littlewood conjectures for multiple linear polynomials it is in turn extended by the bateman horn conjecture note that the coefficients of the polynomials need not to be integers for example this conjecture includes the polynomial formula 6 since it is an integer valued polynomial such a conjecture requires necessary condition for example if we take the two polynomials formula 7 and formula 8 there is no formula 9 for which formula 10 and formula 11 are both primes that is because one will be an even number formula 12 and the other an odd number the main question in formulating the conjecture is to rule out this phenomenon thus we should add a condition for every prime p there is an n such that all the polynomial values at n are not divisible by p the arithmetic nature of the most evident necessary conditions can be understood an integer valued polynomial formula 13 has

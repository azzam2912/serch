monoamniotic twins are always identical always monochorionic and are usually termed monoamniotic monochorionic momo or mono mono twins they share the placenta but have two separate umbilical cords monoamniotic twins develop when an embryo does not split until after formation of the amniotic sac at about 9 13 days after fertilization monoamniotic triplets or other monoamniotic multiples are possible but extremely rare other obscure possibilities include multiples sets where monoamniotic twins are part of a larger gestation such as triplets quadruplets or more monoamniotic twins are rare with an occurrence of 1 in 35 000 to 1 in 60 000 pregnancies the survival rate for monoamniotic twins has been shown to be as high as 81 to 95 in 2009 with aggressive fetal monitoring although previously reported as being between 50 to 60 causes of mortality and morbidity include ultrasound is the only way to detect momo twins before birth it can show the lack of a membrane between the twins after a couple of weeks gestation when the membrane would be visible if present further ultrasounds with high resolution doppler imaging and non stress tests help to assess the situation and identify potential cord problems there is a correlation

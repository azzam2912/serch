lim proteins contain a highly conserved double zinc finger motif called the lim domain fhl 2 is thought to have a role in the assembly of extracellular membranes and may function as a link between presenilin 2 and an intracellular signaling pathway the four and a half lim fhl only protein subfamily is one of the members of the lim only protein family protein members within the group might be originated from a common ancestor and share a high degree of similarity in their amino acid sequence these proteins are defined by the presence of the four and a half cysteine rich lim homeodomain with the half domain always located in the n terminal the name lim was derived from the first letter of the transcription factors lin 11 isl 1 and mec 3 from which the domain was originally characterized no direct interactions between lim domain and dna have been reported instead extensive evidence points towards the functional role of fhl2 in supporting protein protein interactions of lim containing proteins and its binding partners thus far five members have been categorized into the fhl subfamily which are fhl1 fhl2 fhl3 fhl4 and activator of crem in testis act in

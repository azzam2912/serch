translation the assembly of amino acids by ribosomes is an essential part of the biosynthetic pathway along with generation of messenger rna mrna aminoacylation of transfer rna trna co translational transport and post translational modification protein biosynthesis is strictly regulated at multiple steps they are principally during transcription phenomena of rna synthesis from dna template and translation phenomena of amino acid assembly from rna the cistron dna is transcribed into the first of a series of rna intermediates the last version is used as a template in synthesis of a polypeptide chain protein will often be synthesized directly from genes by translating mrna however when a protein must be available on short notice or in large quantities a protein precursor is produced a proprotein is an inactive protein containing one or more inhibitory peptides that can be activated when the inhibitory sequence is removed by proteolysis during posttranslational modification a preprotein is a form that contains a signal sequence an n terminal signal peptide that specifies its insertion into or through membranes i e targets them for secretion the signal peptide is cleaved off in the endoplasmic reticulum preproproteins have both sequences inhibitory and signal still present in protein synthesis

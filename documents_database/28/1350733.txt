nickel metal hydride battery technology is potentially important to the development of battery electric vehicles bevs or evs plug in hybrid electric vehicles phevs and hybrid electric vehicles hevs others hold that the commercial development of nickel metal hydride batteries is the result of the inability of the technology to compete with lighter weight lithium batteries the modern nickel metal hydride nimh electric vehicle battery was invented by dr masahiko oshitani of the gs yuasa corporation and stanford ovshinsky the founder of the ovonics battery company and granted a patent the current trend in the industry is towards the development of lithium ion li ion technology to replace nimh in electric vehicles in 2009 toyota tested lithium batteries as a potential replacement for the nickel metal hydride batteries used in its prius model gasoline electric hybrid the company said that it would continue to use nimh batteries in the prius but would introduce an all electric vehicle based on lithium technology li ion technology while functionally superior due to its higher specific energy and specific power is more expensive and as of 2009 relatively untested with regards to its long term reliability in 2007 the national renewable energy laboratory said

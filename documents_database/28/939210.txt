as a geometric series it is characterized by its first term 1 and its common ratio 2 as a series of real numbers it diverges so in the usual sense it has no sum in a much broader sense the series has a generalized sum of gottfried leibniz considered the divergent alternating series as early as 1673 he argued that by subtracting either on the left or on the right one could produce either positive or negative infinity and therefore both answers are wrong and the whole should be finite now normally nature chooses the middle if neither of the two is permitted or rather if it cannot be determined which of the two is permitted and the whole is equal to a finite quantity leibniz did not quite assert that the series had a sum but he did infer an association with following mercator s method the attitude that a series could equal some finite quantity without actually adding up to it as a sum would be commonplace in the 18th century although no distinction is made in modern mathematics after christian wolff read leibniz s treatment of grandi s series in mid 1712 wolff was so pleased with

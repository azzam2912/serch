vxds have access to the memory of the kernel and all running processes as well as raw access to the hardware the name vxd is an abbreviation for virtual xxx driver where xxx is some class of hardware device it derives from the fact that most drivers had filenames of the form codice 2 in windows 3 x some examples are vjoyd 386 joystick vmm 386 memory manager vxds usually have the filename extension codice 3 under windows 3 x and codice 4 under windows 9x vxds written for windows 3 x can be used under windows 9x but not vice versa prior to the advent of windows dos applications would either communicate directly with the various pieces of hardware responding to interrupts reading and writing device memory etc or go through a dos device driver as dos was not multitasking each application would have exclusive and complete control over the hardware while running though windows applications don t often communicate directly with hardware it was the only way for windows drivers and still is in the real and standard modes of windows 3 x windows 386 and onward allowed multiple dos applications to execute concurrently by executing each within

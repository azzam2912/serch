1 that accepts an input current at the input terminal and provides a mirrored current source or sink output at the output terminal the mirrored current is a precise copy of the input current it may be used as a wilson current source by applying a constant bias current to the input branch as in fig 2 the circuit is named after george r wilson an integrated circuit design engineer who worked for tektronix wilson devised this configuration in 1967 when he and barrie gilbert challenged each other to find an improved current mirror overnight that would use only three transistors wilson won the challenge there are three principal metrics of how well a current mirror will perform as part of a larger circuit the first measure is the static error the difference between the input and output currents expressed as a fraction of the input current minimizing this difference is critical in such applications of a current mirror as the differential to single ended output signal conversion in a differential amplifier stage because this difference controls the common mode and power supply rejection ratios the second measure is the output impedance of the current source or equivalently its inverse

the highway would have connected i 90 in to i 87 and the albany international airport in colonie i 687 faced opposition from those living in the path of the highway and ultimately all that was built of the highway was its interchange with i 90 in albany which now connects to a surface road corporate woods boulevard the project was cancelled in 1973 and i 687 was removed from the interstate highway system four years later a small portion of what would ve been i 687 is now being built as a connector between the adirondack northway and the albany international airport however it is not getting a route designation i 687 was to begin between exits 24 and 25 on the new york state thruway it would continue north to a diamond intersection with ny 5 central avenue it would then proceed north and east to an exit with ny 155 and farther to an interchange with interstate 88 via a connector running on the west side of the airport i 687 would then have an entrance to the albany international airport the main reason for its existence continuing east i 687 would then have a cloverleaf interchange

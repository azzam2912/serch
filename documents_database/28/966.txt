more formally it is a biological assay to assess the mutagenic potential of chemical compounds a positive test indicates that the chemical is mutagenic and therefore may act as a carcinogen because cancer is often linked to mutation the test serves as a quick and convenient assay to estimate the carcinogenic potential of a compound because standard carcinogen assays on mice and rats are time consuming taking two to three years to complete and expensive however false positives and false negatives are known the procedure was described in a series of papers in the early 1970s by bruce ames and his group at the university of california berkeley the ames test uses several strains of the bacterium salmonella typhimurium that carry mutations in genes involved in histidine synthesis these strains are auxotrophic mutants i e they require histidine for growth but cannot produce it the method tests the capability of the tested substance in creating mutations that result in a return to a prototrophic state so that the cells can grow on a histidine free medium the tester strains are specially constructed to detect either frameshift e g strains ta 1537 and ta 1538 or point e g strain ta

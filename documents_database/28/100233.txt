the gibbs free energy formula 1 j in si units is the maximum amount of non expansion work that can be extracted from a thermodynamically closed system one that can exchange heat and work with its surroundings but not matter this maximum can be attained only in a completely reversible process when a system transforms reversibly from an initial state to a final state the decrease in gibbs free energy equals the work done by the system to its surroundings minus the work of the pressure forces the gibbs energy also referred to as formula 2 is also the thermodynamic potential that is minimized when a system reaches chemical equilibrium at constant pressure and temperature its derivative with respect to the reaction coordinate of the system vanishes at the equilibrium point as such a reduction in formula 2 is a necessary condition for the spontaneity of processes at constant pressure and temperature the gibbs free energy originally called available energy was developed in the 1870s by the american scientist josiah willard gibbs in 1873 gibbs described this available energy as the initial state of the body according to gibbs is supposed to be such that the body can be made

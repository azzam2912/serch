its name derives from the location of the camshaft which was a compromise between an overhead valve and an overhead cam layout the camshaft was mounted above the cylinder but aside the valves and actuated them through a very short tappet and a rocker arm because it was not near enough to act directly upon the valves the layout was an evolutionary dead end and was not adapted for other engines the four cylinder cih was largely supplanted by the family ii unit as opel vauxhall s core mid size engine in the 1980s with a large capacity 2 4l version of the cih remaining in limited production until 1998 in the omega a and latterly the frontera a models the six cylinder versions of the cih remained in volume production until 1995 there was also a diesel engine using this layout first seen in the opel rekord d in 1972 the cih is not a true overhead camshaft design although the camshaft is mounted in the cylinder head driven by a roller chain rather it can be thought of as a hybrid between an overhead valve ohv and an ohc configuration later versions used hydraulic tappets a design which

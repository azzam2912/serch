all are found in south america this genus contains 3 species as indicated by analysis of mt and ndna sequences and calibrated with geological data this genus ancestors probably diverged from those of mitu their closest living relatives in the tortonian early late miocene some 8 7 4 mya how the present distribution in 4 small areas quite distant from each other came to be is not known given that helmeted curassows are birds of the foothills and uplands it might be that the ancestral pauxi population became fragmented by the uplift of the andes which in their area of distribution took place during the late miocene around the pauxi mitu divergence and some time after pereira baker 2002 pereira et al 2002 pereira baker 2002 reported an interesting find in the mtdna phylogeny pauxi was paraphyletic with p unicornis being resolved as the sister species of mitu tuberosa this of course does not automatically imply that they are closely related or that the genera are invalid rather the authors point out given the distinct and peculiar morphology of the two genera incomplete lineage sorting or hybridization between ancestral individuals of the two species is a more likely explanation according

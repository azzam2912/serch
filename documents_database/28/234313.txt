the technique for rendering metaballs was invented by jim blinn in the early 1980s each metaball is defined as a function in n dimensions e g for three dimensions formula 1 three dimensional metaballs tend to be most common with two dimensional implementations popular as well a thresholding value is also chosen to define a solid volume then represents whether the volume enclosed by the surface defined by formula 3 metaballs is filled at formula 4 or not a typical function chosen for metaballs is formula 5 where formula 6 is the center of the metaball however due to the division it is computationally expensive for this reason approximate polynomial functions are typically used when seeking a more efficient falloff function several qualities are desired the simplest falloff curve that satisfies these criteria is formula 7 where r is the distance to the point this formulation avoids expensive square root calls more complicated models use a gaussian potential constrained to a finite radius or a mixture of polynomials to achieve smoothness the soft object model by the wyvill brothers provides higher degree of smoothness and still avoids square roots a simple generalization of metaballs is to apply the falloff curve

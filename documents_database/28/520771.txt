originally a military project for the british admiralty it was completed for commercial passenger carrying purposes r80 proved too small for this role and after being used briefly to train the united states navy personnel who were to crew the ill fated zr 2 airship r80 was retired and eventually scrapped in 1925 construction was begun by vickers in their airship shed at walney island barrow in furness in november 1917 to a design by barnes wallis and h b pratt vickers had originally contracted to build r37 but due to a lack of vacant sheds and a war time steel shortage preventing construction of a new larger one the smaller shed at walney was used instead this had been used to build r27 and r29 and the size of the r80 was limited by the small size of the shed work progressed slowly due to labour shortages and with the end of the first world war the future of military airships was reviewed the air ministry stopped the work in the summer of 1919 as it was considered that the ship was no longer of military or commercial value vickers continued to fit out the ship with commercial objectives

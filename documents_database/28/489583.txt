it means that the output of a circuit may be available as soon as sufficient inputs have arrived to allow it to be determined for example if all of the inputs to a mux have arrived and all are the same but the select line has not yet arrived the circuit can still produce an output since all the inputs are identical the select line is irrelevant a ripple carry adder is a simple adder circuit but slow because the carry signal has to propagate through each stage of the adder this diagram shows a 5 bit ripple carry adder in action there is a five stage long carry path so every time two numbers are added with this adder it needs to wait for the carry to propagate through all five stages by switching to dual rail signalling for the carry bit it can have each stage signal its carry out as soon as it knows if both inputs to a stage are 1 then the carry out will be 1 no matter what the carry in is if both inputs are 0 then the carry out will be zero this early completion cuts down on the maximum length

selcal uses a ground based encoder and radio transmitter to broadcast an audio signal that is picked up by a decoder and radio receiver on an aircraft the use of selcal allows an aircraft crew to be notified of incoming communications even when the aircraft s radio has been muted thus crewmembers need not devote their attention to continuous radio listening selcal operates on the high frequency hf or very high frequency vhf radio frequency bands used for aircraft communications hf radio often has extremely high levels of background noise and can be difficult or distracting to listen to for long periods of time as a result it is common practice for crews to keep the radio volume low unless the radio is immediately needed a selcal notification activates a signal to the crew that they are about to receive a voice transmission so that the crew has time to raise the volume an individual aircraft has its own assigned selcal code to initiate a selcal transmission a ground station radio operator enters an aircraft s selcal code into a selcal encoder the encoder converts the four letter code into four designated audio tones the radio operator s transmitter then

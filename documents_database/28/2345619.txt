it was originally isolated from spoiled beer and believed to have some causative effect in beer spoilage since then it has been taxonomically reclassified and proven to play a role in anaerobic beer spoilage because of its production of acids such as acetic and propionic acid during fermentation propionispira rafinnosivorans was first isolated as zymophilus raffinosivorans in january 1990 by schleifer et al spoiled beer and pitching yeast were examined to characterize enigmatic bacterial species and their ecological significance in beer spoilage once collected microbes were inoculated into a modified medium which consisted of peptone yeast extract meat extract glucose nacl hydrated mgso mnso a solution of khpo cysteine hydrochloride and resazurin 47 separate strains of anaerobic gram negative bacteria were observed and recorded a new genus zymophilus was identified and separated into two distinct species zymophilus paucivorans and zymophilus raffinosivorans zymophilus rafinosivorans was originally identified as being the type species more recently ueki et al 2014 reevaluated the species z raffinosivorans and propionispira arboris by comparing them to a new strain of negativicutes wk011 as well as the original type species zymophilus paucivorans strain wk011 was isolated from residue of rice straw which had been digested by cows and

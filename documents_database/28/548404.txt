this real valued function of a real variable can be defined as since every rational number has a unique representation with coprime also termed relatively prime formula 2 and formula 3 the function is well defined note that formula 4 is the only number in formula 5 that is coprime to formula 6 it is a modification of the dirichlet function which is 1 at rational numbers and 0 elsewhere for all formula 11 since formula 12 for all formula 13 there exist formula 2 and formula 15 such that formula 16 and formula 17 according to b zout s identity for some formula 18 holds and thus formula 20 assume an arbitrary rational formula 22 with formula 23 and formula 24 coprime this establishes formula 25 let formula 26 be any irrational number and define for all formula 27 formula 28 these formula 29 are all irrational and so formula 30 this implies formula 31 and formula 32 taking formula 33 and formula 34 selects an formula 35 such that for all formula 37formula 38 which is exactly the definition of discontinuity of formula 7 at formula 40 this shows that formula 7 is discontinuous on formula 42 since

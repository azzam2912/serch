havcr2 was first described in 2002 as a cell surface molecule expressed on ifn producing cd4 th1 and cd8 tc1 cells later the expression was detected in th17 cells regulatory t cells and innate immune cells dendritic cells nk cells monocytes havcr2 belongs to tim family cell surface receptor proteins these proteins share a similar structure in which the extracellular region consists of membrane distal single variable immunoglobulin domain igv and a glycosylated mucin domain of variable length located closer to the membrane intracellular domain of havcr2 is called c terminal cytoplasmic tail it contains five conserved tyrosine residues that interact with multiple components of t cell receptor tcr complex and negatively regulates its function havcr2 is an immune checkpoint and together with other inhibitory receptors including programmed cell death protein 1 pd 1 and lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein lag3 mediate the cd8 t cell exhaustion havcr2 has also been shown as a cd4 th1 specific cell surface protein that regulates macrophage activation and enhances the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice havcr2 is primarily activated by galectin 9 the engagement leads to stimulation of an influx of calcium to intracellular space and induction of programmed cell death

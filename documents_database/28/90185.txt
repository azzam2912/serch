article 95 introduces the terminology quadratic residue and quadratic nonresidue and states that if the context makes it clear the adjective quadratic may be dropped for a given n a list of the quadratic residues modulo n may be obtained by simply squaring the numbers 0 1 because a n a mod n the list of squares modulo n is symmetrical around n 2 and the list only needs to go that high this can be seen in the table below thus the number of quadratic residues modulo n cannot exceed n 2 1 n even or n 1 2 n odd the product of two residues is always a residue modulo 2 every integer is a quadratic residue modulo an odd prime number p there are p 1 2 residues including 0 and p 1 2 nonresidues by euler s criterion in this case it is customary to consider 0 as a special case and work within the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of the field z p z in other words every congruence class except zero modulo p has a multiplicative inverse this is not true for composite moduli following this convention the multiplicative inverse of a residue

specifically the randomized hough transform is a probabilistic variant to the classical hough transform and is commonly used to detect curves straight line circle ellipse etc the basic idea of hough transform ht is to implement a voting procedure for all potential curves in the image and at the termination of the algorithm curves that do exist in the image will have relatively high voting scores randomized hough transform rht is different from ht in that it tries to avoid conducting the computationally expensive voting process for every nonzero pixel in the image by taking advantage of the geometric properties of analytical curves and thus improve the time efficiency and reduce the storage requirement of the original algorithm although hough transform ht has been widely used in curve detection it has two major drawbacks first for each nonzero pixel in the image the parameters for the existing curve and redundant ones are both accumulated during the voting procedure second the accumulator array or hough space is predefined in a heuristic way the more accuracy needed the higher parameter resolution should be defined these two needs usually result in a large storage requirement and low speed for real applications therefore rht

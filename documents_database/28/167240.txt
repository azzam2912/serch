these conditions guarantee that the measure is compatible with the topology of the space and most measures used in mathematical analysis and in number theory are indeed radon measures a common problem is to find a good notion of a measure on a topological space that is compatible with the topology in some sense one way to do this is to define a measure on the borel sets of the topological space in general there are several problems with this for example such a measure may not have a well defined support another approach to measure theory is to restrict to locally compact hausdorff spaces and only consider the measures that correspond to positive linear functionals on the space of continuous functions with compact support some authors use this as the definition of a radon measure this produces a good theory with no pathological problems but does not apply to spaces that are not locally compact if there is no restriction to non negative measures and complex measures are allowed then radon measures can be defined as the continuous dual space on the space of continuous functions with compact support if such a radon measure is real then it can

the term error can also refer to the play during which an error was committed an error does not count as a hit but still counts as an at bat for the batter unless in the scorer s judgment the batter would have reached first base safely but one or more of the additional base s reached was the result of the fielder s mistake in that case the play will be scored both as a hit for the number of bases the fielders should have limited the batter to and an error however if a batter is judged to have reached base solely because of a fielder s mistake it is scored as a hit on error and treated the same as if the batter had been put out hence lowering his batting average similarly a batter does not receive credit for a run batted in rbi when runs score on an error unless the scorer rules that a run would have scored even if the fielder had not made a mistake for example if a batter hits a ball to the outfield for what should be a sacrifice fly and the outfielder drops the ball for an error

a csf must not be confused with a configuration in general one configuration gives rise to several csfs all have the same total quantum numbers for spin and spatial parts but differ in their intermediate couplings in quantum chemistry a configuration state function csf is a symmetry adapted linear combination of slater determinants it is constructed to have the same quantum numbers as the wavefunction formula 1 of the system being studied in the method of configuration interaction the wavefunction can be expressed as a linear combination of csfs that is in the form formula 2 where formula 3 denotes the set of csfs the coefficients formula 4 are found by using the expansion of formula 5 to compute a hamiltonian matrix when this is diagonalized the eigenvectors are chosen as the expansion coefficients csfs rather than just slater determinants can also be used as a basis in multi configurational self consistent field computations in atomic structure a csf is an eigenstate of in linear molecules formula 6 does not commute with the hamiltonian for the system and therefore csfs are not eigenstates of formula 6 however the z projection of angular momentum is still a good quantum number and

these are commonly used with large computer systems typically in conjunction with a robotic tape library the most recent format is the t10000 storagetek primarily competed with ibm in this market and continued to do so after its acquisition by sun microsystems in 2005 and as part of the sun microsystems acquisition by oracle in 2009 most but not all modern tape cartridges are format tape first popularized by the ibm 3480 and dec dlt formats this is a small rectangular and easily handled tape cartridge compared to the previously common 7 track and 9 track round tape reels this form factor has proven to work well with stand alone drives and for use in automated tape libraries nearly all 1 2 tape formats today are a single hub design whereby the tape is wound onto a single hub entirely within the external shell and presents one end for the tape drive to engage and thread into the tape drive for reading or writing the mechanical design of this loading mechanism varies between different types of tape media and is a common source of failures usually the tape cartridge incorporates a switch that can be set to permit or forbid

it is an indirect topology that relies on the perfect shuffle interconnection algorithm an 8x8 omega network is a multistage interconnection network meaning that processing elements pes are connected using multiple stages of switches inputs and outputs are given addresses as shown in the figure the outputs from each stage are connected to the inputs of the next stage using a perfect shuffle connection system this means that the connections at each stage represent the movement of a deck of cards divided into 2 equal decks and then shuffled together with each card from one deck alternating with the corresponding card from the other deck in terms of binary representation of the pes each stage of the perfect shuffle can be thought of as a cyclic logical left shift each bit in the address is shifted once to the left with the most significant bit moving to the least significant bit at each stage adjacent pairs of inputs are connected to a simple exchange element which can be set either straight pass inputs directly through to outputs or crossed send top input to bottom output and vice versa for n processing element an omega network contains n 2 switches at

it does so by the covalent modification of histidine most strongly lysine cysteine and tyrosine residues depc treated and therefore rnase free water is used in handling of rna in the laboratory to reduce the risk of rna being degraded by rnases water is usually treated with 0 1 v v depc for at least 2 hours at 37 c and then autoclaved at least 15 min to inactivate traces of depc inactivation of depc in this manner yields co and ethanol higher concentrations of depc are capable of deactivating larger amounts of rnase but remaining traces or byproducts may inhibit further biochemical reactions such as in vitro transcription furthermore chemical modification of rna such as carboxymethylation is possible when traces of depc or its byproducts are present resulting in impaired recovery of intact rna even after buffer exchange after precipitation depc is unstable in water and susceptible to hydrolysis to carbon dioxide and ethanol especially in the presence of a nucleophile for this reason depc cannot be used with tris or hepes buffers in contrast it can be used with phosphate buffered saline or mops a handy rule is that enzymes or chemicals which have active o n or

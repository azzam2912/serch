atlas utilises the inherent step and terrace structure of the surface as a template for such nanostructures the technique involves the low angle incidence of flux material on vicinal substrates vicinal substrates are composed of atomic terraces separated by atomic steps the atlas technique allows for the fabrication of well defined planar arrays of plasmonic nanostructures of dimensions unachievable by lithography a collimated beam of atoms or molecules is evaporated at an oblique angle to the substrate this causes the steps to shadow the beam and the molecules to be adsorbed only on the exposed parts of the steps in direct line of sight of the evaporator the principal attraction of the technique is its relative simplicity as it does not involve multiple lithography steps and can be applied to metal semiconductor or oxide surfaces alike the technique is a bottom up approach and allows great control over the separation of nanostructures within the array as well as their individual widths the separation is controlled by the size of the atomic terraces of the substrate which is determined by its miscut from the principal index and the width of the nanostructures is controlled by the oblique angle of the deposition

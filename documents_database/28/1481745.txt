they are also able to measure the thickness or density of non conductive materials capacitive displacement sensors are used in a wide variety of applications including semiconductor processing assembly of precision equipment such as disk drives precision thickness measurements machine tool metrology and assembly line testing these types of sensors can be found in machining and manufacturing facilities around the world capacitance is an electrical property which is created by applying an electrical charge to two conductive objects with a gap between them a simple demonstration is two parallel conductive plates of the same profile with a gap between them and a charge applied to them in this situation the capacitance can be expressed by the equation where c is the capacitance is the permittivity of free space constant k is the dielectric constant of the material in the gap a is the area of the plates and d is the distance between the plates there are two general types of capacitive displacement sensing systems one type is used to measure thicknesses of conductive materials the other type measures thicknesses of non conductive materials or the level of a fluid a capacitive sensing system for conductive materials uses a model

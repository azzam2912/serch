they argued that evidence of tyche s existence could be seen in a supposed bias in the points of origin for long period comets more recently matese and whitmire re evaluated the comet data and noted that tyche if it existed would be detectable in the archive of data that was collected by nasa s wide field infrared survey explorer wise telescope in 2014 nasa announced that the wise survey had ruled out any object with tyche s characteristics indicating that tyche as hypothesized by matese whitman and whitmire does not exist matese whitmire and their colleague patrick whitman first proposed the existence of this planet in 1999 based on observations of the orbits of long period comets most astronomers agree that long period comets those with orbits of thousands to millions of years have a roughly isotropic distribution that is they arrive at random from every point in the sky because comets are volatile and dissipate over time astronomers suspect that they must be held in a spherical cloud tens of thousands of au distant known as the oort cloud for most of their existence however matese and whitmire claimed that rather than arriving from random points across the

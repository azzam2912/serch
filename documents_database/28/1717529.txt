having originally been proposed in an article that appeared in the journal of monetary economics in 1988 the corresponding technical appendix detailing their derivation has only been published in 2002 denote consumption with c leisure with l and the absolute value of the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption with formula 1 strict concavity of the utility function implies formula 2 for formula 3 or formula 4 the utility function has the multiplicatively separable form formula 5 where formula 6 is increasing and concave if formula 3 or decreasing and convex if formula 4 further restrictions are required to assure overall concavity of the momentarily utility function in the limit case of formula 9 the resulting preferences specification is additively separable and given by formula 10 where formula 11 is increasing and concave the reason for the prevalence of this preference specification in macroeconomics is that they are compatible with balanced growth along the optimal steady state hence they are used in many dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models which are typically derived from the neoclassical growth model the reason for their compatibility with balanced growth is twofold first having a constant interest rate in steady state the

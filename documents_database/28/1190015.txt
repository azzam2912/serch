other methods are available but peroxide value is the most widely used it gives a measure of the extent to which an oil sample has undergone primary oxidation extent of secondary oxidation may be determined from p anisidine test the double bonds found in fats and oils play a role in autoxidation oils with a high degree of unsaturation are most susceptible to autoxidation the best test for autoxidation oxidative rancidity is determination of the peroxide value peroxides are intermediates in the autoxidation reaction autoxidation is a free radical reaction involving oxygen that leads to deterioration of fats and oils which form off flavours and off odours peroxide value concentration of peroxide in an oil or fat is useful for assessing the extent to which spoilage has advanced the peroxide value is defined as the amount of peroxide oxygen per 1 kilogram of fat or oil traditionally this was expressed in units of milliequivalents although if we are using si units then the appropriate option would be in millimoles per kilogram n b 1 milliequivalents 0 5 millimole because 1 meq of o2 1 mmol 2 0 5 mmol of o2 where 2 is valence note also that the unit

the collecting duct system participates in electrolyte and fluid balance through reabsorption and excretion processes regulated by the hormones aldosterone and vasopressin antidiuretic hormone there are several components of the collecting duct system including the connecting tubules cortical collecting ducts and medullary collecting ducts the segments of the system are as follows with respect to the renal corpuscle the connecting tubule is the most proximal part of the collecting duct system it is adjacent to the distal convoluted tubule the most distal segment of the renal tubule connecting tubules from several adjacent nephrons merge to form cortical collecting tubules and these may join to form cortical collecting ducts connecting tubules of some juxtamedullary nephrons may arch upward forming an arcade the connecting tubule derives from the metanephric blastema but the rest of the system derives from the ureteric bud because of this some sources group the connecting tubule as part of the nephron rather than grouping it with the collecting duct system the initial collecting tubule is a segment with a constitution similar as the collecting duct but before the convergence with other tubules the cortical collecting ducts receive filtrate from multiple initial collecting tubules and descend into the renal

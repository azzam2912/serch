modern integrated circuit based register files are usually implemented by way of fast static rams with multiple ports such rams are distinguished by having dedicated read and write ports whereas ordinary multiported srams will usually read and write through the same ports the instruction set architecture of a cpu will almost always define a set of registers which are used to stage data between memory and the functional units on the chip in simpler cpus these architectural registers correspond one for one to the entries in a physical register file prf within the cpu more complicated cpus use register renaming so that the mapping of which physical entry stores a particular architectural register changes dynamically during execution the register file is part of the architecture and visible to the programmer as opposed to the concept of transparent caches register files may be clubbed together as register banks some processors have several register banks arm processors use arm register banks for fast interrupt request x86 processors use context switching and fast interrupt for switching between instruction decoder gprs and register files if there is more than one before the instruction is issued but this is only existing on processors that support

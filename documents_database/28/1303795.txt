due to its topical content the album was pulled from some christian book stores the album drew upon the production talents of mike knott and gene eugene on this release the band has a rockabilly sound somewhere between the stray cats and the reverend horton heat or like a rockabilly version of mike knott lyrically the album addressed hard issues such as racism skin the underground church in china people underground materialism and temptation fat cat new age spiritualism rock n roll my baby and internal spiritual battles with our sinful nature in spiritual heroin russinger deals with his own former speed addiction describing how christ can fill the need created by addictions which one reviewer described as a slightly disturbing metaphor the album also deals with the victims of the holocaust death train and finally closes with let s go a no holds barred celebration of salvation one reviewer found the album to be on various tracks clich ridden but vaguely worshipful weakly inspiring and shallow dumb the reviewer went on to state that the attempt to bring 1950s wholesomeness into today s moral morass fell flat

siegbert tarrasch 1862 1934 stated the rule that rooks should be placed behind passed pawns either yours or your opponent s the idea behind the guideline is that 1 if a player s rook is behind his passed pawn the rook protects it as it advances and 2 if it is behind an opponent s passed pawn the pawn cannot advance unless it is protected along its way the original quote came from his famous book about the st petersburg 1914 chess tournament which was translated into english in 1993 he referred to his rule 24 years later on page 57 of his book the game of chess 1938 as this rule is usually true but not always as there are many exceptions tarrasch has been quoted as saying always put the rook behind the pawn except when it is incorrect to do so consider the cases in the diagram on the b file white s rook is behind the pawn while black s is in front of it other things being equal black cannot do much to stop the pawn s advance the rook can block it but as soon as the rook moves elsewhere the pawn can advance

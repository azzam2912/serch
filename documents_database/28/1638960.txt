in a morph target animation a deformed version of a mesh is stored as a series of vertex positions in each key frame of an animation the vertices are then interpolated between these stored positions the morph target is a deformed version of a shape when applied to a human face for example the head is first modelled with a neutral expression and a target deformation is then created for each other expression when the face is being animated the animator can then smoothly morph or blend between the base shape and one or several morph targets typical examples of morph targets used in facial animation is a smiling mouth a closed eye and a raised eyebrow but the technique can also be used to morph between for example dr jekyll and mr hyde early 3d videogames such as quake and crash bandicoot use per vertex animation for all character animations when used for facial animation these morph target are often referred to as key poses the interpolations between key poses when an animation is being rendered are typically small and simple transformations of movement rotation and scale performed by the 3d software not all morph target animation has to

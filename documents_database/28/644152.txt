they are related to doped fiber amplifiers which provide light amplification without lasing fiber nonlinearities such as stimulated raman scattering or four wave mixing can also provide gain and thus serve as gain media for a fiber laser an advantage of fiber lasers over other types include light is already coupled into a flexible fiber the fact that the light is already in a fiber allows it to be easily delivered to a movable focusing element which is important for laser cutting welding and folding of metals and polymers another advantage is high output power fiber lasers can have active regions several kilometers long and so can provide very high optical gain they can support kilowatt levels of continuous output power because of the fiber s high surface area to volume ratio which allows efficient cooling the fiber s waveguiding properties reduce or eliminate thermal distortion of the optical path typically producing a diffraction limited high quality optical beam fiber lasers are compact compared to rod or gas lasers of comparable power because the fiber can be bent and coiled to save space they have lower cost of ownership fiber lasers are reliable and exhibit high temperature and vibrational stability

it was developed in germany in the late 1940s there are two isomers of the trans form of prodine alphaprodine and betaprodine both exhibit optical isomerism and alphaprodine and betaprodine are racemates alphaprodine is closely related to desomorphine in steric configuration the cis form also has active isomers but none are used in medicine betaprodine is some five times more potent than alphaprodine but is metabolized more rapidly and only alphaprodine was developed for medicinal use it has similar activity to pethidine but with a faster onset of action and shorter duration betaprodine produces more euphoria and side effects than alphaprodine at all dose levelsand it was found that 5 to 10 mg of betaprodine is equivalent to 25 to 40 mg of alphaprodine tests in rats showed alphaprodine to be 97 the strength of morphine via the subcutaneous route and 140 the strength of methadone orally betaprodine was 550 as strong as morphine sc and the laevorotary cis isomer was 350 as strong and the dextrorotary cis isomer was 790 was strong betaprodine by mouth was 420 as strong as methadone and the cis form was 390 for the laevo and 505 for the dextro isomers alphaprodine was sold

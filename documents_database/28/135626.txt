they contain one or more all carbon rings which may be either saturated or unsaturated but do not have aromatic character alicyclic compounds may have one or more aliphatic side chains attached the simplest alicyclic compounds are the monocyclic cycloalkanes cyclopropane cyclobutane cyclopentane cyclohexane cycloheptane cyclooctane and so on bicyclic alkanes include bicycloundecane decalin and housane polycyclic alkanes include cubane basketane and tetrahedrane spiro compounds have two or more rings that are connected through only one carbon atom the mode of ring closing in the formation of many alicyclic compounds can be predicted by baldwin s rules otto wallach a german chemist received the 1910 nobel prize in chemistry for his work on alicyclic compounds monocyclic cycloalkenes are cyclopropene cyclobutene cyclopentene cyclohexene cycloheptene cyclooctene and so on bicyclic alkenes include norbornene and norbornadiene two more examples are shown below on the left methylenecyclohexane and on the right 1 methylcyclohexene an exocyclic group is always shown outside the ring structure take for instance the exocyclic double bond of the former molecule isotoluenes are a prominent class of compounds with exocyclic double bonds the placement of double bonds in many alicyclic compounds can be predicted with bredt s rule

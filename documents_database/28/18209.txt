for an integer a 1 if a composite integer x divides a 1 then x is called a fermat pseudoprime to base a in other words a composite integer is a fermat pseudoprime to base a if it successfully passes the fermat primality test for the base a the smallest base 2 fermat pseudoprime is 341 it is not a prime since it equals 11 31 but it satisfies fermat s little theorem 2 1 mod 341 and thus passes the fermat primality test for the base 2 pseudoprimes to base 2 are sometimes called poulet numbers after the belgian mathematician paul poulet sarrus numbers or fermatians a fermat pseudoprime is often called a pseudoprime with the modifier fermat being understood an integer x that is a fermat pseudoprime for all values of a that are coprime to x is called a carmichael number some sources use variations of the definition for example to only allow odd numbers to be pseudoprimes every odd number q satisfies formula 1 for formula 2 this trivial case is excluded in the definition of a fermat pseudoprime given by crandall and pomerance there are infinitely many pseudoprimes to a given base in fact infinitely

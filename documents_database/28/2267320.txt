the products are functional copolymers which are used as oil field chemicals and as cosmetic auxiliaries 1 vinylimidazole acts as a reactive diluent in uv lacquers inks and adhesives the synthesis and properties of 1 vinylimidazole were described in a comprehensive article by walter reppe in 1957 imidazole is first reacted with potassium hydroxide solution to form potassium imidazolate and the formed water is removed by distillation zinc oxide and potassium hydroxide are added to the basic catalyst potassium imidazolate and the free imidazole is ethinylated in 1 4 dioxane at 130 c with ethine in a autoclave the yield is 62 in a laboratory process imidazole reacts in a two phase system in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst with 1 2 dichloroethane to give 1 2 chloroethyl imidazole and the latter is converted upon release of hydrogen chloride into 1 vinylimidazole in 92 yield another lab scale procedure reports the vinylation of imidazole with bromethene and kieselguhr supported cesium fluoride in acetonitrile with a yield of 65 1 vinylimidazole is a colorless to brown light sensitive hygroscopic and slightly alkaline reacting liquid with unpleasant amine like fishy smell the compound is very soluble in water and alcohols

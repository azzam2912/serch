this simplification was achieved through a process similar to that of simplified chinese of either replacing the onpu sound mark indicating the on reading with another onpu of the same on reading with fewer strokes or replacing a complex component of a character with a simpler one there have been a few stages of simplifications made since the 1950s but the only changes that became official were the changes in the j y kanji list in 1981 and 2010 the following forms were established as a result of the postwar character reforms however they were not completely created anew as many were based on widely used handwritten abbreviations ryakuji from the prewar era due to the complexity of kanji many abbreviations were used in handwriting whose status rose to become official characters in the post war reforms attention was paid to the aesthetic balance of the characters in their new form in almost all cases characters in the new standard have fewer strokes than old forms though in a few cases they have the same number and in a few other cases they have one more stroke the most radical simplification was removing 20 strokes a complete list by stroke

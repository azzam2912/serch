built at a cost of 60 million it was composed of two parts a pair of powerful marx generators capable of simulating the electromagnetic pulse effects of a high altitude nuclear explosion hane of the type expected during a nuclear war and a giant wooden trestle built in a bowl shaped arroyo designed to elevate the test aircraft above ground interference and orient it below the pulse in a similar manner to what would be seen in mid air trestle is the world s largest structure composed entirely of wood and glue laminate the electromagnetic pulse was produced by a pair of marx generators built by maxwell laboratories of san diego california the generators were mounted on pedestals constructed of wood in the same manner as the main test platform one on each side of a large wedge shaped steel structure which acted as a ground plane for the horizontally polarized pulse each marx generator consisted of a stack of 50 trays each containing two large capacitors and a plasma switch a large peaking capacitor used to adjust the shape of the resulting pulse was also part of the design each generator was enclosed in a large fiberglass structure which

for each of these dyadic pairs switch the edges such that the new dyadic pairs are mismatched after a sufficient number of these mismatches the network increasingly loses its original observed topography as is common with algorithms based on markov chains the number of iterations or individual rewires that must occur on a given graph such that the graph is sufficiently random and distinct from the original graph is unknown though espinoza asserts that a safe minimum threshold is formula 3 where formula 4 is at least 100 espinoza others have provided input for this issue including one author who states that a safe minimum may instead be at least formula 5 where epsilon lies in a range between formula 6 and formula 7 though ultimately the correct number is not presently known there are several cases in which published research have explicitly employed degree preserving randomization in order to analyze network properties dekker used rewiring in order to more accurately model observed social networks by adding a secondary variable formula 8 which introduces a high degree attachment bias liu et al have additionally employed degree preserving randomization to assert that the control centrality a metric they identify alters little

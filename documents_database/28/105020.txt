they are related to the kingfishers bee eaters and rollers they most resemble the latter group and are sometimes considered a sub family of the true rollers ground rollers share the generally crow like size and build of the true rollers ranging from in length and also hunt reptiles and large insects they are more terrestrial than coracidae species and this is reflected in their longer legs and shorter more rounded wings they lack the highly colourful appearance of the true rollers and are duller in appearance with striped or flecked plumage they are much more elusive and shy than their relatives and are normally difficult to find in the malagasy forests often the hooting breeding call is all that betrays their presence these birds nest as solitary pairs in holes in the ground which they excavate themselves unlike the true rollers which rarely nest in ground holes and even then do not dig their own nests mtdna analyses confirmed the systematics of this group but indicated that merging geobiastes into brachypteracias as was usually done since the 1960s should be reversed at least until a more comprehensive review e g supported by fossils is possible kirchman et al 2001

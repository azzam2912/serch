analysis of simosthenurus fossils has contributed to the finding that there are three lineages of macropods sthenurinae macropodinae and lagostrophinae the genus simosthenurus was among the sthenurines the two most documented members of the genus are s maddocki and s occidentalis though other species have also been discovered osteological information predominantly cave floor surface finds has yielded that simosthenurus is part of the same family as that of modern kangaroos however modern kangaroos are plantigrade hoppers using jumping as their means of locomotion while simosthenurus was a bipedal unguligrade walking in a manner similar to that of hominids although members of simosthenurus were no taller than most modern species of kangaroo their robust bones broad pelvis long arms and short necks were unique adaptations to their browsing mode of feeding they had single toed hind feet had small hoof like nails more typical of animals adapted to moving over relatively flat terrain simosthenurus is a highly distinct lineage of macropods with no living descendants however it is possible that their closest living cousin is the banded hare wallaby which is now restricted to small isolated islands off the coast of western australia s occidentalis mtdna sequences were obtained from fossils

these techniques are used for a variety of reasons including the establishment of secure communications increasing resistance to natural interference noise and jamming to prevent detection and to limit power flux density e g in satellite down links this is a technique in which a telecommunication signal is transmitted on a bandwidth considerably larger than the frequency content of the original information frequency hopping is a basic modulation technique used in spread spectrum signal transmission spread spectrum telecommunications is a signal structuring technique that employs direct sequence frequency hopping or a hybrid of these which can be used for multiple access and or multiple functions this technique decreases the potential interference to other receivers while achieving privacy spread spectrum generally makes use of a sequential noise like signal structure to spread the normally narrowband information signal over a relatively wideband radio band of frequencies the receiver correlates the received signals to retrieve the original information signal originally there were two motivations either to resist enemy efforts to jam the communications anti jam or aj or to hide the fact that communication was even taking place sometimes called low probability of intercept lpi frequency hopping spread spectrum fhss direct sequence spread

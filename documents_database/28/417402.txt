the field r includes in particular infinitesimal infinitely small numbers providing a rigorous mathematical justification for their use roughly speaking the idea is to express analysis over r in a suitable language of mathematical logic and then point out that this language applies equally well to r this turns out to be possible because at the set theoretic level the propositions in such a language are interpreted to apply only to internal sets rather than to all sets note that the term language is used in a loose sense in the above edward nelson s internal set theory is an axiomatic approach to non standard analysis see also palmgren at constructive non standard analysis conventional infinitary accounts of non standard analysis also use the concept of internal sets relative to the ultrapower construction of the hyperreal numbers as equivalence classes of sequences formula 1 an internal subset a of r is one defined by a sequence of real sets formula 2 where a hyperreal formula 3 is said to belong to the set formula 4 if and only if the set of indices n such that formula 5 is a member of the ultrafilter used in the construction of r

most materials show some saturable absorption but often only at very high optical intensities close to the optical damage at sufficiently high incident light intensity atoms in the ground state of a saturable absorber material become excited into an upper energy state at such a rate that there is insufficient time for them to decay back to the ground state before the ground state becomes depleted and the absorption subsequently saturates saturable absorbers are useful in laser cavities the key parameters for a saturable absorber are its wavelength range where it absorbs its dynamic response how fast it recovers and its saturation intensity and fluence at what intensity or pulse energy it saturates they are commonly used for passive q switching within the simple model of saturated absorption the relaxation rate of excitations does not depend on the intensity then for the continuous wave operation the absorption rate or simply absorption formula 1 is determined by intensity formula 2 where formula 4 is linear absorption and formula 5 is saturation intensity these parameters are related with the concentration formula 6 of the active centers in the medium the effective cross sections formula 7 and the lifetime formula 8 of the

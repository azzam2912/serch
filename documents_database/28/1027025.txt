the resulting current crowding is termed the proximity effect this crowding gives an increase in the effective resistance of the circuit which increases with frequency a changing magnetic field will influence the distribution of an electric current flowing within an electrical conductor by electromagnetic induction when an alternating current ac flows through a conductor it creates an associated alternating magnetic field around it the alternating magnetic field induces eddy currents in adjacent conductors altering the overall distribution of current flowing through them the result is that the current is concentrated in the areas of the conductor farthest away from nearby conductors carrying current in the same direction the proximity effect can significantly increase the ac resistance of adjacent conductors when compared to its resistance to a dc current the effect increases with frequency at higher frequencies the ac resistance of a conductor can easily exceed ten times its dc resistance for example if two wires carrying the same alternating current lie parallel to one another as would be found in a coil used in an inductor or transformer the magnetic field of one wire will induce longitudinal eddy currents in the adjacent wire that flow in long loops along the

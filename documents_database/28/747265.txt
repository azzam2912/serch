to investigate this he examines the origins and history of the aids epidemic and draws upon epidemiology sociology gay history ecology and many other disciplines his conclusion is that gay men need to add a strategy of partner reduction to the strategy of condoms in order to bring new infections down rotello s central argument derives from the epidemiological concept that sexually transmitted epidemics are the result of three factors sometimes called the triad of risk 1 the infectivity of a sexually transmitted disease std or how easily it spreads 2 the prevalence of that std in a particular group and 3 the contact rate or the average number of sexual partners that people have within a particular group rotello argues that gay men significantly lowered the first leg of the triad infectivity through the use of condoms yet condoms alone proved unable to quell the epidemic because the second leg of the triad prevalence was already so high therefore gay men needed to address the third leg of the triad the contact rate rotello argues that lowering the contact rate while continuing to emphasize condoms might provide enough additional room for error to bring new infections below the epidemic

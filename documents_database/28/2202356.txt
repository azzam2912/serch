it is a derived unit in the planck system of natural units planck acceleration may be stated as where a is the planck acceleration c is the speed of light t is the planck time and g is the standard acceleration of gravity the planck acceleration is the highest acceleration conceivable in the universe as the speed of light is the highest possible speed and the planck time is the shortest possible duration of any meaningful physical process this limitation does assume that relativity has natural units however it is not clear whether any object in the universe actually reaches or can reach the planck acceleration one event where the planck acceleration was possibly reached was the big bang in regard to the acceleration of the expanding universe during the planck epoch also within a black hole such acceleration might be possible beyond its horizon but that is certainly unknown and what lies beyond a horizon is beyond the reach of physical observation in a classical description photons emanating from their subluminal source for example a particle antiparticle collision experience zero acceleration as they always travel at the speed of light however since the planck time is the least conceivable

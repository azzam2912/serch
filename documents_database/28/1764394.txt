any module over a ring has a flat cover that is unique up to non unique isomorphism flat covers are in some sense dual to injective hulls and are related to projective covers and torsion free covers the homomorphism f m is defined to be a flat cover of m if it is surjective f is flat every homomorphism from flat module to m factors through f and any map from f to f commuting with the map to m is an automorphism of f while projective covers for modules do not always exist it was speculated that for general rings every module would have a flat cover this flat cover conjecture was explicitly first stated in the conjecture turned out to be true resolved positively and proved simultaneously by this was preceded by important contributions by p eklof j trlifaj and j xu any module m over a ring has a resolution by flat modules such that each f is the flat cover of the kernel of f f such a resolution is unique up to isomorphism and is a minimal flat resolution in the sense that any flat resolution of m factors through it any homomorphism of modules

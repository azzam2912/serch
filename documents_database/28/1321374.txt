calcium oxalate ca coo caox crystals are found in algae angiosperms and gymnosperms in a total of more than 215 families these plants accumulate oxalate in the range of 3 80 w w of their dry weight through a biomineralization process in a variety of shapes araceae have numerous druses multi crystal druses and needle shaped raphide crystals of caox present in the tissue druses are also found in leaves and bud scales of prunus rosa allium vitis morus and phaseolus a number of biochemical pathways for calcium oxalate biomineralization in plants have been proposed among these are the cleavage of isocitrate the hydrolysis of oxaloacetate glycolate glyoxylate oxidation and or oxidative cleavage of l ascorbic acid the cleavage of ascorbic acid appears to be the most studied pathway the specific mechanism controlling this process is unclear but it has been suggested that a number of factors influence crystal shape and growth such as proteins polysaccharides and lipids or macromolecular membrane structures druses may also have some purpose in calcium regulation

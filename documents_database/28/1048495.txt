practical examples include the relation between 3d points in a scene and their projection onto the image plane of a pinhole camera and homographies an ordinary system of linear equations can be solved for example by rewriting it as a matrix equation formula 9 where matrices formula 10 and formula 11 contain the vectors formula 3 and formula 4 in their respective columns given that there exists a unique solution it is given by solutions can also be described in the case that the equations are over or under determined what makes the direct linear transformation problem distinct from the above standard case is the fact that the left and right sides of the defining equation can differ by an unknown multiplicative factor which is dependent on k as a consequence formula 6 cannot be computed as in the standard case instead the similarity relations are rewritten as proper linear homogeneous equations which then can be solved by a standard method the combination of rewriting the similarity equations as homogeneous linear equations and solving them by standard methods is referred to as a direct linear transformation algorithm or dlt algorithm dlt is attributed to ivan sutherland let formula 16 and

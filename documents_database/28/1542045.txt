it has only been found in martian and lunar meteorites where it is presumably formed from either tridymite or cristobalite other polymorphs of quartz as a result of heating during the atmospheric re entry and impact to the earth at an estimated minimal pressure of 35 gpa it can also be produced in the laboratory by compressing cristobalite in a diamond anvil cell to pressures above 40 gpa the mineral is named after friedrich seifert born 1941 the founder of the bayerisches geoinstitut at university of bayreuth germany and is officially recognized by the international mineralogical association seifertite forms micrometre sized crystalline lamellae embedded into a glassy sio matrix the lamellae are rather difficult to analyze as they vitrify within seconds under laser or electron beams used for standard raman spectroscopy or electron beam microanalysis even at much reduced beam intensities nevertheless it was possible to verify that it is mainly composed of sio with minor inclusions of nao 0 40 wt and alo 1 14 wt x ray diffraction reveals that the mineral has scrutinyite pbo type structure with an orthorhombic symmetry and pbcn or pb2n space group its lattice constants a 4 097 b 5 0462 c 4

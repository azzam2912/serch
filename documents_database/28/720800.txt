it belongs to the smad family of proteins which belong to the tgf superfamily of modulators like many other tgf family members smad9 is involved in cell signalling when a bone morphogenetic protein binds to a receptor bmp type 1 receptor kinase it causes smad9 to interact with smad anchor for receptor activation sara the binding of ligands causes the phosphorylation of the smad9 protein and the dissociation from sara and the association with smad4 it is subsequently transferred to the nucleus where it forms complexes with other proteins and acts as a transcription factor smad9 is a receptor regulated smad r smad and is activated by bone morphogenetic protein type 1 receptor kinase there are two isoforms of the protein confusingly it is also sometimes referred to as smad8 in the literature the smad proteins are homologs of both the drosophila protein mothers against decapentaplegic mad and the c elegans protein sma the name is a combination of the two during drosophila research it was found that a mutation in the gene mad in the mother repressed the gene decapentaplegic in the embryo the phrase mothers against was added since mothers often form organizations opposing various issues e g

it is sometimes claimed that around the 10th century bce a distinct hebrew variant the original hebrew script emerged which was widely used in the ancient kingdoms of israel and judah until they fell in the 8th and 6th centuries bce respectively it is not straightforward however to distinguish israelite judahite scripts from others which were in use in the immediate area most notably by the moabites and ammonites following the babylonian exile jews gradually stopped using the hebrew script and instead adopted the square aramaic script another offshoot of the same family of scripts this script used for writing hebrew later evolved into the jewish or square script that is still used today closely related scripts were in use all over the middle east for several hundred years but following the rise of christianity and later the rise of islam they gave way to the latin and arabic scripts respectively the hebrew alphabet was later adapted in order to write down the languages of the jewish diaspora karaim jud o arabic ladino yiddish etc and was retained all the while in relatively unadapted form throughout the diaspora for hebrew which remained the language of jewish law scriptures and scholarship

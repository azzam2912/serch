the specification is also referred to as the usb 3 0 host controller specification the xhci is a radical break from the previous generations of usb host controller interface architectures i e the open host controller interface ohci the universal host controller interface uhci and the enhanced host controller interface ehci on many counts following are the key goals of the xhci architecture the ohci and uhci controllers support only usb 1 speed devices 1 5 mbit s and 12 mbit s and the ehci only supports usb 2 devices 480 mbit s the xhci architecture was designed to support all usb speeds including superspeed 5 gbit s and future speeds under a single driver stack when usb was originally developed in 1995 it was targeted at desktop platforms to stem the proliferation of connectors that were appearing on pcs e g ps 2 serial port parallel port game port etc and host power consumption was not an important consideration at the time since then mobile platforms have become the platform of choice and their batteries have made power consumption a key consideration the architectures of the legacy usb host controllers ohci uhci and ehci were very similar in that

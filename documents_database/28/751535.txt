three possible isomers of carbon trioxide with molecular symmetry point groups c d and c have been most studied by theoretical methods and the c state has been shown to be the ground state of the molecule carbon trioxide should not be confused with the stable carbonate ion co carbon trioxide can be produced for example in the drift zone of a negative corona discharge by reactions between carbon dioxide co and the atomic oxygen o created from molecular oxygen by free electrons in the plasma another reported method is photolysis of ozone o dissolved in liquid co or in co sf mixtures at 45 c irradiated with light of 253 7 nm the formation of co is inferred but it appears to decay spontaneously by the route 2co 2co o with a lifetime much shorter than 1 minute carbon trioxide can be made by blowing ozone at dry ice solid co and it has also been detected in reactions between carbon monoxide co and molecular oxygen o along with the ground state c isomer the first spectroscopic detection of the d isomer was in electron irradiated ices of carbon dioxide

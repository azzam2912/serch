he lines are very weak or missing but there are lines of o unusually there are lines of hydrogen and absorption components in many lines creating p cygni profiles overall the emission is weaker than stars of similar spectral type and it has often been suggested that wr 3 has a type o binary companion however there are no other signs of a companion and it is thought to be a single star with a spectral type of wn3 hw the h and w indicate that hydrogen is present and the emission is weaker for the class ordered by right ascension wr 3 was the third star in the sixth catalogue of galactic wolf rayet stars wr 1 and wr 2 are also both early wn stars in cassiopeiae wr 3 is a massive and luminous star the presence of hydrogen in its spectrum suggests that it is younger than hydrogen free wr stars and may still be fusing hydrogen in its core the emission lines of heavy elements in its spectrum are produced by strong convection and powerful stellar winds rather than complete loss of the outer layers of the star the wind has been measured at 2 700

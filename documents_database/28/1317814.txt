whereas its nominal formula is almgb the chemical composition is closer to almgb it is a ceramic alloy that is highly resistive to wear and has an extremely low coefficient of sliding friction reaching a record value of 0 02 in lubricated almgb tib composites first reported in 1970 bam has an orthorhombic structure with four icosahedral b units per unit cell this ultrahard material has a coefficient of thermal expansion comparable to that of other widely used materials such as steel and concrete bam powders are commercially produced by heating a nearly stoichiometric mixture of elemental boron low grade because it contains magnesium and aluminium for a few hours at a temperature in the range 900 c to 1500 c spurious phases are then dissolved in hot hydrochloric acid to ease the reaction and make the product more homogeneous the starting mixture can be processed in a high energy ball mill all pretreatments are carried out in a dry inert atmosphere to avoid oxidation of the metal powders bam films can be coated on silicon or metals by pulsed laser deposition using almgb powder as a target whereas bulk samples are obtained by sintering the powder bam usually contains

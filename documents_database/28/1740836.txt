some examples of typical scenarios are that a surveyor doing social research conducts an interview where the research participant is a respondent or when a researcher for a clinical trial asks for a blood sample from a participant to see if there is a relationship between something which can be measured in blood and a person s health in both cases the ideal outcome is that any participant can join the study and neither the researcher nor the study design nor the publication of the study results would ever identify any participant in the study people decide to participate in research for any number of different reasons such as a personal interest a desire to promote research which benefits their community or for other reasons various guidelines for human subject research protect study participants who choose to participate in research and the international consensus is that the rights of people who participate in studies are best protected when the study participant can trust that researchers will not connect the identities of study participants with their input into the study many study participants have experienced problems when their privacy was not upheld after participating in research sometimes privacy is not kept

industrial radiography can be performed utilizing either x rays or gamma rays both are forms of electromagnetic radiation the difference between various forms of electromagnetic energy is related to the wavelength x and gamma rays have the shortest wavelength and this property leads to the ability to penetrate travel through and exit various materials such as carbon steel and other metals radiography started in 1895 with the discovery of x rays later also called r ntgen rays after the man who first described their properties in detail a type of electromagnetic radiation soon after the discovery of x rays radioactivity was discovered by using radioactive sources such as radium far higher photon energies could be obtained than those from normal x ray generators soon these found various applications with one of the earliest users being loughborough college x rays and gamma rays were put to use very early before the dangers of ionizing radiation were discovered after world war ii new isotopes such as caesium 137 iridium 192 and cobalt 60 became available for industrial radiography and the use of radium and radon decreased gamma radiation sources most commonly iridium 192 and cobalt 60 are used to inspect a variety

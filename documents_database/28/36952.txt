465 bc c 395 bc was a greek philosopher and part of the first generation of sophists he came to athens as ambassador from ceos and became known as a speaker and a teacher plato treats him with greater respect than the other sophists and in several of the platonic dialogues socrates appears as the friend of prodicus one writer claims socrates used his method of instruction prodicus made linguistics and ethics prominent in his curriculum the content of one of his speeches is still known and concerns a fable in which heracles has to make a choice between virtue and vice he also interpreted religion through the framework of naturalism prodicus was a native of ioulis on the island of ceos the birthplace of simonides whom he is described as having imitated prodicus came frequently to athens for the purpose of transacting business on behalf of his native city and attracted admiration as an orator although his voice was deep and apt to fall plutarch describes him as slender and weak and plato also alludes to his weakness and a degree of effeminacy which thus resulted philostratus accuses him of luxury and avarice but no earlier source mentions this

since the coast guard policy in 1960 was not to name cutters under in length it was designated as wpb 82303 when commissioned and acquired the name point young in january 1964 when the coast guard started naming all cutters longer than point young was built to accommodate an 8 man crew she was powered by two vt600 cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five bladed propellers the main drive engines were later replaced by vt800 cummins engines water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95 full engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment the design specifications for point young included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non manned main drive engine spaces controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room

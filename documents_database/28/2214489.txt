the similarities are expressed using the tanimoto coefficients and the target compounds are ranked accordingly lisica is also available as lisica pymol plugin both on linux and windows operating systems as an input lisica requires at least one reference compound and database of target compounds for 3d screening this database has to be a pregenerated database of conformations of target and for 2d screening a topology that is a list of atoms and bonds for each target compound on each step the algorithm compares reference compound to one of the compounds from target compounds based on their 2d or 3d representation both compounds molecules are converted to molecular graphs in 2d and 3d screening the molecular graph vertices represent atoms in 2d screening edges of molecular graph represent covalent bonds while in 3d screening edges are drawn between every pair of vertices and have no chemical meaning a product graph generated from molecular graphs is then searched using fast maximum clique algorithm to find the largest substructure common to both compounds the similarity between compounds is calculated using tanimoto coefficients and target compounds are ranked according to their tanimoto coefficients lisica can search 2d and 3d similarities between a reference

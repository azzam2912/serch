trpv2 is a nonspecific cation channel that is a part of the trp channel family this channel allows the cell to communicate with its extracellular environment through the transfer of ions and responds to noxious temperatures greater than 52 c it has a structure similar to that of potassium channels and has similar functions throughout multiple species recent research has also shown multiple interactions in the human body the vanilloid trp subfamily trpv named after the vanilloid receptor 1 consist of six members four of them trpv1 trpv4 have been related to thermal sensation trpv2 shares 50 of its homology with trpv1 compared to trpv1 channels trpv2 channels do not open in response to vanilloids like capsaicin or thermal stimuli around 43 c this may be due to the composition of the ankyrin repeat domains in trpv2 which are different than those in trpv1 however trpv2 channels can open by noxious temperatures greater than 52 c trpv2 initially was characterized as a noxious heat sensor channel but more evidence suggest its importance in various osmosensory and mechanosensory mechanisms the channel can open in response to a variety of stimuli including hormones growth factors mechanical stretching heat osmotic swelling lysophospholipids and

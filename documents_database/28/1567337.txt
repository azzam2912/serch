such information may be e g an alert signal triggered when someone or something has breached a light curtain on a factory floor while traditional safety solutions rely on dedicated communication lines connecting machinery and control systems via special relays opensafety does not need any extra cables reserved for safety related information it is a bus based protocol that allows for passing on safety data over existing industrial ethernet connections between end devices and higher level automation systems connections principally established and used for regular monitoring and control purposes unlike other bus based safety protocols that are suitable for use only with a single or a few specific industrial ethernet implementations and are incompatible with other systems opensafety works with a wide range of different industrial ethernet variants opensafety is certified according to iec 61508 and meets the requirements of sil 3 applications the protocol has been approved by national iec committees representing over two dozen countries around the world and has been released for international standardization in iec 61784 3 fscp 13 opensafety supports functional features to enable fast data transfer such as direct communication between nodes on a network cross traffic as well as a range of measures

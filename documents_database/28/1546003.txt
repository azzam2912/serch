the problem may be formally stated as follows given n points in the plane it is required to interconnect them all by a shortest network which consists only of vertical and horizontal line segments it can be shown that such a network is a tree whose vertices are the input points plus some extra points steiner points the problem arises in the physical design of electronic design automation in vlsi circuits wire routing is carried out by wires running only in vertical and horizontal directions due to high computational complexity of the task therefore wire length is the sum of the lengths of vertical and horizontal segments and the distance between two pins of a net is actually the rectilinear distance manhattan distance between the corresponding geometric points in the design plane it is known that the search for the rsmt may be restricted to the hanan grid constructed by drawing vertical and horizontal lines through each vertex the rsmt is an np hard problem and as with other np hard problems common approaches to tackle it are approximate algorithms heuristic algorithms and separation of efficiently solvable special cases an overview of the approaches to the problem may be found

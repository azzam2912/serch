it was initially thought to be important for hematopoiesis notably for megakaryocyte maturation but subsequently shown to be redundant for platelets and for other blood cell types in both mice and humans it is also known under the names adipogenesis inhibitory factor agif and was developed as a recombinant protein rhil 11 as the drug substance oprelvekin the human il 11 gene consisting of 5 exons and 4 introns is located on chromosome 19 and encodes a 23 kda protein il 11 is a member of the il 6 type cytokine family distinguished based on their use of the common co receptor gp130 signal specificity is provided by the il 11r subunit which is expressed at high levels in fibroblasts and other stromal cells but not immune cells unlike il6 receptors that are expressed at highest levels in immune cells and lowly expressed in stromal cells signal transduction is initiated upon binding of il 11 to il 11ralpha and gp130 facilitating the formation of higher order structures involving dimers of gp130 il 11 il11ra complexes in some instances in epithelial derived cells and cancer cell lines this permits gp130 associated janus kinases jak activation and downstream stat mediated transcriptional activities

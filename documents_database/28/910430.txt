the term is also used to describe modern bindings sewn in the same style coptic bindings the first true codices are characterized by one or more sections of parchment papyrus or paper sewn through their folds and if more than one section attached to each other with chain stitch linkings across the spine rather than to the thongs or cords running across the spine that characterise european bindings from the 8th century onwards in practice the phrase coptic binding usually refers to multi section bindings while single section coptic codices are often referred to as nag hammadi bindings after the 13 codices found in 1945 which exemplify the form nag hammadi bindings were constructed with a textblock of papyrus sheets assembled into a single section and trimmed along the fore edge after folding to prevent the inner sheets from extending outward beyond the outer sheets because the inner sheets were narrower than the outer sheets after trimming the width of text varied through the textblock and it is likely that the papyrus was not written on until after it was bound this in turn would have made it a necessity to calculate the number of sheets needed for a manuscript

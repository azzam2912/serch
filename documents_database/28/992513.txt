they can all read textures and buffers and they use instruction sets that are almost identical earlier gpus generally included two types of shader hardware with the vertex shaders having considerably more instructions than the simpler pixel shaders this lowered the cost of implementation of the gpu as a whole and allowed more shaders in total on a single unit this was at the cost of making the system less flexible and sometimes leaving one set of shaders idle if the workload used one more than the other as improvements in fabrication continued this distinction became less useful ati technologies introduced a unified architecture on the hardware they developed for the xbox 360 and then introduced this in card form in the terascale line nvidia quickly followed with their tesla design the concept has been universal since then early shader abstractions such as shader model 1 x used very different instruction sets for vertex and pixel shaders with vertex shaders having much more flexible instruction set later shader models such as shader model 2 x and 3 0 reduced the differences approaching unified shader model even in the unified model the instruction set may not be completely the same between

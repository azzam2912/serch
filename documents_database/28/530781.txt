it generalises the boolean satisfiability problem sat which is a decision problem considered in complexity theory it is defined as given a 3 cnf formula i e with at most 3 variables per clause find an assignment that satisfies the largest number of clauses max 3sat is a canonical complete problem for the complexity class maxsnp shown complete in papadimitriou pg 314 the decision version of max 3sat is np complete therefore a polynomial time solution can only be achieved if p np an approximation within a factor of 2 can be achieved with this simple algorithm however the karloff zwick algorithm runs in polynomial time and satisfies 7 8 of the clauses the pcp theorem implies that there exists an 0 such that 1 approximation of max 3sat is np hard proof any np complete problem by the pcp theorem for x l a 3 cnf formula is constructed so that the verifier v reads all required bits at once i e makes non adaptive queries this is valid because the number of queries remains constant next we try to find a boolean formula to simulate this we introduce boolean variables x x where l is the length of

it can be used for inference of maximum a posteriori map state or estimation of conditional or marginal distributions over a subset of variables the algorithm has exponential time complexity but could be efficient in practice for the low treewidth graphs if the proper elimination order is used enabling a key reduction in algorithmic complexity a factor formula 1 also known as a potential of variables formula 2 is a relation between each instantiation of formula 3 of variables formula 1 to a non negative number commonly denoted as formula 5 a factor does not necessarily have a set interpretation one may perform operations on factors of different representations such as a probability distribution or conditional distribution joint distributions often become too large to handle as the complexity of this operation is exponential thus variable elimination becomes more feasible when computing factorized entities algorithm 1 called sum out so or marginalization eliminates a single variable formula 3 from a set formula 7 of factors and returns the resulting set of factors the algorithm collect relevant simply returns those factors in formula 7 involving variable formula 3 algorithm 1 sum out formula 3 formula 7 return formula 17 example here we

in adults it can lead to severe consequences such as sepsis or epidural abscess but it can also spontaneously resolve especially in children under 8 years of age discitis occurs post surgically in approximately 1 2 percent of patients after spinal surgery symptoms include severe back pain leading to lack of mobility some very young children may refuse to walk and arching of the back is possible in post operative situations the symptoms occur within a week and result in severe low back pain or neck pain depending on the surgical location if untreated the discitis may resolve on its own causing spontaneous fusion of the intervertebral disc space cause a chronic low grade infection or progress to osteomyelitis and possibly even an epidural abscess in case of concomitant inflammation of one or more vertebrae in such cases usually involving the areas adjacent to the intervertebral disc spaces the condition is called spondylodiscitis there is debate as to the cause although hematogenous seeding of the offending organism is favored as well as direct spread it is important to differentiate between spontaneous discitis which is usually from hematologic spread from a urinary or respiratory infection versus that from a post operative

allegories can be used as an abstraction of categories of relations and in this sense the theory of allegories is a generalization of relation algebra to relations between different sorts allegories are also useful in defining and investigating certain constructions in category theory such as exact completions in this article we adopt the convention that morphisms compose from right to left so means first do then do an allegory is a category in which all such that here we are abbreviating using the order defined by the intersection formula 14 means formula 15 a first example of an allegory is the category of sets and relations the objects of this allegory are sets and a morphism formula 16 is a binary relation between and composition of morphisms is composition of relations intersection of morphisms is intersection of relations in a category a relation between objects and is a span of morphisms formula 17 that is jointly monic two such spans formula 18 and formula 19 are considered equivalent when there is an isomorphism between and that make everything commute strictly speaking relations are only defined up to equivalence one may formalise this either by using equivalence classes or by using

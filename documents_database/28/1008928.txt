resistivity and ip methods are often applied on the ground surface using multiple four electrode sites in an ip survey in addition to resistivity measurement capacitive properties of the subsurface materials are determined as well as a result ip surveys provide additional information about the spatial variation in lithology and grain surface chemistry the ip survey can be made in time domain and frequency domain mode in the time domain induced polarization method the voltage response is observed as a function of time after the injected current is switched off or on in the frequency domain induced polarization mode an alternating current is injected into the ground with variable frequencies voltage phase shifts are measured to evaluate the impedance spectrum at different injection frequencies which is commonly referred to as spectral ip the ip method is one of the most widely used techniques in mineral exploration and mining industry and it has other applications in hydrogeophysical surveys environmental investigations and geotechnical engineering projects time domain ip methods measure considers the resulting voltage following a change in the injected current the time domain ip potential response can be evaluated by considering the mean value on the resulting voltage known as integral

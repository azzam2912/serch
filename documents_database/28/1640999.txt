it should not be confused with the south geomagnetic pole described later for historical reasons the end of a freely hanging magnet that points roughly north is itself called the north pole of the magnet and the other end pointing south is called the magnet s south pole because opposite poles attract earth s south magnetic pole is physically actually a magnetic north pole see also the south magnetic pole is constantly shifting due to changes in earth s magnetic field as of 2005 it was calculated to lie at placing it off the coast of antarctica between ad lie land and wilkes land in 2015 it lay at est that point lies outside the antarctic circle due to polar drift the pole is moving northwest by about per year its current distance from the actual geographic south pole is approximately the nearest permanent science station is dumont d urville station early unsuccessful attempts to reach the magnetic south pole included those of french explorer dumont d urville 1837 40 american charles wilkes expedition of 1838 42 and briton james clark ross expedition of 1839 to 1843 the first calculation of the magnetic inclination to locate the magnetic south pole

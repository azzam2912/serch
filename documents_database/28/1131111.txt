the polg2 gene encodes a 55 kda accessory subunit protein that imparts high processivity and salt tolerance to the catalytic subunit of dna polymerase gamma encoded by the polg gene mutations in this gene result in autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia with mitochondrial dna deletions polg2 is located on the q arm of chromosome 17 in position 23 3 and has 8 exons polg2 the protein encoded by this gene contains a phosphoserine modified residue at p 38 and a transit peptide its structure consists of 25 beta strands 21 alpha helixes and 8 turns polg2 encodes the processivity subunit of the mitochondrial dna polymerase gamma the encoded protein forms a heterotrimer containing one catalytic subunit and two processivity subunits this protein enhances dna binding stimulates polymerase and exonuclease activity and promotes processive dna synthesis deoxynucleoside triphosphate dna n diphosphate dna n 1 mutations in polg2 have been associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia with mitochondrial dna deletions this disease results in progressive weakness of ocular muscles and levator muscle of the upper eyelid and patients with it may also manifest skeletal myopathy ragged red fibers and atrophy shown on muscle biopsy cataracts hearing loss sensory axonal neuropathy ataxia depression hypogonadism

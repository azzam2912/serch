tira has a 34 metre parabolic dish antenna is a monopulse radar operating at 1 333 ghz or 22 5 cm l band and 16 7 ghz or 1 8 cm ku band wavelengths the l band is usually used for tracking debris with a 0 45 beam width at 1 mw peak power the system is capable of determining orbits from direction angles range and doppler shift for single targets the detection size threshold is about 2 cm at 1000 km range the radar conducts regular beam park experiments where the radar beam is pointed in a fixed direction on the celestial sphere for 24 hours scanning 360 in a narrow strip a complete earth rotation the tracking sensitive can be enhanced when the tira system is used as a transmitter part of a bistatic radar system in conjunction with the effelsberg radio telescope functioning as a receiver the combined system has a detection size threshold of 1 cm the ku band is used for imaging in inverse synthetic aperture radar isar mode with 13 kw peak power the radar is capable of producing images with range resolutions better than 7 cm the dish can be turned full 360

many colors are possible but all variations are produced by changes in only a few genes extension and agouti are particularly well known genes with dramatic effects differences at the agouti gene determine whether a horse is bay or black and a change to the extension gene can make a horse chestnut instead most domestic horses have a variant of the dun gene which saturates the coat with color so that they are bay black or chestnut instead of dun grullo or red dun a mutation called cream is responsible for palomino buckskin and cremello horses pearl champagne and silver dapple also lighten the coat and sometimes the skin and eyes as well genes that affect the distribution of melanocytes create patterns of white such as in roan pinto leopard white and even white markings finally the gray gene causes premature graying slowly adding white hairs over the course of several years until the horse looks white some of these patterns have complex interactions most wild equids are bay dun and so were horses before domestication non dun 1 is one of the oldest coat color mutations and has been found in remains from 42 700 years ago along with

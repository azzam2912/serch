the sediments that the ancient channel is cut into or buried by can be unconsolidated semi consolidated consolidated or lithified the word palaeochannel is formed from the palaeo meaning old and channel it may be synonymous with palaeovalley and palaeoriver a palaeochannel is distinct from the overbank deposits of currently active river channels including ephemeral water courses that do not regularly flow such as the todd river central australia because the river bed is filled with sedimentary deposits unrelated to the normal bed load of the current drainage pattern many palaeochannels are arranged on old drainage patterns distinct from the current drainage system of a catchment for example palaeochannels may relate to a system of rivers and creeks that drained east west if the current drainage direction is north south palaeochannels can be most easily identified as broad erosional channels into a basement that underlies a system of depositional sequences which may contain several episodes of deposition and represent meandering peneplain streams thereafter a palaeochannel may form part of the regolith of a region and although it is unconsolidated or partly consolidated it is currently part of the erosional surface palaeochannels can also be identified according to their age for

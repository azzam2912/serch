directional solidification is solidification that occurs from farthest end of the casting and works its way towards the sprue progressive solidification also known as parallel solidification is solidification that starts at the walls of the casting and progresses perpendicularly from that surface most metals and alloys shrink as the material changes from a liquid state to a solid state therefore if liquid material is not available to compensate for this shrinkage a shrinkage defect forms when progressive solidification dominates over directional solidification a shrinkage defect will form the geometrical shape of the mold cavity has a direct effect on progressive and directional solidification at the end of tunnel type geometries divergent heat flow occurs which causes that area of the casting to cool faster than surrounding areas this is called an end effect large cavities do not cool as quickly as surrounding areas because there is less heat flow this is called a riser effect also note that corners can create divergent or convergent also known as hot spots heat flow areas in order to induce directional solidification chills risers insulating sleeves control of pouring rate and pouring temperature can be utilized directional solidification can be used as a purification

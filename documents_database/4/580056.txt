low resistance ohmic contacts are used to allow charge to flow easily in both directions between the two conductors without blocking due to rectification or excess power dissipation due to voltage thresholds by contrast a junction or contact that does not demonstrate a linear i v curve is called non ohmic non ohmic contacts come in a number of forms such as p n junction schottky barrier rectifying heterojunction or breakdown junction generally the term ohmic contact implicitly refers to an ohmic contact of a metal to a semiconductor where achieving ohmic contact resistance is possible but requires careful technique metal metal ohmic contacts are relatively simpler to make by ensuring direct contact between the metals without intervening layers of insulating contamination excessive roughness or oxidation various techniques are used to create ohmic metal metal junctions soldering welding crimping deposition electroplating etc this article focuses on metal semiconductor ohmic contacts stable contacts at semiconductor interfaces with low contact resistance and linear i v behavior are critical for the performance and reliability of semiconductor devices and their preparation and characterization are major efforts in circuit fabrication poorly prepared junctions to semiconductors can easily show rectifying behaviour by causing depletion of the

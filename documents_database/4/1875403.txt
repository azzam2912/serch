this important metal is an alloy composed of copper and tin in proportion which vary slightly but may be normally considered as nine parts of copper to one of tin other ingredients which are occasionally found are more or less accidental the result is a metal of a rich golden brown colour capable of being worked by casting a process little applicable to its component parts but peculiarly successful with bronze the density and hardness of the metal allowing it to take any impression of a mould however delicate it is thus possible to create ornamental work of various kinds the process of casting is known as cire perdue and is the most primitive and most commonly employed through the centuries having been described by the monk theophilus and also by benvenuto cellini briefly it is as follows a core roughly representing the size and form of the object to be produced is made of pounded brick plaster or other similar substance and thoroughly dried upon this the artist overlays his wax which he models to the degree required in his finished work passing from the core through the wax and projecting beyond are metal rods the modelling being completed

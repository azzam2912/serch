the model is a simulation of the discharge which might occur when a human touches an electronic device the hbm definition most widely used is the test model defined in the united states military standard mil std 883 method 3015 9 electrostatic discharge sensitivity classification this method establishes a simplified equivalent electrical circuit and the necessary test procedures required to model an hbm esd event an internationally widely used standard is jedec standard js 001 hbm is used primarily for manufacturing environments to quantify a integrated circuit to survive the manufacturing process a similar standard iec 61000 4 2 is used for system level testing and quantifies protection levels for a real world esd event in an uncontrolled environment in both js 001 2012 and mil std 883h the charged human body is modeled by a 100 pf capacitor and a 1500 ohm discharging resistance during testing the capacitor is fully charged to several kilovolts 2 kv 4 kv 6 kv and 8 kv are typical standard levels and then discharged through the resistor connected in series to the device under test wayback machine copy

as part of the crres program the spacerad space radiation effects project managed by air force geophysics laboratory investigated the radiation environment of the inner and outer radiation belts and measured radiation effects on state of the art microelectronics devices other magnetospheric ionospheric and cosmic ray experiments were also included onboard crres and supported by nasa or the office of naval research the chemical release project was managed by nasa msfc and utilized the release of chemicals from onboard canisters at low altitudes near dawn and dusk perigee times and at high altitudes near local midnight the chemical releases were monitored with optical and radar instrumentation by ground based observers to measure the bulk properties and movement of the expanding clouds of photo ionized plasma along field lines after the releases occurred in order to study the magnetosphere at different local times during the mission the satellite orbit was designed to precess with respect to the earth sun line such that the local time at apogee decreased by 2 5 minutes day from 08 00 lt just after launch and returned to this position in nineteen month cycles the crres spacecraft had the shape of an octagonal prism with solar

multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene the m muscarinic receptors are located in the heart where they act to slow the heart rate down to normal sinus rhythm after positive stimulatory actions of the parasympathetic nervous system by slowing the speed of depolarization they also reduce contractile forces of the atrial cardiac muscle and reduce conduction velocity of the atrioventricular node av node however they have little effect on the contractile forces of the ventricular muscle slightly decreasing force a dutch family study found that there is a highly significant association between the chrm2 gene and intelligence as measured by the wechsler adult intelligence scale revised a similar association was found independently in the minnesota twin and family study however a larger 2009 study attempting to replicate this claim instead found no significant association between the chrm2 gene and intelligence mediating olfactory guided behaviors e g odor discrimination aggression mating m muscarinic receptors act via a g type receptor which causes a decrease in camp in the cell generally leading to inhibitory type effects they appear to serve as autoreceptors in addition they modulate muscarinic potassium channels in the heart this contributes to a decreased

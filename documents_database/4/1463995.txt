if sampling proceeded until n observations were made then x x would have been multinomially distributed however if the experiment is stopped once x reaches the predetermined value k then the distribution of the m tuple x x is negative multinomial these variables are not multinomially distributed because their sum x x is not fixed being a draw from a negative binomial distribution the table below shows an example of 400 melanoma skin cancer patients where the type and site of the cancer are recorded for each subject the sites locations of the cancer may be independent but there may be positive dependencies of the type of cancer for a given location site for example localized exposure to radiation implies that elevated level of one type of cancer at a given location may indicate higher level of another cancer type at the same location the negative multinomial distribution may be used to model the cancer rates at a given site and help measure some of the cancer type dependencies within each location if formula 4 denote the cancer rates for each site formula 5 and each type of cancer formula 6 for a fixed site formula 7 the cancer rates

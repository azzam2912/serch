this form for the gain can provide intuitive insight into the circuit and often is easier to derive than a direct attack on the gain figure 1 shows a block diagram that leads to the asymptotic gain expression the asymptotic gain relation also can be expressed as a signal flow graph see figure 2 the asymptotic gain model is a special case of the extra element theorem as follows directly from limiting cases of the gain expression the asymptotic gain g is simply the gain of the system when the return ratio approaches infinity while the direct transmission term g is the gain of the system when the return ratio is zero direct application of the model involves these steps these steps can be implemented directly in spice using the small signal circuit of hand analysis in this approach the dependent sources of the devices are readily accessed in contrast for experimental measurements using real devices or spice simulations using numerically generated device models with inaccessible dependent sources evaluating the return ratio requires special methods classical feedback theory neglects feedforward g if feedforward is dropped the gain from the asymptotic gain model becomes while in classical feedback theory in terms

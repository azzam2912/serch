these compounds are not common but are of theoretical interest normally compounds with the empirical formula rp exist as rings however like other multiple bonds between heavy main group elements p p double bonds can be stabilized by a large steric hindrance from the substitutions the first isolated diphosphene bis 2 4 6 tri tert butylphenyl diphosphene was exemplified by masaaki yoshifuji and his coworkers in 1981 in which diphosphene is stabilized by two bulky phenyl group in 1877 k hler and michaelis claimed that they synthesized the first isolated diphosphene php pph however the molecular weight determination and x ray crystallographic analysis later proved that this diphosphene only had a p p single bond then the research to diphosphenes kept silent over almost 20 years until masaaki yoshifuji and his coworkers isolated the unprecedented diphosphene bis 2 4 6 tri tert butylphenyl diphosphene in 1981 they first synthesized the 2 4 6 tri tert butylphenyl phosphorus dichloride by adding phosphorus trichloride to 2 4 6 tri butylphenyl lithium that was the product of the lithium and halogen exchange the phosphorus dichloride dimerized to a diphosphene after magnesium extracted two chlorine from 2 4 6 tri tert butylphenyl phophorus dichloride

the term was coined by george philip krapp to refer to the literary technique of using nonstandard spelling that implies a pronunciation of the given word that is actually standard such as wimmin for women the spelling indicates that the character s speech overall is dialectal foreign or uneducated this form of nonstandard spelling differs from others in that a difference in spelling does not indicate a difference in pronunciation of a word that is it is dialect to the eye rather than to the ear it implies ignorance and suggests that a character would use a colloquial pronunciation if one existed some authors who use eye dialect include harriet beecher stowe maya angelou charles dickens william faulkner greer gilman alex haley joel chandler harris russell hoban terry pratchett james whitcomb riley j k rowling robert ruark john steinbeck mark twain maxine beneba clarke paul howard and irvine welsh however most authors are likely to use eye dialect with restraint sprinkling nonstandard misspelling here and there to serve as a cue to the reader about all of a character s speech rather than as an accurate phonetic representation while mostly used in dialogue eye dialect may appear in the narrative

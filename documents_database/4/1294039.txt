is a mathematician best known for his work in minimal surfaces calibrated geometry and algebraic cycles he is currently a distinguished professor of mathematics at stony brook university he received his phd from stanford university in 1969 for work carried out under the supervision of robert osserman lawson found in 1970 a method to solve free boundary value problems for unstable euclidean constant mean curvature surfaces by solving a corresponding plateau problem for minimal surfaces in s he constructed compact minimal surfaces in the 3 sphere of arbitrary genus by applying charles b morrey jr s solution of the plateau problem in general manifolds this work of lawson contains a rich set of ideas among them the conjugate surface construction for minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces the theory of calibrations whose roots are in the work of marcel berger finds its genesis in a 1982 acta mathematica paper of reese harvey and blaine lawson the theory of calibrations has grown to be important because of its many applications to gauge theory and mirror symmetry in his 1989 annals of mathematics paper algebraic cycles and homotopy theory lawson proved a theorem which is now called the lawson suspension theorem this

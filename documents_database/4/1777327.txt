these ecosystems are strongly affected by climate which gets colder as elevation increases they are stratified according to elevation dense forests are common at moderate elevations however as the elevation increases the climate becomes harsher and the plant community transitions to grasslands or tundra as elevation increases the climate becomes cooler due to a decrease in atmospheric pressure and the adiabatic cooling of airmasses the change in climate by moving up 100 meters on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers 45 miles or 0 75 of latitude towards the nearest pole the characteristic flora and fauna in the mountains tend to strongly depend on elevation because of the change in climate this dependency causes life zones to form bands of similar ecosystems at similar altitude one of the typical life zones on mountains is the montane forest at moderate elevations the rainfall and temperate climate encourages dense forests to grow holdridge defines the climate of montane forest as having a biotemperature of between where biotemperature is the mean temperature considering temperatures below to be above the elevation of the montane forest the trees thin out in the subalpine zone become twisted krummholz and eventually fail to grow

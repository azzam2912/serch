the main components of the modeling system are calmet a diagnostic 3 dimensional meteorological model calpuff an air quality dispersion model and calpost a postprocessing package each of these programs has a graphical user interface gui in addition to these components there are numerous other processors that may be used to prepare geophysical land use and terrain data in many standard formats meteorological data surface upper air precipitation and buoy data and interfaces to other models such as the penn state ncar mesoscale model mm5 the national centers for environmental prediction ncep eta model and the rams meteorological model the calpuff model is designed to simulate the dispersion of buoyant puff or continuous point and area pollution sources as well as the dispersion of buoyant continuous line sources the model also includes algorithms for handling the effect of downwash by nearby buildings in the path of the pollution plumes the calpuff model was originally developed by the sigma research corporation src in the late 1980s under contract with the california air resources board carb and it was first issued in about 1990 the sigma research corporation subsequently became part of earth tech inc after the us epa designated calpuff as

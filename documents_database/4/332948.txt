rutter for the btoa utility by using five ascii characters to represent four bytes of binary data making the encoded size larger than the original assuming eight bits per ascii character it is more efficient than uuencode or base64 which use four characters to represent three bytes of data increase assuming eight bits per ascii character its main modern uses are in adobe s postscript and portable document format file formats as well as in the patch encoding for binary files used by git the basic need for a binary to text encoding comes from a need to communicate arbitrary binary data over preexisting communications protocols that were designed to carry only english language human readable text those communication protocols may only be 7 bit safe and within that avoid certain ascii control codes and may require line breaks at certain maximum intervals and may not maintain whitespace thus only the 95 printable ascii characters are safe to use to convey data four bytes can represent 2 4 294 967 296 possible values five radix 85 digits provide 85 4 437 053 125 possible values enough to provide for a unique representation for each possible 32 bit value because five

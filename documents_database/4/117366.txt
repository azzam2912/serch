unlike fluorescence a phosphorescent material does not immediately re emit the radiation it absorbs the slower time scales of the re emission are associated with forbidden energy state transitions in quantum mechanics as these transitions occur very slowly in certain materials absorbed radiation is re emitted at a lower intensity for up to several hours after the original excitation everyday examples of phosphorescent materials are the glow in the dark toys stickers paint wristwatch and clock dials that glow after being charged with a bright light such as in any normal reading or room light typically the glow slowly fades out sometimes within a few minutes or up to a few hours in a dark room around 1604 vincenzo casciarolo discovered a lapis solaris near bologna italy once heated in an oxygen rich furnace it thereafter absorbed sunlight and glowed in the dark the study of phosphorescent materials led to the discovery of radioactivity in 1896 in simple terms phosphorescence is a process in which energy absorbed by a substance is released relatively slowly in the form of light this is in some cases the mechanism used for glow in the dark materials which are charged by exposure to light

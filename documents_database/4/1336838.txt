it encloses the central canal of the spinal cord which contains cerebrospinal fluid the brain and spinal cord together make up the central nervous system cns in humans the spinal cord begins at the occipital bone passing through the foramen magnum and entering the spinal canal at the beginning of the cervical vertebrae the spinal cord extends down to between the first and second lumbar vertebrae where it ends the enclosing bony vertebral column protects the relatively shorter spinal cord it is around in men and around long in women the diameter of the spinal cord ranges from in the cervical and lumbar regions to in the thoracic area the spinal cord functions primarily in the transmission of nerve signals from the motor cortex to the body and from the afferent fibers of the sensory neurons to the sensory cortex it is also a center for coordinating many reflexes and contains reflex arcs that can independently control reflexes it is also the location of groups of spinal interneurons that make up the neural circuits known as central pattern generators these circuits are responsible for controlling motor instructions for rhythmic movements such as walking the spinal cord is the main pathway

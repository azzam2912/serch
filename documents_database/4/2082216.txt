the ratio between the efficiency of 50 for the electric car and that of 20 or less for the combustion cars allows jean marc jancovici to state that the electric chain is 2 5 times as efficient as the combustion chain considering primary energy we need to consider embedded energy leading to a corresponding conversion ratio in france the ratio is 2 58 hence primary energy efficiency is about 0 5 2 58 or 19 similar to most combustion vehicles according to the diagram of the department of energy according to the french energy agency ademe the primary energy consumption of electric vehicles and combustion powered ones is similar by comparison in germany a greater proportion of the electricity is generated from renewable sources and the conversion ratio is 1 8 the efficiency is 0 5 1 8 or 28 higher than for combustion cars a problem of the consumption comparison is that we often compare medium or large combustion vehicles with small electric vehicles

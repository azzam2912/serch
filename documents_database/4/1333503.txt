precipitated silica is produced by precipitation from a solution containing silicate salts the three main classes of amorphous silica are pyrogenic silica precipitated silica and silica gel among them precipitated silica has the greatest commercial significance in 1999 more than one million tons were produced half of it is used in tires and shoe soles like pyrogenic silica precipitated silica is essentially not microporous unless prepared by the st ber process the production of precipitated silica starts with the reaction of an alkaline silicate solution with a mineral acid sulfuric acid and sodium silicate solutions are added simultaneously with agitation to water precipitation is carried out under alkaline conditions the choice of agitation duration of precipitation the addition rate of reactants their temperature and concentration and ph can vary the properties of the silica the formation of a gel stage is avoided by stirring at elevated temperatures the resulting white precipitate is filtered washed and dried in the manufacturing process the particles are porous primary particles with a diameter of 5 100 nm and specific surface area 5 100 m g agglomerate size is 1 40 m with average pore size is 30 nm density 1 9 2 1 g

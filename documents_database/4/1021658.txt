many real world problems can be modeled in this way for example the inputs can be design parameters of a motor the output can be the power consumption or the inputs can be business choices and the output can be the obtained profit an optimization problem in this case a minimization problem can be represented in the following way in continuous optimization a is some subset of the euclidean space r often specified by a set of constraints equalities or inequalities that the members of a have to satisfy in combinatorial optimization a is some subset of a discrete space like binary strings permutations or sets of integers the use of optimization software requires that the function f is defined in a suitable programming language and connected at compile or run time to the optimization software the optimization software will deliver input values in a the software module realizing f will deliver the computed value f x and in some cases additional information about the function like derivatives in this manner a clear separation of concerns is obtained different optimization software modules can be easily tested on the same function f or a given optimization software can be used for

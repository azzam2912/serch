the units are conventionally used for measurement of certain pressure differentials such as small pressure differences across an orifice or in a pipeline or shaft it is defined as the pressure exerted by a column of water of 1 inch in height at defined conditions at a temperature of 4 c 39 2 f pure water has its highest density 1000 kg m at that temperature and assuming the standard acceleration of gravity 1 inaq is approximately 249 082 pascals alternative standard conditions in uncommon usage are 60 f or 68 f 20 c and depends on industry standards rather than on international standards in north america air and other industrial gasses are often measured in inches of water when at low pressure this is in contrast to inches of mercury or pounds per square inch psi lbf in for larger pressures one usage is in the measurement of air wind that supplies a pipe organ and is referred simply as inches it is also used in natural gas distribution for measuring utilization pressure u p i e the residential point of use which is typically between 6 and 7 inches wc 6 7 wc or about 0 25 lbf

power is restricted in most jurisdictions not to exceed 5 mw the small width of the beam and low power of typical laser pointers make the beam itself invisible in a reasonably clean atmosphere only showing a point of light when striking an opaque surface some higher powered laser pointers project a visible beam via scattering from dust particles or water droplets along the beam path higher power and higher frequency green or blue lasers may produce a beam visible even in clean air because of rayleigh scattering from air molecules especially when viewed in moderately to dimly lit conditions the intensity of such scattering increases when these beams are viewed from angles near the beam axis such pointers particularly in the green light output range are used as astronomical object pointers for teaching purposes the low cost availability of infrared ir diode laser modules of up to 1000 mw 1 watt output has created a generation of ir pumped frequency doubled green blue and violet diode pumped solid state laser pointers with visible power up to 300 mw because the invisible ir component in the beams of these visible lasers is difficult to filter out and also because filtering

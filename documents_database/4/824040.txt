the charentes basin is named after the departments of charente and charente maritime the kaolin clays of charentes belong to this mainly continental formation often referred as siderolithic of which the principal outcrop is situated in the south of the charente maritime department going north east from bordeaux city the quarries are scattered along a long wide north south band the clay concentrations of economic value are composed of a succession of clays sands and pebbles this torrential stream deposit close to enlaced rivers laid to the deposition of sandy clayey materials with a variable iron content coming from a lateritic weathering of the french massif central granites the presence of numerous lignite rich levels indicates that the deposit was performed in the presence of abundant organic matter leading to important pedogenetic and diagenetic possibilities of evolutions these chemical and mineralogical evolutions dissolution crystallization allow the neo formation of kaolin and gibbsite as well as iron sulfide at their basement highly enlaced and with channel shapes those deposits often fill karstic depressions leading to the formation of clay wells the juxtaposition of features are sometimes without explanations using the deposition laws probably in relation with post sedimentary strain phenomena eventually

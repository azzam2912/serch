this area of cloister hill was developed relatively late for pre fire bo from around 1775 after another fire it was decided that the previously undeveloped although not uninhabited area to the south of vartiovuori hill would be developed as residential accommodation the south of this area was less rocky and easier to build upon so was developed first plots were surveyed officially then the plot holder would develop within that plot as and when they saw fit these first surveyed plots still form the boundaries within the current museum three plots 158 160 appear on the maps of 1780 by 1800 171 176 178 189 are included and the 1808 map the basis of the post fire map illustrated includes the whole extent of the museum site the original occupations of the first inhabitants are represented by the buildings now within the museum some were building trades such as carpenters and a stonemason and probably built their own properties the plot would be fenced in and a simple cottage with a stove and baking oven built other buildings might be provided for domestic animals in time the buildings would expand around the perimeter of the plot enclosing a courtyard

the term is applied particularly to distinguish heterothallic fungi which require two compatible partners to produce sexual spores from homothallic ones which are capable of sexual reproduction from a single organism in heterothallic fungi two different individuals contribute nuclei to form a zygote examples of heterothallism are included for saccharomyces cerevisiae aspergillus fumigatus aspergillus flavus penicillium marneffei and neurospora crassa the heterothallic life cycle of n crassa is given in some detail since similar life cycles are present in other heterothallic fungi the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is heterothallic this means that each yeast cell is of a certain mating type and can only mate with a cell of the other mating type during vegetative growth that ordinarily occurs when nutrients are abundant s cerevisiae reproduces by mitosis as either haploid or diploid cells however when starved diploid cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores mating occurs when haploid cells of opposite mating type mata and mat come into contact ruderfer et al pointed out that such contacts are frequent between closely related yeast cells for two reasons the first is that cells of opposite mating type are present together in the same ascus the sac that contains the tetrad of

for example 12 is a practical number because all the numbers from 1 to 11 can be expressed as sums of its divisors 1 2 3 4 and 6 as well as these divisors themselves we have 5 3 2 7 6 1 8 6 2 9 6 3 10 6 3 1 and 11 6 3 2 the sequence of practical numbers begins practical numbers were used by fibonacci in his liber abaci 1202 in connection with the problem of representing rational numbers as egyptian fractions fibonacci does not formally define practical numbers but he gives a table of egyptian fraction expansions for fractions with practical denominators the name practical number is due to he noted that the subdivisions of money weights and measures involve numbers like 4 12 16 20 and 28 which are usually supposed to be so inconvenient as to deserve replacement by powers of 10 he rediscovered the number theoretical property of such numbers and was the first to attempt a classification of these numbers that was completed by and this characterization makes it possible to determine whether a number is practical by examining its prime factorization every even perfect number and every power of

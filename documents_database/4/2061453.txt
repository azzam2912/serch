bacteria serve as natural hosts with transmission achieved through passive diffusion there is currently only one species in this genus the type species enterobacteria phage mu group dsdna mulikeviruses are nonenveloped with a head and tail the head has an icosahedral structure of about 54 nm in width the neck is knob like and the tail is contractile with a base plate and six short terminal fibers the type species enterobacteria phage mu has been fully sequenced and is available from ictv it has 36k nucleotides with 55 proteins two similar unclassified viruses are also sequenced the complete genomes are available here the virus attaches to the host cell lipopolysaccharides using its terminal fibers and ejects the viral dna into the host cytoplasm via contraction of its tail sheath once in the cell the viral dna is protected from degradation by the host nucleases the viral dna is then circularized and integrated into the host chromosome the viral genome is copied 50 100 times in the host chromosome via replicative transposition dna templated transcription is the method of transcription translation takes place by 1 ribosomal frameshifting once the viral genes have been replicated the procapsid is assembled and packed the

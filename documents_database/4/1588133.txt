topic modeling is a frequently used text mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body intuitively given that a document is about a particular topic one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently dog and bone will appear more often in documents about dogs cat and meow will appear in documents about cats and the and is will appear equally in both a document typically concerns multiple topics in different proportions thus in a document that is 10 about cats and 90 about dogs there would probably be about 9 times more dog words than cat words the topics produced by topic modeling techniques are clusters of similar words a topic model captures this intuition in a mathematical framework which allows examining a set of documents and discovering based on the statistics of the words in each what the topics might be and what each document s balance of topics is topic models are also referred to as probabilistic topic models which refers to statistical algorithms for discovering the latent semantic structures of an extensive text body in the age of information the amount of the written material we encounter

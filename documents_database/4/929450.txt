at the time the processing for polyethylene to make the sleeve backing was new technology and the adhesives used in sleeves were much the same as those used on pipeline coating the technology used to make sleeves has advanced significantly since then with new methods of cross linking the polyolefin backings and new generation adhesives that are formulated to provide performance under more demanding pipeline conditions heat shrinkable means just that heat them up and they shrink or more correctly they recover in length a heat shrinkable sleeve starts out with a thick extruded poly olefin sheet polyethylene or polypropylene that is formulated to be cross linkable after extruding the thick sheet it is taken to the beam where it is passed under a unit that subjects the sheet to electron irradiation the irradiation process cross links the polyolefin this improves the molecular structure such that the polyolefin will work as part of a heat shrinkable sleeve and provide the required level of mechanical protection while in service it makes the polyolefin perform more like a tough heat resistant elastic material or rubber rather than like a plastic material after cross linking the sheet is stretched by feeding it into

these man made or anthropogenic plants are for the most part plants with commercial value used in horticulture agriculture or forestry because cultigens are defined by their mode of origin and not by where they are growing plants meeting this definition remain cultigens whether they are naturalised in the wild deliberately planted in the wild or growing in cultivation cultigens arise in the following ways selections of variants from the wild or cultivation including vegetative sports aberrant growth that can be reproduced reliably in cultivation plants that are the result of plant breeding and selection programs genetically modified plants plants modified by the deliberate implantation of genetic material and graft chimaeras plants grafted to produce mixed tissue the graft material possibly from wild plants special selections or hybrids cultigens may be named in any of a number of ways the traditional method of scientific naming is under the international code of nomenclature for algae fungi and plants and many of the most important cultigens like maize zea mays and banana musa acuminata are so named although it is perfectly in order to give a cultigen a botanical name in any rank desired now or at any other time these days

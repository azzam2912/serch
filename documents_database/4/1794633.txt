the wedge plow forces snow to the sides of the tracks and therefore requires a large amount of force due to the compression of snow the wedge plow is still in use today in combination with the high maintenance rotary snowplow three features are required for optimum performance well designed wedge plows work best at speeds which accelerate the snow first upward and transitioning to a horizontal acceleration casting the snow far enough from the track to avoid creating high vertical snowbanks which would leave the cleared track a sheltered deposition site for wind blown snow early roads were often rolled rather than plowed to compact accumulated snow into a surface suitable for sleighs drawn by draft animals rail transportation brought the requirement for snow removal by plows in the 1840s railway companies began using bucker plows to remove snow from railways the first incarnation of the wedge plow was the bucker plow which were made of wood because of the amount of capital invested in railroads the railways were required to be functional year round because of this snow needed to be cleared from the railways in an efficient manner the wedge plow was patented by charles lowbaert to

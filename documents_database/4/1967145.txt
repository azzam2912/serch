together with his long time collaborator leonard r stephens he established that ptdins 4 5 p2 is the main substrate of receptor controlled type 1 phosphoinositide 3 kinases pi3ks thus identifying ptdins 3 4 5 p3 as the key output signal produced by this enzyme they identified and isolated the gpcr activated type 1b pi3k pi3k and in a sustained body of work defined its structure explained its complex pattern of regulation by g and ras and proved its role in inflammatory events in vivo they in parallel with dario alessi identified phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 as the ptdins 3 4 5 p3 activated link between pi3k 1 activation and protein kinase b activation a key pathway through which ptdins 3 4 5 p3 formation regulates cell proliferation and survival phill hawkins received a bsc in biochemistry from the university of bristol 1980 and a phd in biochemistry 1983 from the university of birmingham after a post doctoral training in s k f research ltd he joined the molecular neurobiology unit of the mrc in cambridge uk he joined the afrc iapgr now babraham institute in 1990 and became a group leader in 2003 phill hawkins has received several awards

it is particularly used when solving singularly perturbed differential equations it involves finding several different approximate solutions each of which is valid i e accurate for part of the range of the independent variable and then combining these different solutions together to give a single approximate solution that is valid for the whole range of values of the independent variable in a large class of singularly perturbed problems the domain may be divided into two or more subdomains in one of these often the largest the solution is accurately approximated by an asymptotic series found by treating the problem as a regular perturbation i e by setting a relatively small parameter to zero the other subdomains consist of one or more small areas in which that approximation is inaccurate generally because the perturbation terms in the problem are not negligible there these areas are referred to as transition layers and as boundary or interior layers depending on whether they occur at the domain boundary as is the usual case in applications or inside the domain an approximation in the form of an asymptotic series is obtained in the transition layer s by treating that part of the domain as a

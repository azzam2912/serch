during this process the dna polymerase reads existing dna strands and creates two new strands that match the existing ones the t7 dna polymerase requires a host factor e coli thioredoxin in order to carry out its function this helps stabilize the binding of the necessary protein to the primer template to improve processivity by more than 100 fold which is a feature unique to this enzyme it is a member of the family a dna polymerases which include e coli dna polymerase i and taq dna polymerase this polymerase has various applications in site directed mutagenesis as well as a high fidelity enzyme suitable for pcr it has also served as the precursor to sequenase an engineered enzyme optimized for dna sequencing figure 2 nucleotidyl transfer by dna polymerase t7 dna polymerase catalyzes the phosphoryl transfer during dna replication of the t7 phage as shown in figure 2 the 3 hydroxyl group of a primer acts as a nucleophile and attacks the phosphodiester bond of nucleoside 5 triphosphate dtmp pp this reaction adds a nucleoside monophosphate into dna and releases a pyrophosphate ppi generally the reaction is metal dependent and cations such as mg are often present in the

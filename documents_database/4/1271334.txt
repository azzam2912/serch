these stars have often been little studied and once more is learnt about them they are reclassified into other categories such as semiregular variables irregular variable stars were first given acronyms based on the letter i ia ib and ic these were later refined so that the i codes were used nebular or rapidly irregular variable stars such as t tauri and orion variables the remaining irregular stars cool slowly varying giants and supergiants of type ib or ic were reassigned to lb and lc when the general catalogue of variable stars standardised its acronyms to be all uppercase the codes lb and lc were used slow irregular variables of late spectral types k m c s as a rule they are giants the gcvs also claims to give this type to slow irregular red variables where the luminosity or spectral type is not known although it also uses the type l for slow irregular red stars where the spectral type or luminosity is unclear the k5 star co cygni is given as a representative example irregular variable supergiants of late spectral types having amplitudes of about 1 mag in v the m2 supergiant tz cassiopeiae is given as a

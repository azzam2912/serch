a multiplexer of formula 1 inputs has formula 2 select lines which are used to select which input line to send to the output multiplexers are mainly used to increase the amount of data that can be sent over the network within a certain amount of time and bandwidth multiplexers can also be used to implement boolean functions of multiple variables an electronic multiplexer makes it possible for several signals to share one device or resource for example one a d converter or one communication line instead of having one device per input signal conversely a demultiplexer or demux is a device taking a single input and selecting signals of the output of the compatible mux which is connected to the single input and a shared selection line a multiplexer is often used with a complementary demultiplexer on the receiving end an electronic multiplexer can be considered as a multiple input single output switch and a demultiplexer as a single input multiple output switch the schematic symbol for a multiplexer is an isosceles trapezoid with the longer parallel side containing the input pins and the short parallel side containing the output pin the schematic on the right shows a 2

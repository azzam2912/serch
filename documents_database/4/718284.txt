this capacity depends on many factors such as the number of runways available layout of taxi tracks availability of air traffic control and current or anticipated weather the weather can cause large variations in capacity strong winds may limit the number of runways available and poor visibility may necessitate increases in separation between aircraft when an air traffic control unit that will control a flight reaches capacity arriving aircraft are directed towards holding patterns where they circle until it is their turn to land however aircraft flying in circles is an inefficient and costly way of delaying aircraft so it is preferable to keep them on the ground at their place of departure called a ground delay program this way the delay can be waited out on the ground with engines off saving considerable amounts of fuel the careful calculation of en route time for each flight and traffic flow as a whole which aims to minimize overall delays in the air traffic system is highly dependent on computers all ifr flight plans are tracked by a cfmu central flow management unit each airport and air traffic control sector has a published maximum capacity when capacity is exceeded measures are

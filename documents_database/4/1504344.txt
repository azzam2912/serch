the jury act provides the jury act scrapped the key man system of blue ribbon juries in which jury commissioners typically solicited the names of men of recognized intelligence and probity from notables or key men of the community a 1967 survey of federal courts showed that 60 percent still relied primarily on this so called key man system for the names of jurors the jury act provides that each united states district court shall create a list of names of prospective jurors culled from voter registration lists or lists of actual voters and supplemented through other sources of names if necessary to achieve a fair cross section of the community and prevent discrimination the list must consist at least 1 000 names and preferably at least one half of 1 per centum of the total number of persons on the lists used as a source of names for the district or division these names are loaded into a jury wheel which must be emptied and refilled at least once every four years these minimum requirements allow some room for bias to occur for instance residents of a judicial district who are under the age of 18 may be excluded

the law on the subject is complex because various states apply differing principles of nationality namely jus soli and jus sanguinis to varying degrees and with varying qualifications before the 1961 convention quite a number of states expressly provided in their laws that births and deaths aboard an aircraft registered to that state are considered to have occurred on national territory and thus the nationality laws of that territory apply one such was 32 5 of the british nationality act 1948 under the 1944 convention on international civil aviation articles 17 21 all aircraft have the nationality of the state in which they are registered and may not have multiple nationalities the law of the aircraft s nationality is applicable on the aircraft however nationality laws of any country already apply everywhere since it is for each country to determine who are its nationals so this convention has no effect on nationality laws the convention does not say that a birth on a country s aircraft is to be treated as a birth in that country for the purposes of nationality under the 1961 convention on the reduction of statelessness for the purposes of determining the obligations under the convention

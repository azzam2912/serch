it is a colorless compound like other porphyrinogens the molecular structure of uroporphyrinogen iii can be described as a hexahydroporphine core where each pyrrole ring has the hydrogen atoms on its two outermost carbons replaced by an acetic acid group a and a propionic acid group p the groups are attached in an asymmetric way going around the macrocycle the order is ap ap ap pa in the general porphyrin biosynthesis pathway uroporphyrinogen iii is derived from the linear tetrapyrrole preuroporphyrinogen a substituted hydroxymethylbilane by the action of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen iii cosynthase the conversion entails a reversal of the last pyrrole unit thus swapping the acetic and propionic acid groups and a condensation reaction that closes the macrocycle by eliminating the final hydroxyl with a hydrogen atom of the first ring in the biosynthesis of hemes and chlorophylls uroporphyrinogen iii is converted into coproporphyrinogen iii by the enzyme uroporphyrinogen iii decarboxylase in the biosynthesis of sirohemes uroporphyrinogen iii is converted by two methyl transferases to dihydrosirohydrochlorin which is subsequently oxidized sirohydrochlorin a precursor to the siroheme prosthetic group if uroporphyrinogen iii synthase is not present or inactive the hydroxymethylbilane will spontaneously cyclise into the structural isomer uroporphyrinogen i which

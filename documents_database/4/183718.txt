examples include salt in water alcohol in water or the mixing of two solids such as impurities into a finely powdered drug in all cases the substance added present in smaller amounts is considered the solute while the original substance present in larger quantity is thought of as the solvent the resulting liquid solution or solid solid mixture has a lower freezing point than the pure solvent or solid because the chemical potential of the solvent in the mixture is lower than that of the pure solvent the difference between the two being proportional to the natural logarithm of the mole fraction in a similar manner the chemical potential of the vapor above the solution is lower than that above a pure solvent which results in boiling point elevation freezing point depression is what causes sea water a mixture of salt and other things in water to remain liquid at temperatures below the freezing point of pure water the freezing point is the temperature at which the liquid solvent and solid solvent are at equilibrium so that their vapor pressures are equal when a non volatile solute is added to a volatile liquid solvent the solution vapor pressure will be

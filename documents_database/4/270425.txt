it usually consists of 55 copper and 45 nickel its main feature is the low thermal variation of its resistivity which is constant over a wide range of temperatures other alloys with similarly low temperature coefficients are known such as manganin cu 86 mn 12 ni 2 in 1887 edward weston discovered that metals can have a negative temperature coefficient of resistance inventing what he called his alloy no 2 it was produced in germany where it was renamed konstantan of all modern strain gauge alloys constantan is the oldest and still the most widely used this situation reflects the fact that constantan has the best overall combination of properties needed for many strain gauge applications this alloy has for example an adequately high strain sensitivity or gauge factor which is relatively insensitive to strain level and temperature its resistivity 4 9 x 10 m is high enough to achieve suitable resistance values in even very small grids and its temperature coefficient of resistance is fairly low in addition constantan is characterized by good fatigue life and relatively high elongation capability however constantan tends to exhibit a continuous drift at temperatures above and this characteristic should be taken into account

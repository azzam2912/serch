high temperatures to change its form in relation to time of an object it is a device that measures the alteration of a material after it has been put through different forms of stress creep machines are important to see how much strain load an object can handle under pressure so engineers and researchers are able to determine what materials to use the device generates a creep time dependent curve by calculating the steady rate of creep in reference to the time it takes for the material to change creep machines are primarily used by engineers to determine the stability of a material and its behaviour when it is put through ordinary stresses the first creep testing machines were created in 1948 in britain to test materials for aircraft to see how they would stand in high altitudes temperature and pressure the machines were first developed to further calculate and understand the steady rate of creep in materials creep is the tendency of a material to change form over time after facing high temperature and stress creep increases with temperature and it is more common when a material is exposed to high temperatures for a long time or at the

it is longer than a v8 engine but shorter than a straight 6 engine or v12 engine the v10 configuration is not an inherently balanced design like a straight 6 v12 boxer engine or v8 ignoring the counterweights and does still have a small second order rocking motion which can only be compensated by balance shafts until recently the v10 configuration was not a common configuration for road cars as a v12 is only slightly more complicated and runs more smoothly while a v8 is less complex and more economical for the lexus lfa the engineers selected a v10 engine over an equivalent displacement v8 because they could not get the v8 to rev as high as the v10 and over a v12 for its lower reciprocating mass allowing for more rapid engine response for audi in their audi r8 5 2 fsi quattro the v10 was a compromise between a v12 which would be too long and suffer more internal friction due to extra cylinders and valves and a v8 which would be more compact but have larger heavier pistons and have a lower redline the dodge v10 engine saw its first production use in substantially revised form in

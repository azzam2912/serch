it was formally described as new to science in 2010 based on specimens found growing in a greenhouse in botanischer garten jena in germany the species was first mentioned by andreas gminder in a 2005 publication who provisionally called it rhodocybe byssisedoides because of its similarity to the species entoloma byssisedum since that publication a molecular phylogenetics analysis has shown that clitopilus is nested within rhodocybe and both genera have been subsumed into a broader definition of clitopilus clitopilus byssisedoides was formally described in a 2010 mycotaxon publication the authors suggest that it should be classified in the section claudopodes of the former genus rhodocybe as defined by timothy j baroni in 1981 this infrageneric grouping of species is characterized by stipes that are either absent or laterally attached to the cap and pleurocystidia cystidia on the gill face lacking brightly colored pigments the fruit bodies of c byssisedoides are pleurotoid referring to gilled mushrooms with off center stipes that grow on wood and attached to its substrate with distinct rhizomorphs the cap is convex and the margin is wavy and rolled inward so that each of the individual caps is shell shaped the caps attain diameters of up to

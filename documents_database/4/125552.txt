theoretically rounding frontness and backness could also be used in one dimensional vowel systems however vertical refers specifically to the usage of vowel height as the sole distinguishing feature two different diachronic mechanisms may give rise to a vertical vowel system in some cases the front back distinction may simply be lost when vowels are merged this has occurred in wichita in which an old vowel preserved in the related language pawnee has merged with however the wichita vowel system is not phonetically vertical as is realised as open back as open mid front and as close to close mid front hence the feature back is relevant to the phonetics of the language even though it is not a salient phonological distinction similarly the vowel is heard in wichita utterances although this vowel is usually the phonetic result of a contraction of sequences of short vowel w short vowel a phenomenon also noted in other languages with vertical vowel systems more striking is a phenomenon whereby one or more phonological features of vowels are lost and reassigned to the consonants at the syllable periphery leaving all vowels underspecified for frontness rounding or both this has occurred in arrernte in which

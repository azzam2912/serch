it is thought to have been founded in 1089 by william de warenne the son of the 1st earl of surrey who had founded england s first cluniac priory at lewes in 1077 the order originated from burgundy originally the priory was sited within the walls of castle acre castle but this proved too small and inconvenient for the monks hence the priory was relocated to the present site in the castle grounds about one year later the priory was dissolved in 1537 and its ruins are in the care of english heritage along with the nearby castle acre bailey gate and castle acre castle the church itself was consecrated sometime between 1146 and 1148 while the warenne family may have been the main benefactors of the priory others also gave generously to it for example scolland of bedale steward of alan earl of richmond who was in fact buried there like other cluniac houses castle acre priory was directly subject to the authority of the abbot of cluny for practical reasons however the prior of lewes was usually instructed to act for the abbot when any problems arose at castle acre however this obedience owed to a foreign abbot

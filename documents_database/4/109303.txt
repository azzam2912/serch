this can interfere with other electronic devices a computer is a typical example where spurious emissions may not be contained within the case a radio receiver will often use an intermediate frequency which is detectable outside the radio the concept behind at least one audience measurement concept for roadside detection of radio stations which passing motorists are listening to other examples include the motor transformer dimmer and corona from electrical powerlines unintentional radiation from these devices can create interference on am radio and on the video of television stations in north america active devices that are characterized as unintentional radiators are governed by part 15 of the fcc regulations in canada innovation science and economic development consider them as interference causing equipment globally most domestic regulation of unintentional radiators are based on itu recommendations generally this means the device leaks a signal at some level microprocessor controlled appliances anything with a clock signal and switching voltage regulators all make some kind of noise at the repetition frequency and at harmonics in most countries government agencies regulate how much leakage is tolerated this prevents leakage from cable television systems for example from interfering with radio communications between aircraft and control towers

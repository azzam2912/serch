however if a similar type specific i e non template operator exists in the current scope even outside the class definition the compiler will prefer it instead one could of course declare the following in tandem with allowing the derivation of all relational operators from an object declared for example as will contain two members and plus three constructor functions the first default constructor initializes both members with the default values and whereas the second one accepts one parameter of each type the third is a template copy constructor which will accept any provided the types and are capable of implicit conversion to and respectively gcc s implementation defines the mechanism as follows additionally this header defines all six relational operators for instances with both types in common these define a strict weak ordering for objects of type based on the elements and then upon the elements only when the ones are equal additionally the header contains a template function which deduces its return type based on parameters

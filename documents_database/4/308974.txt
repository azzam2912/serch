this article covers plating methods used in the modern electronics industry for more traditional methods often used for much larger objects see gilding there are several types of gold plating used in the electronics industry there are five recognized classes of gold plating chemistry gold plating of silver is used in the manufacture of jewelry silver atoms diffuse into the gold layer causing slow gradual fading of its color and eventually causing tarnishing of the surface this process may take months and even years depending on the thickness of the gold layer a barrier metal layer is used to counter this effect copper which also migrates into gold does so more slowly than silver the copper is usually further plated with nickel a gold plated silver article is usually a silver substrate with layers of copper nickel and gold deposited on top of it gold applied by evaporated methods or electroplating has been specified by nasa to thermally control spacecraft instruments due to its 99 reflectivity in infrared wavelengths gold plating is often used in electronics to provide a corrosion resistant electrically conductive layer on copper typically in electrical connectors and printed circuit boards with direct gold on copper plating

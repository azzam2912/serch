members of the subfamily are informally and collectively known as plioplatecarpines and have been recovered from all continents though the occurrences in australia remain questionable the subfamily includes the genera latoplatecarpus platecarpus plioplatecarpus and plesioplatecarpus plioplatecarpines were small to medium sized mosasaurs that were comparatively fast and agile compared to mosasaurs of other subfamilies the first plioplatecarpines appear in the turonian and are among the oldest of mosasaurs and the clade persists throughout the maastrichtian a period of approximately 24 million years the subfamily was seemingly heavily affected during a poorly understood middle campanian mosasaur extinction event and its genera appear to have faced competition from mosasaurine mosasaurs during the maastrichtian leading to a decline in numbers and in diversity the etymology of this group derives from the genus plioplatecarpus greek pleion more greek plate oar greek karpos wrist carpus in general plioplatecarpines were short skulled short bodied forms and were among the strongest swimming mosasaurs some workers have likened them to pinnipeds in their agility most forms were likely piscivores fish eaters though cephalopods belemnites evidently formed an important part of the plioplatecarpine diet larger forms may have also fed upon smaller marine reptiles at least one genus evolved

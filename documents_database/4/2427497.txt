this differs from current digital storage techniques such as drives that need to be re written often to prevent loss or corruption of data worf has the potential to store data forever and is currently being tested on the international space station iss worf uses a novel high density patented data storage mechanism based on silver halide which after substantial testing has been determined to last for more than a century under conventional ambient environmental conditions worf digital data is stored as microscopic metallic interference created standing waves representing narrowband colors embedded in a modern super resolution dye free photosensitive emulsion wavelengths encode multiple superimposed states allowing complex data permutations to be stored per data region permutations enable extremely high data density to be stored on worf media multi state data architecture within each domain also enhances data integrity error checking and accelerates parallel writing and reading for the entire media module once data is written to worf energy is needed only for reading no periodic refresh is necessary and data is both immutable and truly permanent human readable text and images are embedded in the worf module adjacent to the digital data this text and imagery contain meta information

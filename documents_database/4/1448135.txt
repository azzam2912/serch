both graded manifolds and supermanifolds are phrased in terms of sheaves of graded commutative algebras however graded manifolds are characterized by sheaves on smooth manifolds while supermanifolds are constructed by gluing of sheaves of supervector spaces a graded manifold of dimension formula 1 is defined as a locally ringed space formula 2 where formula 3 is an formula 4 dimensional smooth manifold and formula 5 is a formula 6 sheaf of grassmann algebras of rank formula 7 where formula 6 is the sheaf of smooth real functions on formula 3 the sheaf formula 5 is called the structure sheaf of the graded manifold formula 2 and the manifold formula 3 is said to be the body of formula 2 sections of the sheaf formula 5 are called graded functions on a graded manifold formula 2 they make up a graded commutative formula 16 ring formula 17 called the structure ring of formula 2 the well known batchelor theorem and serre swan theorem characterize graded manifolds as follows let formula 2 be a graded manifold there exists a vector bundle formula 20 with an formula 7 dimensional typical fiber formula 22 such that the structure sheaf formula 5 of formula 2

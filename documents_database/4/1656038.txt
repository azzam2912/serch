it aims to overcome the shortcoming of computation based puzzle protocols in which clients are required to compute hard cpu or memory bound puzzles that favor clients with abundant computational resources guided tour puzzle protocol can be seen as a form of proof of work pow protocol the protocol steps of the guided tour puzzle protocol is similar to that of client puzzle protocol all clients are required to complete a guided tour puzzle prior to receiving service from the server if the server suspects it is currently under denial of service attack or its load exceeds a pre defined threshold simply put a guided tour puzzle is a tour that needs to be completed by taking multiple round trips to a set of special nodes called tour guides in a sequential order it is called a guided tour because the order in which the tour guides are visited is unknown to the client and each tour guide has to direct the client towards the next tour guide for the client to complete the tour in correct order a single tour guide may appear multiple times in a tour so the term stop is used to denote a single appearance

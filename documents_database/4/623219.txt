aphthoviruses infect vertebrates and include the causative agent of foot and mouth disease foot and mouth disease virus fmdv is the prototypic member of the genus aphthovirus there are seven fmdv serotypes a o c sat 1 sat 2 sat 3 and asia 1 and four non fmdv serotypes belonging to three additional species bovine rhinitis a virus brav bovine rhinitis b virus brbv and equine rhinitis a virus erav aphthoviruses are non enveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid with a diameter of around 27 to 30 nm the aphthoviruses are differentiated from other picornaviruses as they have a larger genome ca 8 2 kilobases the genome is linear and non segmented it consists of a single molecule of sense rna with a 5 genome linked protein vpg which is associated to the genome via a phosphodiester bond linked to a tyrosine residue the 5 end of the genome contains a poly c tract while the 3 end is polyadenylated the virions consist of a non enveloped virus capsid which is round and displays icosahedral symmetry aphthoviruses replicate in a similar fashion to all picornaviruses replication is cytoplasmic and initially involves attachment of the exogenous virus to the cell membrane

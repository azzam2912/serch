alp is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle where it localizes to z discs and intercalated discs alp functions to enhance the crosslinking of actin by alpha actinin 2 and also appears to be essential for right ventricular chamber formation and contractile function alp exists primarily as two alternatively spliced variants a 39 2 kda 364 amino acids protein in skeletal muscle and a 34 3 kda 316 amino acids protein in cardiac muscle and smooth muscle alp has a n terminal pdz domain and a c terminal lim domain in addition the alp subfamily contains a specific 34 amino acid domain named the alp like motif containing protein kinase c consensus sequences the pdz domain of alp binds to alpha actinin 2 specifically to its spectrin like repeats the pdz domain is a motif composed of 80 120 amino acids with conserved four residue glgf sequences that typically interact with c termini of cytoskeletal proteins the region of heterogeneity in the two isoforms is between the pdz domain and lim domain alp is localized to chromosome 4q35 it has been shown that deletion of muscleblind like 1 in mice can alter the splicing pattern of pdlim3 studies have

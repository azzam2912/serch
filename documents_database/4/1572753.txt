for instance the rv can be the sum of squared daily returns for a particular month which would yield a measure of price variation over this month more commonly the realized variance is computed as the sum of squared intraday returns for a particular day the realized variance is useful because it provides a relatively accurate measure of volatility which is useful for many purposes including volatility forecasting and forecast evaluation unlike the variance the realized variance is a random quantity the realized volatility is the square root of the realized variance or the square root of the rv multiplied by a suitable constant to bring the measure of volatility to an annualized scale for instance if the rv is computed as the sum of squared daily returns for some month then an annualized realized volatility is given by formula 1 under ideal circumstances the rv consistently estimates the quadratic variation of the price process that the returns are computed from ole e barndorff nielsen and neil shephard 2002 journal of the royal statistical society series b 63 2002 253 280 for instance suppose that the price process formula 2 is given by the stochastic integral where formula 4 is

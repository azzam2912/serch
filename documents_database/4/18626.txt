the equation was proposed by svante arrhenius in 1889 based on the work of dutch chemist jacobus henricus van t hoff who had noted in 1884 that van t hoff equation for the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions this equation has a vast and important application in determining rate of chemical reactions and for calculation of energy of activation arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula currently it is best seen as an empirical relationship it can be used to model the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients population of crystal vacancies creep rates and many other thermally induced processes reactions the eyring equation developed in 1935 also expresses the relationship between rate and energy arrhenius equation gives the dependence of the rate constant of a chemical reaction on the absolute temperature a pre exponential factor and other constants of the reaction where alternatively the equation may be expressed as where the only difference is the energy units of the former form uses energy per mole which is common in chemistry while the latter form uses energy per molecule directly which is common in physics

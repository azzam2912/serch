cohesins hold sister chromatids together after dna replication until anaphase when removal of cohesin leads to separation of sister chromatids cohesin is a multi subunit protein complex made up of four core subunits two smc proteins smc1 and 3 an alpha kleisin orthologues of yeast scc1 and an orthologue of the yeast scc3 protein e g stag1 3 in humans and sa1 3 in mice smc1 and smc3 are members of the structural maintenance of chromosomes smc family smc proteins have two main structural characteristics an atp binding cassette like head domain with atpase activity formed by the interaction of the n and c terminals and a hinge domain that allows dimerization of smcs the head and the hinge domains are connected to each other via long anti parallel coiled coils the dimer is present in a v shaped form connected by the hinges upon atp binding the two head domains in the dimer bind to each other forming a ring structure atp hydrolysis can therefore trigger opening and closing of the ring scc1 and scc3 bind the atpase domains of smc1 and smc3 stabilizing the ring structure the amino and carboxy terminus of scc1 bind smc1 and smc3 once

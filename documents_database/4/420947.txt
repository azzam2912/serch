degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes can be associated with senile plaque deposits these deposits can also be a byproduct of senescence ageing however large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of alzheimer s disease abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments a component of neurofibrillary tangles the plaques are variable in shape and size but are on average 50 m in size in alzheimer s disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides these polypeptides tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic in 1892 paul blocq and gheorghe marinescu first described the presence of plaque deposits in grey matter as a result of their similarity to actinomyces druses they were called druse necrosis by oskar fischer during the early 20th century the connection between plaques and dementia was discovered by alois alzheimer in 1906 by 1911 max bielschowsky proposed the amyloid nature of plaque deposits the same year teofil simchowicz introduced the term senile plaques wisniewski coined the term neuritic plaques in 1973 the second half of the 20th century saw proposed theories of immunological and genetic factors in plaque formation statistical investigations

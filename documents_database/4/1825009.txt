this pitch is a much higher frequency than that of the other whale species with migration patterns most closely resembling this whale s the blue whale 10 39 hz or fin whale 20 hz it has been detected regularly in many locations since the late 1980s and appears to be the only individual emitting a whale call at this frequency it has been described as the world s loneliest whale the sonic signature is that of a whale albeit at a unique frequency at 52 hertz it is a little higher than the lowest note on a double bass the call patterns resemble neither blue nor fin whales being much higher in frequency shorter and more frequent blue whales usually vocalize at 10 39 hz fin whales at 20 hz the 52 hertz calls of this whale are highly variable in their pattern of repetition duration and sequence although they are easily identifiable due to their frequency and characteristic clustering the calls have deepened slightly to around 49 hertz since 1992 suggesting the whale has grown or matured the track of the 52 hertz whale is unrelated to the presence or movement of other whale species its movements have been

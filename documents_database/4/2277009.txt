the functions studied are often but not always boolean valued making them boolean functions the area has found many applications in combinatorics social choice theory random graphs and theoretical computer science especially in hardness of approximation property testing and pac learning we will mostly consider functions defined on the domain formula 2 sometimes it is more convenient to work with the domain formula 1 instead if formula 5 is defined on formula 2 then the corresponding function defined on formula 1 is similarly for us a boolean function is a formula 9 valued function though often it is more convenient to consider formula 10 valued functions instead every real valued function formula 11 has a unique expansion as a multilinear polynomial this is the hadamard transform of the function formula 5 which is the fourier transform in the group formula 14 the coefficients formula 15 are known as fourier coefficients and the entire sum is known as the fourier expansion of formula 5 the functions formula 17 are known as fourier characters and they form an orthonormal basis for the space of all functions over formula 2 with respect to the inner product formula 19 the fourier coefficients can be

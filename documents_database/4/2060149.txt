the project differs from most hvdc systems in that one of the two converter stations is built on a platform in the sea voltage sourced converters are used and the total cable length is 200 km the project was completed by the siemens prysmian consortium and handed over to its owner tennet in january 2015 becoming the first such project to be completed the earlier hvdc borwin1 project despite having completed construction in 2009 was still not fully in service by that date borwin2 is part of an ambitious programme of providing grid connections to offshore wind parks off the coast of germany in the german bight as part of the german energiewende energy transition programme borwin2 forms part of the borwin cluster named after the german island of borkum borwin2 has been built to transport power from the 400 mw veja mate using 6 mw siemens gearless turbines and global tech 1 wind parks hvdc has been chosen for most of the grid connections because the relatively long distance involved both from the wind park to shore and from the shore to the nearest suitable connection point to the onshore grid makes conventional alternating current transmission uneconomic borwin2 uses

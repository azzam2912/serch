like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host it is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict size based dominance hierarchy the female is largest the breeding male is second largest and the male nonbreeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends they exhibit protandry meaning the breeding male changes to female if the sole breeding female dies with the largest nonbreeder becoming the breeding male the body of a perideraion is pink to peach it has the white stripe along the dorsal ridge that is common to all members of the skunk complex and a white head bar running vertically just behind the eye while the largest species of anemonefish can reach a length of a perideraion is one of the smallest species with females growing to a length of some anemonefish species have color variations based on geographic location sex and host anemone a perideraion like other members of the skunk complex does not show any of these variations a perideraion is included in the skunk complex so has similarities with other species in this complex the combination of dorsal stripe and head bar distinguishes it

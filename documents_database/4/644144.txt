treatment of signal boundaries is also simplified the discrete wavelet transform applies several filters separately to the same signal in contrast to that for the lifting scheme the signal is divided like a zipper then a series of convolution accumulate operations across the divided signals is applied the simplest version of a forward wavelet transform expressed in the lifting scheme is shown in the figure above formula 1 means predict step which will be considered in isolation the predict step calculates the wavelet function in the wavelet transform this is a high pass filter the update step calculates the scaling function which results in a smoother version of the data as mentioned above the lifting scheme is an alternative technique for performing the dwt using biorthogonal wavelets in order to perform the dwt using the lifting scheme the corresponding lifting and scaling steps must be derived from the biorthogonal wavelets the analysis filters formula 2 of the particular wavelet are first written in polyphase matrix where formula 4 the polyphase matrix is a 2 2 matrix containing the analysis low pass and high pass filters each split up into their even and odd polynomial coefficients and normalized from here the

therefore it is also called a rotoinversion or rotary inversion a three dimensional symmetry that has only one fixed point is necessarily an improper rotation in both cases the operations commute rotoreflection and rotoinversion are the same if they differ in angle of rotation by 180 and the point of inversion is in the plane of reflection an improper rotation of an object thus produces a rotation of its mirror image the axis is called the rotation reflection axis this is called an n fold improper rotation if the angle of rotation is 360 n there are several different systems for naming individual improper rotations the direct subgroup index 2 is c n nn order n as the rotoreflection generator applied twice s for odd n contain inversion with is the group generated by inversion s contain indirect isometries but not inversion for even n in general if odd p is a divisor of n then s is a subgroup of s for example s is a subgroup of s in a wider sense an improper rotation may be defined as any indirect isometry i e an element of e 3 e 3 thus it can also be a pure

two typical examples are methylmagnesium chloride and phenylmagnesium bromide they are a subclass of the organomagnesium compounds grignard compounds are popular reagents in organic synthesis for creating new carbon carbon bonds for example when reacted with another halogenated compound in the presence of a suitable catalyst they typically yield and the magnesium halide as a byproduct and the latter is insoluble in the solvents normally used in this aspect they are similar to organolithium reagents pure grignard reagents are extremely reactive solids they are normally handled as solutions in solvents such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran which are relatively stable as long as water is excluded in such a medium a grignard reagent is invariably present as a complex with the magnesium atom connected to the two ether oxygens by coordination bonds grignard reagents are prepared by treating an organic halide normally organobromine with magnesium metal cyclic or acyclic ethers are required to stabilize the organomagnesium compound water and air which rapidly destroy the reagent by protonolysis or oxidation are excluded using air free techniques although the reagents still need to be dry ultrasound can allow grignard reagents to form in wet solvents by activating the magnesium such that it

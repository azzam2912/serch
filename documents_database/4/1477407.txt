recombinant proteins containing the sbp tag bind to streptavidin and this property may be utilized in specific purification detection or immobilization strategies the sequence of the sbp tag is mdekttgwrgghvveglageleqlrarlehhpqgqrep the streptavidin binding peptide was discovered within a library of seven trillion stochastically generated peptides using the in vitro selection technique of mrna display selection was performed by incubating with streptavidin agarose followed by elution with biotin the sbp tag has been shown to bind streptavidin with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 2 5nm and is readily eluted with biotin under native conditions because of the mild elution conditions biotin plus wash buffer sbp tagged proteins can be generated in a relatively pure state with a single purification step there are several relatively abundant mammalian proteins that inherently associate with the imac matrices that bind to the more commonly used polyhistidine tag his tag for this reason non imac purification protocols including with the sbp tag are often preferred for proteins that are expressed in mammalian cells complexes of interacting proteins may also be purified using the sbp tag because elution with biotin permits recovery under conditions in which desired complexes remain associated for example the condensin complex was purified

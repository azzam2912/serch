the goal of biomechanics in hitting during baseball training is to study and improve upon the physics involved in hitting this includes optimizing a player s swing for either maximizing their bat speed or time for plate coverage there is a wide range of batting stances and mechanics that are developed through individual preferences however when comparing among experienced baseball players their batting mechanics approach are almost similar hitters have a wide variation of swings but in the end staying balanced and having stable posture is the most important aspect of hitting a baseball if the hitter becomes unbalanced throughout the swing the chance of making solid contact with the baseball is very slim once balanced throughout the swing bat speed comes into the next most important aspect of the baseball swing the faster the bat speed the faster the ball will come off the bat furthermore researchers have long established that home run hits are dependent on swing speed most notably one can logically assume that a faster swing will result in the ball traveling farther a 3 6 increase in bat speed can significantly affect the distance a ball travels after contact in competition 7 in terms of

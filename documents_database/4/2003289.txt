these brain cells control reproduction by secreting gnrh into the hypophyseal portal capillary bloodstream so are sometimes referred to as sex neurons this small capillary network carries gnrh to the anterior pituitary causing release of luteinizing hormone lh and follicle stimulating hormone fsh into the wider bloodstream when gnrh neurons change their pattern of release from the juvenile to the adult pattern of gnrh secretion puberty is initiated failure of gnrh neurons to form the proper connections or failure to successfully stimulate the pituitary with gnrh means that puberty is not initiated these disruptions to the gnrh system cause reproductive disorders like hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or kallmann syndrome in 1989 two research groups independently discovered that gnrh neurons which in adults are scattered throughout the hypothalamus do not originate in this region of the brain instead they migrate into the brain along olfactory axon fibers from the nose most gnrh neurons are born from stem cells in the nasal placode embryonic nasal tissue more recently it was discovered that a subset of gnrh neurons can trace their origins not from the nasal placode but from the neural crest earlier in embryogenesis this subset of cells migrates into the nasal placode where

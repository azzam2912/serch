it consists of an array of hexagonal peltier plates which can be rapidly heated and cooled to form any desired image such as of the natural background or of a non target object its goal is to develop stealth ground vehicles in 2011 bae systems announced their adaptiv infrared military camouflage technology likening it to a thermal tv screen it uses about 1000 hexagonal panels to cover the sides of an armoured vehicle such as a tank or personnel carrier infrared cameras continuously gather thermal images of the vehicle s surroundings the peltier plate panels are rapidly heated and cooled to match either the temperature of the background such as a forest or one of the objects in the thermal cloaking system s library such as a truck car or large rock the system is able to gather and display thermal images while the vehicle is moving the result is to cloak the vehicle from detection by heat detecting night vision devices thermographic camera systems for crypsis the panels can display an infrared image of the vehicle s background this can be updated as the vehicle moves for mimesis an image of a chosen object such as a car can

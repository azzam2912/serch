this page discusses a more abstract concept of models of product lines of product lines pl 2 called metamodels and product lines of product lines of product lines called meta metamodels pl 3 and further abstract concepts a metamodel is a model whose instances are models a genvoca model of a product line is a tuple whose components are features 0 ary or 1 ary functions an extension a k a delta or refinement of a model is a meta feature which is a tuple of deltas that can modify an existing product line by modifying existing features and adding new features as a simple example consider genvoca model m that contains three features a c formula 1 suppose meta model mm contains three meta features aaa ccc each of which is a tuple with a single non identity feature formula 2 where 0 is the null feature model m is constructed by adding the meta features of mm where is the composition operation see fosd formula 3 mm models a product line of product lines pl 2 that is different mm expressions correspond to genvoca models of different product lines

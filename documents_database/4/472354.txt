its design was influenced by rio the windowing system for plan 9 the core x window system drawing protocol does not have a way to efficiently draw transparent objects a computer display is composed of individual pixels which can only show a single color at a time thus transparency can only be achieved by mixing the colors of the transparent object to be drawn with the background color alpha compositing however the standard x protocol only allows drawing with solid color so the only way to achieve transparency is to fetch the background color from the screen mix it with the object color then write it back which is fairly inefficient since many operations require transparency for example spatial anti aliasing especially during font rasterization and transparency effects in window managers such as transparent windows or menus this limitation caused problems and xrender was implemented to address it it provides several rendering operations and also does alpha blending it serves primarily to implement antialiased fonts but for example kwin kde s window manager uses it to draw drop shadows and translucency in case opengl is not available geometric figures are rendered by client side tessellation into either triangles or trapezoids

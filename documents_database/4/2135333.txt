the company is developing a new class of potent specific and versatile small protein therapies called darpins with potential clinical applications in a range of disease areas including oncology immuno oncology ophthalmology and immunology molecular partners currently has two darpin molecules in clinical development and a broad pipeline of molecules in preclinical development researchers at the university of zurich switzerland formed molecular partners ag in 2004 while studying monoclonal antibodies these scientists discovered and developed the darpin technology and launched the company using this platform molecular partners became a publicly traded company in november 2014 when it was listed on the six swiss exchange as of 2018 molecular partners has two cancer assets currently going through clinical testing darpins are genetically engineered antibody mimetic proteins typically exhibiting highly specific and high affinity target protein binding they are derived from natural ankyrin repeat proteins repeat proteins are among the most common classes of binding proteins in nature responsible for diverse functions such as cell signaling and receptor binding darpins constitute a new class of potent specific and versatile small protein therapies and are used as investigational tools in various therapeutic and diagnostic applications the simplest format of a darpin is the

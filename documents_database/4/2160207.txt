its a 17 kda q8x1m9 and b 59 kda q5w9e8 components are assembled into a transmembrane pore complex the pleurotolysin pore forming pleurotolysin family tc 1 c 97 is a family of pore forming proteins belonging to the macpf superfamily proteins with membrane attack complex perforin macpf domains have a variety of biological roles including defense and attack organismal development and cell adhesion and signaling the distribution of these proteins in fungi appears to be restricted to some pezizomycotina and basidiomycota species only in correlation with the aegerolysins pf06355 these two protein groups coincide in only a few species and they operate as cytolytic bi component pore forming agents representative proteins include pleurotolysin b which has a macpf domain the aegerolysin like protein pleurotolysin a and the very similar ostreolysin a tc 1 c 97 3 2 that has been purified from oyster mushroom pleurotus ostreatus these act in concert to perforate natural and artificial lipid membranes with high cholesterol and sphingomyelin contents the complex has a 13 meric rosette like structure with a central lumen that is 4 5 nm in diameter the opened transmembrane pore is non selectively permeable to ions and smaller neutral solutes and is a

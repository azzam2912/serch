for example one may talk about an infinitesimal rotation of a rigid body in three dimensional space this is conventionally represented by a 3 3 skew symmetric matrix a it is not the matrix of an actual rotation in space but for small real values of a parameter the transformation is a small rotation up to quantities of order a comprehensive theory of infinitesimal transformations was first given by sophus lie this was at the heart of his work on what are now called lie groups and their accompanying lie algebras and the identification of their role in geometry and especially the theory of differential equations the properties of an abstract lie algebra are exactly those definitive of infinitesimal transformations just as the axioms of group theory embody symmetry the term lie algebra was introduced in 1934 by hermann weyl for what had until then been known as the algebra of infinitesimal transformations of a lie group for example in the case of infinitesimal rotations the lie algebra structure is that provided by the cross product once a skew symmetric matrix has been identified with a 3 vector this amounts to choosing an axis vector for the rotations the defining

the about two embryonic whorls are smooth and shining and slightly convex the succeeding whorls number about four or five and are strongly costate the spire whorls are subangulate a little below the suture giving t he latter the appearance of being somewhat impressed each whorl bears from ten to twelve strong costae usually the former number the costae are slightly oblique are usually narrower than the interspaces between them and extend of a uniform breadth from the anterior suture to the posterior angulation thence to the posterior suture tapering slightly and forwardly directed to a slight extent on the anterior lower half of the body whorl the costae are backwardly arched and thin out towards the columella the costae and interspaces are both crossed transversely by fairly strong and intermediate fine series of spiral threads the strong and prominent threads numbering from three to six to a whorl with several tine threadlets between them in young and in well preserved adult shells the coarser spiral threads where they cross the costae cause the latter to have a regular beaded or granulated appearance but in some adult specimens there appears to be a tendency for this type of ornament to

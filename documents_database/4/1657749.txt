the legitimate uses of such devices have led to wide adoption of dma accessories and connections but an attacker can equally use the same facility to create an accessory that will connect using the same port and can then potentially gain direct access to part or all of the physical memory address space of the computer bypassing all os security mechanisms and any lock screen to read all that the computer is doing steal data or cryptographic keys install or run spyware and other exploits or modify the system to allow backdoors or other malware preventing physical connections to such ports will prevent dma attacks on many computers the connections implementing dma can also be disabled within the bios or uefi if unused which depending on the device can nullify or reduce the potential for this type of exploit examples of connections that may allow dma in some exploitable form include firewire cardbus expresscard thunderbolt pci and pci express in modern operating systems non system i e user mode applications are prevented from accessing any memory locations not explicitly authorized by the virtual memory controller called memory management unit mmu in addition to containing damage that may be caused by

the electrically neutral atom contains a single positively charged proton and a single negatively charged electron bound to the nucleus by the coulomb force atomic hydrogen constitutes about 75 of the baryonic mass of the universe in everyday life on earth isolated hydrogen atoms called atomic hydrogen are extremely rare instead a hydrogen atom tends to combine with other atoms in compounds or with another hydrogen atom to form ordinary diatomic hydrogen gas h atomic hydrogen and hydrogen atom in ordinary english use have overlapping yet distinct meanings for example a water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms but does not contain atomic hydrogen which would refer to isolated hydrogen atoms atomic spectroscopy shows that there is a discrete infinite set of states in which a hydrogen or any atom can exist contrary to the predictions of classical physics attempts to develop a theoretical understanding of the states of the hydrogen atom have been important to the history of quantum mechanics since all other atoms can be roughly understood by knowing in detail about this simplest atomic structure the most abundant isotope hydrogen 1 protium or light hydrogen contains no neutrons and is simply a proton and an electron protium is

these enzymes catalyze the movement of ions or molecules across membranes or their separation within membranes the reaction is designated as a transfer from side 1 to side 2 because the designations in and out which had previously been used can be ambiguous translocases are the most common secretion system in gram positive bacteria it is also a historical term for the protein now called elongation factor g due to its function in moving the transfer rna trna and messenger rna mrna through the ribosome the enzyme classification and nomenclature list was first approved by the international union of biochemistry in 1961 six enzyme classes had been recognized based on the type of chemical reaction catalyzed including oxidoreductases ec 1 transferases ec 2 hydrolases ec 3 lyases ec 4 isomerases ec 5 and ligases ec 6 however it became apparent that none of these could describe the important group of enzymes that catalyse the movement of ions or molecules across membranes or their separation within membranes several of these involve the hydrolysis of atp and had been previously classified as atpases ec 3 6 3 although the hydrolytic reaction is not their primary function in august 2018 the international union

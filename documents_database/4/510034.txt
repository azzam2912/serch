the vastus medialis is part of the quadriceps muscle group the vastus medialis is one of four muscles in the anterior compartment of the thigh it is involved in knee extension along with the other muscles which make up the quadriceps muscle the vastus medialis also contributes to correct tracking of the patella a division of the vastus medialis muscle into two groups of fibers has been hypothesized a long and relatively inline group of fibres with the quadriceps ligament the vastus medialis longus and a shorter and more obliquely oriented with group of fibres the vastus medialis obliquus there is as yet insufficient evidence to conclusively confirm or deny this hypothesis knee pain is thought to be primarily associated with specific quadriceps muscle weakness or fatigue especially in the vastus medialis obliquus vmo it is known that fatigue can be caused by many different mechanisms ranging from the accumulation of metabolites within muscle fibers to the generation of an inadequate motor command in the motor cortex characteristics of the vastus medialis including its angle of insertion correlate with presence of knee joint pain patellofemoral pain syndrome however this syndrome is complex and definitive evidence of causality has not yet

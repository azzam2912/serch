the ice matrix they inhabit has strong vertical gradients of salinity light temperature and nutrients sea ice chemistry is most influenced by the salinity of the brine which affects the ph and the concentration of dissolved nutrients and gases the brine formed during the melting sea ice creates pores and channels in the sea ice in which these microbes can live as a result of these gradients and dynamic conditions a higher abundance of microbes are found in the lower layer of the ice although some are found in the middle and upper layers despite this extreme variability in environmental conditions the taxonomical community composition tends to remain consistent throughout the year until the ice melts much of the knowledge concerning the community diversity of the sea ice is known through genetic analyses and next generation sequencing in both the arctic and antarctic alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and flavobacteriia are the common bacterial classes found most sea ice archaea belong to the phylum thaumarchaeota while most of the protists belong to one of 3 supergroups alveolata stramenopile and rhizaria the abundance of living cells within and on sea ice ranges from 10 10 cells ml these microbial communities play a significant role

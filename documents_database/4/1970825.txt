calculating the exact cardinality of a multiset requires an amount of memory proportional to the cardinality which is impractical for very large data sets probabilistic cardinality estimators such as the hyperloglog algorithm use significantly less memory than this at the cost of obtaining only an approximation of the cardinality the hyperloglog algorithm is able to estimate cardinalities of 10 with a typical accuracy standard error of 2 using 1 5 kb of memory hyperloglog is an extension of the earlier loglog algorithm itself deriving from the 1984 flajolet martin algorithm in the original paper by flajolet et al and in related literature on the count distinct problem the term cardinality is used to mean the number of distinct elements in a data stream with repeated elements however in the theory of multisets the term refers to the sum of multiplicities of each member of a multiset this article chooses to use flajolet s definition for consistency with the sources the basis of the hyperloglog algorithm is the observation that the cardinality of a multiset of uniformly distributed random numbers can be estimated by calculating the maximum number of leading zeros in the binary representation of each number in the set

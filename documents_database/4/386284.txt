if for some reason the organism does not receive the appropriate stimulus during this critical period to learn a given skill or trait it may be difficult ultimately less successful or even impossible to develop some functions later in life functions that are indispensable to an organism s survival such as vision are particularly likely to develop during critical periods critical period also relates to the ability to acquire one s first language researchers found that people who passed the critical period would not acquire their first language fluently some researchers differentiate between strong critical periods and weak critical periods a k a sensitive periods defining weak critical periods sensitive periods as more extended periods after which learning is still possible other researchers consider these the same phenomenon for example the critical period for the development of a human child s binocular vision is thought to be between three and eight months with sensitivity to damage extending up to at least three years of age further critical periods have been identified for the development of hearing and the vestibular system examples of strong critical periods include monocular deprivation filial imprinting monaural occlusion and prefrontal synthesis acquisition these traits cannot be

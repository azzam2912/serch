the vapor pressure at a convex curved surface is higher than that at a flat surface the kelvin equation is dependent upon thermodynamic principles and does not allude to special properties of materials it is also used for determination of pore size distribution of a porous medium using adsorption porosimetry the equation is named in honor of william thomson also known as lord kelvin the kelvin equation may be written in the form where formula 2 is the actual vapour pressure formula 3 is the saturated vapour pressure when the surface is flat formula 4 is the liquid vapor surface tension formula 5 is the molar volume of the liquid formula 6 is the universal gas constant formula 7 is the radius of the droplet and formula 8 is temperature equilibrium vapor pressure depends on droplet size as formula 7 increases formula 2 decreases and the droplets grow into bulk liquid if we now cool the vapour then formula 8 decreases but so does formula 3 this means formula 17 increases as the liquid is cooled we can treat formula 4 and formula 5 as approximately fixed which means that the critical radius formula 7 must also decrease the further

two alternative splice variants encoding distinct isoforms are reported additional splice variants exist but their full length nature has not been determined this gene encodes a protein that is a member of the shank family of synaptic proteins that may function as molecular scaffolds in the postsynaptic density psd shank proteins contain multiple domains for protein protein interaction including ankyrin repeats an sh3 domain a psd 95 dlg zo 1 domain a sterile alpha motif domain and a proline rich region this particular family member contains a pdz domain a consensus sequence for cortactin sh3 domain binding peptides and a sterile alpha motif the alternative splicing demonstrated in shank genes has been suggested as a mechanism for regulating the molecular structure of shank and the spectrum of shank interacting proteins in the psds of adult and developing brain it is thought that shank2 might play a role in synaptogenesis by attaching metabotropic glutamate receptors mglurs to an existing pool of nmda receptors nmda r bylinking to the nmda r through psd 95 and the mglurs through homer1 an alternative hypothesis is that the homer shank gkap psd 95 assembly mediates physical association of the nmdar with ip3r ryr and intracellular

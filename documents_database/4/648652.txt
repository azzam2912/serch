it belongs to a class of dyes called sulfonephthaleins it is used as a ph indicator in applications such as growth mediums for microorganisms and titrations in clinical practise it is commonly used as a diagnostic technique the most common use of bromocresol green is to measure serum albumin concentration within mammalian blood samples in possible cases of renal failure and liver disease in aqueous solution bromocresol green will ionize to give the monoanionic form yellow that further deprotonates at higher ph to give the dianionic form blue which is stabilized by resonance the acid dissociation constant p k of this reaction is 4 8 tap water is sufficiently basic to give a solution of bromocresol green its characteristic blue green color the acid and basic forms of this dye have an isosbestic point in their uv visible spectrum around 515 nm indicate that the two forms interconvert directly without forming any other substance an ethanol solution 0 04 wt of bromocresol green has been proposed for tlc staining and is suitable for visualisation of the compounds with functional groups whose p k is below 5 0 carboxylic acids sulfonic acids etc these appear as yellow spots on a light

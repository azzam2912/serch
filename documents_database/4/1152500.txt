hecht states that he was confronted with what seemed a mundane problem when showing speakers at various audio shows onlookers often poked at the two inch dome tweeters of the display models sometimes cracking them he set out to make a soft mock tweeter that wouldn t crack when prodded i brought it back to the lab and i thought it might possibly make a good mid range if i coated it hecht recalls so i coated it with a thin rubber coating and put noise through it with a signal generator to my absolute surprise it went beyond 12k that was quite a shock in those days the belief was that only a rigid tweeter was capable of producing high frequencies the soft dome revolutionized the reproduction of high frequency sound it produced a smoother frequency response wider dispersion to higher frequencies and had almost no high frequency resonances all with much lower distortion than conventional tweeters up to that point after it was patented the soft dome tweeter became an industry standard and was licensed almost immediately by all major audio companies in the world including philips peerless mcintosh sony jvc yamaha pioneer kenwood shure and many more

the floating leg of a constant maturity swap fixes against a point on the swap curve on a periodic basis a constant maturity swap is an interest rate swap where the interest rate on one leg is reset periodically but with reference to a market swap rate rather than libor the other leg of the swap is generally libor but may be a fixed rate or potentially another constant maturity rate constant maturity swaps can either be single currency or cross currency swaps therefore the prime factor for a constant maturity swap is the shape of the forward implied yield curves a single currency constant maturity swap versus libor is similar to a series of differential interest rate fixes or dirf in the same way that an interest rate swap is similar to a series of forward rate agreements valuation of constant maturity swaps depend on volatilities of different forward rates and therefore requires a stochastic yield curve model or some approximated methodology like a convexity adjustment see for example brigo and mercurio 2006 a customer believes that the six month libor rate will fall relative to the three year swap rate for a given currency to take advantage of

the book is the founding text of the lydian chromatic concept lcc or lydian chromatic theory lct russell s work postulates that all music is based on the tonal gravity of the lydian mode russell believed that dominant function was the driving force behind all harmonic motion russell focuses on the lydian mode because it can be built with fifths for instance to construct a c lydian scale one could list the first seven tones on the circle of fifths starting with c the desired lydian tonic this process would yield c g d a e b f if these tones are voiced in the space of an octave they form the lydian mode c d e f g a b additionally russell observed when these tones are voiced in thirds they form the preferred form of a major 7 9 11 13 chord russell builds a prototype chromatic scale starting on the lydian tonic by stacking fifths skipping the interval between the seventh and eighth tones using c as the lydian tonic yields the following 12 note scale with enharmonic respellings c g d a e b f c g d e a b e f b c thus

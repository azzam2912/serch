over time this creates a thick layer of acidic peat large areas of these forests are being logged at high rates peat swamp forests are typically surrounded by lowland rain forests on better drained soils and by brackish or salt water mangrove forests near the coast tropical peatlands which coexist with swamp forests within the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome store and accumulate vast amounts of carbon as soil organic matter much more than natural forests contain their stability has important implications for climate change they are among the largest near surface reserves of terrestrial organic carbon peat swamp forests which have ecological importance are one of the most threatened yet least studied and most poorly understood biotypes since the 1970s peat swamp forest deforestation and drainage have increased exponentially in addition el ni o southern oscillation enso drought and large scale fires are accelerating peatland devastation this destruction enhances the decomposition of soil and organic matter increasing the carbon release to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide this phenomenon suggests that tropical peatlands have already become a large carbon dioxide source but related data and information is limited tropical peat swamp forests are home to thousands of animals

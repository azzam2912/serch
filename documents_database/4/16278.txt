the two basic types are the arithmetic left shift and the arithmetic right shift for binary numbers it is a bitwise operation that shifts all of the bits of its operand every bit in the operand is simply moved a given number of bit positions and the vacant bit positions are filled in instead of being filled with all 0s as in logical shift when shifting to the right the leftmost bit usually the sign bit in signed integer representations is replicated to fill in all the vacant positions this is a kind of sign extension some authors prefer the terms sticky right shift and zero fill right shift for arithmetic and logical shifts respectively arithmetic shifts can be useful as efficient ways to perform multiplication or division of signed integers by powers of two shifting left by n bits on a signed or unsigned binary number has the effect of multiplying it by 2 shifting right by n bits on a two s complement signed binary number has the effect of dividing it by 2 but it always rounds down towards negative infinity this is different from the way rounding is usually done in signed integer division which rounds

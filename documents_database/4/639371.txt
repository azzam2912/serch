it was later redescribed as a new genus and species by paul sereno in 2000 it is known from the late cretaceous period and its fossils were found in mongolia only a partial skeleton has been found the type and only known species is graciliceratops mongoliensis graciliceratops is known from shireegiin gashuun formation in mongolia s gobi desert north of the nemegt basin the shireegiin gashuun locality is thought to be older than the djadokhta localities that produced protoceratops and is probably early late cretaceous in age the relationships of the genus are unclear however the frill has large fenestrae bounded by very slender struts this structure is very similar to that of the later protoceratops the skull of the animal measures an estimated twenty centimetres and the whole animal would have been about the size of a cat however the arches and bodies of the vertebrae are not fused which suggests that the animal was not fully grown when it died the adult may have approached protoceratops in size which grew to around two meters like other ceratopsians graciliceratops would have been an herbivore using its powerful beak and shearing teeth to process tough plant matter little is known

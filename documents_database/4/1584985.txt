8 by walter piston is a symphony dating from 1965 the boston symphony orchestra commissioned the eighth symphony and gave its first performance on march 5 1965 conducted by erich leinsdorf to whom the score is dedicated initially piston had preferred to write a flute concerto for the boston symphony s principal flautist doriot anthony dwyer but leinsdorf preferred a symphony the concerto was eventually composed in 1971 according to another account however it was piston himself who expressed a preference for a symphony the work is in three movements the symphony is 20 minutes in duration although piston had occasionally employed twelve tone technique from early on it is much more in evidence in the eighth symphony than ever before and this brings with it a heightened level of impassioned almost tragic expression the first movement begins with a melody constructed from a twelve tone series c d e f a g f e d a b b accompanied by two six note chords consisting of the second and first hexachords of the same row this series lends the music a dark solemnity because of its emphasis on minor seconds and minor thirds after such a slow prelude like

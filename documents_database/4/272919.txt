it is the result of many years of work by luigi cavalli sforza one of the most cited scientists in the world who has published extensively in the use of genetics to understand human migration and evolution the hgdp data sets have often been cited in papers on such topics as population genetics anthropology and heritable disease research the project has noted the need to record the genetic profiles of indigenous populations as isolated populations are the best way to understand the genetic frequencies that have clues into our distant past knowing about the relationship between such populations makes it possible to infer the journey of humankind from the humans who left africa and populated the world to the humans of today the hgdp ceph human genome diversity cell line panel is a resource of 1 063 cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines lcls from 1 050 individuals in 52 world populations banked at the fondation jean dausset ceph in paris the hgdp is not related to the human genome project hgp and has attempted to maintain a distinct identity the hgdp includes the 51 populations from around the world a description of the populations that were studied can be found in

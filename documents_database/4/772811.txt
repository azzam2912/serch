strictly speaking the name bullet cluster refers to the smaller subcluster moving away from the larger one it is at a co moving radial distance of 1 141 gpc 3 7 billion light years gravitational lensing studies of the bullet cluster are claimed to provide the best evidence to date for the existence of dark matter observations of other galaxy cluster collisions such as macs j0025 4 1222 similarly support the existence of dark matter the major components of the cluster pair stars gas and the putative dark matter behave differently during collision allowing them to be studied separately the stars of the galaxies observable in visible light were not greatly affected by the collision and most passed right through gravitationally slowed but not otherwise altered the hot gas of the two colliding components seen in x rays represents most of the baryonic i e ordinary matter in the cluster pair the gases interact electromagnetically causing the gases of both clusters to slow much more than the stars the third component the dark matter was detected indirectly by the gravitational lensing of background objects in theories without dark matter such as modified newtonian dynamics mond the lensing would be expected

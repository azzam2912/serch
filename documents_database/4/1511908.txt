interatomic intermolecular coulombic decay is a very efficient interatomic intermolecular relaxation process of an electronically excited atom or molecule embedded in an environment without the environment the process cannot take place until now it has been mainly demonstrated for atomic and molecular clusters independently of whether they are of van der waals or hydrogen bonded type the nature of the process can be depicted as follows consider a cluster with two subunits a and b suppose an inner valence electron is removed from subunit a if the resulting ionized state is higher in energy than the double ionization threshold of subunit a then an intraatomic intramolecular process autoionization in the case of core ionization auger decay sets in even though the excitation is energetically not higher than the double ionization threshold of subunit a itself it may be higher than the double ionization threshold of the cluster which is lowered due to charge separation if this is the case an interatomic intermolecular process sets in which is called icd during the icd the excess energy of subunit a is used to remove due to electronic correlation an outer valence electron from subunit b as a result a doubly ionized cluster

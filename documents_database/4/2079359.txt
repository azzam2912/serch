it concerns the limits of adaptation to natural environments as well as the limits of artificial selection humans have created a wide range of new species and varieties within those species of both domesticated animals and plants other human activity also impacts evolution this has been achieved in a very short geological period of time spanning only a few tens of thousands of years and sometimes less maize zea mays for instance is estimated to have been created in what is now known as mexico in only a few thousand years starting between about 7 000 and 12 000 years ago from still uncertain origins in the light of this extraordinarily rapid rate of evolution through prehistoric artificial selection george c williams and others have remarked that the question of evolutionary change in relation to available geological time is indeed a serious theoretical challenge but the reasons are exactly the opposite of that inspired by most people s intuition organisms in general have not done nearly as much evolving as we should reasonably expect long term rates of change even in lineages of unusual rapid evolution are almost always far slower than they theoretically could be the basis for such

the flow velocity components can be expressed as the derivatives of the scalar stream function the stream function can be used to plot streamlines which represent the trajectories of particles in a steady flow the two dimensional lagrange stream function was introduced by joseph louis lagrange in 1781 the stokes stream function is for axisymmetrical three dimensional flow and is named after george gabriel stokes considering the particular case of fluid dynamics the difference between the stream function values at any two points gives the volumetric flow rate or volumetric flux through a line connecting the two points since streamlines are tangent to the flow velocity vector of the flow the value of the stream function must be constant along a streamline the usefulness of the stream function lies in the fact that the flow velocity components in the x and y directions at a given point are given by the partial derivatives of the stream function at that point a stream function may be defined for any flow of dimensions greater than or equal to two however the two dimensional case is generally the easiest to visualize and derive for two dimensional potential flow streamlines are perpendicular to equipotential

historically celestial mechanics applies principles of physics classical mechanics to astronomical objects such as stars and planets to produce ephemeris data modern analytic celestial mechanics started with isaac newton s principia of 1687 the name celestial mechanics is more recent than that newton wrote that the field should be called rational mechanics the term dynamics came in a little later with gottfried leibniz and over a century after newton pierre simon laplace introduced the term celestial mechanics prior to kepler there was little connection between exact quantitative prediction of planetary positions using geometrical or arithmetical techniques and contemporary discussions of the physical causes of the planets motion johannes kepler 1571 1630 was the first to closely integrate the predictive geometrical astronomy which had been dominant from ptolemy in the 2nd century to copernicus with physical concepts to produce a new astronomy based upon causes or celestial physics in 1609 his work led to the modern laws of planetary orbits which he developed using his physical principles and the planetary observations made by tycho brahe kepler s model greatly improved the accuracy of predictions of planetary motion years before isaac newton developed his law of gravitation in 1686 isaac newton 25

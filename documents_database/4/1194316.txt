the spacecraft were launched on 13 march 2015 at 02 44 utc it is designed to gather information about the microphysics of magnetic reconnection energetic particle acceleration and turbulence processes that occur in many astrophysical plasmas the mission builds upon the successes of the esa cluster mission but will surpass it in spatial resolution and in temporal resolution allowing for the first time measurements of the critical electron diffusion region the site where magnetic reconnection occurs its orbit is optimized to spend extended periods in locations where reconnection is known to occur at the dayside magnetopause the place where the pressure from the solar wind and the planets magnetic field are equal and in the magnetotail which is formed by pressure from the solar wind on a planet s magnetosphere and which can extend great distances away from its originating planet magnetic reconnection in earth s magnetosphere is one of the mechanisms responsible for the aurora and it is important to the science of controlled nuclear fusion because it is one mechanism preventing magnetic confinement of the fusion fuel these mechanisms are studied in outer space by the measurement of motions of matter in stellar atmospheres like that of the

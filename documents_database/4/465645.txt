the analysis provides parameters of the physics under the fluctuations one of the interesting applications of this is an analysis of the concentration fluctuations of fluorescent particles molecules in solution in this application the fluorescence emitted from a very tiny space in solution containing a small number of fluorescent particles molecules is observed the fluorescence intensity is fluctuating due to brownian motion of the particles in other words the number of the particles in the sub space defined by the optical system is randomly changing around the average number the analysis gives the average number of fluorescent particles and average diffusion time when the particle is passing through the space eventually both the concentration and size of the particle molecule are determined both parameters are important in biochemical research biophysics and chemistry fcs is such a sensitive analytical tool because it observes a small number of molecules nanomolar to picomolar concentrations in a small volume 1 m in contrast to other methods such as hplc analysis fcs has no physical separation process instead it achieves its spatial resolution through its optics furthermore fcs enables observation of fluorescence tagged molecules in the biochemical pathway in intact living cells this opens a

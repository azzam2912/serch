the final report was published in mid 2004 caves and other underground structures including martian lava tubes canyon overhangs and other martian cavities would be potentially useful for manned missions for they would provide considerable shielding from both the elements and intense solar radiation to which a mars mission would expose astronauts they might also offer access to minerals gases ices and any subterranean life that the crew of such a mission would probably be searching for the program also studied designs for inflatable modules and other such structures that would aid the astronauts to build a livable environment for humans and earth creatures the final report is divided into 10 parts section 1 the project summary summarizes the entire project and claims that this project developed a revolutionary system to exploit the novel idea of extraterrestrial cave use and explaining that two experiments or missions were tested to gather data section 2 the introduction answers the question of why caves for martian research bases and provides a variety of different answers to the advantages of using caves as a foothold in martian exploration such as this section also contains some speculation on the existence and locations of such caves

achieving plug flow has previously been limited to either a large number of continuous stir tank reactors cstr in series or conditions with high turbulent flow the technology incorporates annular baffles to a tubular reactor framework to create eddies when liquid is pushed up through the tube likewise when liquid is on a downstroke through the tube eddies are created on the other side of the baffles eddy generation on both sides of the baffles creates very effective mixing while still maintaining plug flow by using cobr potentially higher yields of product can be made with greater control and reduced waste a standard cobr consists of a 10 150mm id tube with equally spaced baffles throughout there are typically two pumps in a cobr one pump is reciprocating to generate continuous oscillatory flow and a second pump creates net flow through the tube this design offers a control over mixing intensity that conventional tubular reactors cannot achieve each baffled cell acts as a cstr and because a secondary pump is creating a net laminar flow much longer residence times can be achieved relative to turbulent flow systems with conventional tubular reactors mixing is accomplished through stirring mechanisms or turbulent flow

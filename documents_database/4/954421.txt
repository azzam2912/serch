he later introduced a non symmetric generalization in 1995 macdonald originally associated his polynomials with weights of finite root systems and used just one variable t but later realized that it is more natural to associate them with affine root systems rather than finite root systems in which case the variable t can be replaced by several different variables t t t one for each of the k orbits of roots in the affine root system the macdonald polynomials are polynomials in n variables x x x where n is the rank of the affine root system they generalize many other families of orthogonal polynomials such as jack polynomials and hall littlewood polynomials and askey wilson polynomials which in turn include most of the named 1 variable orthogonal polynomials as special cases koornwinder polynomials are macdonald polynomials of certain non reduced root systems they have deep relationships with affine hecke algebras and hilbert schemes which were used to prove several conjectures made by macdonald about them first fix some notation the macdonald polynomials p for p are uniquely defined by the following two conditions in other words the macdonald polynomials are obtained by orthogonalizing the obvious basis for a the

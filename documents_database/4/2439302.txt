lam this work was published in the 1994 usenix summer technical conference for this project the authors won the 2004 acm software system award this work began in 1991 as a theoretical investigation by the networking research laboratory on the formal meaning of a protocol layer satisfying an upper interface specification as a service provider and a lower interface specification as a service consumer the networking research laboratory received a grant from the national security agency in june 1991 to investigate how to apply their theory of modules and interfaces to security verification at that time there were three well known authentication systems built mit s kerberos or being developed dec s spx and ibm s kryptoknight all of these systems suffered from a common drawback namely they did not export a clean and easy to use interface that could be readily used by internet applications for example it would take a tremendous amount of effort to kerberize an existing distributed application toward the goal of secure network programming for the masses the inventors of snp conceived secure sockets as a high level abstraction suitable for securing internet applications in 1993 they designed and built a prototype of snp designed

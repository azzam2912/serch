if the r is organic the compounds are called organic hydroperoxides such compounds are a subset of organic peroxides which have the formula roor organic hydroperoxides can either intentionally or unintentionally initiate explosive polymerisation in materials with unsaturated chemical bonds the o o bond length in peroxides is about 1 45 and the r o o angles r h c are about 110 water like characteristically the c o o h dihedral angles are about 120 the o o bond is relatively weak with a bond dissociation energy of less than half the strengths of c c c h and c o bonds hydroperoxides can be reduced to alcohols with lithium aluminium hydride as described in this idealized equation this reaction is the basis of methods for analysis of organic peroxides another way to evaluate the content of peracids and peroxides is the volumetric titration with alkoxides such as sodium ethoxide the phosphite esters and tertiary phosphines also effect reduction hydroperoxides are intermediates in the production of many organic compounds in industry for example the cobalt catalyzed oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone acetone and phenol are produced by the so called cumene process which proceeds via cumene hydroperoxide many epoxides

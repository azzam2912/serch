the units are length time i e velocity squared or twice the energy per mass every object in a 2 body ballistic trajectory has a constant specific orbital energy formula 2 equal to the sum of its specific kinetic and specific potential energy where formula 4 is the standard gravitational parameter of the massive body with mass formula 5 and formula 6 is the radial distance from its center as an object in an escape trajectory moves outward its kinetic energy decreases as its potential energy which is always negative increases maintaining a constant sum note that c is twice the specific orbital energy formula 2 of the escaping object a spacecraft with insufficient energy to escape will remain in a closed orbit unless it intersects the central body with where if the orbit is circular of radius r then a spacecraft leaving the central body on a parabolic trajectory has exactly the energy needed to escape and no more a spacecraft that is leaving the central body on a hyperbolic trajectory has more than enough energy to escape where also where formula 17 is the asymptotic velocity at infinite distance spacecraft s velocity approaches formula 17 as it is

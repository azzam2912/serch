for example the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4 the greatest common divisor is also known as the greatest common factor gcf highest common factor hcf greatest common measure gcm or highest common divisor this notion can be extended to polynomials see polynomial greatest common divisor and other commutative rings see below in this article we will denote the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b as gcd a b some authors use a b what is the greatest common divisor of 54 and 24 the number 54 can be expressed as a product of two integers in several different ways thus the divisors of 54 are formula 2 similarly the divisors of 24 are formula 3 the numbers that these two lists share in common are the common divisors of 54 and 24 the greatest of these is 6 that is the greatest common divisor of 54 and 24 one writes two numbers are called relatively prime or coprime if their greatest common divisor equals 1 for example 9 and 28 are relatively prime for example a 24 by 60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 1 by 1 squares 2 by 2

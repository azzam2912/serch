the solubility of a substance fundamentally depends on the physical and chemical properties of the solute and solvent as well as on temperature pressure and presence of other chemicals including changes to the ph of the solution the extent of the solubility of a substance in a specific solvent is measured as the saturation concentration where adding more solute does not increase the concentration of the solution and begins to precipitate the excess amount of solute insolubility is the inability to dissolve in a solid liquid or gaseous solvent most often the solvent is a liquid which can be a pure substance or a mixture one may also speak of solid solution but rarely of solution in a gas see vapor liquid equilibrium instead under certain conditions the equilibrium solubility can be exceeded to give a so called supersaturated solution which is metastable metastability of crystals can also lead to apparent differences in the amount of a chemical that dissolves depending on its crystalline form or particle size a supersaturated solution generally crystallises when seed crystals are introduced and rapid equilibration occurs phenylsalicylate is one such simple observable substance when fully melted and then cooled below its fusion point solubility

therefore in this theory the pitch of a pure tone is determined by the period of neuron firing patterns either of single neurons or groups as described by the volley theory temporal or timing theory competes with the place theory of hearing which instead states that pitch is signaled according to the locations of vibrations along the basilar membrane temporal theory was first suggested by august seebeck as the basilar membrane vibrates each clump of hair cells along its length is deflected in time with the sound components as filtered by basilar membrane tuning for its position the more intense this vibration is the more the hair cells are deflected and the more likely they are to cause cochlear nerve firings temporal theory supposes that the consistent timing patterns whether at high or low average firing rate code for a consistent pitch percept at high sounds levels nerve fibers whose characteristic frequencies do not exactly match the stimulus still respond because of the motion induced in larger areas of the basilar membrane by loud sounds temporal theory can help explain how we maintain this discrimination even when a larger group of nerve fibers are all firing there is a periodicity

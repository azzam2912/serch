that is characteristics do not hold to evolutionary convergence and do not have analogous structures statistically this can be represented as an ancestor having state 0 in all characteristics where 0 represents a lack of that characteristic each of these characteristics changes from 0 to 1 exactly once and never reverts to state 0 it is rare that actual data adheres to the concept of perfect phylogeny in general there are two different data types that are used in the construction of a phylogenetic tree in distance based computations a phylogenetic tree is created by analyzing relationships among the distance between species and the edge lengths of a corresponding tree using a character based approach employs character states across species as an input in an attempt to find the most perfect phylogenetic tree the statistical components of a perfect phylogenetic tree can best be described as follows a perfect phylogeny for an n x m character state matrix m is a rooted tree t with n leaves satisfying i each row of m labels exactly one leaf of t ii each column of m labels exactly one edge of t iii every interior edge of t is labeled by at

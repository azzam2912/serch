its age as given in the treatise on invertebrate paleontology is arenigian bajkaloceras is characterized by an orthonic shell with an elliptical cross section and short camerae and a large central to subctral siphuncle composed of moderately concave segments with short septal necks and apparently thin connecting rings in the early growth stage the interior of the siphuncle is lined with calcareous deposits that seem to be outgrowths of the connecting rings which are divided into numerous cells by longitudinal and transverse partitions bajkaloceras is the sole member and representative of the bajkaloceratidae proposed by balashov 1962 and given ordinal rank by sheveyrev 2006 teichert 1964 in the treatise pt k included bajkaloceras and bajkaloceratidae along with intejoceras evencoceras and padunoceras in the intejocerida which he joined with the endocerida in the endoceratoidea flower 1976 separated these into two groups calling attention to differences in siphuncle morphology and location thin connecting rings and the central or subcentral siphuncle separate bajkaloceras form the endoceroids and suggest a close relationship with the baltoceratidae or the troedssonellidae

it is a spectral class f9 5 main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 4 23 despite having a slightly lower mass this star is more luminous than the sun based upon parallax measurements by the hipparcos spacecraft it is approximately 28 0 light years from earth this is one of the least variable stars observed during the hipparcos mission the composition and mass of this star are very similar to the sun with a slightly lower mass and an estimated age of three billion years the solar like qualities make it a target of interest for investigating the possible existence of a life bearing planet based upon an excess emission of infrared radiation at 70 micrometres this system is believed to have a debris disk the disk is orbiting the star at a minimum radius of 2 3 astronomical units it is radiating with a maximum temperature of 218 k as of 2009 no planet has been discovered in orbit around this star the components of this star s space velocity are u 60 v 4 and w 38 km s these correspond to the velocity toward the galactic center the velocity along the direction of galactic rotation

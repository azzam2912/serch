this automatic dumas technique has replaced the kjeldahl method as the standard method of analysis for protein content for food and animal feeds the method consists of combusting a sample of known mass in a high temperature range of 800 900 c chamber in the presence of oxygen this leads to the release of carbon dioxide water and nitrogen the gases are then passed over special columns such as potassium hydroxide aqueous solution that absorb the carbon dioxide and water a column containing a thermal conductivity detector at the end is then used to separate the nitrogen from any residual carbon dioxide and water and the remaining nitrogen content is measured the instrument must first be calibrated by analyzing a material that is pure and has a known nitrogen concentration the measured signal from the thermal conductivity detector for the unknown sample can then be converted into a nitrogen content as with the kjeldahl method conversion of the concentration of nitrogen in a sample to the crude protein content is performed using conversion factors which depend on the particular amino acid sequence of the measured protein the dumas method has the advantages of being easy to use and fully automatable

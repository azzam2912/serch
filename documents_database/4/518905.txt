each of these component modules processes one bit field or slice of an operand the grouped processing components would then have the capability to process the chosen full word length of a particular software design bit slicing more or less died out due to the advent of the microprocessor recently it has been used in alus for quantum computers and has been used as a software technique e g in x86 cpus for cryptography bit slice processors usually include an arithmetic logic unit alu of 1 2 4 8 or 16 bits and control lines including carry or overflow signals that are internal to the processor in non bitsliced cpu designs for example two 4 bit alu chips could be arranged side by side with control lines between them to form an 8 bit alu result need not be power of two e g three 1 bit can make a 3 bit alu thus 3 bit or n bit cpu while 3 bit or any cpu with higher odd number of bits hasn t been manufactured and sold in volume four 4 bit alu chips could be used to build a 16 bit alu it would take eight chips to

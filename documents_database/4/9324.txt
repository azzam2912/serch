in essence a sequence is a function with domain the natural numbers and in the context of topology the codomain of this function is usually any topological space however in the context of topology sequences do not fully encode all information about a function between topological spaces in particular the following two conditions are not equivalent in general for a map f between topological spaces x and y it is true however that condition 1 implies condition 2 the difficulty encountered when attempting to prove that condition 2 implies condition 1 lies in the fact that topological spaces are in general not first countable if the first countability axiom were imposed on the topological spaces in question the two above conditions would be equivalent in particular the two conditions are equivalent for metric spaces the purpose of the concept of a net first introduced by e h moore and herman l smith in 1922 is to generalize the notion of a sequence so as to confirm the equivalence of the conditions with sequence being replaced by net in condition 2 in particular rather than being defined on a countable linearly ordered set a net is defined on an arbitrary directed

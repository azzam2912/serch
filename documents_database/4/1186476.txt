a site tree is a single tree in a stand group of growing trees that gives a good representation of the average dominant or co dominant tree in the stand site trees are used to calculate the site index of the site in reference to a particular tree species a site tree should belong to the dominant or co dominant overstory class the total height of the tree and age measured at diameter at breast height of a sample of site trees will be used to determine a site index which will show how tall trees of different species can grow on that site in a set amount of time sometimes several years are added to the breast height age to account for time grown below determining what a site tree should look like in a stand varies with what kind of stand one is standing in the simplest stand to find a site tree in is an even aged stand of a single species much like a forest plantation in this stand almost any dominant or co dominant tree can be used finding a site tree is more difficult in uneven aged mixed species stands there are multiple assumptions

each branch of the tree is given a rectangle which is then tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub branches a leaf node s rectangle has an area proportional to a specified dimension of the data often the leaf nodes are colored to show a separate dimension of the data in information visualization and computing treemapping is a method for displaying hierarchical data using nested figures usually rectangles when the color and size dimensions are correlated in some way with the tree structure one can often easily see patterns that would be difficult to spot in other ways such as if a certain color is particularly relevant a second advantage of treemaps is that by construction they make efficient use of space as a result they can legibly display thousands of items on the screen simultaneously to create a treemap one must define a tiling algorithm that is a way to divide a region into sub regions of specified areas ideally a treemap algorithm would create regions that satisfy the following criteria unfortunately these properties have an inverse relationship as the aspect ratio is optimized the order of placement becomes less predictable as the order becomes more stable the aspect ratio

gear shaping is a convenient and versatile method of gear cutting it involves continuous same plane rotational cutting of gear the types of cutters used for gear shaping can be grouped into four categories disk hub shank and helical cutters the cutters are essentially gears that are used to form the teeth this method of gear cutting is based on the principle that any two gears will mesh if they are of the same pitch proper helix angle and proper tooth depth and thickness by using a gear shaped corresponding cutter that is rotated in relation to a blank gear produces the gear teeth the cutters that are rotated are timed with the workpiece this process produces internal gears external gears and integral gear pinion arrangements the process of gear shaping uses a toothed disk cutter which reciprocates in axial rotations the workpiece or blank gear rotates on a second shaft spindle the workpiece is aligned with the cutter and it gradually feeds into the cutter while rotating if a two step process is used all tooth spaces are partially cut before finishing the machine used for gear shaping generally consists of a base column spindle and an arbor the

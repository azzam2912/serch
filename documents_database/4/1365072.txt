it is a basic technique in distributed algorithms for instance a minimum spanning tree is used as a backbone to reduce the cost of broadcast from o m to o n where m and n are the number of edges and vertices in the graph respectively the term topology control is used mostly by the wireless ad hoc and sensor networks research community the main aim of topology control in this domain is to save energy reduce interference between nodes and extend lifetime of the network lately topology control algorithms have been divided into two subproblems topology construction in charge of the initial reduction and topology maintenance in charge of the maintenance of the reduced topology so that characteristics like connectivity and coverage are preserved this is the first stage of a topology control protocol once the initial topology is deployed specially when the location of the nodes is random the administrator has no control over the design of the network for example some areas may be very dense showing a high number of redundant nodes which will increase the number of message collisions and will provide several copies of the same information from similarly located nodes however the administrator

the solutions are often quite complicated unless the problem is essentially one dimensional such as the radiation field in a thin layer of gas between two parallel rectangular plates these functions have practical applications in several engineering problems related to transport of thermal or neutron radiation in systems with special symmetries e g spherical or axial symmetry w g bickley was a british mathematician born in 1893 the n th bickley naylor function ki x is defined by and it is classified as one of the generalized exponential integral functions the integral defining the function ki generally cannot be evaluated analytically but can be approximated to a desired accuracy with riemann sums or other methods taking the limit as a 0 in the interval of integration a 2 alternative ways to define the function ki include the integral all of the functions ki for positive integer n are monotonously decreasing functions because e is a decreasing function and formula 3 is a positive increasing function for formula 4 the values of these functions for different values of the argument x were often listed in tables of special functions in the era when numerical calculation of integrals was slow a table

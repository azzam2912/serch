it is important in the localization of sounds as it provides a cue to the direction or angle of the sound source from the head if a signal arrives at the head from one side the signal has further to travel to reach the far ear than the near ear this pathlength difference results in a time difference between the sound s arrivals at the ears which is detected and aids the process of identifying the direction of sound source when a signal is produced in the horizontal plane its angle in relation to the head is referred to as its azimuth with 0 degrees 0 azimuth being directly in front of the listener 90 to the right and 180 being directly behind the duplex theory proposed by lord rayleigh 1907 provides an explanation for the ability of humans to localise sounds by time differences between the sounds reaching each ear itds and differences in sound level entering the ears interaural level differences ilds but there still lies a question whether itd or ild is prominent the duplex theory states that itds are used to localise low frequency sounds in particular while ilds are used in the localisation of high

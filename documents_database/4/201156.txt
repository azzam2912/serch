for example for the decimal denary system the most common system in use today the radix base number is ten because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9 in any standard positional numeral system a number is conventionally written as with x as the string of digits and y as its base although for base ten the subscript is usually assumed and omitted together with the pair of parentheses as it is the most common way to express value for example 100 is equivalent to 100 the decimal system is implied in the latter and represents the number one hundred while 100 in the binary system with base 2 represents the number four radix is a latin word for root root can be considered a synonym for base in the arithmetical sense in the system with radix 13 for example a string of digits such as 398 denotes the decimal number 632 more generally in a system with radix b a string of digits denotes the number where in contrast to decimal or radix 10 which has a ones place tens place hundreds place and so on radix b would have a ones place then a b s

unlike species of geomyces p destructans forms asymmetrically curved conidia pseudogymnoascus destructans grows very slowly on artificial media and cannot grow at temperatures above 20 c it can grow around 4 c to 20 c which encompasses the temperatures found in winter bat hibernacula phylogenic evaluation has revealed this organism should be reclassified under the family pseudeurotiaceae changing its name to pseudogymnoascus destructans in 2008 blehert et al described the fungus associated with white nose syndrome as a member of the genus geomyces in 2009 gargas et al were the first to describe the fungus as a unique species the specific name they chose means destroying the fungus was definitively identified as the cause of the syndrome in bats according to research published in 2011 by scientists at the united states geological survey it was previously unknown whether this fungus was the primary cause of wns or was an opportunistic pathogen associated with the disease though strong evidence suggested that the fungus was the etiologic agent in 2013 an analysis of the phylogenetic relationship indicated that this fungus was more closely related to the genus pseudogymnoascus than to the genus geomyces changing its latin binomial to pseudogymnoascus destructans pseudogymnoascus destructans

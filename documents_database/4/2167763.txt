coli system or of one protein just the arsb integral membrane protein of the plasmid encoded staphylococcus system arsa proteins have two atp binding domains and probably arose by a tandem gene duplication event arsb proteins all possess twelve transmembrane spanners and may also have arisen by a tandem gene duplication event structurally the ars pumps resemble abc type efflux pumps but there is no significant sequence similarity between the ars and abc pumps when only arsb is present the system operates by a pmf dependent mechanism and consequently belongs in tc subclass 2 a i e tc 2 a 45 when arsa is also present atp hydrolysis drives efflux and consequently the system belongs in tc subclass 3 a i e tc 3 a 4 arsb therefore appears twice in the tc system arsb and arsab but arsa appears only once these pumps actively expel both arsenite and antimonite homologues of arsb are found in gram negative and gram positive bacteria as well as cyanobacteria homologues are also found in archaea and eukarya several paralogues may sometimes be found in a single organism among the distant homologues found in eukaryotes are members of the dass family tc 2 a

they were founded in 1970 in fort lauderdale florida in the 1970s and 1980s they produced a line of 16 and 32 bit mini computers through the 1980s modcomp lost market share as more powerful micro computers became popular and digital equipment corporation s vax and alpha systems continued to grow the company successfully survives today as a systems integrator their first computer was the 16 bit modcomp iii introduced shortly after the company was founded this had 15 general purpose registers and was initially offered with a 16 kilobyte 16 384 bytes 18 mil magnetic core memory with an 800 ns cycle time expandable to 128 kilobytes 131 072 bytes the modcomp i followed for smaller applications with only 3 general purpose registers and a maximum of 64 kilobytes 65 536 bytes of core these machines were based on ssi and msi ttl logic the modcomp ii introduced in 1972 maintained compatibility with the modcomp iii while using some lsi circuits the core architecture of the 16 bit machines included blocks of uncommitted opcodes and provisions for physical modularity that hint at the reasoning behind the company name the modcomp iv was an upward compatible 32 bit machine with

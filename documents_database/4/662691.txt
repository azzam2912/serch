for manufacturers a bill of materials bom is a critical product information record that lists the raw materials assemblies components parts and the quantities of each needed to manufacture a product advanced modeling techniques are necessary to cope with configurable products where changing a small part of a product can have multiple impacts on other product structure models concepts within this entry are in capital letters in order to indicate these concepts several concepts are related to the subject of product structure modeling all these concepts are discussed in this section these concepts are divided into two main aspects first the product breakdown is discussed which involves all the physical aspects of a product second different views at the product structure are indicated figure 1 illustrates the concepts that are important to the structure of a product this is a meta data model which can be used for modeling the instances in a specific case of product structuring the core of the product structure is illustrated by the product components items and their relationships thus this involves the linking between items related to the product the assembly can consist of subassemblies and parts whereas subassemblies can also consist of other

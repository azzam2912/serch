it is a measure of how much the incident light illuminates the surface wavelength weighted by the luminosity function to correlate with human brightness perception similarly luminous emittance is the luminous flux per unit area emitted from a surface luminous emittance is also known as luminous exitance in si derived units these are measured in lux lx or equivalently in lumens per square metre cd sr m in the cgs system the unit of illuminance is the phot which is equal to the foot candle is a non metric unit of illuminance that is used in photography illuminance was formerly often called brightness but this leads to confusion with other uses of the word such as to mean luminance brightness should never be used for quantitative description but only for nonquantitative references to physiological sensations and perceptions of light the human eye is capable of seeing somewhat more than a 2 trillion fold range the presence of white objects is somewhat discernible under starlight at while at the bright end it is possible to read large text at 10 lux or about 1000 times that of direct sunlight although this can be very uncomfortable and cause long lasting afterimages in

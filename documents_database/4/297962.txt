systems are approached as coherent wholes whose component parts are best understood in context and in relation to one another and to the whole this practice is in contrast to a purely analytic tradition sometimes called reductionism which aims to gain understanding of systems by dividing them into smaller composing elements and gaining understanding of the system through understanding their elemental properties the holism reductionism dichotomy is often evident in conflicting interpretations of experimental findings and in setting priorities for future research david deutsch calls holism anti reductionist and refers to the concept as thinking the only legitimate way to think about science is as a series of emergent or higher level phenomena he argues that neither approach is purely correct two aspects of holism are proponents claim that holistic science is naturally suited to subjects such as ecology biology physics and the social sciences where complex non linear interactions are the norm these are systems where emergent properties arise at the level of the whole that cannot be predicted by focusing on the parts alone which may make mainstream reductionist science ill equipped to provide understanding beyond a certain level this principle of emergence in complex systems is often

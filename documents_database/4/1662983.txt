a diode matrix is used as the control store or microprogram in many early computers a logically equivalent transistor matrix is still used as the control store or microprogram or decode rom in many modern microprocessors at any one instant a single row of the diode matrix or transistor matrix is activated charge flows through each diode connected to that row that activates the column corresponding to each row the only activated control signals during that instant were those whose corresponding column wire was connected with a diode to that row a diode matrix rom was used in many computers in the 1960s and 70s as well as electronic desk calculators and keyboard matrix circuits for computer terminals a keyboard matrix circuit has a very similar grid of diodes but is used differently the microsequencer of many early computers perhaps starting with the whirlwind computer simply activated each row of the diode matrix in sequence and after the last row was activated started over again with the first row the technique of microprogramming as first described by maurice wilkes in terms of a second diode matrix added to a diode matrix control store later computers used a variety of alternative

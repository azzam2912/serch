it is an important part of the behavior of charge carrying fluids such as ionized gases classical plasmas electrolytes and charge carriers in electronic conductors semiconductors metals in a fluid with a given permittivity composed of electrically charged constituent particles each pair of particles with charges q and q interact through the coulomb force as where the vector r is the relative position between the charges this interaction complicates the theoretical treatment of the fluid for example a naive quantum mechanical calculation of the ground state energy density yields infinity which is unreasonable the difficulty lies in the fact that even though the coulomb force diminishes with distance as 1 r the average number of particles at each distance r is proportional to r assuming the fluid is fairly isotropic as a result a charge fluctuation at any one point has non negligible effects at large distances in reality these long range effects are suppressed by the flow of particles in response to electric fields this flow reduces the effective interaction between particles to a short range screened coulomb interaction this system corresponds to the simplest example of a renormalized interaction see sections 1 2 1 and 3 2 of

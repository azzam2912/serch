they include the risks of terrorist attack biosecurity risks such as the invasion of pests and extreme natural disasters such as major earthquakes the estimation of the probability of extreme events is difficult because of the lack of data they are events that have not yet happened or have happened only very rarely so relevant data are scarce thus standard statistical methods are generally inapplicable if there is some relevant data the probability of events at or beyond the range of the data may be estimated by the statistical methods of extreme value theory developed for such purposes as predicting 100 year floods from a limited range of data of past floods in such cases a mathematical function may be fitted to the data and extrapolated beyond the range of the data to estimate the probability of extreme events the results need to be treated with caution because of the possibility that the largest values in the past are unrepresentative and the possibility that the behavior of the system has changed in cases where the event of interest is very different from existing experience there may be no relevant guide in the past data nassim nicholas taleb argues in his

more specifically it is the torsion free metric connection i e the torsion free connection on the tangent bundle an affine connection preserving a given pseudo riemannian metric the fundamental theorem of riemannian geometry states that there is a unique connection which satisfies these properties in the theory of riemannian and pseudo riemannian manifolds the term covariant derivative is often used for the levi civita connection the components of this connection with respect to a system of local coordinates are called christoffel symbols the levi civita connection is named after tullio levi civita although originally discovered by elwin bruno christoffel levi civita along with gregorio ricci curbastro used christoffel s symbols to define the notion of parallel transport and explore the relationship of parallel transport with the curvature thus developing the modern notion of holonomy the levi civita notions of intrinsic derivative and parallel displacement of a vector along a curve make sense on an abstract riemannian manifold even though the original motivation relied on a specific embedding since the definition of the christoffel symbols make sense in any riemannian manifold in 1869 christoffel discovered that the components of the intrinsic derivative of a vector transform as the components of

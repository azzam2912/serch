natural prefix orders often occur when considering dynamical systems as a set of functions from time a totally ordered set to some phase space in this case the elements of the set are usually referred to as executions of the system the name prefix order stems from the prefix order on words which is a special kind of substring relation and because of its discrete character a tree a prefix order is a binary relation over a set p which is antisymmetric transitive reflexive and downward total i e for all a b and c in p we have that while between partial orders it is usual to consider order preserving functions the most important type of functions between prefix orders are so called history preserving functions given a prefix ordered set p a history of a point p p is the by definition totally ordered set p q q p a function f p q between prefix orders p and q is then history preserving if and only if for every p p we find f p f p similarly a future of a point p p is the prefix ordered set p q p q and f is

it is a first order method in time explicit in time and is conditionally stable when applied to the heat equation when used as a method for advection equations or more generally hyperbolic partial differential equation it is unstable unless artificial viscosity is included the abbreviation ftcs was first used by patrick roache the ftcs method is based on central difference in space and the forward euler method in time giving first order convergence in time and second order convergence in space for example in one dimension if the partial differential equation is then letting formula 2 the forward euler method is given by the function formula 4 must be discretized spatially with a central difference scheme this is an explicit method which means that formula 5 can be explicitly computed no need of solving a system of algebraic equations if values of formula 6 at previous time level formula 7 are known ftcs method is computationally inexpensive since the method is explicit the ftcs method is often applied to diffusion problems as an example for 1d heat equation the ftcs scheme is given by or letting formula 10 the ftcs method for one dimensional equations is numerically stable if

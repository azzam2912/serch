the primary endogenous agonists of the sympathetic nervous system are the catecholamines i e epinephrine adrenaline norepinephrine noradrenaline and dopamine which function as both neurotransmitters and hormones sympathomimetic drugs are used to treat cardiac arrest and low blood pressure or even delay premature labor among other things these drugs can act through several mechanisms such as directly activating postsynaptic receptors blocking breakdown and reuptake of certain neurotransmitters or stimulating production and release of catecholamines the mechanisms of sympathomimetic drugs can be direct acting direct interaction between drug and receptor such as adrenergic agonists adrenergic agonists and dopaminergic agonists or indirect acting interaction not between drug and receptor such as maois comt inhibitors release stimulants and reuptake inhibitors that increase the levels of endogenous catecholamines for maximum sympathomimetic activity a drug must have the structure can be modified to alter binding if the amine is primary or secondary it will have direct action but if the amine is tertiary it will have poor direct action also if the amine has bulky substituents then it will have greater beta adrenergic receptor activity but if the substituent is not bulky then it will favor the alpha adrenergic receptors direct stimulation of the and

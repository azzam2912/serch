tcag also operates as a science and technology innovation centre of genome canada with an emphasis on next generation sequencing ngs and bioinformatics support research at tcag focuses on the genetic and genomic basis of human variability health and disease including research on the genetics of autism spectrum disorder and structural variation of the human genome the centre is located in the peter gilgan centre for research and learning in downtown toronto canada the need for a centralized core facility for human genome research at sickkids hospital prompted the establishment of the centre for applied genomics tcag in 1998 the founding director and associate director were drs lap chee tsui and stephen w scherer respectively dr scherer is now the scientific director funding from the canada foundation for innovation cfi enabled tcag to form by consolidating existing core facilities including the medical research council of canada genome resource facility the canadian genetic diseases network cgdn large insert clone core the cgdn dna sequencing core and the sickkids biotechnology service dna sequencing and synthesis labs a genome wide microsatellite genotyping laboratory at the ottawa health research institute led by dr dennis bulman was added subsequently operational funding from the cihr genomics

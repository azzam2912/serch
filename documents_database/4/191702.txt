the term refers to a situation where two calabi yau manifolds look very different geometrically but are nevertheless equivalent when employed as extra dimensions of string theory mirror symmetry was originally discovered by physicists mathematicians became interested in this relationship around 1990 when philip candelas xenia de la ossa paul green and linda parkes showed that it could be used as a tool in enumerative geometry a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the number of solutions to geometric questions candelas and his collaborators showed that mirror symmetry could be used to count rational curves on a calabi yau manifold thus solving a longstanding problem although the original approach to mirror symmetry was based on physical ideas that were not understood in a mathematically precise way some of its mathematical predictions have since been proven rigorously today mirror symmetry is a major research topic in pure mathematics and mathematicians are working to develop a mathematical understanding of the relationship based on physicists intuition mirror symmetry is also a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory and it has been used to understand aspects of quantum field theory the formalism that physicists use to describe elementary particles major approaches to

the magnetic field varies along this tube in the center the field is low reaching at most 0 35 teslas the field rises to as high as 15 teslas at the ends this change in the strength is needed to reflect the particles and get them internally trapped see the magnetic mirror effect heating the plasma is heated using two methods simultaneously the first is neutral beam injection where a hot 25 kev neutral beam of material is shot into the machine at a rate of 5 megawatts the second is electron cyclotron resonance heating which is where electromagnetic waves are used to heat a plasma analogous to microwaving it performance as of 2016 the machine had achieved a plasma trapping beta of 0 6 for 5 milliseconds it had reached an electron temperature of 1 kev using the method of electron cyclotron resonance heating it had reached an ion density of 1 10 ions m the machine loses material out of the ends of the mirror but material is replenished at such a rate as to maintain a density inside the machine during any given experiment operators can choose from at least 15 fusion diagnostics to measure the machines

it depends on the body s mass distribution and the axis chosen with larger moments requiring more torque to change the body s rotation rate it is an extensive additive property for a point mass the moment of inertia is just the mass times the square of the perpendicular distance to the rotation axis the moment of inertia of a rigid composite system is the sum of the moments of inertia of its component subsystems all taken about the same axis its simplest definition is the second moment of mass with respect to distance from an axis for bodies constrained to rotate in a plane only their moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the plane a scalar value matters for bodies free to rotate in three dimensions their moments can be described by a symmetric 3 3 matrix with a set of mutually perpendicular principal axes for which this matrix is diagonal and torques around the axes act independently of each other when a body is free to rotate around an axis torque must be applied to change its angular momentum the amount of torque needed to cause any given angular acceleration the rate of change in angular

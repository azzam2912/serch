genome sequencing and comparison have revealed the existence of four tensin genes in humans these genes appear to be related by ancient instances of gene duplication tensin binds to actin filaments and contains a phosphotyrosine binding ptb domain at the c terminus which interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of integrins these interactions allow tensin to link actin filaments to integrin receptors several factors induce tyrosine phosphorylation of tensin thus tensin functions as a platform for assembly and disassembly of signaling complexes at focal adhesions by recruiting tyrosine phosphorylated signaling molecules and also by providing interaction sites for other proteins haynie by contrast argues in a review of tensin structure and function that experimental evidence for the specific association of tensin with actin filaments is inconclusive at best it is beyond reasonable doubt however that tensin 1 tensin 2 and tensin 3 each contains a protein tyrosine phosphatase ptp domain near the n terminus the ptp domain is unlikely to be active in tensin 1 owing to mutation of the essential nucleophilic cysteine in the signature motif to asparagine nevertheless phosphatidylinositol 3 4 5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase the well studied tumor suppressor that is better known as pten gets its name

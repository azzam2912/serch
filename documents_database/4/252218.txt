it compares the rate of energy being generated by fusion reactions within the fusion fuel to the rate of energy losses to the environment when the rate of production is higher than the rate of loss and enough of that energy is captured by the system the system is said to be ignited the concept was first developed by john d lawson in a classified 1955 paper and published openly in 1957 as originally formulated the lawson criterion gives a minimum required value for the product of the plasma electron density n and the energy confinement time formula 1 that leads to net energy output later analysis suggested that a more useful figure of merit is the triple product of density confinement time and plasma temperature t the triple product also has a minimum required value and the name lawson criterion may refer to this inequality the central concept of the lawson criterion is an examination of the energy balance for any fusion power plant using a hot plasma this is shown below net power efficiency fusion radiation loss conduction loss lawson calculated the fusion rate by assuming that the fusion reactor contains a hot plasma cloud which has a

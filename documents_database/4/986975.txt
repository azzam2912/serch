the process preserves all the information in the original signal less that which is lost to rounding errors in the mathematical processes the input and output signals can be real or complex samples often the ddc converts from the raw radio frequency or intermediate frequency down to a complex baseband signal a ddc consists of three subcomponents a direct digital synthesizer dds a low pass filter lpf and a downsampler which may be integrated into the low pass filter the dds generates a complex sinusoid at the intermediate frequency if multiplication of the intermediate frequency with the input signal creates images centered at the sum and difference frequency which follows from the frequency shifting properties of the fourier transform the lowpass filters pass the difference i e baseband frequency while rejecting the sum frequency image resulting in a complex baseband representation of the original signal assuming judicious choice of if and lpf bandwidth the complex baseband signal is mathematically equivalent to the original signal in its new form it can readily be downsampled and is more convenient to many dsp algorithms any suitable low pass filter can be used including fir iir and cic filters the most common choice is

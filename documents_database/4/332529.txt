they appear to have over 95 of their mass as non baryonic dark matter there appears to be no supernova activity in these galaxies rotation curve measurements indicate an extremely high mass to light ratio meaning that stars and luminous gas contribute only very little to the overall mass balance of an lsb the centers of lsbs show no large overdensities in stars unlike e g the bulges of normal spiral galaxies therefore they seem to be dark matter dominated even in their centers which makes them excellent laboratories for the study of dark matter in comparison to the high surface brightness galaxies lsbs are mainly isolated field galaxies found in regions devoid of other galaxies in their past they had fewer tidal interactions or mergers with other galaxies which could have triggered enhanced star formation this is an explanation for the small stellar content lsb galaxies were theorized to exist in 1976 by mike disney giant low surface brightness glsb galaxies are among the most massive known spiral galaxies in the universe they have very faint stellar disks that are very rich in neutral hydrogen but low in star formation and thus low in surface brightness such galaxies often

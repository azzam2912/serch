in may 2009 amd replaced sse5 with three smaller instruction set extensions named as xop fma4 and f16c which retain the proposed functionality of sse5 but encode the instructions differently for better compatibility with intel s proposed avx instruction set the three sse5 derived instruction sets were introduced in the bulldozer processor core released in october 2011 on a 32 nm process amd s sse5 extension bundle does not include the full set of intel s sse4 instructions making it a competitor to sse4 rather than a successor this complicates software development it is recommended practice for a program to test for the presence of instruction set extensions by means of the cpuid instruction before entering a code path which depends upon those instructions to function correctly for maximum portability an optimized application will require three code paths a base code path for compatibility with older processors from either vendor a separately optimized intel code path exploiting sse4 or avx and a separately optimized amd code path exploiting sse5 due to this proliferation benchmarks between intel and amd processors increasingly reflect the cleverness or implementation quality of the divergent code paths rather than the strength of the underlying platform the

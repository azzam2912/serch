it functions by using a segmented recharging road that induces a current in pick up modules on the vehicle olev is the first public transport system that used a recharging road and was first launched on march 9 2010 by the korea advanced institute of science and technology kaist the olev system is split into two main parts the segmented recharging road and the pick up modules on the vehicle in the recharging road slim w shaped ferrite cores magnetic cores used in induction are buried 30 cm underground in a fish bone like structure power cables are wrapped around the center of the fish bone structures to make the primary coils this design combines the magnetic fields of the two sides of the cables and shapes the fields in a way that maximizes induction moreover the primary coils are placed in segments across certain spans of the road so that only about 5 to 15 of the road needs to be remodeled to power the primary coils the cables are attached to the south korean national power grid through a power inverter the inverter accepts 60 hz 3 phase 380 or 440 voltage from the grid to generate 20

it is widely referred to a fluorescent derivative of glucose and it is used in cell biology to visualize uptake of glucose by cells cells that have taken up the compound fluoresce green 2 nbdg is similar to radiolabeled glucose in that both can be used to detect glucose transport unlike radiolabeled glucose 2 nbdg is compatible with fluorescence techniques such as a fluorescent microscopy flow cytometry and fluorimetry the compound is taken up by a variety of mammalian plant and microbial cells in mammalian cells one transporter for 2 nbdg is glut2 in bacterial cells the predominant transporter is the mannose phosphotransferase system cells that lack these or other compatible transporters do not take up 2 nbdg like glucose 2 nbdg is transported according to michaelis menten kinetics however transport of 2 nbdg has a lower v maximum rate and thus the rate of transport is generally slower than glucose once taken up the compound is metabolized to a non fluorescent derivative as shown in escherichia coli the identity and further metabolism of this non fluorescent derivative has not been established

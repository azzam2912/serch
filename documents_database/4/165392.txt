the serum level of calcium is closely regulated within a fairly limited range in the human body in a healthy physiology extracellular calcium levels are maintained within a tight range through the actions of parathyroid hormone vitamin d and the calcium sensing receptor disorders in calcium metabolism can lead to hypocalcemia decreased plasma levels of calcium or hypercalcemia elevated plasma calcium levels hypocalcemia is common and can occur unnoticed with no symptoms or in severe cases can have dramatic symptoms and be life threatening hypocalcemia can be parathyroid related or vitamin d related parathyroid related hypocalcemia includes post surgical hypoparathyroidism inherited hypoparathyroidism pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudo pseudohypoparathyroidism post surgical hypoparathyroidism is the most common form and can be temporary due to suppression of tissue after removal of a malfunctioning gland or permanent if all parathyroid tissue has been removed inherited hypoparathyroidism is rare and is due to a mutation in the calcium sensing receptor pseudohypoparathyroidism is maternally inherited and is categorized by hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia finally pseudo pseudohypoparathyroidism is paternally inherited patients display normal parathyroid hormone action in the kidney but exhibit altered parathyroid hormone action in the bone vitamin d related hypocalcemia may be associated with a lack of vitamin

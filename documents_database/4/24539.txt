besides this important role in early development reelin continues to work in the adult brain it modulates synaptic plasticity by enhancing the induction and maintenance of long term potentiation it also stimulates dendrite and dendritic spine development and regulates the continuing migration of neuroblasts generated in adult neurogenesis sites like subventricular and subgranular zones it is found not only in the brain but also in the liver thyroid gland adrenal gland fallopian tube breast and in comparatively lower levels across a range of anatomical regions reelin has been suggested to be implicated in pathogenesis of several brain diseases the expression of the protein has been found to be significantly lower in schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder but the cause of this observation remains uncertain as studies show that psychotropic medication itself affects reelin expression moreover epigenetic hypotheses aimed at explaining the changed levels of reelin expression are controversial total lack of reelin causes a form of lissencephaly reelin may also play a role in alzheimer s disease temporal lobe epilepsy and autism reelin s name comes from the abnormal reeling gait of reeler mice which were later found to have a deficiency of this brain protein and were homozygous for

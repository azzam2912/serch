a thermodynamical approach to the high energy collisions first proposed by e fermi the partition function of the fireballs can be written in two forms one in terms of its density of states formula 1 and the other in terms of its mass spectrum formula 2 the self consistency principle says that both forms must be asymptotically equivalent for energies or masses sufficiently high asymptotic limit also the density of states and the mass spectrum must be asymptotically equivalent in the sense of the weak constraint proposed by hagedorn as these two conditions are known as the self consistency principle or bootstrap idea after a long mathematical analysis hagedorn was able to prove that there is in fact formula 4 and formula 5 satisfying the above conditions resulting in and with formula 8 and formula 9 related by then the asymptotic partition function is given by where a singularity is clearly observed for formula 12 formula 13 this singularity determines the limiting temperature formula 14 in hagedorn s theory which is also known as hagedorn temperature hagedorn was able not only to give a simple explanation for the thermodynamical aspect of high energy particle production but also worked out a

however it does have a strong relationship to the icosidodecahedron an archimedean solid most evident is the cluster of three pentagons and four triangles on one side of the solid if these faces are aligned with a congruent patch of faces on the icosidodecahedron then the hexagonal face will lie in the plane midway between two opposing triangular faces of the icosidodecahedron the triangular hebesphenorotunda also has clusters of faces that can be aligned with corresponding faces of the rhombicosidodecahedron there are three such clusters each consisting of a square and two antipodal triangles adjacent to the square the faces around each 3 5 vertex can also be aligned with the corresponding faces of various diminished icosahedra the triangular hebesphenorotunda is the only johnson solid with faces of 3 4 5 and 6 sides the coordinates of the triangular hebesphenorotunda are where formula 10 is the golden ratio these coordinates produce a triangular hebesphenorotunda with edge length 2 resting on the xy plane and having its 3 fold axis of symmetry aligned to the z axis a second inverted triangular hebesphenorotunda can be obtained by negating the second and third coordinates of each point this second polyhedron will be joined

ests may be used to identify gene transcripts and are instrumental in gene discovery and in gene sequence determination the identification of ests has proceeded rapidly with approximately 74 2 million ests now available in public databases e g genbank 1 january 2013 all species an est results from one shot sequencing of a cloned cdna the cdnas used for est generation are typically individual clones from a cdna library the resulting sequence is a relatively low quality fragment whose length is limited by current technology to approximately 500 to 800 nucleotides because these clones consist of dna that is complementary to mrna the ests represent portions of expressed genes they may be represented in databases as either cdna mrna sequence or as the reverse complement of the mrna the template strand one can map ests to specific chromosome locations using physical mapping techniques such as radiation hybrid mapping happy mapping or fish alternatively if the genome of the organism that originated the est has been sequenced one can align the est sequence to that genome using a computer the current understanding of the human set of genes includes the existence of thousands of genes based solely on est evidence

sfrps act as soluble modulators of wnt signaling sfrp1 and sfrp5 may be involved in determining the polarity of photoreceptor cells in the retina sfrp1 is expressed in several human tissues with the highest levels in the heart the secreted frizzled related protein sfrp family consists of five secreted glycoproteins in humans sfrp1 sfrp2 sfrp3 sfrp4 sfrp5 that act as extracellular signaling ligands each sfrp is 300 amino acids in length and contains a cysteine rich domain crd that shares 30 50 sequence homology with the crd of frizzled fz receptors sfrps are able to bind wnt proteins and fz receptors in the extracellular compartment the interaction between sfrps and wnt proteins prevents the latter from binding the fz receptors sfrps are also able to downregulate wnt signaling by the formation of an inhibitory complex with the frizzled receptors the wnt pathway plays a key role in embryonic development cell differentiation and cell proliferation it has been shown that the deregulation of this critical developmental pathway occurs in several human tumor entities sfrp1 is a 35 kda prototypical member of the sfrp family it acts as a biphasic modulator of wnt signaling counteracting wnt induced effects at high concentrations and

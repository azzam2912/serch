flash pans are found on gonnes matchlocks wheellocks snaplocks snaphances and flintlocks the flash pan was at first attached to the gun barrel but was later moved to the lock plate of the gun a small amount of finely ground gunpowder is placed in the flash pan and ignited the flash of flame travels through the touch hole igniting the main charge of propellant inside the barrel unlike the cannon it was not necessary or desirable to place priming in the touch hole itself the flash alone and not particles of burning powder was enough to ignite the main charge the ignition of the main charge from the flash pan was not a guaranteed operation however and sometimes it failed in those cases the spark would flash in the pan but the gun would fail to fire this led by the end of the 17th century to the expression flash in the pan to mean a failure after a brief and showy start or momentary sensation of no real importance

it was popular in europe during the late renaissance and early baroque periods a virginal is a smaller and simpler rectangular or polygonal form of harpsichord with only one string per note running more or less parallel to the keyboard on the long side of the case many if not most of the instruments were constructed without legs and would be placed on a table for playing later models were built with their own stands the mechanism of the virginals is identical to the harpsichord s in that its wire strings are plucked by plectra mounted in jacks its case however is rectangular or polygonal and the single choir of strings one per note runs roughly parallel to the keyboard the strings are plucked either at one end as with the harpsichord or in the case of the muselar nearer the middle producing a richer flute like tone the origin of the name is obscure it may derive from the latin virga meaning a rod perhaps referring to the wooden jacks that rest on the ends of the keys but this is unproven another possibility is that the name derives from the word virgin as it was most commonly played

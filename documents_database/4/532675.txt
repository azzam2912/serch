a shifting mechanism allows selection of the appropriate gear ratio for efficiency or comfort under the prevailing circumstances for example it may be comfortable to use a high gear when cycling downhill a medium gear when cycling on a flat road and a low gear when cycling uphill different gear ratios and gear ranges are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling a cyclist s legs produce power optimally within a narrow pedalling speed range or cadence gearing can be optimized to use this narrow range as efficiently as possible as in other types of transmissions the gear ratio is closely related to the mechanical advantage of the drivetrain of the bicycle on single speed bicycles and multi speed bicycles using derailleur gears the gear ratio depends on the ratio of the number of teeth on the chainring to the number of teeth on the rear sprocket cog for bicycles equipped with hub gears the gear ratio also depends on the internal planetary gears within the hub for a shaft driven bicycle the gear ratio depends on the bevel gears used at each end of the shaft for a bicycle to travel at the same speed using a lower

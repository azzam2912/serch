these textures can then be used as inputs to other shaders or as texture maps applied to 3d models introduced by opengl 2 0 and direct3d 9 mrt can be invaluable to real time 3d applications such as video games before the advent of mrt a programmer would have to issue a command to the gpu to draw the 3d scene once for each render target texture resulting in redundant vertex transformations which in a real time program expected to run as fast as possible can be quite time consuming with mrt a programmer creates a pixel shader that returns an output value for each render target this pixel shader then renders to all render targets with a single draw command a common use of mrt is deferred shading a shading process which unlike forward shading performs lighting calculations on an entire 3d scene at once instead of on each individual object to do this in real time mrt is used to store the required information for the lighting calculations in multiple render targets which are then used after the entire scene has been drawn to calculate the lit final image typically one render target holds color and surface information

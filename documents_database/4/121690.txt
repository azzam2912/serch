intuitively marginal cost at each level of production includes the cost of any additional inputs required to produce the next unit at each level of production and time period being considered marginal costs include all costs that vary with the level of production whereas other costs that do not vary with production are fixed and thus have no marginal cost for example the marginal cost of producing an automobile will generally include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile but not the fixed costs of the factory that have already been incurred in practice marginal analysis is segregated into short and long run cases so that over the long run all costs including fixed costs become marginal where there are economies of scale prices set at marginal cost will fail to cover total costs thus requiring a subsidy marginal cost pricing is not a matter of merely lowering the general level of prices with the aid of a subsidy with or without subsidy it calls for a drastic restructuring of pricing practices with opportunities for very substantial improvements in efficiency at critical points if the cost function formula 1 is continuous and differentiable the marginal cost

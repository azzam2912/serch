these may be interpreted as multiplicativity for the norms on the complex numbers quaternions and octonions respectively the hurwitz problem for the field k is to find general relations of the form with the z being bilinear forms in the x and y that is each z is a k linear combination of terms of the form x y we call a triple r s n admissible for k if such an identity exists trivial cases of admissible triples include r s rs the problem is uninteresting for k of characteristic 2 since over such fields every sum of squares is a square and we exclude this case it is believed that otherwise admissibility is independent of the field of definition hurwitz posed the problem in 1898 in the special case r s n and showed that when coefficients are taken in c the only admissible values n n n were n 1 2 4 8 his proof extends to any field of characteristic not 2 the hurwitz radon problem is that of finding admissible triples of the form r n n obviously 1 n n is admissible the hurwitz radon theorem states that n n n is admissible over

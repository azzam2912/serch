it was launched on 15 november 1972 into the low earth orbit with a periapsis of 443 km and an apoapsis of 632 km it completed its observations on 8 june 1973 sas 2 was the second in the series of small spacecraft designed to extend the astronomical studies in the x ray gamma ray ultraviolet visible and infrared regions the primary objective of the sas b was to measure the spatial and energy distribution of primary galactic and extragalactic gamma radiation which energies between 20 and 300 mev the instrumentation consisted principally of a guard scintillation detector an upper and a lower spark chamber and a charged particle telescope sas 2 was launched from the san marco platform off the coast of malindi kenya into a nearly equatorial orbit the orbiting spacecraft was in the shape of a cylinder approximately 59 cm in diameter and 135 cm in length four solar paddles were used to recharge the 6 amp h nickel cadmium battery and provide power to the spacecraft and telescope experiment the spacecraft was spin stabilized and a magnetically torqued commandable control system was used to point the spin axis of the spacecraft to any position in space

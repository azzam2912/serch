geological survey usgs dlgs are collected from usgs maps and are distributed in large intermediate and small scale with up to nine different categories of features depending on the scale they come in optional and spatial data transfer standard sdts format and are topologically structured for use in mapping and geographic information system gis applications dlgs are normally derived from usgs maps or usgs map related sources dlgs are distributed at three different scales large scale which normally correspond to the usgs 7 5 by 7 5 minute 1 24 000 and 1 25 000 scale topographic quadrangle map series 1 63 360 scale for alaska and 1 30 000 scale for puerto rico intermediate scale which are derived from the usgs 30 by 60 minute 1 100 000 scale map series and small scale which are derived from the usgs 1 2 000 000 scale sectional maps of the national atlas of the united states large scale dlgs are usually cast on the universal transverse mercator coordinate system utm but are sometimes cast on the state plane rectangular coordinate system intermediate scale dlgs are sold in 30 by 30 minute sections that correspond to the east or west half

stability of a discrete lti system requires that its characteristic polynomials obtained from its difference equation its dynamic matrix or appearing as the denominator of its transfer function is a stable polynomial where formula 2 is said to be stable if all its zeros are inside the unit circle viz where formula 4 the test determines whether formula 5 is stable algebraically i e without numerical determination of the zeros the method also solves the full zero location zl problem namely it can count the number of inside the unit circle iuc zeros formula 6 on the unit circle zeros uc zeros formula 7 and outside the unit circle ouc zeros formula 8 for any real or complex polynomial the bistritz test is the discrete equivalent of routh criterion used to test stability of continuous lti systems this title was introduced soon after its presentation it has been also recognized to be more efficient than previously available stability tests for discrete systems like the schur cohn and the jury test in the following the focus is only on how to test stability of a real polynomial however as long as the basic recursion needed to test stability remains valid zl

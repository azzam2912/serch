the system is a three step classification exposure reference and slope rock mass classification with conversion factors between the three steps depending on existing and future weathering and damage due to method of excavation the stability of a slope is expressed as probability for different failure mechanisms a rock mass is classified following a standardized set of criteria in one or more exposures exposure classification these values are converted per exposure to a reference rock mass by compensating for the degree of weathering in the exposure and the method of excavation that was used to make the exposure i e the reference rock mass values are not influenced by local influences such as weathering and method of excavation a new slope can then be designed in the reference rock mass with compensation for the damage due to the method of excavation to be used for making the new slope and compensation for deterioration of the rock mass due to future weathering the slope rock mass if the stability of an already existing slope is assessed the exposure and slope rock mass values are the same the failure mechanisms are divided in orientation dependent and orientation independent orientation dependent failure mechanisms

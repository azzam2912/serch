taking l n to be the hardy space h the toeplitz algebra consists of elements of the form where t is a toeplitz operator with continuous symbol and k is a compact operator toeplitz operators with continuous symbols commute modulo the compact operators so the toeplitz algebra can be viewed as the c algebra extension of continuous functions on the circle by the compact operators this extension is called the toeplitz extension by atkinson s theorem an element of the toeplitz algebra t k is a fredholm operator if and only if the symbol f of t is invertible in that case the fredholm index of t k is precisely the winding number of f the equivalence class of f in the fundamental group of the circle this is a special case of the atiyah singer index theorem wold decomposition characterizes proper isometries acting on a hilbert space from this together with properties of toeplitz operators one can conclude that the toeplitz algebra is the universal c algebra generated by a proper isometry this is coburn s theorem

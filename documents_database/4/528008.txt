he did additional graduate work at the university of strasbourg and the university of leipzig where he studied under chemist wilhelm ostwald buckingham received a phd from leipzig in 1893 he worked at the usda bureau of soils from 1902 to 1906 as a soil physicist he worked at the us national bureau of standards now the national institute of standards and technology or nist 1906 1937 his fields of expertise included soil physics gas properties acoustics fluid mechanics and blackbody radiation he is also the originator of the buckingham theorem in the field of dimensional analysis in 1923 buckingham published a report which voiced skepticism that jet propulsion would be economically competitive with prop driven aircraft at low altitudes and at the speeds of that period buckingham s first work on soil physics is on soil aeration particularly the loss of carbon dioxide from the soil and its subsequent replacement by oxygen from his experiments he found that the rate of gas diffusion in soil was not dependent significantly on the soil structure compactness or water content of the soil using an empirical formula based on his data buckingham was able to give the diffusion coefficient as a function

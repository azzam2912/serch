many of the tools used in woodworking have steel blades which are sharpened to a fine edge a cutting edge is created on the blade at the point at which two surfaces of the blade meet to create this cutting edge a bevel is formed on the blade usually by grinding this bevel is subsequently refined by honing until a satisfactorily sharp edge is created the purpose of the sharpening jig is to hold the blade or tool at the desired angle while grinding or honing the bevel in some cases the angle of the bevel is critical to the performance of the cutting edge a jig allows for repeatability of this angle over a number of sharpening sessions there are many styles of jig available commercially fundamentally all jigs are similar in that they allow the user to clamp the blade or tool in some way the jig then has some means of referencing the clamped blade to the grinding or honing apparatus so that the bevel angle is maintained one of the more common approaches is to have the jig ride on a roller these types of jigs are usually used with a sharpening stone or plate such

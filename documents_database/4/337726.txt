electrodes dtl silver nylon fiber string are usually placed on the surface of the cornea for full field global multifocal erg s and brass copper electrodes are placed on the skin near the eye for eog type testing during a recording the patient s eyes are exposed to standardized stimuli and the resulting signal is displayed showing the time course of the signal s amplitude voltage signals are very small and typically are measured in microvolts or nanovolts the erg is composed of electrical potentials contributed by different cell types within the retina and the stimulus conditions flash or pattern stimulus whether a background light is present and the colors of the stimulus and background can elicit stronger response from certain components if a dim flash erg is performed on a dark adapted eye the response is primarily from the rod system flash ergs performed on a light adapted eye will reflect the activity of the cone system sufficiently bright flashes will elicit ergs containing an a wave initial negative deflection followed by a b wave positive deflection the leading edge of the a wave is produced by the photoreceptors while the remainder of the wave is produced by a

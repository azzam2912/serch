the transition happened approximately 1 25 0 7 million years ago in the pleistocene epoch before the mpt the glacial cycles were dominated by a 41 000 year periodicity with low amplitude thin ice sheets and a linear relationship to the milankovitch forcing from axial tilt after the mpt there have been strongly asymmetric cycles with long duration cooling of the climate and build up of thick ice sheets followed by a fast change from extreme glacial conditions to a warm interglacial the cycle lengths have varied with an average length of approximately 100 000 years the mid pleistocene transition was long a problem to explain as described in the article 100 000 year problem the mpt can now be reproduced by numerical models that include a decreasing level of atmospheric carbon dioxide and gradual removal of regoliths from northern hemisphere areas that have been subject to glacial processes during the quaternary the reduction in may be related to changes in volcanic outgassing burial of ocean sediments carbonate weathering or iron fertilization of oceans from glacially induced dust before the quaternary northern north america and northern eurasia are believed to have been covered by thick layers of regoliths which have

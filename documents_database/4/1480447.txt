as with the miliolidae the chambers are arranged in various planes with two chambers per whorl in quinqueloculins the chambers are in planes set 72 degrees apart but successive chambers are in planes separated by 144 degrees the name quinqueloculina comes from quinque the latin for five in quinqueloculina five chambers are exposed to view on the outside although the earlier three are sandwiched between the later two one on one side two on the other chambers are generally long and tubular normally without integral floors that function made by the underlying chamber some 30 or more species of quinqueloculina have been named quinqueloculina is found in abundance around the coasts of the uk high concentrations of one species of quinqueloculina within the celtic sea are interpreted as a seasonal indicator of strong vertical mixing in that water body in an experiment trends in diversity abundance and taxonomic composition of live foraminiferal assemblages were analyzed to replicate corer samples collected at the porcupine abyssal plain over a thirteen year period conclusions found that the miliolid quinqueloculina sp was virtually absent in multicore samples from 1989 to 1994 peaked in september 1996 22 when degraded phytodetritus was present on core surfaces

however other routes to 2d materials exist the early approaches of cleaving multi layer graphite into single layers or growing it epitaxially by depositing a layer of carbon onto another material have been supplemented by numerous alternatives in all cases the graphite must bond to some substrate to retain its 2d shape as of 2014 exfoliation produced graphene with the lowest number of defects and highest electron mobility andre geim and konstantin novoselov initially used adhesive tape to split graphite into graphene achieving single layers typically requires multiple exfoliation steps each producing a slice with fewer layers until only one remains after exfoliation the flakes are deposited on a silicon wafer crystallites larger than 1 mm and visible to the naked eye can be obtained in this method a sharp single crystal diamond wedge penetrates onto the graphite source to exfoliate layers this method uses highly ordered pyrolytic graphite hopg as the starting material the experiments were supported by molecular dynamic simulations p boehm reported producing monolayer flakes of reduced graphene oxide in 1962 rapid heating of graphite oxide and exfoliation yields highly dispersed carbon powder with a few percent of graphene flakes reduction of graphite oxide monolayer films e

the predatory behavior of this nematode presents the opportunity to use it as a bio control agent against other plant parasitic nematodes it has been shown to have a preference for the second stage juveniles of meloidogyne incognita m fortidens may be found in decomposing organic manure morphological features include lips with setose papillae large amphid aperatures and a mobile claw like tooth the female is diovarial and amphidelphic while the male is without bursa and has nine pairs of genital papillae the tails of both the male and female are filiform m fortidens prefers small slow moving prey once they ve pierced the cuticle they feed by cutting and sucking or swallowing their prey whole they have also been shown to aggregate and feed from prey in groups this positive aggregation response may be in part due to prey secretions attractions that m fortidens senses other factors affecting attraction include prey number temperature starvation and distance between predator and prey bilgrami and jairajpuri found that attraction to prey improved when prey number increased and when m fortidens was starved for 12 days predation of meloidogyne incognita by m fortidens plateaued at temperatures between 30 and 35 c the use

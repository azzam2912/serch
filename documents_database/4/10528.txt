it encodes a message signal as variations in the instantaneous phase of a carrier wave phase modulation is one of the two principal forms of angle modulation together with frequency modulation the phase of a carrier signal is modulated to follow the changing signal level amplitude of the message signal the peak amplitude and the frequency of the carrier signal are maintained constant but as the amplitude of the message signal changes the phase of the carrier changes correspondingly phase modulation is widely used for transmitting radio waves and is an integral part of many digital transmission coding schemes that underlie a wide range of technologies like wi fi gsm and satellite television pm is used for signal and waveform generation in digital synthesizers such as the yamaha dx7 to implement fm synthesis a related type of sound synthesis called phase distortion is used in the casio cz synthesizers pm changes the phase angle of the complex envelope in direct proportion to the message signal if m t is the message signal to be transmitted and the carrier onto which the signal is modulated is then the modulated signal is this shows how formula 3 modulates the phase the greater

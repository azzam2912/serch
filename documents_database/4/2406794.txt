similarly the parallel to the side formula 8 through formula 2 intersects the side formula 4 in formula 13 and the side formula 14 in formula 15 the theorem of the gnomon now states that the parallelograms formula 16 and formula 17 have equal areas gnomon is the name for the l shaped figure consisting of the two overlapping parallelograms formula 18 and formula 19 the parallelograms of equal area formula 16 and formula 17 are called complements of the parallelograms on diagonal formula 22 and formula 23 the proof of the theorem is surprisingly easy if one considers the areas of the main parallelogram and the two inner parallelograms around its diagonal the theorem of the gnomon can be used to construct a new parallelogram or rectangle of equal area to a given parallelogram or rectangle by the means of straightedge and compass constructions this also allows the representation of a division of two numbers in geometrical terms an important feature to reformulate geometrical problems in algebraic terms more precisely if two numbers are given as lengths of line segments one can construct a third line segment the length of which matches the quotient of those two numbers see

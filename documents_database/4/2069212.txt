research has shown that a main cause of veining is thermal expansion of the silica sand in combination with reduction in sand volume above 573c after the alpha to beta silica phase transformation due to softening sintering and or melting of sand grains which results in cracking voids veining can be reduced or avoided by the use of more refractory non silica sands zircon chromite etc by flux additives which lower the temperature of silica transition to tridymite or cristobalite or which sinter the sand increasing resistance to failure or by organic additives which are decomposed to carbon at high temperature which then bonds to silica increasing strength imparting veining resistance

these probes can be generally considered as antennas although with different characteristics in fact probes should not perturb the electromagnetic field and must prevent coupling and reflection as much as possible in order to obtain precise results there are two main types of emf measurements emf probes may respond to fields only on one axis or may be tri axial showing components of the field in three directions at once amplified active probes can improve measurement precision and sensitivity but their active components may limit their speed of response measurements of the emf are obtained using an e field sensor or h field sensor which can be isotropic or mono axial active or passive a mono axial omnidirectional probe is a device which senses the electric short dipole or magnetic field linearly polarized in a given direction using a mono axial probe implies the need for three measurements taken with the sensor axis set up along three mutually orthogonal directions in a x y z configuration as an example it can be used as a probe which senses the electric field component parallel to the direction of its axis of symmetry in these conditions where e is the amplitude of

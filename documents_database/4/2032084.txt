typically the structure is cast monolithically making the structure continuous from deck to foundation the connections between members are rigid connections which transfer bending moment axial forces and shear forces a bridge design consisting of a rigid frame can provide significant structural benefits but can also be difficult to design and or construct the use of rigid frame bridges began in germany in the early twentieth century and quickly spread to the americas em lio henrique baumgart and arthur g hayden in particular gained notoriety for their use of concrete rigid frames in the early 1920s at the time reinforced concrete was commonly used in bridge design but the superstructure was designed with bearings on the substructure in concrete rigid frame design there are no bearings instead the superstructure is cast monolithically with the substructure and the entire bridge from deck to footing is continuous engineers have found this type of design advantageous for many reasons moments at the center of the deck of a rigid frame bridge are smaller than the corresponding moments in a simply supported deck therefore a much shallower cross section at mid span can be used additional benefits are that less space is required for

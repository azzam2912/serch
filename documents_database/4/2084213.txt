it is around 14 000 light years away near the faint open cluster hogg 15 the binary contains a wolf rayet star and is also known as wr 47 cd cru is composed of two massive and highly luminous stars aligned so that they eclipse each other as they orbit every 6 days and 6 hours one is a hot blue o type main sequence star of spectral type o5v that is 57 times as massive as the sun while the other is an even hotter wolf rayet star of spectral type wn6 that is 48 times as massive as the sun the wr star dominates the spectrum but is less bright so which star is considered the primary varies for clarity the components are referred to as wr and o hogg 15 is a small faint open cluster that has been calculated to lie about 4 2 kpc away cd cru is considered a likely member of the cluster in which case it would be the brightest member by over a magnitude it lies outside the central two arc minute condensation of the cluster but well within the outer bounds discovered for the member stars the cluster is calculated

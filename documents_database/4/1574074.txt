the unit of time is usually one hour and the measurement is made in the early morning before the rising sun evaporates the dew when the apparatus is made self registering the surface with its accumulating dew hangs at one end of a delicate balance or from a delicate spiral metallic spring and by its gradual sinking moves the index that makes the record on a moving sheet of paper although many forms have been suggested yet none have been considered to give results that are comparable with each other from day to day owing largely to the fact that the slightest change in the surface that receives the moisture alters the quantity of dew that is caught even the same bit of wool when used day after day changes its nature in this respect if a metallic surface is used its behavior must be compared frequently with a standard partly because different metals have different properties but principally because the same surface when it becomes greasy dirty or scratched has different properties many peculiarities of the deposition of dew on different objects are explained in detail in the popular work by charles tomlinson entitled the dew drop and the

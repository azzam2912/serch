it is visible to the naked eye on a dark night with an apparent visual magnitude of 4 25 the distance to this star based upon an annual parallax shift of 0 00402 arcseconds is roughly 810 light years eri is classified in the general catalogue of variable stars as a beta cephei variable the aavso international variable star index defines a leri type of variation eri is classified as leri gcas since it shows both short term periodic variations and longer timescale eruptive variation it was one of the first stars where short period variations were found the line profile variability periods are 0 702d and 0 269d with intermittently present periods of 0 6d and 0 75d the photometric amplitude of the variation is 0 010 magnitude this is a giant or subgiant be star with a stellar classification of b2 ivne or b2 iii e p depending on the source it is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 327 km s compare this to the estimated break up velocity of 440 km s this rotation is giving the star an oblate shape with an equatorial bulge that is 25 larger than the polar radius the

the mir 34 family members were discovered computationally and later verified experimentally the precursor mirna stem loop is processed in the cytoplasm of the cell with the predominant mir 34 mature sequence excised from the 5 arm of the hairpin in mammals three mir 34 precursors are produced from two transcriptional units the human mir 34a precursor is transcribed from chromosome 1 the mir 34b and mir 34c precursors are co transcribed from a region on chromosome 11 apparently as part of a transcript known as bc021736 expression of mir34a gene in mouse is observed in all tissues examined but is highest in brain mir 34b and c are relatively less abundant in most tissues but are the predominant mir 34 species in lung the presence of mir 34 products has also been confirmed in embryonic stem cells mir 34 has been shown to be maternally inherited in drosophila and zebrafish and the loss of mir 34 resulted in defects in hindbrain development in zebrafish embryos this was the first report of knockdown phenotype of mir 34 in any model organism although the phenotype was observed in only about 30 of zebrafish embryos yamakuchi et al showed that mir 34a

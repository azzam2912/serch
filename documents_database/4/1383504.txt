prior to version 7 two main versions of the library existed chipmunk2d free was written purely in c99 and freely available under the terms of the mit license chipmunk2d pro was a proprietary upgrade designed for development on mobile devices it included several high level subroutines in objective c and floating point optimizations for the arm processor however after version 7 the project was fully open sourced aside from objective c there are official bindings for ruby and third party interfaces exist for python haskell ocaml and others chipmunk is endorsed by a number of game libraries including aerosol gosu and cocos2d chipmunk supports multiple collision primitives attached to one rigid body and bodies may be joined by constraints it has a flexible collision detection system with layers exclusion groups and collision callbacks callbacks are defined based on user definable collision types and may reject collisions and even override the calculation of friction and elasticity coefficients version 7 of the library introduced autogeometry an image tracing feature that transforms a raster graphic into a polygonal shape usable by the library this feature is currently only available in the objective c version of the library chipmunk has been widely used on

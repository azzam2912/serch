it takes its name from the porcupine hills of southwestern alberta and was first described in outcrop by george mercer dawson in 1883 the porcupine hills formation is composed primarily of mudstones siltstones and sandstones the sediments were derived from the canadian cordillera during tectonic uplift and erosion in the late stages of the laramide orogeny and were transported eastward by river systems and deposited in fluvial and floodplain environments the mudstones are characterized by well developed paleosols and caliche nodules and the sandstones are cross bedded and cemented with calcite in contrast to the paskapoo formation an equivalent formation farther to the north there are no coaly beds this has given rise to the hypothesis that during the deposition of the porcupine hills formation the climate was semi arid while the climate farther north was more humid the porcupine hills formation is present in southwestern alberta from the waterton river near the canada us border in the south to the bow river near calgary in the north the upper limit is the present day erosional surface so its original thickness can not be determined however the maximum recorded thickness is in the porcupine hills the porcupine hills formation is

the encoded protein may play a role in single stranded dna repair mutations in this gene have been associated with ataxia ocular apraxia multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene however the full length nature of some variants has not been determined aprataxin removes amp from dna ends following abortive ligation attempts by dna ligase iv during non homologous end joining thereby permitting subsequent attempts at ligation ataxia oculomotor apraxia 1 is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in the aptx gene that encodes aprataxin the neurological disorder appears to be caused by the gradual accumulation of unrepaired dna strand breaks resulting from abortive dna ligation events aptx mutant mice have been generated but they lack an obvious phenotype another mouse model was generated in which a mutation of superoxide dismutase i sod1 is expressed in an aptx mouse the sod1 mutation causes a reduction in transcription recovery following oxidative stress these mice showed accelerated cellular senescence this study also demonstrated a protective role of aptx in vivo and suggested that the loss of aptx function results in progressive accumulation of dna breaks in the nervous system triggering hallmarks of systemic premature aging see dna

that library was a starting point and it has been deeply modified and improved idea1 is composed of accurate models for each of the nodes hardware devices sensor microcontroller radio frequency transceiver and energy module network simulator ns 2 is used in the same research field but for higher level validations protocols routing ns 2 is more focused on these high levels whereas idea1 has more hardware phy details for example accurate power and latency indeed idea1 is composed of measurement validated models in hardware that include electrical power energy and delays for several hardware devices 3 sensors 2 microcontrollers 3 radio frequency devices models are based on finite state machines that include timing for processing communications and electrical consumption it has been developed for 433 mhz and 2 4 ghz ieee 802 15 4 radio frequency devices but will be extended for multimedia applications these low level models are used to simulate wireless sensor networks at high network level it permits to explore design space in order to best choose hardware devices and ieee 802 15 4 mode idea1 is currently developed at the lyon institute of nanotechnology inl france related papers can be found in and in

the power spectral density of the noise is expressed in terms of the temperature in kelvins that would produce that level of johnson nyquist noise thus where thus the noise temperature is proportional to the power spectral density of the noise formula 6 that is the power that would be absorbed from the component or source by a matched load noise temperature is generally a function of frequency unlike that of an ideal resistor which is simply equal to the actual temperature of the resistor at all frequencies a noisy component may be modelled as a noiseless component in series with a noisy voltage source producing a voltage of v or as a noiseless component in parallel with a noisy current source producing a current of i this equivalent voltage or current corresponds to the above power spectral density formula 7 and would have a mean squared amplitude over a bandwidth b of where r is the resistive part of the component s impedance or g is the conductance real part of the component s admittance speaking of noise temperature therefore offers a fair comparison between components having different impedances rather than specifying the noise voltage and qualifying that number

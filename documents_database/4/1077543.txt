this definition includes brown dwarfs and former stars similar to ef eridani b and can also include objects of planetary mass regardless of their formation mechanism and whether or not they are associated with a primary star assuming that a substellar object has a composition similar to the sun s and at least the mass of jupiter approximately 10 solar masses its radius will be comparable to that of jupiter approximately 0 1 solar radii regardless of the mass of the substellar object brown dwarfs are less than 75 jupiter masses this is because the center of such a substellar object at the top range of the mass just below the hydrogen burning limit is quite degenerate with a density of 10 g cm but this degeneracy lessens with decreasing mass until at the mass of jupiter a substellar object has a central density less than 10 g cm the density decrease balances the mass decrease keeping the radius approximately constant substellar objects like brown dwarfs do not have enough mass to fuse hydrogen and helium hence do not undergo the usual stellar evolution that limits the lifetime of stars a substellar object with a mass just below the hydrogen

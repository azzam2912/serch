although dcl1 is named for its homology with the metazoan protein dicer its role in mirna biogenesis is somewhat different due to substantial differences in mirna maturation processes between plants and animals unlike dicer dcl1 is localized to the cell nucleus where it initiates mirna processing as the catalytic component of the so called dicing complex which also contains hyl1 a double stranded rna binding protein and a zinc finger protein known as se or serrate within the nucleus dicing complexes co localize in dicing bodies or d bodies in plants dcl1 is responsible both for processing a primary mirna to a pre mirna and for then processing the pre mirna to a mature mirna in animals the equivalents of these two steps are carried out by different proteins pri mirna processing takes place in the nucleus by the ribonuclease drosha as part of the microprocessor complex and processing to a mature mirna takes place in the cytoplasm by dicer to yield a mature mirna although dcl1 is responsible for the majority of the mirna processing in plants most plants contain an additional three members of the same family dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 with related roles in rna processing

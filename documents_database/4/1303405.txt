in 1997 it was successfully nominated as a unesco biosphere reserve the lake is linked to the mekong river by the tonl sap river from november until june the lake flows into the mekong however each year during the rainy season mid june late october the mekong river is inundated with rain waters its lower delta becomes flooded and cannot flow into the sea quickly enough to eliminate all the excess water this causes the mekong river to rise enough to reverse the flow of the tonl sap river causing it to flow back into the lake the lake expands from 2500 km to more than 16 000 km creating an enormous wetland area this wetland area supports a tremendous amount of biodiversity including plants reptiles mammals birds and other animals many of these are known to be rare or endangered these wetlands are also an important breeding area for fish from the lake and mekong river both siamese crocodiles crocodylus siamensis and saltwater crocodiles crocodylus porosus once occurred side by side in the lake and there is thought to be inter species breeding amongst the crocodiles found in the floating farms on the western part of the lake in

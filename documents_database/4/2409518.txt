sutton is an american engineering professor he is carolina distinguished professor and distinguished professor emeritus of mechanical engineering at the university of south carolina columbia he served as chairperson of mechanical engineering and chair of the university tenure and promotion committee sutton is the author of more than 230 journal articles he is most known for his contributions to the invention development and validation of the non contacting image based deformation measurement methods known as digital image correlation methods or dic in the early 1980s sutton and his co workers invented the first dic method known as two dimensional dic or 2d dic this method is applicable for surface measurements on planar specimens undergoing nominally in plane deformation while working with nasa researchers as part of the us aging aircraft program sutton showed that crack tip opening displacement or the more general mixed mode form using three dimensional crack tip displacements is a valid crack growth predictor for the thin aerospace aluminum alloy components such as 2024 t3 and 2424 t3 commonly used in commercial aviation their research led to the establishment of an astm standard test method for determining resistance to stable crack extension under low constraint conditions this

for most spaces that are considered in practice namely for all those that satisfy the t separation axiom this preorder is even a partial order called the specialization order on the other hand for t spaces the order becomes trivial and is of little interest the specialization order is often considered in applications in computer science where t spaces occur in denotational semantics the specialization order is also important for identifying suitable topologies on partially ordered sets as is done in order theory consider any topological space x the specialization preorder on x relates two points of x when one lies in the closure of the other however various authors disagree on which direction the order should go what is agreed is that if where cl y denotes the closure of the singleton set y i e the intersection of all closed sets containing y we say that x is a specialization of y and that y is a generization of x this is commonly written using a wavy arrow such as the one given by the command leadsto in the amssymb latex package leading from y to x unfortunately the property x is a specialization of y is alternatively

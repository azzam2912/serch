critical to the realization of cnt mmc possessing optimal properties in these areas are the development of synthetic techniques that are a economically producible b provide for a homogeneous dispersion of nanotubes in the metallic matrix and c lead to strong interfacial adhesion between the metallic matrix and the carbon nanotubes since the development of cnt mmc is still in the research phase the current focus is primarily on improving these latter two areas according to the new production systems carbon nanotubes reinforced metal matrix composites cnt mmc may be produced in several different methods these production methods are powder metallurgy route technics electrochemical routes for non structural applications thermal spraying melt processing novel techniques indigenous techniques sintering is one of the oldest method in production technics and used to produce density controlled materials and components from metal or ceramic powders by applying thermal energy their promising properties the high active surface area of nanopowders results in lowering sintering temperature relative to coarser powders although low temperature sintering suppresses the grain growth high density of interfaces and grain boundaries in nanocrystalline powders leads to accelerated grain growth during sintering one common method to disperse the cnt into the metal matrix

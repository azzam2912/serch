as the infected cancer cells are destroyed by oncolysis they release new infectious virus particles or virions to help destroy the remaining tumour oncolytic viruses are thought not only to cause direct destruction of the tumour cells but also to stimulate host anti tumour immune system responses the potential of viruses as anti cancer agents was first realised in the early twentieth century although coordinated research efforts did not begin until the 1960s a number of viruses including adenovirus reovirus measles herpes simplex newcastle disease virus and vaccinia have been clinically tested as oncolytic agents most current oncolytic viruses are engineered for tumour selectivity although there are naturally occurring examples such as reovirus and the senecavirus resulting in clinical trials the first oncolytic virus to be approved by a national regulatory agency was genetically unmodified echo 7 strain enterovirus rigvir approved in latvia in 2004 for the treatment of skin melanoma it was subsequently approved in georgia and armenia an oncolytic adenovirus a genetically modified adenovirus named h101 was approved in china in 2005 for the treatment of head and neck cancer in 2015 talimogene laherparepvec oncovex t vec an oncolytic herpes virus which is a modified herpes simplex virus

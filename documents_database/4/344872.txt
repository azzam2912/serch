since electric current is invisible and the processes at play in electronics are often difficult to demonstrate the various electronic components are represented by hydraulic equivalents electricity as well as heat was originally understood to be a kind of fluid and the names of certain electric quantities such as current are derived from hydraulic equivalents as with all analogies it demands an intuitive and competent understanding of the baseline paradigms electronics and hydraulics there is no unique paradigm for establishing this analogy two paradigms can be used to introduce the concept to students using pressure induced by gravity or by pumps in the version with pressure induced by gravity large tanks of water are held up high or are filled to differing water levels and the potential energy of the water head is the pressure source this is reminiscent of electrical diagrams with an up arrow pointing to v grounded pins that otherwise are not shown connecting to anything and so on this has the advantage of associating electric potential with gravitational potential a second paradigm is a completely enclosed version with pumps providing pressure only and no gravity this is reminiscent of a circuit diagram with a voltage source

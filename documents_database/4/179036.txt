it is approximately the energy equivalent of burning often referred to as 1 ccf of natural gas since natural gas meters measure volume and not energy content a therm factor is used by natural gas companies to convert the volume of gas used to its heat equivalent and thus calculate the actual energy use the therm factor is usually expressed in units of therms per ccf it will vary with the mix of hydrocarbons in the natural gas natural gas with a higher than average concentration of ethane propane or butane will have a higher therm factor impurities such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen lower the therm factor the volume of the gas is calculated as if measured at standard temperature and pressure stp one therm is equal to about megajoules kilocalories or kilowatt hours one therm can also be provided by about of natural gas the therm sometimes has been confused with the thermie the names of both units come from the greek word for heat 10 therms are known as a decatherm sometimes dekatherm commonly abbreviated dth which is btu of whichever type further common abbreviations are mdth for a decatherms and mmdth for decatherms united kingdom regulations

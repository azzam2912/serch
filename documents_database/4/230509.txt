he was the first to use mass spectrometry to isolate uranium 235 which was used to demonstrate that u could undergo fission and developed the sector mass spectrometer configuration now known as nier johnson geometry he was born in st paul minnesota on may 28 1911 nier showed an early ability in mathematics and science coupled with an aptitude for craft and mechanical work nier s german immigrant parents had little education or financial resources but their determination for his development meant that he was able to attend the nearby university of minnesota though he graduated in electrical engineering in 1931 the lack of engineering jobs during the great depression encouraged him to take up graduate study in physics in 1936 his spectroscopic skills won him a fellowship and substantial grant at harvard university his work there led to the 1938 publication of measurements of the relative abundance of the isotopes of uranium measurements that were used by fritz houtermans and arthur holmes in the 1940s to estimate the age of the earth nier returned to minnesota in 1938 to be near his ageing parents in 1940 on the request of enrico fermi he and a few students including edward

note that formula 5 for any non zero scalar c recall that a hermitian or real symmetric matrix is diagonalizable with only real eigenvalues it can be shown that for a given matrix the rayleigh quotient reaches its minimum value formula 6 the smallest eigenvalue of m when x is formula 7 the corresponding eigenvector similarly formula 8 and formula 9 the rayleigh quotient is used in the min max theorem to get exact values of all eigenvalues it is also used in eigenvalue algorithms such as rayleigh quotient iteration to obtain an eigenvalue approximation from an eigenvector approximation the range of the rayleigh quotient for any matrix not necessarily hermitian is called a numerical range and coincides with its spectrum when the matrix is hermitian the numerical range is equal to the spectral norm still in functional analysis formula 10 is known as the spectral radius in the context of c algebras or algebraic quantum mechanics the function that to m associates the rayleigh ritz quotient r m x for a fixed x and m varying through the algebra would be referred to as vector state of the algebra in quantum mechanics the rayleigh quotient gives the expectation value

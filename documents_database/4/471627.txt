if the stops were immediately followed by t or s they changed to voiceless fricatives spirants under normal conditions any voiced stop would likely have been devoiced before and during proto indo european times and so all three indo european series of stop consonants aspirated voiced and voiceless had already merged before those two consonants therefore for example and had already become and in some of the late proto indo european dialects likewise and had become and compare for example latin scribere to write and legere to gather read with their past participles scriptus and lectus cases before are also numerous as can be noticed by comparing latin scribere and its perfect scrips or pingere to paint and pinx and also the genitive noun form regis and its nominative r x king the specifically germanic part of the change in which the first plosive became a fricative but not the following it seems to have been just an exception to grimm s law under the normal operation of the law voiceless plosives become fricatives in germanic however if two plosives stood next to each other the first became a fricative by grimm s law if it was not so already

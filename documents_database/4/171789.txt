in electronic engineering and control theory step response is the time behaviour of the outputs of a general system when its inputs change from zero to one in a very short time the concept can be extended to the abstract mathematical notion of a dynamical system using an evolution parameter from a practical standpoint knowing how the system responds to a sudden input is important because large and possibly fast deviations from the long term steady state may have extreme effects on the component itself and on other portions of the overall system dependent on this component in addition the overall system cannot act until the component s output settles down to some vicinity of its final state delaying the overall system response formally knowing the step response of a dynamical system gives information on the stability of such a system and on its ability to reach one stationary state when starting from another instead of frequency response system performance may be specified in terms of parameters describing time dependence of response the step response can be described by the following quantities related to its time behavior in the case of linear dynamic systems much can be inferred about the

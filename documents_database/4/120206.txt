it is a clamping device suppressing all overvoltages above its breakdown voltage it automatically resets when the overvoltage goes away but absorbs much more of the transient energy internally than a similarly rated crowbar device a transient voltage suppression diode may be either unidirectional or bidirectional a unidirectional device operates as a rectifier in the forward direction like any other avalanche diode but is made and tested to handle very large peak currents a bidirectional transient voltage suppression diode can be represented by two mutually opposing avalanche diodes in series with one another and connected in parallel with the circuit to be protected while this representation is schematically accurate physically the devices are now manufactured as a single component a transient voltage suppression diode can respond to over voltages faster than other common over voltage protection components such as varistors or gas discharge tubes gdt the actual clamping occurs in roughly one picosecond but in a practical circuit the inductance of the wires leading to the device imposes a higher limit this makes transient voltage suppression diodes useful for protection against very fast and often damaging voltage transients these fast over voltage transients are present on all distribution networks and

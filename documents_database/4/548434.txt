this means that the chief rays oblique rays that pass through the center of the aperture stop are parallel to the optical axis in front of or behind the system respectively the simplest way to make a lens telecentric is to put the aperture stop at one of the lens s focal points an entrance pupil at infinity makes the lens object space telecentric such lenses are used in machine vision systems because image magnification is independent of the object s distance or position in the field of view an exit pupil at infinity makes the lens image space telecentric such lenses are used with image sensors that do not tolerate a wide range of angles of incidence for example a three ccd color beamsplitter prism assembly works best with a telecentric lens and many digital image sensors have a minimum of color crosstalk and shading problems when used with telecentric lenses if both pupils are at infinity the lens is double telecentric or bi telecentric non telecentric lenses exhibit varying magnification for objects at different distances from the lens most lenses are entocentric objects further away have lower magnification for pericentric lenses objects further away have higher magnification the

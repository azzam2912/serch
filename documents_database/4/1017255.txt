being a spatial dispersion effect the induced optical activity exhibit different behavior under the operation of wave vector reversal when compared with the faraday effect the optical activity increment associated with the electrogyration effect changes its sign under that operation contrary to the faraday effect formally it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the magnetic permeability tensor is diagonal the electrogyration effect linear in the electric field occurs in crystals of all point groups of symmetry except for the three cubic m3m 432 and formula 1 the effect proportional to the square of the electric field can exist only in crystals belonging to acentric point groups of symmetry the changes in the optical activity sign induced by the external electric field have been observed for the first time in ferroelectric crystals lih seo by h futama and r pepinsky in 1961 while switching enantiomorphous ferroelectric domains the change in the point symmetry group of the crystal being 2 m m the observed phenomenon has been explained as a consequence of specific domain structure a replacement of optic axes occurred under the switching rather than the electrogyration induced by spontaneous polarization the first description of electrogyration effect induced by

the field is divided into three major branches automata theory and languages computability theory and computational complexity theory which are linked by the question what are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers in order to perform a rigorous study of computation computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers called a model of computation there are several models in use but the most commonly examined is the turing machine computer scientists study the turing machine because it is simple to formulate can be analyzed and used to prove results and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible reasonable model of computation see church turing thesis it might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute but any decidable problem solved by a turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory so in principle any problem that can be solved decided by a turing machine can be solved by a computer that has a finite amount of memory the theory of computation can be considered the creation of models of all kinds in the field of computer science therefore mathematics and logic are used in the last century it became

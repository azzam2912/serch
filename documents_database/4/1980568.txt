after completing his bachelor s and master s degrees at university of cambridge in 2009 maynard obtained his d phil from university of oxford at balliol college in 2013 under the supervision of roger heath brown for the 2013 2014 year maynard was a crm ism postdoctoral researcher at the university of montreal in 2017 he was appointed research professor at oxford in november 2013 maynard gave a different proof of yitang zhang s theorem that there are bounded gaps between primes and resolved a longstanding conjecture by showing that for any formula 1 there are infinitely many intervals of bounded length containing formula 1 prime numbers this work can be seen as progress on the hardy littlewood formula 1 tuples conjecture as it establishes that a positive proportion of admissible formula 1 tuples satisfy the prime formula 1 tuples conjecture for every formula 1 maynard s approach yielded the upper bound which improved significantly upon the best existing bounds due to the polymath8 project in other words he showed that there are infinitely many prime gaps with size of at most 600 subsequently polymath8b was created whose collaborative efforts have reduced the gap size to 252 on 14 april

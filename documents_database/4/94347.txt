it is composed of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule the renal corpuscle consists of a tuft of capillaries called a glomerulus and an encompassing bowman s capsule the renal tubule extends from the capsule the capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen a healthy adult has 0 8 to 1 5 million nephrons in each kidney blood is filtered as it passes through three layers the endothelial cells of the capillary wall its basement membrane and between the foot processes of the podocytes of the lining of the capsule the tubule has adjacent peritubular capillaries that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule as the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged some are added others are removed first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary this process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances at the end of the tubule the remaining fluid urine

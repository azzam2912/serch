with an apparent visual magnitude of 3 56 it is the brightest star in this rather dim constellation it has an annual parallax shift of 17 56 mas as measured from earth indicating delta crateris lies at a distance of 163 4 light years from the sun this is an evolved orange hued giant star belonging to the spectral class k0 iii delta crateris is a member of the so called red clump indicating that it is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of helium at its core the star has an estimated 1 56 times the mass of the sun but has expanded to times the sun s radius the metallicity of the star what astronomers term the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium is only 33 that of the sun it is around 2 89 billion years old with a rotation rate that is too small to measure the projected rotational velocity is 0 0 km s delta crateris is radiating as much luminosity as the sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of k

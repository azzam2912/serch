incremental search has been studied at least since the late 1960s incremental search algorithms reuse information from previous searches to speed up the current search and solve search problems potentially much faster than solving them repeatedly from scratch similarly heuristic search has also been studied at least since the late 1960s heuristic search algorithms often based on a use heuristic knowledge in the form of approximations of the goal distances to focus the search and solve search problems potentially much faster than uninformed search algorithms the resulting search problems sometimes called dynamic path planning problems are graph search problems where paths have to be found repeatedly because the topology of the graph its edge costs the start vertex or the goal vertices change over time so far three main classes of incremental heuristic search algorithms have been developed all three classes of incremental heuristic search algorithms are different from other replanning algorithms such as planning by analogy in that their plan quality does not deteriorate with the number of replanning episodes incremental heuristic search has been extensively used in robotics where a larger number of path planning systems are based on either d typically earlier systems or d lite current

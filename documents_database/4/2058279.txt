this protein is member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family proteins a group of proteins that are thought to be involved in the development of the nervous system the nbpf1 gene in humans is located on the minus strand of 1p36 3 in humans and is 51179 base pairs long including exons and introns it is located between the protein coding genes necap2 and crocc nbpf1 is one of the 26 known members of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family genes and pseudogenes the nbpf2 pseudogene and nbpf3 gene are the most similar genes located close to nbpf1 and they reside on the chromosomal location 1p36 12 most members of the nbpf gene family are located on chromosomal location 1q21 1 1q23 3 in humans and these genes are more similar to each other in sequence than they are to nbpf1 the transcript for nbpf1 in humans is a 6183 base pair mrna that is made of 28 exons there are more than 14 alternative splicing forms of nbpf1 predicted but only seven of the splice forms have been observed out of all of the possible transcripts only two are known to code proteins one of these transcripts is 1139 amino acids long

specifically it is a hydroxylase and is one of the most studied enzymes and catalyzes reactions involved in soil detoxification metabolism and other biosynthetic processes 4 hydroxybenzoate 3 monooygenase catalyzes the regioselective hydroxylation of 4 hydroxybenzoate giving 3 4 dihydroxybenzoate as the product the mechanism consists of the following general steps 1 reduction of the flavin 2 reaction of the flavin with o producing c4a hydroperoxyflavin and 3 binding and activation of the substrate leading to product formation and release throughout the mechanism the flavin changes between open and closed conformations thus altering the substrate reaction environment the open conformation allows solvent access to the active site the enzyme adopts this conformation for substrate binding and product release a closed conformation isolates the reaction from solvent which helps to stabilize the reaction intermediates 4 hydroxybenzoate 3 monooxygenase is a homodimer with a flavin bound to each monomer the active site is composed of the flavin and amino acids on the monomer the structure of this enzyme often serves as a model for structure reactivity interdependence of other flavin dependent hydroxylases the active site limits potential substrates to substituted benzenes namely 4 hydroxybenzoate the native substrate 2 4 dihydroxybenzoate 4 mercaptobenzoate

dual problems only contain binary constraints and are therefore solvable by algorithms tailored for such problems the join graphs and join trees of a constraint satisfaction problem are graphs representing its dual problem or a problem obtained from the dual problem removing some redundant constraints the dual problem of a constraint satisfaction problem contains a variable for each constraint of the original problem its domains and constraints are built so to enforce a sort of equivalence to the original problem in particular the domain of a variable of the dual problem contains one element for each tuple satisfying the corresponding original constraint this way a dual variable can take a value if and only if the corresponding original constraint is satisfied by the corresponding tuple the constraints of the dual problem forbid two dual variables to take values that correspond to two incompatible tuples without these constraints one dual variable may take the value corresponding to the tuple formula 1 while another dual variable takes the value corresponding to formula 2 which assigns a different value to formula 3 more generally the constraints of the dual problem enforce the same values for all variables shared by two constraints if two

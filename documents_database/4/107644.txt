the a20 line in particular is used to transmit the 21st bit on the address bus a microprocessor typically has a number of addressing lines equal to the base two logarithm of its physical addressing space for example a processor with 4 gb of byte addressable physical space requires 32 lines which are named a0 through a31 the lines are named after the zero based number of the bit in the address that they are transmitting the least significant bit is first and is therefore numbered bit 0 and signaled on line a0 a20 transmits bit 20 the 21st bit and becomes active once addresses reach 1 mb or 2 the intel 8086 intel 8088 and intel 80186 processors had 20 address lines numbered a0 to a19 with these the processor can access 2 bytes or 1 mb internal address registers of such processors only had 16 bits to access a 20 bit address space an external memory reference was made up of a 16 bit offset address added to a 16 bit segment number shifted 4 bits so as to produce a 20 bit physical address the resulting address is equal to segment 16 offset there are many combinations

a universal graph of this type was first constructed by richard rado and is now called the rado graph or random graph more recent work has focused on universal graphs for a graph family that is an infinite graph belonging to f that contains all finite graphs in for instance the henson graphs are universal in this sense for the clique free graphs a universal graph for a family of graphs can also refer to a member of a sequence of finite graphs that contains all graphs in for instance every finite tree is a subgraph of a sufficiently large hypercube graph so a hypercube can be said to be a universal graph for trees however it is not the smallest such graph it is known that there is a universal graph for vertex trees with only vertices and edges and that this is optimal a construction based on the planar separator theorem can be used to show that vertex planar graphs have universal graphs with edges and that bounded degree planar graphs have universal graphs with edges it is also possible to construct universal graphs for planar graphs that have vertices sumner s conjecture states that tournaments are universal

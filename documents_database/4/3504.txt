formally it is the time difference obtained by subtracting universal time ut defined by the earth s rotation from terrestrial time tt independent of the earth s rotation the value of t for the start of 1902 is approximately zero for 2002 it is about 64 seconds so the earth s rotations over that century took about 64 seconds longer than would be required for days of atomic time the earth s rotational speed is and a day corresponds to one period a rotational acceleration gives a rate of change of the period of which is usually expressed as this has units of 1 time and is commonly quoted as milliseconds per day per century written as ms day cy understood as ms day cy integrating gives an expression for t against time universal time is a time scale based on the earth s rotation which is somewhat irregular over short periods days up to a century thus any time based on it cannot have an accuracy better than 1 in 10 however a larger more consistent effect has been observed over many centuries earth s rate of rotation is inexorably slowing down this observed change in the rate of

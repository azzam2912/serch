it is a black solid that is produced by treating nickel ii salts with hydrogen sulfide many nickel sulfides are known including the mineral millerite which also has the formula nis aside from being useful ores nickel sulfides are the products of desulfurization reactions and are sometimes used as catalysts nonstoichiometric forms of nickel sulfide are known e g nis and nis like many related materials nickel sulfide adopts the nickel arsenide motif in this structure nickel is octahedral and the sulfide centers are in trigonal prismatic sites nickel sulfide has two allotropes the alpha form has a hexagonal unit cell while the beta form has a rhombohedral cell the alpha phase is stable at temperatures above and converts into the beta phase at lower temperatures that phase transition causes an increase in volume by 2 4 the precipitation of solid black nickel sulfide is a mainstay of traditional qualitative inorganic analysis schemes which begins with the separation of metals on the basis of the solubility of their sulfides such reactions are written many other more controlled methods have been developed including solid state metathesis reactions from nicl and nas and high temperature reactions of the elements the mineral millerite

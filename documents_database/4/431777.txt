for example the largest amount that cannot be obtained using only coins of 3 and 5 units is 7 units the solution to this problem for a given set of coin denominations is called the frobenius number of the set the frobenius number exists as long as the set of coin denominations has no common divisor greater than 1 there is an explicit formula for the frobenius number when there are only two different coin denominations x and y xy x y if the number of coin denominations is three or more no explicit formula is known but for any fixed number of coin denominations there is an algorithm computing the frobenius number in polynomial time in the logarithms of the coin denominations forming an input no known algorithm is polynomial time in the number of coin denominations and the general problem where the number of coin denominations may be as large as desired is np hard in mathematical terms the problem can be stated this largest integer is called the frobenius number of the set a a a and is usually denoted by g a a a the requirement that the greatest common divisor gcd equal 1 is necessary

fourteen radioactive isotopes radioisotopes have also been found so far with atomic masses ranging from 10 to 25 and one nuclear isomer n all of these radioisotopes are short lived with the longest lived one being nitrogen 13 with a half life of 9 965 minutes all of the others have half lives below 7 15 seconds with most of these being below 620 milliseconds most of the isotopes with atomic mass numbers below 14 decay to isotopes of carbon while most of the isotopes with masses above 15 decay to isotopes of oxygen the shortest lived known isotope is nitrogen 10 with a half life of about 200 yoctoseconds nitrogen 14 is one of two stable non radioactive isotopes of the chemical element nitrogen which makes about 99 636 of natural nitrogen nitrogen 14 is one of the very few stable nuclides with both an odd number of protons and of neutrons seven each and is the only one to make up a majority of its element each of proton or neutron contributes a nuclear spin of plus or minus spin 1 2 giving the nucleus a total magnetic spin of one like all elements heavier than lithium the

the later pen ft added a single stroke film advance and an uncoupled integrated light meter which used a system of exposure numbers rather than f stops the exposure numbers were added to the aperture rings of later pen f lenses the rings could be pulled out and rotated to show conventional f stops instead a side effect of the ft s light meter was a dimmer viewfinder the pen fv was essentially a pen ft with the light meter deleted and the f s brighter viewfinder reinstated half frame meant that the camera used an 18 24 mm vertical portrait format producing twice the pictures on a roll of 135 film as the regular 36 24 mm format the smaller image format also allowed for a smaller camera and lenses making the pen f system one of the smallest slr systems ever made the pentax auto 110 was smaller but with a much more limited range of lenses and accessories and smaller 110 film these cameras were somewhat exceptional since they used a rotary focal plane shutter rather than the two curtain focal plane shutter commonly used in other slrs since this one piece shutter opens fully before it

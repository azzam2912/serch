the best approximation can be defined as that which minimises the difference between the original function and the approximation for a least squares approach the quality of the approximation is measured in terms of the squared differences between the two a generalization to approximation of a data set is the approximation of a function by a sum of other functions usually an orthogonal set with the set of functions formula 2 an orthonormal set over the interval of interest see also fej r s theorem the coefficients formula 3 are selected to make the magnitude of the difference as small as possible for example the magnitude or norm of a function over the can be defined by where the denotes complex conjugate in the case of complex functions the extension of pythagoras theorem in this manner leads to function spaces and the notion of lebesgue measure an idea of space more general than the original basis of euclidean geometry the satisfy orthonormality relations where is the kronecker delta substituting function into these equations then leads to the n dimensional pythagorean theorem the coefficients a making f f as small as possible are found to be the generalization of the n

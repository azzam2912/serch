the nramp family is a member of the large apc superfamily of secondary carriers homologues of this family are found in various yeasts plants animals archaea and gram negative and gram positive bacteria termed natural resistance associated macrophage proteins because one of the animal homologues plays a role in resistance to intracellular bacterial pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium leishmania donovani and mycobacterium bovis the natural history of slc11 genes in vertebrates has been discussed by neves et al 2011 proposed to be a distant member of the apc superfamily several human pathologies may result from defects in nramp dependent fe or mn transport including iron overload neurodegenerative diseases and innate susceptibility to infectious diseases humans and rodents possess two distinct nramps the broad specificity nramp2 dmt1 which transports a range of divalent metal cations transports fe and h with a 1 1 stoichiometry and apparent affinities of 6 m and about 1 m respectively variable h fe stoichiometry has also been reported the order of substrate preference for nramp2 is fe zn mn co ca cu ni pb many of these ions can inhibit iron absorption mutation of nramp2 in rodents leads to defective endosomal iron export within

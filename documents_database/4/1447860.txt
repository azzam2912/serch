t tutte it has chromatic number 3 chromatic index 3 girth 4 and diameter 8 the tutte graph is a cubic polyhedral graph but is non hamiltonian therefore it is a counterexample to tait s conjecture that every 3 regular polyhedron has a hamiltonian cycle published by tutte in 1946 it is the first counterexample constructed for this conjecture other counterexamples were found later in many cases based on grinberg s theorem from a small planar graph called the tutte fragment w t tutte constructed a non hamiltonian polyhedron by putting together three such fragments the compulsory edges of the fragments that must be part of any hamiltonian path through the fragment are connected at the central vertex because any cycle can use only two of these three edges there can be no hamiltonian cycle the resulting graph is 3 connected and planar so by steinitz theorem it is the graph of a polyhedron it has 25 faces it can be realized geometrically from a tetrahedron the faces of which correspond to the four large nine sided faces in the drawing three of which are between pairs of fragments and the fourth of which forms the exterior by multiply truncating

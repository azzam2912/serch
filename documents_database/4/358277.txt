in a 1 2 shift the movement involves two adjacent atoms but moves over larger distances are possible in the example below the substituent r moves from carbon atom c to c the rearrangement is intramolecular and the starting compound and reaction product are structural isomers the 1 2 rearrangement belongs to a broad class of chemical reactions called rearrangement reactions a rearrangement involving a hydrogen atom is called a 1 2 hydride shift if the substituent being rearranged is an alkyl group it is named according to the alkyl group s anion i e 1 2 methanide shift 1 2 ethanide shift etc a 1 2 rearrangement is often initialised by the formation of a reactive intermediate such as the driving force for the actual migration of a substituent in step two of the rearrangement is the formation of a more stable intermediate for instance a tertiary carbocation is more stable than a secondary carbocation and therefore the s1 reaction of neopentyl bromide with ethanol yields tert pentyl ethyl ether carbocation rearrangements are more common than the carbanion or radical counterparts this observation can be explained on the basis of h ckel s rule a cyclic carbocationic transition state

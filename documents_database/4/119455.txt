rounding and truncation are typical examples of quantization processes quantization is involved to some degree in nearly all digital signal processing as the process of representing a signal in digital form ordinarily involves rounding quantization also forms the core of essentially all lossy compression algorithms the difference between an input value and its quantized value such as round off error is referred to as quantization error a device or algorithmic function that performs quantization is called a quantizer an analog to digital converter is an example of a quantizer because quantization is a many to few mapping it is an inherently non linear and irreversible process i e because the same output value is shared by multiple input values it is impossible in general to recover the exact input value when given only the output value the set of possible input values may be infinitely large and may possibly be continuous and therefore uncountable such as the set of all real numbers or all real numbers within some limited range the set of possible output values may be finite or countably infinite the input and output sets involved in quantization can be defined in a rather general way for example

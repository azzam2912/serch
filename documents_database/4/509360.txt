examples include the map from a wedge of circles to a single circle where the map is a homeomorphism on each circle in algebraic geometry the term branched covering is used to describe morphisms formula 1 from an algebraic variety formula 2 to another one formula 3 the two dimensions being the same and the typical fibre of formula 1 being of dimension 0 in that case there will be an open set formula 5 of formula 3 for the zariski topology that is dense in formula 3 such that the restriction of formula 1 to formula 5 from formula 10 to formula 5 that is is unramified depending on the context we can take this as local homeomorphism for the strong topology over the complex numbers or as an tale morphism in general under some slightly stronger hypotheses on flatness and separability generically then such a morphism resembles a covering space in the topological sense for example if formula 2 and formula 3 are both riemann surfaces we require only that formula 1 is holomorphic and not constant and then there is a finite set of points formula 15 of formula 3 outside of which we do find an

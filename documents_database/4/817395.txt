examples of bit depth include compact disc digital audio which uses 16 bits per sample and dvd audio and blu ray disc which can support up to 24 bits per sample in basic implementations variations in bit depth primarily affect the noise level from quantization error thus the signal to noise ratio snr and dynamic range however techniques such as dithering noise shaping and oversampling mitigate these effects without changing the bit depth bit depth also affects bit rate and file size bit depth is only meaningful in reference to a pcm digital signal non pcm formats such as lossy compression formats do not have associated bit depths a pcm signal is a sequence of digital audio samples containing the data providing the necessary information to reconstruct the original analog signal each sample represents the amplitude of the signal at a specific point in time and the samples are uniformly spaced in time the amplitude is the only information explicitly stored in the sample and it is typically stored as either an integer or a floating point number encoded as a binary number with a fixed number of digits the sample s bit depth the resolution indicates the number of

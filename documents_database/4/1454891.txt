sinotyrannus is known from a single incomplete fossil specimen including a partial skull from the early cretaceous jiufotang formation of liaoning china though it is not much younger than primitive tyrannosauroids such as dilong it is similar in size to later forms such as tyrannosaurus it was much larger than contemporary tyrannosauroids reaching a total estimated length of it is the largest known theropod from the jiufotang formation the type species is s kazuoensis described by ji et al in 2009 the holotype of sinotyrannus is kzv 001 a disarticulated partial skeleton including the front portion of the skull three dorsal vertebrae the incomplete ilia three articulated manual phalanges including an ungual and other fragmentary bones the preserved cranial elements include the premaxillae dentary and anterior portions of the maxillae and nasals the dorsal margin of the maxilla is unusually concave unlike the convex condition in tyrannosaurids the nares are large and elliptical supporting its relation to proceratosauridae the dentary gradually curves upwards as it approaches its front edge many teeth are preserved attached to the maxillae with a roughly equal number of denticles on each side similarly to those of tyrannosaurids sinotyrannus could perceivably have had a tall nasal

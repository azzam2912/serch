the north end of winnipeg is a very left leaning area which has some of the strongest new democratic party support in all of canada the south end with many jewish and franco manitoban voters is one of the few areas in the prairies where the liberals have been successful in recent years the outer suburban areas tilt rightward but this was obscured for most of the 1990s by massive vote splitting the end of vote splitting on the right allowed the conservatives to win two seats in 2004 in one case defeating a star candidate the conservatives picked up another seat in 2006 one more in 2008 and two additional seats in 2011 including elmwood transcona the former seat of longtime ndp mp and former deputy leader bill blaikie in 2015 however the liberals took all but one seat in winnipeg en route to their second largest seat count ever the only seat that didn t get swept up in the liberal tide was elmwood transcona where blaikie s son daniel blaikie narrowly retook the seat for the ndp it was the first time since 1968 and only the second time since the end of world war ii that

in its mid season asexual phase p dissotocum disperses by forming a filamentous sporangia which produce vesicles housing 10 75 motile zoospores vesicles open releasing zoospores which contact host roots encyst and produce a germ tube which infects the host root and begins formation of mycelium in sexual reproduction if multiple mating types are present hyphal antheridium can contact each other and undergo plasmogamy merging their membranes near the end of growing season after several steps of differentiation and meiosis an oospore the primary survival structure is formed these thick walled oospores can remain dormant for many months and will eventually germinate through two methods a sporangium can be produced which generates a cyst and releases zoospores or the oospore can create a germ tube which can directly penetrate and infect a host this disease cycle is extremely dependent on water for dispersal making greenhouses irrigation systems and hydroponics especially prone to spread of p dissotocum p dissotocum is primarily a water borne pathogen and as a result poses serious threats to plants managed via hydroponics and by irrigation with motile spores that can move quickly infection spreads rapidly in water logged crops and hydroponic systems p dissotocum can infect

in appearance they have variously been compared to worms with legs caterpillars and slugs they prey upon smaller animals such as insects which they catch by squirting an adhesive slime approximately 200 species of velvet worms have been described although the true number of species is likely greater the two extant families of velvet worms are peripatidae and peripatopsidae they show a peculiar distribution with the peripatids being predominantly equatorial and tropical while the peripatopsids are all found south of the equator it is the only phylum within animalia that is wholly endemic to terrestrial environments velvet worms are considered close relatives of the arthropoda and tardigrada with which they form the taxon panarthropoda this makes them of palaeontological interest as they can help reconstruct the ancestral arthropod in modern zoology they are particularly renowned for their curious mating behaviour and for bearing live young velvet worms are segmented animals with a flattened cylindrical body cross section and rows of unstructured body appendages known as oncopods or lobopods informally stub feet the animals grow to between 0 5 and 20 cm 2 to 8 in with the average being about 5 cm 2 in and have between 13 and 43

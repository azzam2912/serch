adf was first developed in the early seventies by the group of e j baerends from the vrije universiteit in amsterdam and by the group of t ziegler from the university of calgary nowadays many other academic groups are contributing to the software software for chemistry materials scm formerly known as scientific computing modelling is a spin off company from the baerends group scm has been coordinating the development and distribution of adf since 1995 together with the rise in popularity of dft in the nineties adf has become a popular computational chemistry software package used in the industrial and academic research adf excels in spectroscopy transition metals and heavy elements problems a periodic structure counterpart of adf named band is available to study bulk crystals polymers and surfaces the adf modeling suite has expanded beyond dft since 2010 with a gui to stewart s semi empirical mopac code and the quantum espresso plane wave code a density functional based tight binding dftb module a reactive force field module reaxff and an implementation of klamt s cosmo rs method

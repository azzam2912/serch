the program calculates the magnitude of several health effects associated to exposure to the most relevant air pollutants in a given population airq has been used in the breathe life campaign and in numerous studies aimed at measuring long term exposure to ambient particulate matter the first version of the program airq was distributed in a excel spreadsheet program in 1999 followed by another version of airq for windows in 2000 a substantial difference between airq and airq is that airq contains dose response functions and relative risk values airq version 1 3 was released in october 2018 and is available in english russian and french languages airq is intended as a tool to ascertain the magnitude of the burden and impacts of air population on health in a given locality it performs this function by featuring data analysis graphing tools tables and quantitative information for prominent pollutants such as particulate matter pm nitrogen dioxide no and tropospheric ozone o airq also has the capacity to perform calculations for black carbon bc and provides rough estimates of impacts of household indoor air pollution on health airq can be applied to long and short term exposure to ambient air pollution and

this behavior displayed by all terrestrial vertebrates is typically identified based upon changes in respiratory frequency and or amplitude and is often studied in the context of odor guided behaviors and olfactory perceptual tasks sniffing is quantified by measuring intra nasal pressure or flow or air or while less accurate through a strain gauge on the chest to measure total respiratory volume strategies for sniffing behavior vary depending upon the animal with small animals rats mice hamsters displaying sniffing frequencies ranging from 4 to 12 hz but larger animals humans sniffing at much lower frequencies usually less than 2 hz subserving sniffing behaviors evidence for an olfactomotor circuit in the brain exists wherein perception or expectation of an odor can trigger brain respiratory center to allow for the modulation of sniffing frequency and amplitude and thus acquisition of odor information sniffing is analogous to other stimulus sampling behaviors including visual saccades active touch and whisker movements in small animals viz whisking atypical sniffing has been reported in cases of neurological disorders especially those disorders characterized by impaired motor function and olfactory perception the behavior of sniffing incorporates changes in air flow within the nose this can involve changes in the

both the sequence letter and quality score are each encoded with a single ascii character for brevity it was originally developed at the wellcome trust sanger institute to bundle a fasta formatted sequence and its quality data but has recently become the de facto standard for storing the output of high throughput sequencing instruments such as the illumina genome analyzer a fastq file normally uses four lines per sequence a fastq file containing a single sequence might look like this the byte representing quality runs from 0x21 lowest quality in ascii to 0x7e highest quality in ascii here are the quality value characters in left to right increasing order of quality ascii for solid data the sequence is in color space except the first position the quality values are those of the sanger format alignment tools differ in their preferred version of the quality values some include a quality score set to 0 i e for the leading nucleotide others do not the sequence read archive includes this quality score fastq read simulation has been approached by several tools a comparison of those tools can be seen here quality values account for about half of the required disk space in

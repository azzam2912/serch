it has been shown that humans have almost 42 different tbc proteins which differ from each other by having additional motifs and domains gram run ptb and add functional diversification to the family the most well known of this protein group are tbc1d1 and tbc1d4 which are directly associated with functional diseases moreover most of them have really close relations with other protein domains for example it has been demonstrated that some of them act like a gap gtpase activating protein for small gtpases rab activity is modulated in part by gtpase activating proteins gaps and many of these rabgaps share a tre2 bub2 cdc16 tbc domain architecture however it is needed much research on these kind of proteins and in this article it explains what is known by now picture 1 a rab cycle in membrane trafficking the cycle between the gtp bound inactive state and the gtp bound active state is led by the rab protein and regulated by an activating enzyme gef and an inactivating enzyme gap which in this case could be the tbc protein hereafter the activated form of rab gtp bound is incorporated to a specific organelle or vesicle and promotes its transport by

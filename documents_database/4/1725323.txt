light is conducted through the stone from one end to the other therefore the fibers have to go through the whole object this results in a certain light pattern on the other surface depending on the fiber structure shadows cast onto one side appear as silhouettes through the material translucent concrete is used in fine architecture as a fa ade material and for cladding of interior walls light transmitting concrete has also been applied to various design products several ways of producing translucent concrete exist all are based on a fine grain concrete ca 95 and only 5 light conducting elements that are added during casting process after setting the concrete is cut to plates or stones with standard machinery for cutting stone materials due to bends in the fibers and roughnesses on the cut surfaces of the fibers light transmission is generally a bit less than half the incident light on the fibers so given five percent fibers about two percent as the human eye s response to light is non linear this can still give useful daylighting in theory the fibers could carry light around corners and over a distance of tens of meters with the rate of

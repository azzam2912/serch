it is formed by the union of the common hepatic duct and the cystic duct from the gall bladder it is later joined by the pancreatic duct to form the ampulla of vater there the two ducts are surrounded by the muscular sphincter of oddi when the sphincter of oddi is closed newly synthesized bile from the liver is forced into storage in the gall bladder when open the stored and concentrated bile exits into the duodenum this conduction of bile is the main function of the common bile duct the hormone cholecystokinin when stimulated by a fatty meal promotes bile secretion by increased production of hepatic bile contraction of the gall bladder and relaxation of the sphincter of oddi several problems can arise within the common bile duct a diameter of more than 8 mm is regarded as abnormal dilatation and is a sign of cholestasis it normally gets slightly dilated after cholecystectomy with upper limit 95 prediction interval being about 10 mm after a few months on abdominal ultrasonography the common bile duct is generally seen most readily in the perihilar area the border area between the common hepatic duct and the cbd by the hilum of the

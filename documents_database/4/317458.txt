the assigned values to unknown points are calculated with a weighted average of the values available at the known points the name given to this type of methods was motivated by the weighted average applied since it resorts to the inverse of the distance to each known point amount of proximity when assigning weights the expected result is a discrete assignment of the unknown function formula 1 in a study region where formula 3 is the study region the set of formula 4 known data points can be described as a list of tuples the function is to be smooth continuous and once differentiable to be exact formula 6 and to meet the user s intuitive expectations about the phenomenon under investigation furthermore the function should be suitable for a computer application at a reasonable cost nowadays a basic implementation will probably make use of parallel resources at the harvard laboratory for computer graphics and spatial analysis beginning in 1965 a varied collection of scientists converged to rethink among other things what we now call geographic information systems the motive force behind the laboratory howard fisher conceived an improved computer mapping program that he called symap which from the start

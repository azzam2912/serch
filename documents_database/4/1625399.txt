it is found in mongolia and the adjacent nei mongol autonomous region a generic revision of the genus was undertaken in 2007 which helped resolve the uncertainty as to whether this species should be considered a subspecies of spermophilus erythrogenys a phylogeny based on molecular sequence data determined that s pallidicauda was indeed a separate species from s erythrogenys and from the other similar species in the genus s brevicauda and s alashanicus the pallid ground squirrel is found in mongolia near lake khulu nur and the baidarak river and in ullyn bulyk the mongolian and the gobi altai mountains the closely related species spermophilus alashanicus from the alashan desert and spermophilus brevicauda found in eastern kazakhstan and in tian shan mountain range are allopatric in distribution as they are largely separated by geographic boundaries it has been found to hybridise with p alashanicus where their ranges do overlap this ground squirrel has a strawy brown colour which takes on a more sandy hue in summer but is still paler than other similar species the short tail is a whitish yellow colour with a rust coloured stripe most of the way along the upper side there is a white streak

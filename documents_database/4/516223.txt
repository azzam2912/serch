this aromatic diamine is an important precursor to many heterocyclic compounds it is isomeric with m phenylenediamine and p phenylenediamine commonly 2 nitrochlorobenzene is treated with ammonia and the resulting 2 aminonitrobenzene is then hydrogenated in the laboratory the reduction of the nitroaniline is effected with zinc powder in ethanol followed by purification of the diamine as the hydrochloride salt this compound darkens in air impurities may be removed by treating a hot aqueous solution with sodium dithionite reducing agent and activated carbon and allowing the product to cool crystallize o phenylenediamine condenses with ketones and aldehydes to give rise to a variety of useful products reactions with carboxylic acids and their derivatives afford benzimidazoles the herbicide benomyl is prepared in this manner also quinoxalinedione may be prepared by condensation of o phenylenediamine with dimethyl oxalate condensation with xanthate esters affords mercaptoimidazoles which are used as antioxidants in rubber products treatment with nitrous acid gives benzotriazole a corrosion inhibitor condensation of substituted o phenylenediamine with various diketones is used in the preparation of a variety of pharmaceuticals in coordination chemistry phenylenediamine is an important ligand precursor schiff base derivatives such as those derived from salicylaldehyde are excellent chelating ligands oxidation

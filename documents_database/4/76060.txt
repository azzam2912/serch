it is a weakly magnetic black or steel gray solid from a commercial perspective ilmenite is the most important ore of titanium ilmenite is the main source of titanium dioxide which is used in paints printing inks fabrics plastics paper sunscreen food and cosmetics ilmenite crystallizes in the trigonal system the ilmenite crystal structure consists of an ordered derivative of the corundum structure in corundum all cations are identical but in ilmenite fe and ti ions occupy alternating layers perpendicular to the trigonal c axis containing high spin ferrous centers ilmenite is paramagnetic ilmenite is commonly recognized in altered igneous rocks by the presence of a white alteration product the pseudo mineral leucoxene often ilmenites are rimmed with leucoxene which allows ilmenite to be distinguished from magnetite and other iron titanium oxides the example shown in the image at right is typical of leucoxene rimmed ilmenite in reflected light it may be distinguished from magnetite by more pronounced reflection pleochroism and a brown pink tinge samples of ilmenite exhibit a weak response to a hand magnet in 1791 william gregor discovered ilmenite in a stream that runs through the valley just south of the village of manaccan cornwall and identified

methods of the class should preserve the invariant the class invariant constrains the state stored in the object class invariants are established during construction and constantly maintained between calls to public methods code within functions may break invariants as long as the invariants are restored before a public function ends an object invariant or representation invariant is a computer programming construct consisting of a set of invariant properties that remain uncompromised regardless of the state of the object this ensures that the object will always meet predefined conditions and that methods may therefore always reference the object without the risk of making inaccurate presumptions defining class invariants can help programmers and testers to catch more bugs during software testing the useful effect of class invariants in object oriented software is enhanced in the presence of inheritance class invariants are inherited that is the invariants of all the parents of a class apply to the class itself inheritance can allow descendant classes to alter implementation data of parent classes so it would be possible for a descendant class to change the state of instances in a way that made them invalid from the viewpoint of the parent class the concern for

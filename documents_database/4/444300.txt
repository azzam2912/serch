atlas is the first superconducting linear accelerator for heavy ions at energies in the vicinity of the coulomb barrier the atlas accelerator at argonne should not be confused with the atlas experiment at the large hadron collider at cern ions are generated from one of two sources the 9 mv electrostatic tandem van de graaff accelerator or the positive ion injector a 12 mv low velocity linac and electron cyclotron resonance ecr ion source the ions are sent from one of these two into the 20 mv booster linac then to the 20 mv atlas linac section the atlas linac section contains 62 resonators each one of seven different type each type accelerates ions to a particular velocity each resonator is also tunable to allow for a wide range of velocities the ions in the atlas linac are aligned into a beam which exits the linac into one of three experimental areas the experiment areas contain scattering chambers spectrometers and spectrographs beamlines a gamma ray facility and particle detectors the energy levels of the ions produces by atlas are ideal to study the properties of the nucleus specifically understanding reactions between nuclei from very low energies typically encountered in burning

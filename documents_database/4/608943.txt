it is also referred to as extranuclear dna or cytoplasmic dna most dna in an individual genome is found in chromosomes but dna found outside the nucleus also serves important biological functions in prokaryotes nonviral extrachromosomal dna is primarily found in plasmids whereas in eukaryotes extrachromosomal dna is primarily found in organelles mitochondrial dna is a main source of this extrachromosomal dna in eukaryotes the fact that this organelle contains its own dna supports the hypothesis that mitochondria originated as bacterial cells engulfed by ancestral eukaryotic cells extrachromosomal dna is often used in research of replication because it is easy to identify and isolate extrachromosomal dna was found to be structurally different from nuclear dna cytoplasmic dna is less methylated than dna found within the nucleus it was also confirmed that the sequences of cytoplasmic dna was different from nuclear dna in the same organism showing that cytoplasmic dnas are not simply fragments of nuclear dna in addition to dna found outside the nucleus in cells infection of viral genomes also provides an example of extrachromosomal dna although prokaryotic organisms do not possess a membrane bound nucleus like the eukaryotes they do contain a nucleoid region in which the main

the applications of geophysical fluid dynamics do not generally include the circulation of the mantle which is the subject of geodynamics or fluid phenomena in the magnetosphere to describe the flow of geophysical fluids equations are needed for conservation of momentum or newton s second law and conservation of energy the former leads to the navier stokes equations further approximations are generally made first the fluid is assumed to be incompressible remarkably this works well even for a highly compressible fluid like air as long as sound and shock waves can be ignored second the fluid is assumed to be a newtonian fluid meaning that there is a linear relation between the shear stress and the strain for example where is the viscosity under these assumptions the navier stokes equations are the left hand side represents the acceleration that a small parcel of fluid would experience in a reference frame that moved with the parcel a lagrangian frame of reference in a stationary eulerian frame of reference this acceleration is divided into the local rate of change of velocity and advection a measure of the rate of flow in or out of a small region the equation for energy conservation

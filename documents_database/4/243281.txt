it was created in the mid 1990s by professor christine orengo and colleagues including janet thornton and david jones and continues to be developed by the orengo group at university college london cath shares many broad features with the scop resource however there are also many areas in which the detailed classification differs greatly experimentally determined protein three dimensional structures are obtained from the protein data bank and split into their consecutive polypeptide chains where applicable protein domains are identified within these chains using a mixture of automatic methods and manual curation the domains are then classified within the cath structural hierarchy at the class c level domains are assigned according to their secondary structure content i e all alpha all beta a mixture of alpha and beta or little secondary structure at the architecture a level information on the secondary structure arrangement in three dimensional space is used for assignment at the topology fold t level information on how the secondary structure elements are connected and arranged is used assignments are made to the homologous superfamily h level if there is good evidence that the domains are related by evolution i e they are homologous additional sequence data for

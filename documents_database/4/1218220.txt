most primates are sexually dimorphic for different biological characteristics such as body size canine tooth size craniofacial structure skeletal dimensions pelage color and markings and vocalization however such sex differences are primarily limited to the anthropoid primates most of the strepsirrhine primates lemurs and lorises and tarsiers are monomorphic extant primates exhibit a broad range of variation in sexual size dimorphism ssd or sexual divergence in body size it ranges from species such as gibbons and strepsirrhines including madagascar s lemurs in which males and females have almost the same body sizes to species such as chimpanzees and bonobos in which males body sizes are larger than females body sizes in extreme cases males have body sizes that are almost twice as large as those of females as in some species including gorillas orangutans mandrills hamadryas baboons and proboscis monkeys patterns of size dimorphism exhibited in primates may correspond to the intensity of competition between members of the same sex for access to mates intrasexual competition counteracted by fecundity selection on the other sex some callitrichine and strepsirrhine primates are however characterized by the reverse dimorphism a phenomenon in which females are larger than males for lemurs for example females

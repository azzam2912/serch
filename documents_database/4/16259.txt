a scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a descending scale some scales contain different pitches when ascending than when descending for example the melodic minor scale often especially in the context of the common practice period most or all of the melody and harmony of a musical work is built using the notes of a single scale which can be conveniently represented on a staff with a standard key signature due to the principle of octave equivalence scales are generally considered to span a single octave with higher or lower octaves simply repeating the pattern a musical scale represents a division of the octave space into a certain number of scale steps a scale step being the recognizable distance or interval between two successive notes of the scale however there is no need for scale steps to be equal within any scale and particularly as demonstrated by microtonal music there is no limit to how many notes can be injected within any given musical interval a measure of the width of each scale step provides a method to classify scales for instance in a chromatic scale each scale step

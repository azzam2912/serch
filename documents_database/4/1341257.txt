it was originally due to john landen and independently rediscovered by carl friedrich gauss the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind is where formula 2 is the modular angle landen s transformation states that if formula 3 formula 4 formula 5 formula 6 are such that formula 7 and formula 8 then landen s transformation can similarly be expressed in terms of the elliptic modulus formula 10 and its complement formula 11 consider an example when the transformation does not change the value of the integral let and formula 13 and formula 14 are replaced by their arithmetic and geometric means respectively that is therefore from equation aa we conclude and formula 20 the same equation can be proved by integration by substitution it is convenient to first cast the integral in an algebraic form by a substitution of formula 21 formula 22 giving a further substitution of formula 24 gives the desired result this latter step is facilitated by writing the radical as and the infinitesimal as so that the factor of formula 28 is recognized and cancelled between the two factors if the transformation is iterated a number of times then the parameters formula 13 and formula

the ship was designed as an improved version of existing battleships with greater displacement and a thicker armoured belt amidships trafalgar saw active service as a battleship from 1890 to 1897 and from 1909 to 1911 when she was sold between these two periods as a combatant trafalgar served as a guardship and as a drill ship the two ships were designed to be improved versions of the admiral and victoria classes having a greater displacement to allow for improved protection however they sacrificed a full armoured belt for greater thickness amidships in a partial belt as originally designed trafalgar was to have displaced 11 940 tons and carried a secondary armament of ten guns of calibre disposed in the broadside battery changes made during construction however led to an increase in displacement to 12 590 tons this led to the ships draught being increased by from the initial design and with full bunkers this in turn led to the main belt being immersed to a deeper level than had been intended with a potential decrease in defensive effect in combat in october 1896 the secondary battery of guns was replaced by a more powerful battery of six quick firers

in an ideal mixture the microscopic interactions between each pair of chemical species are the same or macroscopically equivalent the enthalpy change of solution and volume variation in mixing is zero and as a result properties of the mixtures can be expressed directly in terms of simple concentrations or partial pressures of the substances present e g raoult s law deviations from ideality are accommodated by modifying the concentration by an activity coefficient analogously expressions involving gases can be adjusted for non ideality by scaling partial pressures by a fugacity coefficient the concept of activity coefficient is closely linked to that of activity in chemistry the chemical potential of a substance b in an ideal mixture of liquids or an ideal solution is given by where is the chemical potential of a pure substance formula 2 and x is the mole fraction of the substance in the mixture this is generalised to include non ideal behavior by writing when a is the activity of the substance in the mixture with where is the activity coefficient which may itself depend on x as approaches 1 the substance behaves as if it were ideal for instance if 1 then raoult s law

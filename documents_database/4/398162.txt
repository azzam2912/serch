for example three cuts across a pancake will produce six pieces if the cuts all meet at a common point inside the circle but up to seven if they do not this problem can be formalized mathematically as one of counting the cells in an arrangement of lines for generalizations to higher dimensions see arrangement of hyperplanes the analogue of this sequence in three dimensions is the cake number the maximum number p of pieces that can be created with a given number of cuts where is given by the formula using binomial coefficients the formula can be expressed as simply put each number equals a triangular number plus 1 this sequence starting with thus results in when a circle is cut times to produce the maximum number of pieces represented as the th cut must be considered the number of pieces before the last cut is while the number of pieces added by the last cut is to obtain the maximum number of pieces the th cut line should cross all the other previous cut lines inside the circle but not cross any intersection of previous cut lines thus the th line itself is cut in places and into

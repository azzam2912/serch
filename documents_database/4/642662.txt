nonparametric regression requires larger sample sizes than regression based on parametric models because the data must supply the model structure as well as the model estimates in gaussian process regression also known as kriging a gaussian prior is assumed for the regression curve the errors are assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution and the regression curve is estimated by its posterior mode the gaussian prior may depend on unknown hyperparameters which are usually estimated via empirical bayes the hyperparameters typically specify a prior covariance kernel in case the kernel should also be inferred nonparametrically from the data the critical filter can be used smoothing splines have an interpretation as the posterior mode of a gaussian process regression kernel regression estimates the continuous dependent variable from a limited set of data points by convolving the data points locations with a kernel function approximately speaking the kernel function specifies how to blur the influence of the data points so that their values can be used to predict the value for nearby locations decision tree learning algorithms can be applied to learn to predict a dependent variable from data although the original classification and regression tree cart formulation applied only to predicting

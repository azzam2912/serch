the effects can include those manifested within animals including humans microorganisms or combinations of organisms for example infection pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are the main branches of pharmacology being itself a topic of biology interested in the study of the interactions between both endogenous and exogenous chemical substances with living organisms in particular pharmacodynamics is the study of how a drug affects an organism whereas pharmacokinetics is the study of how the organism affects the drug both together influence dosing benefit and adverse effects pharmacodynamics is sometimes abbreviated as pd and pharmacokinetics as pk especially in combined reference for example when speaking of pk pd models pharmacodynamics places particular emphasis on dose response relationships that is the relationships between drug concentration and effect one dominant example is drug receptor interactions as modeled by where l r and lr represent ligand drug receptor and ligand receptor complex concentrations respectively this equation represents a simplified model of reaction dynamics that can be studied mathematically through tools such as free energy maps the majority of drugs either there are 7 main drug actions the desired activity of a drug is mainly due to successful targeting of one of the following general anesthetics were once

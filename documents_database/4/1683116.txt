in 1998 from the university of california san diego with michael freedman topology of hyperbolic 3 manifolds he is a professor at the university of california berkeley and a former professor at the university of illinois at chicago in 2004 agol proved the marden tameness conjecture a conjecture of albert marden it states that a hyperbolic 3 manifold with finitely generated fundamental group is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3 manifold the conjecture was also independently proven by danny calegari and david gabai and implies the ahlfors measure conjecture in 2012 he announced a proof of the virtually haken conjecture which was published a year later the conjecture now theorem states that every aspherical 3 manifold is finitely covered by a haken manifold agol calegari and gabai received the 2009 clay research award for their proof of the marden tameness conjecture in 2005 agol was a guggenheim fellow in 2012 he became a fellow of the american mathematical society in 2013 agol was awarded the oswald veblen prize in geometry along with daniel wise in 2015 he was awarded the 2016 breakthrough prize in mathematics for spectacular contributions to low dimensional topology and geometric group theory including work

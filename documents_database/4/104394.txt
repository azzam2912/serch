moneyness is firstly a three fold classification if the derivative would have positive intrinsic value if it were to expire today it is said to be in the money if it would be worthless if expiring at the current price it is said to be out of the money and if the current price and strike price are equal it is said to be at the money there are two slightly different definitions according to whether one uses the current price spot or future price forward specified as at the money spot or at the money forward etc this rough classification can be quantified by various definitions to express the moneyness as a number measuring how far the asset is in the money or out of the money with respect to the strike or conversely how far a strike is in or out of the money with respect to the spot or forward price of the asset this quantified notion of moneyness is most importantly used in defining the relative volatility surface the implied volatility in terms of moneyness rather than absolute price the most basic of these measures is simple moneyness which is the ratio of spot or forward

it has an apparent magnitude of 4 46 making it visible to the naked eye in suitably dark conditions this a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 958 days it is located about 46 light years from the earth at present the system is moving away from the sun with a radial velocity of 26 km s about 305 000 years ago it made perihelion passage at an estimated distance of tau eridani was a latter designation of 90 ceti a moderate far infrared excess was observed for this star system in the 12 m 25 m 60 m and 100 m wavelengths by the infrared astronomical satellite iras and published in 1993 this discovery was subsequently interpreted as indicating a debris disk with a radius near to 500 au it was further speculated that if the star system had been observed at longer wavelengths it was likely the debris disk would have been seen to have a radius considerably wider than 500 au later observations made by the spitzer space telescope published in 2004 detected no substantial infrared excess around the stars within the 14 35 m range of wavelengths

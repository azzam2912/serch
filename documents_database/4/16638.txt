in all silica based optical fibers minimum material dispersion occurs naturally at a wavelength of approximately 1300 nm single mode fibers may be made of silica based glasses containing dopants that shift the material dispersion wavelength and thus the zero dispersion wavelength toward the minimum loss window at approximately 1550 nm the engineering tradeoff is a slight increase in the minimum attenuation coefficient such fiber is called dispersion shifted fiber another way to alter the dispersion is changing the core size and the refractive indices of the material of core and cladding because fiber optic materials are already highly optimized for low scattering and high transparency alternative ways to change the refractive index were investigated as a straightforward solution tapered fibers and holey fibers or photonic crystal fibers pcf were produced essentially they replace the cladding by air this improves the contrast of refractive indices by a factor of 10 therefore the effective index is changed especially for longer wavelengths this type of refractive index change versus wavelength due to different geometry is called waveguide dispersion as these narrow waveguides 1 3 m core diameter are combined with ultrashort pulses at the zero dispersion wavelength pulses are not instantly destroyed

the elements of the architecture are documented in the ibm system 360 principles of operation and the ibm system 360 i o interface channel to control unit original equipment manufacturers information manuals the system 360 architecture provides the following features memory storage in system 360 is addressed in terms of 8 bit bytes various instructions operate on larger units called halfword 2 bytes fullword 4 bytes doubleword 8 bytes quad word 16 bytes and 2048 byte storage block specifying the leftmost lowest address of the unit within a halfword fullword doubleword or quadword low numbered bytes are more significant than high numbered bytes this is sometimes referred to as big endian many uses for these units require aligning them on the corresponding boundaries within this article the unqualified term word refers to a fullword the original architecture of system 360 provided for up to 2 16 777 216 bytes of memory the later model 67 extended the architecture to allow up to 2 4 294 967 296 bytes of virtual memory system 360 uses truncated addressing that means that instructions do not contain complete addresses but rather specify a base register and a positive offset from the addresses in the

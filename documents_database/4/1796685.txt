edopoids are known from the late carboniferous and early permian of north america and europe and the late permian of africa they are among the most basal temnospondyls and possess a number of primitive features that were lost in later members of the group edopoids are relatively large temnospondyls with many species estimated to have grown several meters in length the skull of edops is broad while those of cochleosaurids are narrower and elongated distinguishing features of edopoids include the presence of an intertemporal bone that is absent in all other temnospondyls and the lack of a pineal foramen a small hole on the skull roof of many early tetrapods young individuals still possess this hole relative to other temnospondyls edopoids also have enlarged premaxillae maxillae and nasal bones in the snout region which constrict the nostrils to small holes and push them to the sides of the skull most edopoids lacked grooves in the skull called sensory sulci which presumably supported a lateral line system in other temnospondyls the lack of sensory sulci suggests that most edopoids were adapted to terrestrial lifestyles as lateral lines are characteristic of aquatic animals nigerpeton is the only edopoid to possess sensory sulci

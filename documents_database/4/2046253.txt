under the separation of powers model the state is divided into different branches each branch has separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with the powers associated with the others the typical division creates an executive branch that executes and enforces the law as led by a head of state typically a president a legislative branch that enacts amends or repeals laws as led by a unicameral or bicameral legislature and a judiciary branch that interprets and applies the law as led by a supreme court divided governments are seen by different groups as a benefit or as an undesirable product of said separations those in favor of divided government believe that the separations encourage more policing of those in power by the opposition as well as limiting spending and the expansion of undesirable laws opponents however argue that divided governments become lethargic leading to many gridlocks in the late 1980s terry m moe a professor of political science at stanford university examined the issue he concluded that divided governments lead to compromise which can be seen as beneficial but he also noticed that divided governments subvert performance

while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with the term loudspeaker speaker it is usually applied to specialized transducers which reproduce only a portion of the audible frequency range for high fidelity reproduction of sound multiple loudspeakers are often mounted in the same enclosure each reproducing a different part of the audible frequency range in this case the individual speakers are referred to as drivers and the entire unit is called a loudspeaker drivers made for reproducing high audio frequencies are called tweeters those for middle frequencies are called mid range drivers and those for low frequencies are called woofers while those for very low bass range are subwoofers less common types of drivers are supertweeters and rotary woofers the mechanism most widely used in speakers to convert the electric current to sound waves is the dynamic or electrodynamic driver invented in 1925 by edward w kellogg and chester w rice which creates sound with a coil of wire called a voice coil suspended between the poles of a magnet there are others which are far less widely used electrostatic drivers piezoelectric drivers planar magnetic drivers heil air motion drivers and ionic drivers among others speaker drivers include a diaphragm

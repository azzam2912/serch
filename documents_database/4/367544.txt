such suits may be either full pressure i e a space suit or partial pressure as used by aircrew partial pressure suits work by providing mechanical counter pressure to assist breathing at altitude the region from sea level to around is known as the physiological efficient zone oxygen levels are usually high enough for humans to function without supplemental oxygen and decompression sickness is rare the physiological deficient zone extends from to about there is an increased risk of problems such as hypoxia trapped gas dysbarism where gas trapped in the body expands and evolved gas dysbarism where dissolved gases such as nitrogen may form in the tissues i e decompression sickness above approximately oxygen rich breathing mixture is required to approximate the oxygen available in the lower atmosphere while above oxygen must be under positive pressure above respiration is not possible because the pressure at which the lungs excrete carbon dioxide approximately 87 mmhg exceeds outside air pressure above also known as the armstrong limit fluids in the throat and lungs will boil away generally 100 oxygen is used to maintain an equivalent altitude of generally pressure suits work by either indirectly compressing the human body or directly compressing

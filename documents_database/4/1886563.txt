v o quine according to quine there is more than one correct method of translating sentences where the two translations differ not merely in the meanings attributed to the sub sentential parts of speech but also in the net import of the whole sentence it is holophrastic indeterminacy that underlies quine s argument against synonymy the basis of his objections to rudolf carnap s analytic synthetic distinction the other kind of indeterminacy introduced by quine is the inscrutability of reference which refers to parts of a sentence or individual words quine s work on indeterminacy of translation stemming from the basic forms of indeterminacy is widely discussed in modern analytic philosophy quine s approach to translation radical translation takes the perspective of trying to establish the meaning of sentences in a foreign language quine calls it arunta by observing and questioning native speakers of that language it is a hypothetical version of what could be an empirical investigation by an armchair analysis of such an adventure quine argues that it is impossible to construct a unique translation that can be defended as better than all others the reason is predicated upon an argued unavoidable introduction of the two indeterminacies above

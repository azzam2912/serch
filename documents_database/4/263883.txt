its chemical formula is sio tridymite was first described in 1868 and the type location is in hidalgo mexico the name is from the greek tridymos for triplet as tridymite commonly occurs as twinned crystal trillings compound crystals comprising three twinned crystal components tridymite can occur in seven crystalline forms two of the most common at standard pressure are known as and the tridymite phase is favored at elevated temperatures 870 c and it converts to cristobalite at 1470 c however tridymite does usually not form from pure quartz one needs to add trace amounts of certain compounds to achieve this otherwise the quartz tridymite transition is skipped and quartz transitions directly to cristobalite at 1050 c without occurrence of the tridymite phase in the table m o h c p l and s stand for monoclinic orthorhombic hexagonal centered primitive low temperature and superlattice t indicates the temperature at which the corresponding phase is relatively stable though the interconversions between phases are complex and sample dependent and all these forms can coexist at ambient conditions mineralogy handbooks often arbitrarily assign tridymite to the triclinic crystal system yet use hexagonal miller indices because of the hexagonal crystal shape see infobox

design rules for production are developed by process engineers based on the capability of their processes to realize design intent electronic design automation is used extensively to ensure that designers do not violate design rules a process called design rule checking drc drc is a major step during physical verification signoff on the design which also involves lvs layout versus schematic checks xor checks erc electrical rule check and antenna checks the importance of design rules and drc is greatest for ics which have micro or nano scale geometries for advanced processes some fabs also insist upon the use of more restricted rules to improve yield design rules are a series of parameters provided by semiconductor manufacturers that enable the designer to verify the correctness of a mask set design rules are specific to a particular semiconductor manufacturing process a design rule set specifies certain geometric and connectivity restrictions to ensure sufficient margins to account for variability in semiconductor manufacturing processes so as to ensure that most of the parts work correctly the most basic design rules are shown in the diagram on the right the first are single layer rules a width rule specifies the minimum width of any

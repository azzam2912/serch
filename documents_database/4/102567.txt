in algebraic topology it is a cohomology theory known as topological k theory in algebra and algebraic geometry it is referred to as algebraic k theory it is also a fundamental tool in the field of operator algebras it can be seen as the study of certain kinds of invariants of large matrices k theory involves the construction of families of k functors that map from topological spaces or schemes to associated rings these rings reflect some aspects of the structure of the original spaces or schemes as with functors to groups in algebraic topology the reason for this functorial mapping is that it is easier to compute some topological properties from the mapped rings than from the original spaces or schemes examples of results gleaned from the k theory approach include the grothendieck riemann roch theorem bott periodicity the atiyah singer index theorem and the adams operations in high energy physics k theory and in particular twisted k theory have appeared in type ii string theory where it has been conjectured that they classify d branes ramond ramond field strengths and also certain spinors on generalized complex manifolds in condensed matter physics k theory has been used to classify

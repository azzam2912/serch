the strength of the shaking involved in strong ground motion usually overwhelms a seismometer forcing the use of accelerographs or strong ground motion accelerometers for recording the science of strong ground motion also deals with the variations of fault rupture both in total displacement energy released and rupture velocity as seismic instruments and accelerometers in particular become more common it becomes necessary to correlate expected damage with instrument readings the old modified mercalli intensity scale mm a relic of the pre instrument days remains useful in the sense that each intensity level provides an observable difference in seismic damage after many years of trying every possible manipulation of accelerometer time histories it turns out that the extremely simple peak ground velocity pgv provides the best correlation with damage pgv merely expresses the peak of the first integration of the acceleration record accepted formulae now link pgv with mm intensity note that the effect of soft soils gets built into the process since one can expect that these foundation conditions will amplify the pgv significantly shakemaps are produced by the united states geological survey provide almost real time information about significant earthquake events and can assist disaster relief teams and other

oversteer is what occurs when a car turns steers by more than the amount commanded by the driver conversely understeer is what occurs when a car steers less than the amount commanded by the driver automotive engineers define understeer and oversteer based on changes in steering angle associated with changes in lateral acceleration over a sequence of steady state circular turning tests car and motorsport enthusiasts often use the terminology more generally in magazines and blogs to describe vehicle response to steering in all kinds of maneuvers standard terminology used to describe understeer and oversteer are defined by the society of automotive engineers sae in document j670 and by the international organization for standardization iso in document 8855 by these terms understeer and oversteer are based on differences in steady state conditions where the vehicle is following a constant radius path at a constant speed with a constant steering wheel angle on a flat and level surface understeer and oversteer are defined by an understeer gradient k that is a measure of how the steering needed for a steady turn changes as a function of lateral acceleration steering at a steady speed is compared to the steering that would be

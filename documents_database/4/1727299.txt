a differentiating electron is the electron that differentiates an element from the previous one for example sodium ne 3s when compared to neon he 2s2p has a difference of one s electron the term appears to have been first used by charles janet each block is named after its characteristic orbital s block p block d block and f block the block names s p d and f are derived from the spectroscopic notation for the value of an electron s azimuthal quantum number sharp 0 principal 1 diffuse 2 or fundamental 3 succeeding notations proceed in alphabetical order as g h etc there is an approximate correspondence between this nomenclature of blocks based on electronic configuration and sets of elements based on chemical properties the s block and p block together are usually considered main group elements the d block corresponds to the transition metals and the f block encompasses nearly all of the lanthanides like lanthanum and the actinides like actinium not everyone agrees on the exact membership of each set of elements for example the group 12 elements zn cd and hg are as often regarded as main group rather than transition group because they are chemically

it is an example of carrier current signaling power stations transmit a ripple signal on the main transmission lines when off peak rates start often around 10 pm this ripple noise is picked up by the zellweger which after a random delay turns the hot water heater on the noise is often picked up by other equipment especially audio amplifiers and stereos and the noise can cause problems with other electrical devices it is especially audible from ceiling fans running at low speed even some telephone lines can pick up the noise the noise can be particularly obtrusive from some fluorescent light systems newer electrical meters incorporate this technology into the meter time of use meters charge electricity to the current tariff within half an hour giving customers incentive to run appliances such as dishwashers pool pumps and clothes dryers during the night power stations have plenty of unused capacity late at night but must keep running as they take days to shut down off peak rates are used as an incentive for customers to use this surplus capacity and to reduce the amount of peak demand this can produce cheaper power by delaying the need to build new power

dp steels have high ultimate tensile strength uts enabled by the martensite combined with low initial yielding stress provided by the ferrite phase high early stage strain hardening and macroscopically homogeneous plastic flow enabled through the absence of l ders effects these features render dp steels ideal materials for automotive related sheet forming operations the steel melt is produced in an oxygen top blowing process in the converter and undergoes an alloy treatment in the secondary metallurgy phase the product is aluminium killed steel with high tensile strength achieved by the composition with manganese chromium and silicon their advantages are as follows due to these properties dp steels are often used for automotive body panels wheels and bumpers

forces being vectors are observed to obey the laws of vector addition and so the overall resultant force due to the application of a number of forces can be found geometrically by drawing vector arrows for each force for example see figure 1 this construction has the same result as moving f so its tail coincides with the head of f and taking the net force as the vector joining the tail of f to the head of f this procedure can be repeated to add f to the resultant f f and so forth suppose a particle moves at a uniform rate along a line from a to b figure 2 in a given time say one second while in the same time the line ab moves uniformly from its position at ab to a position at dc remaining parallel to its original orientation throughout accounting for both motions the particle traces the line ac because a displacement in a given time is a measure of velocity the length of ab is a measure of the particle s velocity along ab the length of ad is a measure of the line s velocity along ad and the length of

hexacene and its derivatives are investigated for potential applications as organic semiconductor hexacene is one of a series of linear acenes the previous one being pentacene five fused benzene rings and the next one being heptacene seven fused benzene rings hexacene is very unstable being highly reactive in the 6 15 positions due to pi electron localization its spectra must be collected on freshly purified samples handled in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon only with very large substituents it is possible to isolate an hexacene for instance the compound 6 15 bis tri t butylsilylethynyl hexacene which melts with decomposition at 96 c the first reported synthesis of hexacene itself dates back to 1939 in 1955 the compound is synthesized by dehydrogenation of hexacosahydrohexacene by palladium on carbon in 1982 hexacene is reported as a bluish green compound with decomposition at 380 degrees in 2007 a research group claimed the first reproducible unsubstituted hexacene synthesis invalidating the previous claims based on photochemical decarbonylation of a diketone precursor the compound could not be isolated it dimerized even at concentration as low as 10 m and reacted in solution with oxygen to the organic peroxide in a pmma polymer

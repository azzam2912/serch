it is in the thomas combe collection at the ashmolean museum oxford the painting portrays a scene from the bible two of noah s daughters in law nurture the dove that has returned to the ark bearing an olive branch this is the second of millais s paintings with biblical themes following the eve of the deluge millais had some intention of producing a pendant painting titled the dove s first flight but never did so millais s original plan for the painting was to include the figure of noah as well as including several animals in the background the final omission of these other figures is thought to have been due to his desire to have the painting ready for the royal academy exhibition of 1851 the return of the dove to the ark was first put on public display at the royal academy in april 1851 millais was surprised to learn that some roman catholics who viewed it believed it to be an allegory for the return of the country to the true faith it was praised by john ruskin and th ophile gautier among others ruskin was so taken with it that he wished to buy it

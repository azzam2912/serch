they are used to track trends in a single photovoltaic pv system to identify faults in or damage to solar panels to compare the performance of a system to design specifications or to compare pv systems at different locations this range of applications requires various sensors and monitoring systems adapted to the intended purpose sensors and monitoring systems are standardized in iec 61724 1 and classified into three levels of accuracy denoted by the letters a b or c or by the labels high accuracy medium accuracy and basic accuracy for example class a is appropriate for large commercial solar plants while class c is more appropriate for small residential installations on site irradiance measurements are an important part of pv performance monitoring systems irradiance can be measured in the same orientation as the pv panels so called plane of array poa measurements or horizontally so called global horizontal irradiance ghi measurements typical sensors used for such irradiance measurements include thermopile pyranometers pv reference devices and photodiode sensors to conform to a specific accuracy class each sensor type must meet a certain set of specifications these specifications are listed in the table below if an irradiance sensor is placed in

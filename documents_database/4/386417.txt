and it is one of the six most abundant zeolites and is used commercially it was first described in 1864 by henry how he named it after the small community of morden nova scotia canada along the bay of fundy where it was first found mordenite is orthorhombic a b c unequal all angles 90 degree it crystallizes in the form of fibrous aggregates masses and vertically striated prismatic crystals it may be colorless white or faintly yellow or pink it has mohs hardness of 5 and a density of 2 1 g cm when it forms well developed crystals they are hairlike very long thin and delicate mordenite s molecular structure is a framework containing chains of five membered rings of linked silicate and aluminate tetrahedra four oxygen atoms arranged at the points of a triangular pyramid about a central silicon or aluminium atom its high ratio of silicon to aluminum atoms makes it more resistant to attack by acids than most other zeolites mordenite is one of the most abundant zeolites in altered volcanic deposits it is found in volcanic rock such as rhyolite andesite and basalt it is associated with other zeolites such as stilbite and heulandite

in photography chromatic aberration produces soft overall images and color fringing at high contrast edges like an edge between black and white astronomers face similar problems particularly with telescopes that use lenses rather than mirrors achromatic lenses are corrected to bring two wavelengths typically red and blue into focus in the same plane apo chromatic lenses are designed to bring three wavelengths typically red green and blue into focus in the same plane the residual color error secondary spectrum can be up to an order of magnitude less than for an achromatic lens of equivalent aperture and focal length apochromats are also corrected for spherical aberration at two wavelengths rather than one as in an achromat telescope objective lenses for wide band digital imaging in astronomy must have apochromatic correction as the optical sensitivity of typical ccd imaging arrays can extend from the ultraviolet through the visible spectrum and into the near infrared wavelength range apochromatic lenses for astrophotography in the 60 150 mm aperture range have been developed and marketed by several firms with focal ratios ranging from to 7 focused and guided properly during the exposure these apochromatic objectives are capable of producing the sharpest wide field astrophotographs

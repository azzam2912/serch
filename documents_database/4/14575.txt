under zero based numbering the initial element is sometimes termed the zeroth element rather than the first element zeroth is a coined ordinal number corresponding to the number zero in some cases an object or value that does not originally belong to a given sequence but which could be naturally placed before its initial element may be termed the zeroth element there is not wide agreement regarding the correctness of using zero as an ordinal nor regarding the use of the term zeroth as it creates ambiguity for all subsequent elements of the sequence when lacking context numbering sequences starting at 0 is quite common in mathematics notation in particular in combinatorics though programming languages for mathematics usually index from 1 in computer science array indices usually start at 0 in modern programming languages so computer programmers might use zeroth in situations where others might use first and so forth in some mathematical contexts zero based numbering can be used without confusion when ordinal forms have well established meaning with an obvious candidate to come before first for instance a zeroth derivative of a function is the function itself obtained by differentiating zero times such usage corresponds to naming an

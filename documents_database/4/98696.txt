the name is analogous with voltage controlled oscillator dcos were designed to overcome the tuning stability limitations of early vco designs using a dco does not make a synthesizer digital or hybrid the term digitally controlled oscillator has been used to describe the combination of a voltage controlled oscillator driven by a control signal from a digital to analog converter and is also sometimes used to describe numerically controlled oscillators this article refers specifically to the dcos used in many synthesizers of the 1980s these include the roland juno 6 juno 60 juno 106 jx 3p jx 8p and jx 10 the elka synthex the korg poly 61 the oberheim matrix 6 some instruments by akai and kawai and the recent prophet 08 and its successor rev2 by dave smith instruments many voltage controlled oscillators for electronic music are based on a capacitor charging linearly in an op amp integrator configuration when the capacitor charge reaches a certain level a comparator generates a reset pulse which discharges the capacitor and the cycle begins again this produces a rising ramp or sawtooth waveform and this type of oscillator core is known as a ramp core a common dco design uses a

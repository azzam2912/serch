carbon nanobuds were discovered and synthesized in 2006 in this material fullerenes are covalently bonded to the outer sidewalls of the underlying nanotube consequently nanobuds exhibit properties of both carbon nanotubes and fullerenes for instance the mechanical properties and the electrical conductivity of the nanobuds are similar to those of corresponding carbon nanotubes however because of the higher reactivity of the attached fullerene molecules the hybrid material can be further functionalized through known fullerene chemistry additionally the attached fullerene molecules can be used as molecular anchors to prevent slipping of the nanotubes in various composite materials thus modifying the composite s mechanical properties owing to the large number of highly curved fullerene surfaces acting as electron emission sites on conductive carbon nanotubes nanobuds possess advantageous field electron emission characteristics randomly oriented nanobuds have already been demonstrated to have an extremely low work function for field electron emission reported test measurements show macroscopic field thresholds of about 0 65 v m non functionalized single walled carbon nanotubes have a macroscopic field threshold for field electron emission 2 v m and a much higher current density as compared with that of the corresponding pure single walled carbon nanotubes the electron transport properties

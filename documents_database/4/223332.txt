without loss of generality we can demand also that n contains all its sequences of length likewise a cardinal is strongly unfoldable if and only if it is strongly unfoldable for all these properties are essentially weaker versions of strong and supercompact cardinals consistent with v l many theorems related to these cardinals have generalizations to their unfoldable or strongly unfoldable counterparts for example the existence of a strongly unfoldable implies the consistency of a slightly weaker version of the proper forcing axiom a ramsey cardinal is unfoldable and will be strongly unfoldable in l it may fail to be strongly unfoldable in v however in l any unfoldable cardinal is strongly unfoldable thus unfoldables and strongly unfoldables have the same consistency strength a cardinal k is strongly unfoldable and unfoldable if and only if it is weakly compact a unfoldable cardinal is totally indescribable and preceded by a stationary set of totally indescribable cardinals

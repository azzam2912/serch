the mc in mc4 stands for the manufacturer multi contact now st ubli electrical connectors and the 4 for the 4 mm diameter contact pin mc4s allow strings of panels to be easily constructed by pushing the connectors from adjacent panels together by hand but require a tool to disconnect them to ensure they do not accidentally disconnect when the cables are pulled the mc4 and compatible products are universal in the solar market today equipping almost all solar panels produced since about 2011 originally rated for 600 v newer versions are rated at 1500 v which allows longer strings to be created while small solar panels used for battery charging and similar tasks may not require special connectors larger systems normally connect the panels together in series to form strings in the past this was accomplished by opening a small electrical box on the back of the panel and connecting user supplied wires to screw terminals within however bare terminals of this sort are limited to 50v or less by the nec code above that only a licensed electrician can make the connections additionally these sorts of connections were subject to problems caused by water leakage electrical corrosion and

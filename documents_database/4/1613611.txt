it is used as an indicator of photosynthetic energy conversion in higher plants algae and bacteria excited chlorophyll dissipates the absorbed light energy by driving photosynthesis photochemical energy conversion as heat in non photochemical quenching or by emission as fluorescence radiation as these processes are complementary processes the analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence is an important tool in plant research with a wide spectra of applications upon illumination of a dark adapted leaf there is a rapid rise in fluorescence from photosystem ii psii followed by a slow decline first observed by kautsky et al 1960 this is called the kautsky effect this variable rise in chlorophyll fluorescence rise is due to photosystem ii fluorescence from photosystem i is not variable but constant the increase in fluorescence is due to psii reaction centers being in a closed or chemically reduced state reaction centers are closed when unable to accept further electrons this occurs when electron acceptors downstream of psii have not yet passed their electrons to a subsequent electron carrier so are unable to accept another electron closed reaction centres reduce the overall photochemical efficiency and so increases the level of fluorescence transferring a leaf from dark into light increases the

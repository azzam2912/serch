nails evolved from claws found in other animals fingernails and toenails are made of a tough protective protein called alpha keratin which is found in the hooves hair claws and horns of vertebrates the nail consists of the nail plate the nail matrix and the nail bed below it and the grooves surrounding it the matrix sometimes called the matrix unguis keratogenous membrane nail matrix or onychostroma is the tissue or germinal matrix which the nail protects it is the part of the nail bed that is beneath the nail and contains nerves lymph and blood vessels the matrix produces cells that become the nail plate the width and thickness of the nail plate is determined by the size length and thickness of the matrix while the shape of the fingertip itself shows if the nail plate is flat arched or hooked the matrix will continue to produce cells as long as it receives nutrition and remains in a healthy condition as new nail plate cells are made they push older nail plate cells forward and in this way older cells become compressed flat and translucent this makes the capillaries in the nail bed below visible resulting in a pink

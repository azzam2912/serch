in solar physics an arcade refers to a bundle of coronal loops and the prefix supra indicates that the downflows appear above flare arcades they were first described in 1999 using the soft x ray telescope sxt on board the yohkoh satellite sads are byproducts of the magnetic reconnection process that drives solar flares but their precise cause remains unknown sads are dark finger like plasma voids that are sometimes observed descending through the hot dense plasma above bright coronal loop arcades during solar flares they were first reported for a flare and associated coronal mass ejection that occurred on january 20 1999 and was observed by the sxt onboard yohkoh sads are sometimes referred to as tadpoles for their shape and have since been identified in many other events e g they tend to be most easily observed in the decay phases of long duration flares when sufficient plasma has accumulated above the flare arcade to make sads visible but they do begin earlier during the rise phase in addition to the sad voids there are related structures known as supra arcade downflowing loops sadls sadls are retracting shrinking coronal loops that form as the overlying magnetic field is

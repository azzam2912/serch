the broad central parts of continents are called cratons and are subject to epeirogeny the movement may be one of subsidence toward or of uplift from the centre of the earth the movement is caused by a set of forces acting along an earth radius such as those contributing to isostasy and faulting in the lithosphere epeirogenic movement can be permanent or transient transient uplift can occur over a thermal anomaly due to convecting anomalously hot mantle and disappears when convection wanes permanent uplift can occur when igneous material is injected into the crust and circular or elliptical structural uplift that is without folding over a large radius tens to thousands of km is one characteristic of a mantle plume in contrast to epeirogenic movement orogenic movement is a more complicated deformation of the earth s crust associated with crustal thickening notably associated with the convergence of tectonic plates such plate convergence forms orogenic belts that are characterized by the folding and faulting of layers of rock by the intrusion of magma and by volcanism epeirogenic movements may divert rivers and create drainage divides by upwarping of the crust along axes example of this is the deflection of eridanos river

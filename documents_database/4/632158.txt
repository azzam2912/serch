this compound is important as a component in the conversion process of uranium hexafluoride uf to uranium dioxide uo the ammonium uranyl carbonate is combined with steam and hydrogen at 500 600 c to yield uo in another process aqueous uranyl nitrate known as uranyl nitrate liquor unl is treated with ammonium bicarbonate to form ammonium uranyl carbonate as a solid precipitate this is separated from the solution dried with methanol and then calcinated with hydrogen directly to uo to obtain a sinterable grade powder the ex auc uranium dioxide powder is free flowing relatively coarse 10 and porous with specific surface area in the range of 5 m g and suitable for direct pelletisation avoiding the granulation step conversion to uo is often performed as the first stage of nuclear fuel fabrication the auc process is followed in south korea and argentina in the auc route calcination reduction and stabilization are simultaneously carried out in a vertical fluidized bed reactor in most countries sinterable grade uo powder for nuclear fuel is obtained by the ammonium diuranate adu process which requires several more steps ammonium uranyl carbonate is also one of the many forms called yellowcake in this case it

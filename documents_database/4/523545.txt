hydrolock occurs when a volume of liquid greater than the volume of the cylinder at its minimum end of the piston s stroke enters the cylinder since liquids are nearly incompressible the piston cannot complete its travel either the engine must stop rotating or a mechanical failure must occur if an engine hydrolocks while at speed a mechanical failure is likely common damage modes include bent or broken connecting rods a fractured crank a fractured head a fractured block crankcase damage damaged bearings or any combination of these forces absorbed by other interconnected components may cause additional damage physical damage to metal parts can manifest as a crashing or screeching sound and usually requires replacement of the engine or a substantial rebuild of its major components if an internal combustion engine hydrolocks while idling or under low power conditions the engine may stop suddenly with no immediate damage in this case the engine can often be purged by unscrewing the spark plugs or injectors and turning the engine over to expel the liquid from the combustion chambers after which a restart may be attempted depending on how the liquid was introduced to the engine it possibly can be restarted and

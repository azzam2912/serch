in computability theory it is shown that the recursive functions are precisely the functions that can be computed by turing machines this is one of the theorems that supports the church turing thesis the recursive functions are closely related to primitive recursive functions and their inductive definition below builds upon that of the primitive recursive functions however not every recursive function is a primitive recursive function the most famous example is the ackermann function other equivalent classes of functions are the recursive functions and the functions that can be computed by markov algorithms the subset of all total recursive functions with values in is known in computational complexity theory as the complexity class r the recursive functions or general recursive functions are partial functions that take finite tuples of natural numbers and return a single natural number they are the smallest class of partial functions that includes the initial functions and is closed under composition primitive recursion and the operator the smallest class of functions including the initial functions and closed under composition and primitive recursion i e without minimisation is the class of primitive recursive functions while all primitive recursive functions are total this is not true of partial

the classification has fallen from use as a formal taxon but the terms holotrich and holotrichous are still applied descriptively to organisms with cilia of uniform length distributed evenly over the surface of the body the term holotrich derives from the ancient greek meaning whole entire and meaning hair because of the even distribution of cilia over the surface of the cell the order holotricha was erected in 1859 by friedrich stein who developed a system of classification in which ciliates were categorized according to the type and distribution of their cilia the four major subdivisions of stein s ciliata were heterotricha peritricha hypotricha and holotricha the latter was reserved for organisms with cilia covering the entire surface of the body the order included five families within which a very diverse collection of genera were grouped among the better known ciliates in stein s holotricha were coleps nassula lacrymaria loxodes colpoda glaucoma and paramecium stein s scheme was amended in 1889 by otto b tschli who divided the ciliata into two orders holotricha and spirotricha b tschli s holotricha were described much as stein s had been as ciliates with relatively uniform somatic cilia the other three orders of stein

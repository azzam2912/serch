at the moment this section also includes ciphers that are used for producing a mac tag for a message here hash functions are defined as taking an arbitrary length message and producing a fixed size output that is virtually impossible to use for recreating the original message comparison of implementations of message authentication code mac algorithms a mac is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message in other words to confirm that the message came from the stated sender its authenticity and has not been changed in transit its integrity table compares implementations of block ciphers block ciphers are defined as being deterministic and operating on a set number of bits termed a block using a symmetric key each block cipher can be broken up into the possible key sizes and block cipher modes it can be run with table compares implementations of the various stream ciphers stream ciphers are defined as using plain text digits that are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream stream ciphers are typically faster than block ciphers and may have lower hardware complexity but may be more susceptible to attacks table compares the ability to utilize hardware enhanced cryptography with using

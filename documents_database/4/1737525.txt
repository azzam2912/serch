the latter cardinal is denoted formula 3 or formula 4 a variety of such cardinal characteristics arise naturally and much work has been done in determining what relations between them are provable and constructing models of set theory for various consistent configurations of them cantor s diagonal argument shows that formula 4 is strictly greater than formula 1 but it does not specify whether it is the least cardinal greater than formula 1 that is formula 8 indeed the assumption that formula 9 is the well known continuum hypothesis which was shown to be independent of the standard zfc axioms for set theory by paul cohen if the continuum hypothesis fails and so formula 4 is at least formula 11 natural questions arise about the cardinals strictly between formula 1 and formula 4 for example regarding lebesgue measurability by considering the least cardinal with some property one may get a definition for an uncountable cardinal that is consistently less than formula 4 generally one only considers definitions for cardinals that are provably greater than formula 1 and at most formula 4 as cardinal characteristics of the continuum so if the continuum hypothesis holds they are all equal to formula 8

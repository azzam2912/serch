each edge has two octahedra and one icosahedron each vertex has five octahedra and two icosahedra in total it has 3600 triangle faces 3600 edges and 720 vertices containing the cell realms of both the regular 120 cell and the regular 600 cell it can be considered analogous to the polyhedron icosidodecahedron which is a rectified icosahedron and rectified dodecahedron the vertex figure of the rectified 600 cell is a uniform pentagonal prism it is one of three semiregular 4 polytopes made of two or more cells which are platonic solids discovered by thorold gosset in his 1900 paper he called it a octicosahedric for being made of octahedron and icosahedron cells e l elte identified it in 1912 as a semiregular polytope labeling it as tc a related vertex transitive polytope can be constructed with equal edge lengths removes 120 vertices from the rectified 600 cell but isn t uniform because it contains square pyramid cells discovered by george olshevsky calling it a swirlprismatodiminished rectified hexacosichoron with 840 cells 600 square pyramids 120 pentagonal prisms and 120 pentagonal antiprisms 2640 faces 1800 triangles 600 square and 240 pentagons 2400 edges and 600 vertices it has a chiral bi diminished

aside from brownian motion with drift all other proper that is not deterministic l vy processes have discontinuous paths a stochastic process formula 1 is said to be a l vy process if it satisfies the following properties if formula 11 is a l vy process then one may construct a version of formula 11 such that formula 13 is almost surely right continuous with left limits a continuous time stochastic process assigns a random variable x to each point t 0 in time in effect it is a random function of t the increments of such a process are the differences x x between its values at different times t independent random variables whenever the two time intervals do not overlap and more generally any finite number of increments assigned to pairwise non overlapping time intervals are mutually not just pairwise independent to call the increments stationary means that the probability distribution of any increment x x depends only on the length t s of the time interval increments on equally long time intervals are identically distributed if formula 11 is a wiener process the probability distribution of x x is normal with expected value 0 and variance t

it was discovered by edwin hall in 1879 for clarity the original effect is sometimes called the ordinary hall effect to distinguish it from other hall effects which have different physical mechanisms the hall coefficient is defined as the ratio of the induced electric field to the product of the current density and the applied magnetic field it is a characteristic of the material from which the conductor is made since its value depends on the type number and properties of the charge carriers that constitute the current the modern theory of electromagnetism was systematized by james clerk maxwell in the paper on physical lines of force which was published in four parts between 1861 1862 while maxwell s paper established a solid mathematical basis for electromagnetic theory the detailed mechanisms of the theory were still being explored one such question was about the details of the interaction between magnets and electric current including whether magnetic fields interacted with the conductors or the electric current itself in 1879 edwin hall was exploring this interaction and discovered the hall effect while he was working on his doctoral degree at johns hopkins university in baltimore maryland eighteen years before the electron was

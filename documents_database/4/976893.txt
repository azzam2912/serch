there was already a tramway crossing the town the lana meran railway the new tram line was to cross the town at right angles to the existing line the line started at the then new vinschger bahn station it went on to mazzini square and theatre square where there was a junction with the lana meran railway after crossing the post bridge the line inclined sharply and after eight kilometres it terminated at the fountain square in the obermais quarter the tram depot was at the rear of the cemetery and is used today by the city s bus company the profit of the company wasn t very high during the years the tram line operated so after some time some of the cars where sold to the bolzano tramway company in the 50s like many other railway lines in the region the tram was substituted by a bus line apart from the garage behind the cemetery all traces of the line have been erased in political campaigns by local politicians there has been sometimes talk of reactivating the tram to reduce air pollution in the town which today has a lot of traffic

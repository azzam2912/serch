zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals e g iron because in contrast zinc has a low boiling point at temperatures typically used for smelting metals zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost unless specific measures are taken to prevent it the most common zinc concentrate processed is zinc sulfide which is obtained by concentrating sphalerite using the froth flotation method secondary recycled zinc material such as zinc oxide is also processed with the zinc sulfide approximately 30 of all zinc produced is from recycled sources there are two methods of smelting zinc the pyrometallurgical process and the electrolysis process both methods are still used both of these processes share the same first step roasting roasting is a process of oxidizing zinc sulfide concentrates at high temperatures into an impure zinc oxide called zinc calcine the chemical reactions that take place are as follows approximately 90 of zinc in concentrates are oxidized to zinc oxide however at the roasting temperatures around 10 of the zinc reacts with the iron impurities of the zinc sulfide concentrates to form zinc ferrite a byproduct of roasting is

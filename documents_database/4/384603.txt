it lies to the northeast of the larger crater langemak about a crater diameter to the south southwest of be v and further east is love the most distinctive aspect of this crater is the prominent ray system that surrounds the outer rim this higher albedo skirt of ejecta extends in a nearly continuous fashion out for several crater diameters but is more extensive to the north and northeast than elsewhere beyond this continuous skirt occasional rays and wisps of light material extent outwards for many more crater diameters due to its prominent rays and generally very fresh appearance necho is mapped as part of the copernican system the mid east and the middle part of the crater are mostly rough containing several hills the outer rim of necho is somewhat uneven in form particularly along the western side where it possesses two inner sides that overlap in almost spiral like fashion the rim has a slight outward bulge to the east and is more uneven along that edge the inner wall and floor has a high albedo giving the crater a bright appearance the inner side is generally wider on the western side and the interior floor is offset

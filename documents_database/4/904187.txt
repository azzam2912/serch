benefits over previous types include increased underwater speed and a smaller acoustic signature making detection by sonar more difficult another advantage was that the entire bow could be used to house a sonar for the submarine s own hunting of opponents the forward hydroplanes are located aft of the sonar array or on the sail conning tower in older boats so as not to interfere with the sonar the hull design was initially introduced in 1944 on the german delphin class midget submarine designed to be used as a cheap high speed coastal submarine the delphin was a 2 5 ton vessel built to carry a single torpedo under its belly and reached submerged speeds of during tests although development of the midget submarine was discontinued after one of the prototypes collided with a surface vessel on 18 jan 1945 some form of the design has been present in the operational submarine fleets of almost every navy since that time this design is more often referred to as an albacore hull because of its use in the more well known this was based upon the lyon shape named for hilda lyon there are several variations of the basic hull design

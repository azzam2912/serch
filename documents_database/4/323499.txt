homodyne signifies a single frequency in contrast to the dual frequencies employed in heterodyne detection when applied to processing of the reflected signal in remote sensing for topography homodyne detection lacks the ability of heterodyne detection to determine the size of a static discontinuity in elevation between two locations if there is a path between the two locations with smoothly changing elevation then homodyne detection may in principle be able to track the signal phase along the path if sampling is dense enough homodyne detection is more readily applicable to velocity sensing in optical interferometry homodyne signifies that the reference radiation i e the local oscillator is derived from the same source as the signal before the modulating process for example in a laser scattering measurement the laser beam is split into two parts one is the local oscillator and the other is sent to the system to be probed the scattered light is then mixed with the local oscillator on the detector this arrangement has the advantage of being insensitive to fluctuations in the frequency of the laser usually the scattered beam will be weak in which case the nearly steady component of the detector output is a good

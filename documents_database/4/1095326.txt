they are mobile animals with the mouth directed towards the substrate they usually have a madreporite tube feet and moveable spines of some sort and some have tiedemann s bodies on the ring canal all living echinoderms except crinoidea belong here there are 2 main competing hypotheses about the internal subdivision both about equally well supported by both molecular and morphological data they differ in their placement of the ophiuroidea brittle stars and are named accordingly the cryptosyringida hypothesis posits that the sea star morphology is plesiomorphic for eleutherozoa as a whole and that starfish asteroidea and brittle stars are not very closely related the latter forming the clade cryptosyringida together with the echinozoa the asterozoa hypothesis on the other hand implies that the sea star arms of starfish and brittle stars as well as the rounded shape of echinozoa all evolved independently from an ancestor of unknown morphology but that each armed and rounded lineage is strictly monophyletic too little is known of the basal eleutherozoans and echinoderms to be able to firmly decide for or against any of these hypotheses at present the asterozoa would have to be ranked as a superclass or treated as an unranked clade

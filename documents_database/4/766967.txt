it was derived before the advent of quantum mechanics by hendrik kramers and werner heisenberg in 1925 based on the correspondence principle applied to the classical dispersion formula for light the quantum mechanical derivation was given by paul dirac in 1927 the kramers heisenberg formula was an important achievement when it was published explaining the notion of negative absorption stimulated emission the thomas reiche kuhn sum rule and inelastic scattering where the energy of the scattered photon may be larger or smaller than that of the incident photon thereby anticipating the raman effect the kramers heisenberg kh formula for second order processes is formula 1 it represents the probability of the emission of photons of energy formula 2 in the solid angle formula 3 centered in the formula 4 direction after the excitation of the system with photons of energy formula 5 formula 6 are the initial intermediate and final states of the system with energy formula 7 respectively the delta function ensures the energy conservation during the whole process formula 8 is the relevant transition operator formula 9 is the intrinsic linewidth of the intermediate state

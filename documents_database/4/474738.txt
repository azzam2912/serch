it was named after william richardson and leon lucy who described it independently when an image is produced using an optical system and detected using photographic film or a charge coupled device ccd for instance it is inevitably blurred with an ideal point source not appearing as a point but being spread out into what is known as the point spread function extended sources can be decomposed into the sum of many individual point sources thus the observed image can be represented in terms of a transition matrix p operating on an underlying image where formula 2 is the intensity of the underlying image at pixel formula 3 and formula 4 is the detected intensity at pixel formula 5 in general a matrix whose elements are formula 6 describes the portion of light from source pixel j that is detected in pixel i in most good optical systems or in general linear systems that are described as shift invariant the transfer function p can be expressed simply in terms of the spatial offset between the source pixel j and the observation pixel i where p i is called a point spread function in that case the above equation becomes a

this novel species was discovered by scientist myron t la duc of nasa s biotechnology and planetary protection group a unit whose purpose is to clean and sterilize spacecraft so as not to have microorganisms contaminate other celestial bodies or foreign microorganisms contaminate earth on the surface of the mars odyssey in a clean room at the jet propulsion laboratory in la ca ada flintridge before the spacecraft was launched to space la duc named the bacterium bacillus odysseyi sp nov after the odyssey mission it had apparently evolved to live in the sparse environment of a clean room and its secondary spore coat makes it especially resistant to radiation b odysseyi consists of an exosporium spore coat cortex and core in a test performed by the planetary protection unit its spores were the most consistently resistant and it survived exposure to all of the challenges posed against it desiccation 100 survival hydrogen peroxide ho 26 survival ultraviolet radiation 10 survival at 660 j m and gamma radiation 0 4 survival b odysseyi shares many dna similarities with bacillus fusiformis and solibacillus silvestris the type strain for b odysseyi is 34hs 1 atcc pta 4993 nrrl b 30641 nbrc 100172

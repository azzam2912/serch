the angle between the radii lying within the bounding semidisks is the dihedral angle of the wedge if ab is a semidisk that forms a ball when completely revolved about the z axis revolving ab only through a given produces a spherical wedge of the same angle beman 2008 remarks that a spherical wedge is to the sphere of which it is a part as the angle of the wedge is to a perigon a spherical wedge of radians 180 is called a hemisphere while a spherical wedge of 2 radians 360 constitutes a complete ball the volume of a spherical wedge can be intuitively related to the ab definition in that while the volume of a ball of radius r is given by r the volume a spherical wedge of the same radius r is given by extrapolating the same principle and considering that the surface area of a sphere is given by 4 r it can be seen that the surface area of the lune corresponding to the same wedge is given by hart 2009 states that the volume of a spherical wedge is to the volume of the sphere as the number of degrees in the angle

a linear inequality contains one of the symbols of inequality it shows the data which is not equal in graph form a linear inequality looks exactly like a linear equation with the inequality sign replacing the equality sign two dimensional linear inequalities are expressions in two variables of the form where the inequalities may either be strict or not the solution set of such an inequality can be graphically represented by a half plane all the points on one side of a fixed line in the euclidean plane the line that determines the half planes ax by c is not included in the solution set when the inequality is strict a simple procedure to determine which half plane is in the solution set is to calculate the value of ax by at a point x y which is not on the line and observe whether or not the inequality is satisfied for example to draw the solution set of x 3 y linear form also called a linear functional formula 4 and b a constant real number more concretely this may be written out as or here formula 7 are called the unknowns and formula 8 are called the coefficients

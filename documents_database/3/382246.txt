a circular shift is a special kind of cyclic permutation which in turn is a special kind of permutation formally a circular shift is a permutation of the n entries in the tuple such that either or the result of repeatedly applying circular shifts to a given tuple are also called the circular shifts of the tuple for example repeatedly applying circular shifts to the four tuple a b c d successively gives and then the sequence repeats this four tuple therefore has four distinct circular shifts however not all n tuples have n distinct circular shifts for instance the 4 tuple a b a b only has 2 distinct circular shifts in general the number of circular shifts of an n tuple could be any divisor of n depending on the entries of the tuple in computer programming a bitwise rotation also known as a circular shift is a bitwise operation that shifts all bits of its operand unlike an arithmetic shift a circular shift does not preserve a number s sign bit or distinguish a floating point number s exponent from its significand unlike a logical shift the vacant bit positions are not filled in with zeros but

in physics circle bundles are the natural geometric setting for electromagnetism a circle bundle is a special case of a sphere bundle circle bundles over surfaces are an important example of 3 manifolds a more general class of 3 manifolds is seifert fiber spaces which may be viewed as a kind of singular circle bundle or as a circle bundle over a two dimensional orbifold the maxwell equations correspond to an electromagnetic field represented by a 2 form f with formula 2 being cohomologous to zero in particular there always exists a 1 form a the electromagnetic four potential equivalently the affine connection such that given a circle bundle p over m and its projection one has the homomorphism where formula 6 is the pullback each homomorphism corresponds to a dirac monopole the integer cohomology groups correspond to the quantization of the electric charge the bohm aharonov effect can be understood as the holonomy of the connection on the associated line bundle describing the electron wave function in essence the bohm aharonov effect is not a quantum mechanical effect contrary to popular belief as no quantization is involved or required in the construction of the fiber bundles or connections since

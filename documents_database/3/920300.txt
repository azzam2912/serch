in the food industry it is important to adopt measures that keep mycotoxin levels as low as practicable especially those that are heat stable these chemical compounds are the result of secondary metabolism initiated in response to specific developmental or environmental signals this includes biological stress from the environment such as lower nutrients or competition for those available under this secondary path the fungus produces a wide array of compounds in order to gain some level of advantage such as incrementing the efficiency of metabolic processes to gain more energy from less food or attacking other microorganisms and being able to use their remains as a food source mycotoxins are made by fungi and are toxic to vertebrates and other animal groups in low concentrations low molecular weight fungal metabolites such as ethanol that are toxic only in high concentrations are not considered mycotoxins mushroom poisons are fungal metabolites that can cause disease and death in humans and other animals they are rather arbitrarily excluded from discussions of mycotoxicology molds make mycotoxins mushrooms and other macroscopic fungi make mushroom poisons the distinction between a mycotoxin and a mushroom poison is based not only on the size of the producing fungus

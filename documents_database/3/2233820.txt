it is the point in which developing embryos of species in the same phylum display maximal similarity recently molecular tools have been used to identify the phylotypic period based on the developmental stage that displays maximal conservation of gene expression or minimal gene sequence divergence between species within a phylum the idea that embryos of different species have similar morphologies at some point during development can be traced back to aristotle aristotle observed a number of developing vertebrate embryos noting in his text the generation of animals that the morphological differences among the different embryos arose late in development in 1828 karl ernst von baer created his laws of embryology which summarized the results of his comparative embryogenesis studies in his first law he proposed that the more general characters of a group appear earlier in their embryos than the more special characters in 1866 ernst haeckel proposed that each developing organism passes through the evolutionary stages of its ancestors i e ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny the hypothesis that different organisms pass through the developmental stages of closely related organisms is outdated however the idea that early stages of development are conserved among species with increasing divergence as development progresses has

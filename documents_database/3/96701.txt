heat transfer can either occur as sensible heat differences in temperature without evapotranspiration or latent heat the energy required during a change of state without a change in temperature the bowen ratio is the mathematical method generally used to calculate heat lost or gained in a substance it is the ratio of energy fluxes from one state to another by sensible heat and latent heating respectively the ratio was named by harald sverdrup after ira sprague bowen 1898 1973 an astrophysicist whose theoretical work on evaporation to air from water bodies made first use of it and it is used most commonly in meteorology and hydrology the bowen ratio is calculated by the equation in this context when the magnitude of formula 4 is less than one a greater proportion of the available energy at the surface is passed to the atmosphere as latent heat than as sensible heat and the converse is true for values of formula 4 greater than one as formula 6 however formula 4 becomes unbounded making the bowen ratio a poor choice of variable for use in formulae especially for arid surfaces for this reason the evaporative fraction is sometimes a more appropriate choice of

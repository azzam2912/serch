this is a glucuronidation reaction alternative names glucuronosyltransferases are responsible for the process of glucuronidation a major part of phase ii metabolism arguably the most important of the phase ii conjugative enzymes ugts have been the subject of increasing scientific inquiry since the mid to late 1990s the reaction catalyzed by the ugt enzyme involves the addition of a glucuronic acid moiety to xenobiotics and is the most important pathway for the human body s elimination of the most frequently prescribed drugs it is also the major pathway for foreign chemical dietary environmental pharmaceutical removal for most drugs dietary substances toxins and endogenous substances ugt is present in humans other animals plants and bacteria famously ugt enzymes are not present in the genus felis and this accounts for a number of unusual toxicities in the cat family the glucuronidation reaction consists of the transfer of the glucuronosyl group from uridine 5 diphospho glucuronic acid udpga to substrate molecules that contain oxygen nitrogen sulfur or carboxyl functional groups the resulting glucuronide is more polar e g hydrophilic and more easily excreted than the substrate molecule the product solubility in blood is increased allowing it to be eliminated from the body by

this protein is one of the 17 essential subunits alpha subunits 1 7 constitutive beta subunits 1 7 and inducible subunits including beta1i beta2i beta5i that contributes to the complete assembly of 20s proteasome complex the gene psma2 encodes a member of the peptidase t1a family that is a 20s core alpha subunit using fish the human gene hc3 old nomenclature for pmsa2 4 3kb with 3 exons was mapped at chromosome band 6q27 the human protein proteasome subunit alpha type 2 is also known as 20s proteasome subunit alpha 2 based on systematic nomenclature the protein is 25 9 kda in size and composed of 234 amino acids the calculated theoretical pi of this protein is 6 77 the proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered 20s core structure this barrel shaped core structure is composed of 4 axially stacked rings of 28 non identical subunits the two end rings are each formed by 7 alpha subunits and the two central rings are each formed by 7 beta subunits three beta subunits beta1 beta2 and beta5 each contains a proteolytic active site and has distinct substrate preferences proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high

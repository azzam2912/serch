ideas from probability play an important role in his works on geometry bismut s early work was related to stochastic differential equations stochastic control and malliavin calculus to which he made fundamental contributions bismut received in 1973 his docteur d tat in mathematics from the universit paris vi a thesis entitled analyse convexe et probabilit s in his thesis bismut established a stochastic version of pontryagin s maximum principle in control theory by introducing and studying the backward stochastic differential equations which have been the starting point of an intensive research in stochastic analysis and it stands now as a major tool of mathematical finance using the quasi invariance of the brownian measure bismut gave a new approach to the malliavin calculus and a probabilistic proof of h rmander s theorem he established his celebrated integration by parts for the brownian motion on manifolds since 1984 bismut works on differential geometry he found a heat equation proof for the atiyah singer index theorem and he established a local version of the atiyah singer families index theorem for dirac operators by introducing the bismut superconnection which plays a central role in modern aspects of index theory bismut freed developed the theory

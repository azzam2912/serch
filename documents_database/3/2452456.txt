vejocalcin is a member of the calcin family of toxins it acts as a cell penetrating peptide cpp it binds with high affinity and specificity to skeletal ryanodine receptor 1 ryr1 of the sarcoplasmic reticulum thereby triggering calcium release from intracellular ca stores vejocalcin is produced by vaejovis mexicanus a scorpion endemic to north and central america while vaejovis mexicanus was originally described in 1836 vejocalcin was only isolated in 2016 this toxin was named after the scorpion that produces the peptide as well as its structural similarity to other toxins of the scorpion calcin family on the basis of its amino acid structure vejocalcin belongs to the family of scorpion calcin toxins a group of selective high affinity membrane permeable ligands of ryrs vejocalcin shares significant sequence similarity with other members of this family vejocalcin has a molecular mass of approximately 3 8 kda and an isoelectric point of 9 3 it is a relatively small protein consisting of only 33 amino acids notably two calcins produced by two closely related scorpions vejocalcin from vaejovis mexicanus and intrepicalcin from vaejovis intrepidus display a 97 similarity in their primary sequence differing in only one amino acid at position 14 asn

they were formerly classified as protists until that kingdom fell out of general use and are suggested to have evolutionary significance in being a possible transitional form between ecologically important heterotrophic and photosynthetic species among chromalveolates one paper places them in the sar supergroup phylogenomic analyses of 127 genes place telonemia with centroheliozoa in a group also consisting of cryptomonads and haptophytes see cryptomonads haptophytes assemblage although they have been studied in primarily marine environments they have also been found in freshwater shalchian tabrizi et al say that 18s rdna sequences in the phylum formed two major groups group 1 and 2 including t subtilis and t antarcticum respectively and that these were further sub divided into several statistically supported clades of sequences with restricted geographic distribution species of telonemia are heterotrophic predators feeding on a wide range of bacteria and pico to nano sized phytoplankton chloroplasts have not been observed in any of the investigated species by using specific pcr primers they revealed a much larger diversity of telonemia from environmental samples than previously uncovered by eukaryote wide primers they are globally distributed in marine waters and are frequently encountered in environmental clone libraries the evolutionary origin of telonemia

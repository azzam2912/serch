futile care discontinuation is distinct from euthanasia because euthanasia involves active intervention to end life while withholding futile medical care does not encourage or hasten the natural onset of death in the broadest sense futile care is care that does not benefit the patient as a whole including physical spiritual or other benefits this may be interpreted differently in various legal ethical or religious contexts clinicians and health care providers may need to rely on a more narrow definition of futile care in order to make decisions about a patient s health care and this definition often centers around an assessment of the likelihood that a patient could physically recover as a result of treatment or the likelihood of such treatment to relieve a patient s suffering examples of futile care may be a surgeon operating on a terminal cancer patient even when the surgery will not alleviate suffering or doctors keeping a brain dead person on life support machines for reasons other than to procure their organs for donation it is a sensitive area that often causes conflicts among medical practitioners and patients or kin many controversies surrounding the concept of futile care center around how futility is assessed

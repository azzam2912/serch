the name refers to the very thin hair like oxea present in this species sponge forming massive reticulate colonies of asconoid tubes closely resembling clathrina ceylonensis but somewhat coarser here and there on the surface of the colony the tubes converge to unite in small prominent true vents the tubes themselves are about 0 5 mm in diameter and they form a close reticulation without any pseudoderm the colour in alcohol is pale grey there are three kinds of spicules regular triradiates quadriradiates and very slender hair like oxea the regular triradiates have rather stout slightly fusiform rays bluntly and rather abruptly pointed at the apex which is often somewhat irregular the rays measure about 0 1 mm in length by 0 012 mm in diameter at the thickest part the quadriradiates are abundant and resemble the triradiates but with an apical ray projecting at right angles into the gastral cavity this ray is somewhat variable in form and size typically it is long and slender gradually and sharply pointed and slightly undulated towards the extremity in the type specimen it attains a length of about 0 14 mm the very slender hair like oxea sparsely hispidate the surface of

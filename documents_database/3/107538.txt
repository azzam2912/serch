the effect is most commonly associated with a nuclear explosion but any sufficiently energetic detonation or deflagration will produce the same effect they can be caused by powerful conventional weapons like thermobaric weapons including the atbip and gbu 43 b massive ordnance air blast some volcanic eruptions and impact events can produce natural mushroom clouds mushroom clouds result from the sudden formation of a large volume of lower density gases at any altitude causing a rayleigh taylor instability the buoyant mass of gas rises rapidly resulting in turbulent vortices curling downward around its edges forming a temporary vortex ring that draws up a central column possibly with smoke debris and or condensed water vapor to form the mushroom stem the mass of gas plus entrained moist air eventually reaches an altitude where it is no longer of lower density than the surrounding air at this point it disperses drifting back down see fallout the stabilization altitude depends strongly on the profiles of the temperature dew point and wind shear in the air at and above the starting altitude although the term appears to have been coined at the start of the 1950s mushroom clouds generated by explosions were being described

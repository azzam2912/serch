the surface might define the energy as a function of one or more coordinates if there is only one coordinate the surface is called a potential energy curve or energy profile an example is the morse long range potential it is helpful to use the analogy of a landscape for a system with two degrees of freedom e g two bond lengths the value of the energy analogy the height of the land is a function of two bond lengths analogy the coordinates of the position on the ground the pes concept finds application in fields such as chemistry and physics especially in the theoretical sub branches of these subjects it can be used to theoretically explore properties of structures composed of atoms for example finding the minimum energy shape of a molecule or computing the rates of a chemical reaction the geometry of a set of atoms can be described by a vector whose elements represent the atom positions the vector could be the set of the cartesian coordinates of the atoms or could also be a set of inter atomic distances and angles given the energy as a function of the positions is the value of for all

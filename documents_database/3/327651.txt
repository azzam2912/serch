in contrast most conventional lasers such as the ruby laser rely on stimulated electronic transitions to amplify light raman lasers are optically pumped however this pumping does not produce a population inversion as in conventional lasers rather pump photons are absorbed and immediately re emitted as lower frequency laser light photons stokes photons by stimulated raman scattering the difference between the two photon energies is fixed and corresponds to a vibrational frequency of the gain medium this makes it possible in principle to produce arbitrary laser output wavelengths by choosing the pump laser wavelength appropriately this is in contrast to conventional lasers in which the possible laser output wavelengths are determined by the emission lines of the gain material in optical fibers made of silica for example the frequency shift corresponding to the largest raman gain is about 13 2 thz in the near infrared this corresponds to a wavelength separation between pump light and laser output light of about 100 nm the first raman laser realized in 1962 by gisela eckhardt and e j woodbury used nitrobenzene as the gain medium which was intra cavity pumped inside a q switching ruby laser various other gain media can be used

the arrangement and orientation of one dimensional linear nucleic acids within this three dimensional framework results in new chemical biological and physical properties in the use of nucleic acids for intracellular gene regulation though this is disputed molecular diagnostics and materials synthesis applications the first sna consisted of 3 alkanethiol terminated single stranded oligonucleotides short dna sequences covalently attached to the surface of spherical gold nanoparticles a dense nucleic acid loading was achieved through a series of salt additions in which positively charged counterions were used to reduce electrostatic repulsion between adjacent negatively charged dna strands and thereby enable more efficient dna packing onto the nanoparticle surface one and two dimensional forms of nucleic acids e g single strands linear duplexes and plasmids are important biological machinery for the storage and transmission of genetic information fig 1 underlying this utility are the bioprogrammable interactions between complementary nucleotide bases scientists and engineers have been synthesizing and in certain cases mass producing such structures for decades in an effort to understand and exploit this elegant recognition motif the recognition abilities of nucleic acids are enhanced when arranged in a spherical geometry which allows for polyvalent interactions this polyvalency along with the high

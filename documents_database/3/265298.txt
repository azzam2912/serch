the gsh 6 30 fires a 30 165mm projectile the gsh 6 30 designed in the early 1970s and entering service in 1975 has a six barrel design that is similar to the gryazev shipunov gsh 6 23 it was based on the naval ao 18 used in the ak 630 system unlike most modern american rotary cannons it is gas operated rather than hydraulically driven allowing it to spin up to maximum rate of fire more quickly allowing more rounds to be placed on target in a short duration burst this makes the weapon advantageous in dogfights where pilots often have a very small window for engaging the enemy ignition is electrical as with the smaller gsh 6 23 on the mig 27 flogger the gsh 6 30 had to be mounted obliquely to absorb recoil the gun was noted for its high often uncomfortable vibration and extreme noise the airframe vibration led to fatigue cracks in fuel tanks numerous radio and avionics failures the necessity of using runways with floodlights for night flights as the landing lights would often be destroyed tearing or jamming of the forward landing gear doors leading to at least three crash landings cracking

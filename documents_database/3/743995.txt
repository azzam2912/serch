neurturin belongs to the glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor gdnf family of neurotrophic factors which regulate the survival and function of neurons neurturin s role as a growth factor places it in the tgf beta transforming growth factor subfamily along with its homologs persephin artemin and gdnf it is also considered a trophic factor and critical in the development and growth of neurons in the brain neurotrophic factors like neurturin have been tested in several clinical trial setting for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases specifically parkinsons disease neurturin is encoded for by the nrtn gene located on chromosome 19 in humans and has been shown to promote potent effects on survival and function of developing and mature midbrain dopaminergic neurons da in vitro in vivo the direct administration of neurturin into substantia nigra of mice models also shows mature da neuron protection in addition neurturin has also been shown to support the survival of several other neurons including sympathetic and sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia knockout mice have shown that neurturin does not appear essential for survival however evidence shows retarded growth of enteric sensory and parasympathetic neurons in mice upon the removal of neurturin receptors

it was settled in 1875 the first icelandic emigrants to canada were members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints from the westman islands the more general migration followed an offer from lord dufferin of land in manitoba to establish what amounted to a free state due to harsh environmental and economic conditions in iceland including the eruption of mount askja some 20 000 icelanders left their homeland between 1870 and 1915 roughly a quarter of the population of iceland in 1875 a large group of icelandic immigrants migrated from ontario to manitoba leaving kinmount ontario on 25 september 1875 for gimli manitoba on the shores of lake winnipeg one of the main reasons for the choice of the colony site was the abundance of fish in lake winnipeg but according to icelandic people in manitoba their first attempts at fishing on lake winnipeg were not successful moreover the winter of 1875 1876 was one of the coldest on record in manitoba and the settlers clothes including the leather shoes from ontario were not suitable for the rigorous weather however the immigrants eventually learned to handle the ax prepare the soil fish through ice and hunt game

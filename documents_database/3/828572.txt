these intermediate filament proteins are expressed mostly in nerve cells where they are implicated in the radial growth of the axon seven genes encode for the heavy nf h medium nf m and light neurofilament nf l proteins nestin and internexin in nerve cells synemin and desmuslin synemin two alternative transcripts of the dmn gene in muscle cells and syncoilin also in muscle cells members of this group mostly preferentially coassemble as heteropolymers in tissues steinert et al has shown that nestin forms homodimers and homotetramers but does not form if by itself in vitro in mixtures nestin preferentially co assembles with purified vimentin or the type iv if protein internexin to form heterodimer coiled coil molecules structurally nestin has the shortest head domain n terminus and the longest tail domain c terminus of all the if proteins nestin is of high molecular weight 240kda with a terminus greater than 500 residues compared to cytokeratins and lamins with termini less than 50 residues after subcloning the human nestin gene into plasmid vectors dahlstrand et al determined the nucleotide sequence of all coding regions and parts of the introns in order to establish the boundaries of the introns they used the

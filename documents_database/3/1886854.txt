pure tone of period slower than the time window the second paradox is that when two pitches are very close they create a beat if the period of this beat is longer than the integration window it is seen as a sinusoidal variation in the average rating sin 2 f t sin 2 f t sin 2 ft cos 2 t where 1 is the slow period the present spectrum is made of multiple frequencies beating together resulting in a superimposition of various pitches fading in and out at different moments and pace thus forming the melody here is the program used to generate the paradoxical melody

following a double stranded break a protein complex mrx binds to either end of the break working with dna nucleases to carry out resection resulting in 5 end digest to produce 3 overhangs of single stranded dna see figure these overhangs are then bound to form a nucleoprotein filament which can then locate dna sequences similar to one of the 3 overhangs initiating a single stranded strand invasion into the dna duplex containing these sequences once strand invasion has occurred a displacement loop or d loop is formed at which point either sdsa or a double holliday junction occurs homologous recombination via the sdsa pathway occurs in both mitotic and meiotic cells as an important mechanism of non crossover recombination and was first suggested as a model in 1976 acquiring its current name in 1994 as the double holliday junction model was the first posited in order to explain this phenomenon various versions of the sdsa model were later proposed to explain heteroduplex dna configurations that did not match predictions of the double holliday junction model studies in s cerevisiae found that non crossover products appear earlier than double holliday junctions or crossover products which challenged the previous notion that

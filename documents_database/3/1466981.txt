the need for such a design arises when an aircraft is required to operate consistently in the supersonic flight regime supersonic airfoils generally have a thin section formed of either angled planes or opposed arcs called double wedge airfoils and biconvex airfoils respectively with very sharp leading and trailing edges the sharp edges prevent the formation of a detached bow shock in front of the airfoil as it moves through the air this shape is in contrast to subsonic airfoils which often have rounded leading edges to reduce flow separation over a wide range of angle of attack a rounded edge would behave as a blunt body in supersonic flight and thus would form a bow shock which greatly increases wave drag the airfoils thickness camber and angle of attack are varied to achieve a design that will cause a slight deviation in the direction of the surrounding airflow however since a round leading edge decreases an airfoil s susceptibility to flow separation a sharp leading edge implies that the airfoil will be more sensitive to changes in angle of attack therefore to increase lift at lower speeds aircraft that employ supersonic airfoils also use high lift devices such as

specialty tweeters can deliver high frequencies up to 100 khz the name is derived from the high pitched sounds made by some birds tweets especially in contrast to the low woofs made by many dogs after which low frequency drivers are named woofers nearly all tweeters are electrodynamic drivers using a voice coil suspended within a fixed magnetic field these designs operate by applying current from the output of an amplifier circuit to a coil of wire called a voice coil the voice coil produces a varying magnetic field which works against the fixed magnetic field of a magnet around which the cylindrical voice coil is suspended forcing the voice coil and the diaphragm attached to it to move this mechanical movement resembles the waveform of the electronic signal supplied from the amplifier s output to the voice coil since the coil is attached to a diaphragm the vibratory motion of the voice coil transmits to the diaphragm the diaphragm in turn vibrates the air thus creating air motions or audio waves which is heard as high sounds modern tweeters are typically different from older tweeters which were usually small versions of woofers as tweeter technology has advanced different design

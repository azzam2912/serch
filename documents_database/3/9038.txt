the natural logarithm of x is generally written as or sometimes if the base e is implicit simply parentheses are sometimes added for clarity giving ln x log x or log x this is done in particular when the argument to the logarithm is not a single symbol to prevent ambiguity the natural logarithm of x is the power to which e would have to be raised to equal x for example ln 7 5 is 2 0149 because the natural log of e itself ln e is 1 because while the natural logarithm of 1 ln 1 is 0 since the natural logarithm can be defined for any positive real number a as the area under the curve from 1 to a the area being taken as negative when a complex numbers although this leads to a multi valued function see complex logarithm the natural logarithm function if considered as a real valued function of a real variable is the inverse function of the exponential function leading to the identities like all logarithms the natural logarithm maps multiplication into addition thus the logarithm function is a group isomorphism from positive real numbers under multiplication to the group of real

examples of weakly random sources include radioactive decay or thermal noise the only restriction on possible sources is that there is no way they can be fully controlled calculated or predicted and that a lower bound on their entropy rate can be established for a given source a randomness extractor can even be considered to be a true random number generator trng but there is no single extractor that has been proven to produce truly random output from any type of weakly random source sometimes the term bias is used to denote a weakly random source s departure from uniformity and in older literature some extractors are called unbiasing algorithms as they take the randomness from a so called biased source and output a distribution that appears unbiased the weakly random source will always be longer than the extractor s output but an efficient extractor is one that lowers this ratio of lengths as much as possible while simultaneously keeping the seed length low intuitively this means that as much randomness as possible has been extracted from the source note that an extractor has some conceptual similarities with a pseudorandom generator prg but the two concepts are not identical both

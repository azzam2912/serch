the genus takes its name from the discovery of tomato spotted wilt virus tswv in australia in 1919 it remained the only member of the family until the early 1990s when genetic characterisation of viruses discovered in plants became more common there are now at least twenty viral species in the family with more being recorded and described on a relatively regular basis together these viruses have been documented infecting over eight hundred different plant species from 82 different families these viruses have a single stranded rna genome with negative polarity therefore being classified as a class v virus ssrna viruses the structure of the genome resembles that of the genus phlebovirus the genome is linear and is 17 2 kb in size it is segmented into three segments termed s 2 9kb m 5 4kb and l 8 9kb the m and s rna segments encode for proteins in an ambisense orientation tospoviruses are arboviruses usually vectored by thrips at least ten species of thrips belonging to family thripidae have been confirmed as vectors for the transmission of thirteen or more tospoviruses the thrips vectors are not closely related implying an independent origin of infection for each thrips possibly

it is characterized by the presence of multinucleated giant cells osteoclast like cells malignancy in giant cell tumor is uncommon and occurs in about 2 of all cases however if malignant degeneration does occur it is likely to metastasize to the lungs giant cell tumors are normally benign with unpredictable behavior it is a heterogeneous tumor composed of three different cell populations the giant cell tumour stromal cells gctsc constitute the neoplastic cells which are from an osteoblastic origin and are classified based on expression of osteoblast cell markers such as alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin in contrast the mononuclear histiocytic cells mnhc and multinucleated giant cell mngc fractions are secondarily recruited and comprise the non neoplastic cell population they are derived from an osteoclast monocyte lineage determined primarily by expression of cd68 a marker for monocytic precursor cells in most patients the tumors are slow to develop but may recur locally in as many as 50 of cases patients usually present with pain and limited range of motion caused by tumor s proximity to the joint space swelling may occur as well if the tumor has been growing for a long time some patients may be asymptomatic until they develop

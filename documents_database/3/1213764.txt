it has wide flaring feet and was designed to be laid direct on the ballast without requiring sleepers it was widely adopted on lightly trafficked railways but was ultimately unsuccessful because of maintenance difficulties it resembles the bridge rail used for brunel s baulk road but was of tapering form rather than with the flat base of the heavier bridge rail intended for laying onto timber in the mid nineteenth century railway networks were expanding into areas where lighter traffic was expected the first cost of conventional railway track was considerable and cheaper alternatives were sought the barlow rail offered this benefit by avoiding the cost of sleepers and chairs altogether laid directly in the ballast it required no other ancillary equipment however the rail itself was significantly heavier and more expensive than conventional rails in practice it had several disadvantages in particular there was no gauge tie so that if the ballast was poorly consolidated the rails could gradually move independently resulting in a serious derailment risk some modifications involved the provision of tie bars between opposing rails to maintain the gauge the wider and heavier rail section was considerably stiffer to lateral bending and this made smooth alignment

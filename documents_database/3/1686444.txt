it is found worldwide however recent discoveries from molecular phylogeny analysis show that chaetopterus variopedatus sensu hartman 1959 is not a single species polychaetes or marine bristle worms have elongated bodies divided into many segments each segment may bear setae bristles and parapodia paddle like appendages some species live freely either swimming crawling or burrowing and these are known as errant others live permanently in tubes either calcareous or parchment like and these are known as sedentary c variopedatus builds and lives permanently in a tough flexible papery u shaped tube buried in soft substrate with both ends protruding like little chimneys the worm itself is segmented pale coloured and up to twenty five centimetres long the anterior end is short and has bristle bearing segments and a shovel like mouth the middle section bears parapodia on the 12th segment these are modified into long wing like structures which secrete mucus and form a bag the parapodia on segments 13 14 and 15 are fused into three paddle shaped piston like structures the purpose of which is to pump water through the tube the water is drawn in through the anterior end and expelled through the posterior end passing through

the fuel air explosive fae is one of the best known types of thermobaric weapons most conventional explosives consist of a fuel oxidizer premix gunpowder for example contains 25 fuel and 75 oxidizer whereas thermobaric weapons are almost 100 fuel so thermobaric weapons are significantly more energetic than conventional condensed explosives of equal weight their reliance on atmospheric oxygen makes them unsuitable for use underwater at high altitude and in adverse weather they are however considerably more destructive when used against field fortifications such as foxholes tunnels bunkers and caves partly due to the sustained blast wave and partly by consuming the oxygen inside there are many different types of thermobaric weapons that can be fitted to hand held launchers the term thermobaric is derived from the greek words for heat and pressure thermobarikos from thermos hot baros weight pressure suffix ikos suffix ic other terms used for this family of weapons are high impulse thermobaric weapons hits heat and pressure weapons vacuum bombs or fuel air explosives fae or fax in contrast to a condensed explosive in which oxidation in a confined region produces a blast front emanating from a single source a thermobaric flame front accelerates to a

note that consistency as defined in the cap theorem is quite different from the consistency guaranteed in acid database transactions no distributed system is safe from network failures thus network partitioning generally has to be tolerated in the presence of a partition one is then left with two options consistency or availability when choosing consistency over availability the system will return an error or a time out if particular information cannot be guaranteed to be up to date due to network partitioning when choosing availability over consistency the system will always process the query and try to return the most recent available version of the information even if it cannot guarantee it is up to date due to network partitioning in the absence of network failure that is when the distributed system is running normally both availability and consistency can be satisfied cap is frequently misunderstood as if one has to choose to abandon one of the three guarantees at all times in fact the choice is really between consistency and availability only when a network partition or failure happens at all other times no trade off has to be made database systems designed with traditional acid guarantees in mind

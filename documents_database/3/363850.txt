after some experimentation before world war ii in hungary and in the black forest in germany it came into widespread use in the 1950s one of the reasons why it was not introduced earlier was the lack of suitable small and lightweight control and rectification equipment before the development of solid state rectifiers and related technology another reason was the increased clearance distances required where it ran under bridges and in tunnels which would have required major civil engineering in order to provide the increased clearance to live parts railways using older lower capacity direct current systems have introduced or are introducing ac instead of dc dc for their new high speed lines the first successful operational and regular use of the system dates back to 1931 tests having run since 1922 it was developed by k lm n kand in hungary who used ac at asynchronous traction and an adjustable number of motor poles the first electrified line for testing was budapest dunakeszi alag the first fully electrified line was budapest gy r hegyeshalom part of the budapest vienna line although kand s solution showed a way for the future railway operators outside of hungary showed a lack of

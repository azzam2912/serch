the fundamental theorem is stated in common language but its formulation is based on mathematical reasoning each decision that is made in poker can be analyzed in terms of the expected value of the payoff of a decision the correct decision to make in a given situation is the decision that has the largest expected value if a player could see all of their opponents cards they would always be able to calculate the correct decision with mathematical certainty and the less they deviate from these correct decisions the better their expected long term results this is certainly true heads up but morton s theorem in which an opponent s correct decision can benefit a player may apply in multi way pots suppose bob is playing limit texas hold em and is dealt 9 9 under the gun before the flop he calls and everyone else folds to carol in the big blind who checks the flop comes a k 10 and carol bets bob now has a decision to make based upon incomplete information in this particular circumstance the correct decision is almost certainly to fold there are too many turn and river cards that could kill his hand

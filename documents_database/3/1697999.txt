constituents submitted to the analytical laboratory must be accurately described to avoid faulty interpretations approximations or incorrect results the qualitative and quantitative data generated from the laboratory can then be used for decision making in the chemical sense quantitative analysis refers to the measurement of the amount or concentration of an element or chemical compound in a matrix that differs from the element or compound fields such as industry medicine and law enforcement can make use of aqc aqc processes are of particular importance in laboratories analysing environmental samples where the concentration of chemical species present may be extremely low and close to the detection limit of the analytical method in well managed laboratories aqc processes are built into the routine operations of the laboratory often by the random introduction of known standards into the sample stream or by the use of spiked samples quality control begins with sample collection and ends with the reporting of data aqc is achieved through laboratory control of analytical performance initial control of the complete system can be achieved through specification of laboratory services instrumentation glassware reagents solvents and gases however evaluation of daily performance must be documented to ensure continual production of valid

geared devices can change the speed torque and direction of a power source gears almost always produce a change in torque creating a mechanical advantage through their gear ratio and thus may be considered a simple machine the teeth on the two meshing gears all have the same shape two or more meshing gears working in a sequence are called a gear train or a transmission a gear can mesh with a linear toothed part called a rack producing translation instead of rotation the gears in a transmission are analogous to the wheels in a crossed belt pulley system an advantage of gears is that the teeth of a gear prevent slippage when two gears mesh if one gear is bigger than the other a mechanical advantage is produced with the rotational speeds and the torques of the two gears differing in proportion to their diameters in transmissions with multiple gear ratios such as bicycles motorcycles and cars the term gear as in first gear refers to a gear ratio rather than an actual physical gear the term describes similar devices even when the gear ratio is continuous rather than discrete or when the device does not actually contain gears

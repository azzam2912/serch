strombolian eruptions consist of ejection of incandescent cinders lapilli and lava bombs to altitudes of tens to a few hundreds of metres the eruptions are small to medium in volume with sporadic violence this type of eruption is named for the italian volcano stromboli the italian vulcanologist giuseppe mercalli studied eruptions at stromboli and vulcano in 1888 1890 and observed that the characteristic features of eruptions were different between the two to distinguish between them mercalli defined strombolian eruptions as mildly explosive at discrete but fairly regular intervals of seconds to minutes the tephra typically glows red when leaving the vent but its surface cools and assumes a dark to black colour and may significantly solidify before impact the tephra accumulates in the vicinity of the vent forming a cinder cone cinder is the most common product the amount of volcanic ash is typically rather minor the lava flows are more viscous and therefore shorter and thicker than the corresponding hawaiian eruptions it may or may not be accompanied by production of pyroclastic rock instead the gas coalesces into bubbles called gas slugs that grow large enough to rise through the magma column bursting near the top due to the

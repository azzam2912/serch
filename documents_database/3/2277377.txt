engineering controls are physical changes to the workplace that isolate workers from hazards and are considered the most important set of methods for controlling the health and safety hazards of nanomaterials after systems and facilities have been designed the primary hazard of nanomaterials is health effects from inhalation of aerosols containing nanoparticles many engineering controls developed for other industries can be used or adapted for protecting workers from exposure to nanomaterials including ventilation and filtering using laboratory fixtures such as fume hoods containment using gloveboxes and other non ventilation controls such as sticky mats research is ongoing as to what engineering controls are most effective for nanomaterials controlling exposures to occupational hazards is considered the fundamental method of protecting workers traditionally a hierarchy of controls has been used as a means of determining how to implement feasible and effective controls which typically include elimination substitution engineering controls administrative controls and personal protective equipment methods earlier in the list are considered generally more effective in reducing the risk associated with a hazard with process changes and engineering controls recommended as the primary means for reducing exposures and personal protective equipment being the approach of last resort following the hierarchy is intended

it belongs to the short scorpion toxin superfamily for isolation of slotoxin scorpions of the species centruroides noxius are milked for venom in the laboratory the crude venom is being dissolved in distilled water and spun the supernatant is separated the active fraction is then further separated the 37 amino acid peptide belongs to the charybdotoxin sub family ktx1 and was numbered member 11 ktx1 11 revealed specificity for mammalian maxik channels hslo thus was named slotoxin its sequence is h thr phe ile asp val asp cys 1 thr val ser lys glu cys 2 trp ala pro cys 3 lys ala ala phe gly val asp arg gly lys cys 1 met gly lys lys cys 2 lys cys 3 tyr val oh slotoxin reversibly blocks the high conductance calcium activated potassium channels composed of only subunits kd 1 5 nm unreversibly blocks the high conductance calcium activated potassium channels composed of and 1 subunits unreversibly and weakly blocks the high conductance calcium activated potassium channels composed of and 4 subunits it shows no activity on other potassium channels the positively charged surface c terminal of slotx has a specific short range interaction with the negatively charged pore

the values of the m z and time are defined in an inclusion list which is derived from a previous analysis targeted analysis allows the thorough analysis of all ions at all abundance range above the noise level at any time window in the experiment in contrast non targeted analysis would typically only allow detection of the most abundant 50 100 ions over the entire experiment time such limitation of non targeted analysis makes it less suitable for analyzing highly complex highly dynamic sample such as human blood serum however the methods of utilizing targeted mass spectrometry are still at a primitive stage in the sense that the inclusion list used in the targeted analysis is typically manually typed in by scientists in addition to that only one inclusion list is allowed for the entire experiment such manual process is both labor intensive and error prone this is largely due to the lack of software to control the mass spectrometer there have been some efforts in automating the generation of inclusion lists through the solution of external software in 2010 wu et al introduced a semi automatic method in an effort of identifying low abundance glyco peptide they implemented the

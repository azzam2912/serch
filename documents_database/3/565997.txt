the interface between matter and air or matter and vacuum is called a surface and studied in surface science in thermal equilibrium the regions in contact are called phases and the interface is called a phase boundary an example for an interface out of equilibrium is the grain boundary in polycrystalline matter the importance of the interface depends on the type of system the bigger the quotient area volume the greater the effect the interface will have consequently interfaces are very important in systems with large interface area to volume ratios such as colloids interfaces can be flat or curved for example oil droplets in a salad dressing are spherical but the interface between water and air in a glass of water is mostly flat surface tension is the physical property which rules interface processes involving liquids for a liquid film on flat surfaces the liquid vapor interface keeps flat to minimize interfacial area and system free energy for a liquid film on rough surfaces the surface tension tends to keep the meniscus flat while the disjoining pressure makes the film conformal to the substrate the equilibrium meniscus shape is a result of the competition between the capillary pressure and

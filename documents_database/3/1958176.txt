it was developed in 1949 by norman ramsey who built upon the ideas of his mentor isidor isaac rabi who initially developed a technique for measuring atomic transition frequencies ramsey s method is used today in atomic clocks and in the s i definition of the second most precision atomic measurements such as modern atom interferometers and quantum logic gates have a ramsey type configuration a modern interferometer using a ramsey configuration was developed by french physicist and is known as the ramsey bord interferometer bord s main idea was to use atomic recoil to create a beam splitter of different geometries for an atom wave the ramsey bord interferometer specifically uses two pairs of counter propagating interaction waves and another method named the photon echo uses two co propagating pairs of interaction waves a main goal of precision spectroscopy of a two level atom is to measure the absorption frequency formula 1 between the ground state and excited state of the atom one way to accomplish this measurement is to apply an external oscillating electromagnetic field at frequency formula 2 and then find the difference formula 3 also known as the detuning between formula 2 and formula 1 formula

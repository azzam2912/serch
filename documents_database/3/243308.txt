wankel engines were invented in the early 1960s by felix wankel a german engineer over the years displacement has been increased and turbocharging has been added mazda rotary engines have a reputation for being relatively small and powerful at the expense of poor fuel efficiency the engines became popular with kit car builders hot rodders and in light aircraft because of their light weight compact size tuning potential and inherently high power to weight ratio as is true for all wankel type engines mazda put the engine into series production with nsu ro80 and citro n gs birotor as part of the comotor joint venture between 1967 and 1977 since the end of production of the mazda rx 8 in 2012 the engine is produced only for single seater racing with the one make star mazda championship being contested with a wankel engine until 2017 the series transitioned to using a mazda branded piston engine in 2018 wankel engines can be classified by their geometric size in terms of radius rotor center to tip distance also the median stator radius and depth rotor thickness and offset crank throw eccentricity also 1 4 the difference between stator s major and minor

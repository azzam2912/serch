it seeks to understand biomolecular systems and explain biological function in terms of molecular structure structural organization and dynamic behaviour at various levels of complexity from single molecules to supramolecular structures viruses and small living systems this discipline covers topics such as the measurement of molecular forces molecular associations allosteric interactions brownian motion and cable theory additional areas of study can be found on outline of biophysics the technical challenges of molecular biophysics are formidable and the discipline has required development of specialized equipment and procedures capable of imaging and manipulating minute living structures as well as novel experimental approaches molecular biophysics typically addresses biological questions similar to those in biochemistry and molecular biology seeking to find the physical underpinnings of biomolecular phenomena scientists in this field conduct research concerned with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell including the interactions between dna rna and protein biosynthesis as well as how these interactions are regulated a great variety of techniques are used to answer these questions fluorescent imaging techniques as well as electron microscopy x ray crystallography nmr spectroscopy atomic force microscopy afm and small angle scattering sas both with x rays and neutrons saxs sans are

the bodies are located in the constellation scorpius and are about 400 light years away mass estimates of the two objects are uncertain but they are probably each higher than the brown dwarf planet dividing line of 13 jupiter masses oph1622b is located 1 94 arcseconds from oph1622a at a position angle of 182 the discovery of the pair was announced in a 2006 science article by ray jayawardhana and valentin d ivanov the objects were discovered using telescopes of the european southern observatory s new technology telescope in la silla chile the masses were originally reported to be lower at 14 and 7 jupiter masses which would have made the smaller object a planetary mass object or planemo the system was announced as the first reported binary system of objects this small however later observations and calculations have revised the masses upward close et al estimate the mass of the primary designated oph1622a as 12 21 times that of jupiter and 9 20 jupiter masses for the less massive oph1622b while luhman et al assign values of 57 and 20 jupiter masses despite the acronym oph appearing in its name implying that it may belong to the young ophiuchus

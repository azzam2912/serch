so too the adoption of digital techniques in aviation also arrived progressively at around the same time and also continues today the use of digital computers in aircraft design was developed by large aerospace companies throughout the 1970s and included technique such as cad cam structural component stress analysis using fea and for aerodynamic modelling composite materials lend themselves better than metal to fluid organic aerodynamic shapes of high efficiency and the advent of sophisticated computer aided design and modelling has led to an expansion in the use of these materials and forms digital systems also appeared in the aircraft themselves and grew steadily in sophistication the first fadec full authority digital engine control trials took place in 1968 with the first operational system entering service in 1985 the first operational fully authoritative fly by wire system was developed for the general dynamics f 16 fighting falcon and its introduction in 1978 heralded a revolution in taking over the task of ensuring stability in flight from the traditional aerodynamic stabilizers this use of relaxed static stability allowed aircraft to be made more manoeuvrable and to be given an artificial feel to aid pilots in their main task meanwhile the glass

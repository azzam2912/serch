it is also used to accelerate the effects of exposure to the environment sometimes at conditions not actually expected chamber testing involves testing and exposing products to various environmental conditions in a controlled setting climatic chamber testing and thermal shock testing are part of chamber testing climatic chamber testing is a broad category of ways to simulate climate or excessive ambient conditions exposure for a product or a material under laboratory controlled yet accelerated conditions on the other hand thermal shock testing is used to simulate how materials will react when exposed to changes in extreme climatic conditions such as going from extremely cold to extremely hot conditions in a very short period of time usually only few seconds these conditions may include manufactured samples specimens or components are placed inside the chamber and subjected to one or more of these environmental parameters to determine reliability or measure after effects such as corrosion in the case of machinery such as internal combustion engines byproducts such as emissions are monitored an environmental chamber can be a small room used both to condition test specimens and to conduct the test it can be a smaller unit that s used for conditioning test

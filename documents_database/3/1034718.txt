matthews in 1975 it takes into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes the mcc is in essence a correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted binary classifications it returns a value between 1 and 1 a coefficient of 1 represents a perfect prediction 0 no better than random prediction and 1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation the statistic is also known as the phi coefficient mcc is related to the chi square statistic for a 2 2 contingency table where n is the total number of observations while there is no perfect way of describing the confusion matrix of true and false positives and negatives by a single number the matthews correlation coefficient is generally regarded as being one of the best such measures other measures such as the proportion of correct predictions also termed accuracy are not useful when the two classes are of very different sizes for example assigning every object to the larger set achieves a high proportion of correct predictions but is not generally a useful classification the mcc can be calculated

the initial testing was done in 2008 and tested the velocity of 13 common handgun cartridges as it related to firearm barrel length in 2009 an additional three calibers were tested and in 2010 and 2011 more calibers were added also in 2011 testing was carried out to study the cylinder gap effect on the velocity of ammunition shot from revolvers all testing has been carried out as carefully as possible with no bias toward any particular manufacturer caliber or firearm in november 2008 the bbti website went online describing the tests and making the data freely available so that anyone can dig out any particular bit of information they may be interested in the website underwent a complete redesign in late 2011 with the addition of the 2011 tests the initial round of tests and most later ones tested handgun bullet velocity as it relates to the length of the barrel the bbti team wanted to test barrel lengths from 2 to 18 inches in one inch increments to have a consistent platform to test the various sizes and shapes of ammunition a gunsmith was commissioned to create a custom barrel to fit each caliber tested these barrels fit

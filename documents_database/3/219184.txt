it has one double bond and is the second simplest member of the alkene class of hydrocarbons it is a colorless gas with a faint petroleum like odor propene is a byproduct of oil refining and natural gas processing during oil refining ethylene propene and other compounds are produced as a result of cracking larger hydrocarbons a major source of propene is naphtha cracking intended to produce ethylene but it also results from refinery cracking producing other products propene can be separated by fractional distillation from hydrocarbon mixtures obtained from cracking and other refining processes refinery grade propene is about 50 to 70 a shift to lighter steam cracker feedstocks with relatively lower propene yields and reduced motor gasoline demand in certain areas has reduced propene supply in the phillips triolefin or olefin conversion technology propylene is interconverted with ethylene and 2 butenes rhenium and molybdenum catalysts are used the technology is founded on an olefin metathesis reaction discovered at phillips petroleum company propene yields of about 90 wt are achieved related is the methanol to olefins methanol to propene converts synthesis gas syngas to methanol and then converts the methanol to ethylene and or propene the process produces water

the term reciprocity law refers to a long line of more concrete number theoretic statements which it generalized from the quadratic reciprocity law and the reciprocity laws of eisenstein and kummer to hilbert s product formula for the norm symbol artin s result provided a partial solution to hilbert s ninth problem let l k be a galois extension of global fields and c stand for the id le class group of l one of the statements of the artin reciprocity law is that there is a canonical isomorphism called global symbol map where ab denotes the abelianization of a group the map formula 2 is defined by assembling the maps called the local artin symbol the local reciprocity map or the norm residue symbol for different places v of k more precisely formula 2 is given by the local maps formula 5 on the v component of an id le class the maps formula 5 are isomorphisms this is the content of the local reciprocity law a main theorem of local class field theory a cohomological proof of the global reciprocity law can be achieved by first establishing that constitutes a class formation in the sense of artin and

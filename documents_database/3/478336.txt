there are a number of forms reported an anhydrous form a dihydrate capo 2ho and a tetrahydrate capo 4ho deposition of dihydrate crystals in cartilage are responsible for the severe joint pain in cases of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease pseudo gout whose symptoms are similar to those of gout capo is commonly used as a mild abrasive agent in toothpastes because of its insolubility and nonreactivity toward fluoride crystals of the tetrahydrate can be prepared by reacting sodium pyrophosphate napo with calcium nitrate ca no at carefully controlled ph and temperature the dihydrate sometimes termed cppd can be formed by the reaction of pyrophosphoric acid with calcium chloride the anhydrous forms can be prepared by heating dicalcium phosphate at 240 500 c an amorphous phase is formed heating to 750 c forms capo heating to 1140 1350 c forms the capo the stable tetrahydrate was originally reported to be rhombohedral but is now believed to be monoclinic additionally there is an unstable monoclinic form the dihydrate is triclinic with hydrogen bonding between the two water molecules and hydrogen bonds to the o atoms on the anion an hexagonal dihydrate has also been reported the anhydrous form has 3 polymorphs and

since tires are rated for specific loads at certain pressure it is important to keep the pressure of the tire at the optimal amount tires are rated for their optimal pressure when cold meaning before the tire has been driven on for the day and allowed to heat up which ultimately changes the internal pressure of the tire due to the expansion of gases the precision of a typical mechanical gauge as shown is higher precision gauges with uncertainty can also be obtained many modern cars now come with built in tire pressure sensors that allow all four tire pressures to be read simultaneously from inside the car in 2005 most on board tire pressure monitoring systems tpms used indirect pressure monitoring the anti lock brake sensors detect one tire rotating faster than the rest and indicate a low tire pressure to the driver the problem with this method was that if tires all lost the same pressure then none would show up against the others to indicate a problem since september 2007 all new automobiles below in weight sold in the united states are required to incorporate a tire pressure monitoring system which is capable of monitoring all four

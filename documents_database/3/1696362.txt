conus cone is a rare congenital anomaly of the eye characterized by a conical protrusion on the crystalline lens capsule and the underlying cortex it can reach a diameter of 2 to 7 mm the conus may occur anteriorly or posteriorly if the bulging is spherical instead of conical the condition is referred to as lentiglobus it produces a decrease in visual acuity and irregular refraction that cannot be corrected by either spectacle or contact lenses biomicroscopically lenticonus is characterized by a transparent localized sharply demarcated conical projection of the lens capsule and cortex usually axial in localization in an early stage retro illumination shows an oil dropletconfiguration using a narrow slit the image of a conus is observed in a more advanced stage associated subcapsular and cortical opacities appear retinoscopically the oil droplet produces a pathognomonic scissors movement of the light reflex this phenomenon is due to the different refraction in the central and the peripheral area of the lens ultrasonography also can illustrate the existence of a lenticonus a scan ultrasonography may reveal an increased lens thickness and b scanultrasonography may show herniated lenticular material suggestive of a lenticonus amblyopia cataract strabismus and loss of central fixation may

mylonites can have many different mineralogical compositions it is a classification based on the textural appearance of the rock mylonites are ductilely deformed rocks formed by the accumulation of large shear strain in ductile fault zones there are many different views on the formation of mylonites but it is generally agreed that crystal plastic deformation must have occurred and that fracturing and cataclastic flow are secondary processes in the formation of mylonites mechanical abrasion of grains by milling does not occur although this was originally thought to be the process that formed mylonites which were named from the greek mylos meaning mill mylonites form at depths of no less than 4 km there are many different mechanisms that accommodate crystal plastic deformation in crustal rocks the most important processes are dislocation creep and diffusion creep dislocation generation acts to increase the internal energy of crystals this effect is compensated through grain boundary migration recrystallization which reduces the internal energy by increasing the grain boundary area and reducing the grain volume storing energy at the mineral grain surface this process tends to organize dislocations into subgrain boundaries as more dislocations are added to subgrain boundaries the misorientation across that subgrain boundary

trilinear coordinates are an example of homogeneous coordinates the ratio x y is the ratio of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides extended if necessary opposite vertices a and b respectively the ratio y z is the ratio of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sidelines opposite vertices b and c respectively and likewise for z x and vertices c and a in the diagram at right the trilinear coordinates of the indicated interior point are the actual distances a b c or equivalently in ratio form ka kb kc for any positive constant k if a point is on a sideline of the reference triangle its corresponding trilinear coordinate is 0 if an exterior point is on the opposite side of a sideline from the interior of the triangle its trilinear coordinate associated with that sideline is negative it is impossible for all three trilinear coordinates to be non positive the name trilinear coordinates is sometimes abbreviated to trilinears the ratio notation x y z for trilinear coordinates is different from the ordered triple notation a b c for actual directed distances here each of x y and z has no meaning by itself

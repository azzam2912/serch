it employs the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate also known as plp which participates in numerous enzymatic transamination decarboxylation and deamination reactions this enzyme belongs to the family of lyases specifically the carboxy lyases which cleave carbon carbon bonds the systematic name of this enzyme class is meso 2 6 diaminoheptanedioate carboxy lyase l lysine forming dap decarboxylase catalyzes the final step in the meso diaminopimelate lysine biosynthetic pathway lysine is used for protein synthesis and used in the peptidoglycan layer of gram positive bacteria cell walls this enzyme is not found in humans but the ortholog is ornithine decarboxylase dapdc is a plp dependent enzyme belonging to the alanine racemase family this enzyme is generally dimeric with each monomer containing two domains the first domain is the n terminal barrel that binds the plp to the active site lysine residue the second domain is the c terminal sandwich the active site is formed from residues present in both domains resulting in two active sites within the dimer dapdc is stereochemically specific due to the opposing chiralities at each terminus of diaminopimelate in order for the l lysine to be generated over d lysine decarboxylation must occur at the d terminus whether

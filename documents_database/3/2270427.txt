he joined georgia institute of technology in 2002 as motorola foundation chair professor in the school of electrical computer engineering he earned his education at university of california santa barbara he did research on vocal tract modeling at speech communications research laboratory scrl with hisashi wakita and then joined signal technology inc sti in 1979 while still a ph d student at ucsb advisor a h gray jr to work on a number of government sponsored research projects in 1982 he moved to the u s east coast to join bell laboratories his work includes development of vector quantization for voice applications voice coders at extremely low bit rates 800 bit s and 300 bit s robust vocoders for satellite communications fundamental algorithms in signal modeling for automatic speech recognition hidden markov models segmental clustering algorithms discriminative methods in pattern recognition and machine learning stereo and multi phonic teleconferencing and a number of voice enabled interactive communication services aside from various algorithms that are in widespread use today he is also accredited with the conceptual breakthrough of direct error minimization for pattern recognition which substantially augments the century old methodology of thomas bayes distribution estimation approach he was director of

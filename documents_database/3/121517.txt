the metacarpal bones are analogous to the metatarsal bones in the foot the metacarpals form a transverse arch to which the rigid row of distal carpal bones are fixed the peripheral metacarpals those of the thumb and little finger form the sides of the cup of the palmar gutter and as they are brought together they deepen this concavity the index metacarpal is the most firmly fixed while the thumb metacarpal articulates with the trapezium and acts independently from the others the middle metacarpals are tightly united to the carpus by intrinsic interlocking bone elements at their bases the ring metacarpal is somewhat more mobile while the fifth metacarpal is semi independent each metacarpal bone consists of a body or shaft and two extremities the head at the distal or digital end near the fingers and the base at the proximal or carpal end close to the wrist the body shaft is prismoid in form and curved so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind concave in front it presents three surfaces medial lateral and dorsal the base basis or carpal extremity is of a cuboidal form and broader behind than in front it articulates with the carpal

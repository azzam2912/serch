it is common in clothing but occurs with other items such as the tendency of dust to be attracted to and stick to plastic items in clothing static cling occurs from static electricity an electrostatic charge builds up on clothes due to the triboelectric effect when pieces of fabric rub against each other as happens particularly in a clothes dryer the separate positive and negatively charged surfaces attract each other it is especially noticeable when humidity is low allowing static electricity to build up certain substances can reduce static cling and are often included in fabric softener and dryer sheets antistatic agents which make the surfaces slightly conductive can be used on fabrics dust accumulation caused by static cling is a significant issue for computers and other electronic devices with heat generating components that need to be cooled by airflow dust is carried into the computer by the airflow created by case and component fans the accumulated dust covers metal surfaces and clogs the empty space between the fins of heatsinks diminishing the dissipation of heat and interrupting the outward flow of warm air especially for critical components such as microprocessors and memory banks this raises the risk of them

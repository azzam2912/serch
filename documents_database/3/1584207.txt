the goal of algaeparc is to fill the gap between fundamental research on algae and full scale algae production facilities this will be done by setting up flexible pilot scale facilities to perform applied research and obtain direct practical experience it is a joined initiative of bioprocess engineering and food biobased research of the wageningen university algaeparc facility algaeparc uses four different photobioreactors comprising 24 m ground surface an open pond two types of tubular reactors and a plastic film bioreactor and a number of smaller systems for the testing of new technologies this facility is unique because it is the first facility in which the productivity of four different production systems can be compared during the year under identical conditions at the same time knowledge is gained for the development of new photobioreactors and the design of systems on a production scale for the construction of the facility 2 25 m has been made available by the ministry of agriculture nature and food quality 1 5 m and the provincie gelderland 0 75 m microalgae microalgae are currently seen by some persons as a promising source of biodiesel and chemical building blocks which can be used in paint and

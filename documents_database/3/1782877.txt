neofunctionalization is an adaptive mutation process meaning one of the gene copies must mutate to develop a function that was not present in the ancestral gene in other words one of the duplicates retains its original function while the other accumulates molecular changes such that in time it can perform a different task this process is thought to be free of selective pressure because one gene copy can mutate without adversely affecting the fitness of the organism since ancestral function is retained in the other copy the process of neofunctionalization begins with a gene duplication event which is thought to occur as a defense mechanism against the accumulation of deleterious mutations following the gene duplication event there are two identical copies of the ancestral gene performing exactly the same function this redundancy allows one the copies to take on a new function in the event that the new function is advantageous natural selection positively selects for it and the new mutation becomes fixed in the population the occurrence of neofunctionalization can most often be attributed to changes in the coding region or changes in the regulatory elements of a gene it is much more rare to see major changes in

scf complexes formed by skp1 cullin and f box proteins act as protein ubiquitin ligases f box proteins interact with skp1 through the f box and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains biochemically fbx15 is a substrate receptor of an ubiquitin ligase belonging to the family of the f box proteins differently from other f box proteins fbx15 recognizes its substrate kif1 binding protein kbp in an acetylation dependent manner fbxo15 is a protein expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells it is expressed during coexpression of oct3 4 c myc klf4 and sox2 four genes identified to be important in embryonic stem cell self renewal and differentiation repression in mice having a beta galactosidase gene knocked into the fbx15 locus stain was detected in es cells early embryos from two cell to blastocyst stages and testis tissue there is an enhancer site upstream of the fbx15 encoding transcription gene that contains an octamer like binding motif and a sox like binding motif reporter gene analyses demonstrated that the es cell specific expression required this 18 bp enhancer element located approximately 500 nucleotides upstream from the transcription initiation site deletion or point mutation of either motif abolished

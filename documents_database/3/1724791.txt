it consists of a connection to a gas source a needle valve opened and closed by turning an attached dial for control of flow rate a float resting in a clear tapered tube and an outlet port it is primarily used in health care institutions during delivery of medical gases often in conjunction with other devices such as pressure gauges or pressure reducing valves when a driving pressure is applied to the inlet of a thorpe tube flowmeter the ball rises in the tapered tube until the flow rate creates an applied pressure on the ball equal to its weight the tube s shape that of a slender cone decreases the pressure behind the ball as it rises a cylindrical tube would not permit driving pressure to decrease with flow rate resulting in the ball rising to the top of the tube and allowing for no variance in readings the flow rate of a specific gas necessary to cause the float to rise to a given height is precalculated in order to calibrate a tube a variety of float shapes may be seen with older thorpe tube flowmeters and all floats should be read from the top of the float

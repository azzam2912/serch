maurice karnaugh introduced it in 1953 as a refinement of edward veitch s 1952 veitch chart which actually was a rediscovery of allan marquand s 1881 logical diagram aka marquand diagram but with a focus now set on its utility for switching circuits veitch charts are therefore also known as marquand veitch diagrams and karnaugh maps as karnaugh veitch maps kv maps the karnaugh map reduces the need for extensive calculations by taking advantage of humans pattern recognition capability it also permits the rapid identification and elimination of potential race conditions the required boolean results are transferred from a truth table onto a two dimensional grid where in karnaugh maps the cells are ordered in gray code and each cell position represents one combination of input conditions while each cell value represents the corresponding output value optimal groups of 1s or 0s are identified which represent the terms of a canonical form of the logic in the original truth table these terms can be used to write a minimal boolean expression representing the required logic karnaugh maps are used to simplify real world logic requirements so that they can be implemented using a minimum number of physical logic gates a

its main associated enzyme is delta 6 desaturase d6d however the human enzyme been shown to also catalyze some delta 8 and delta 4 desaturases in spite of naming conventions fatty acid desaturase 2 is a member of the fatty acid desaturase fads gene family desaturase enzymes cause desaturation of fatty acids through the introduction of double bonds between defined carbons of the fatty acyl chain fads family members are considered fusion products composed of an n terminal cytochrome b5 like domain and a c terminal multiple membrane spanning desaturase portion both of which are characterized by conserved histidine motifs this gene is clustered with family members fads1 and fads2 at 11q12 q13 1 this cluster is thought to have arisen evolutionarily from gene duplication based on its similar exon intron organization it was reported the fads2 interacts with breastfeeding such that breast fed children with the c version of the gene appear about 7 intelligence quotient iq points higher than those with the less common g version less than this when adjusted for maternal iq an attempt to replicate this study in 5934 8 year old children failed no relationship of the common c allele to negative effects of

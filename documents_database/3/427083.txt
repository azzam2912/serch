a pse may also assist users in formulating problem resolution a pse may also assist users in formulating problems selecting algorithm simulating numerical value and viewing and analysing results many pses were introduced in the 1990s they use the language of the respective field and often employ modern graphical user interfaces the goal is to make the software easy to use for specialists in fields other than computer science pses are available for generic problems like data visualization or large systems of equations and for narrow fields of science or engineering like gas turbine design the problem solving environment pse released a few years after the release of fortran and algol 60 people thought that this system with high level language would cause elimination of professional programmers however surprisingly pse has been accepted and even though scientists used it to write programs the problem solving environment for parallel scientific computation was introduced in 1960 where this was the first organised collections with minor standardisation in 1970 pse was initially researched for providing high class programming language rather than fortran also libraries plotting packages advent development of libraries were continued and there were introduction of emergence of computational packages and graphical

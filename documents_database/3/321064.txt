if then f may be defined as the values of 2k approach one for increasing k and comparing the series for the riesz function with that for formula 5 shows that it defines an entire function alternatively f may be defined as formula 7 denotes the rising factorial power in the notation of d e knuth and the number b are the bernoulli number the series is one of alternating terms and the function quickly tends to minus infinity for increasingly negative values of x positive values of x are more interesting and delicate it can be shown that for any exponent e larger than 1 2 where this is big o notation taking values both positive and negative riesz showed that the riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the claim that the above is true for any e larger than 1 4 in the same paper he added a slightly pessimistic note too je ne sais pas encore decider si cette condition facilitera la v rification de l hypoth se i do not know how to decide if this condition will facilitate the verification of the hypothesis the riesz function is related to the riemann zeta function via its mellin

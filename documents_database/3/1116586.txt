the latter nomenclature is recommended by the international union of basic and clinical pharmacology and is used here other previously used names for fpr1 are nfpr and fmlpr for fpr2 are fprh1 fprl1 rfp lxa4r alxr fpr2 alx hm63 fmlpx and fpr2a and for fpr3 are fprh2 fprl2 and fmlpy the overall function of fpr3 is quite unclear compared to fpr1 and fpr2 fpr3 is highly phosphorylated a signal for receptor inactivation and internalization and more localized to small intracellular vesicles this suggests that fpr3 rapidly internalizes after binding its ligands and thereby may serve as a decoy receptor to reduce the binding of its ligands to frp1 and frp2 receptors the fpr3 gene was cloned and named based on the similarity of the amino acid sequence which it encodes to that encoded by the gene for fpr1 see formyl peptide receptor 1 for details the studies indicated that fpr3 is composed of 352 amino acids and its gene similar to fpr1 has an intronless open reading frames which encodes a protein with the 7 transmembrane structure of g protein coupled receptors fpr3 has 69 and 72 amino acid sequence identities with fpr1 all three genes localize to chromosome 19q

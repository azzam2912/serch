it produces medium sized annual fruit bodies that are soft and have a strong distinct smell the fungus is a saprophyte that feeds on coniferous wood of logs lying on the ground and causes brown rot it is a rather rare species that only occurs in old growth forest the fungus was originally described by swedish mycologist lars romell in 1911 who called it polyporus lapponicus the type collection was made in nattavaara sweden where it was found growing on fir romell initially thought the fungus might be climacocystis borealis but ultimately rejected that opinion as that species has an easily breakable fruit body and its spores are of different size and shape amylocystis lapponica has been shuffled to several different polypore genera in its taxonomic history including ungulina pil t 1934 leptoporus pil t 1938 and tyromyces j lowe 1975 the fungus has microscopic characteristics that are typical of the genus tyromyces but differs by the presence of thick walled amyloid cystidia in the hymenium for this reason a bondartsev and rolf singer created the genus amylocystis in 1944 to contain the fungus polyporus ursinus proposed by curtis gates lloyd in 1915 is now considered a synonym of amylocystis

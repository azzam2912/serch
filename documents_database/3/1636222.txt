the genus was first described in 1985 based on fossil specimens from the posongchong formation wenshan district yunnan china the sporophyte of h recurvata consisted of leafless stems axes branching both dichotomously and pseudomonopodially i e with unequal divisions creating a main stem the sporangia spore forming organs were born in terminal spikes on fertile stems with the sporangia spirally arranged on stalks which curved downwards the central strand of vascular tissue contained g type tracheids it was initially provisionally assigned to the rhyniophytes however this group is defined as having terminal sporangia whereas those of huia are lateral suggesting affinity with the zosterophylls a second species h gracilis was described from the xujiachong formation pragian early emsian qujing district yunnan china it differs from h recurvata in its more slender morphology and its lack of pseudomonopodial branching the adaxial sporangia which were oval or elongated oval in shape split dehisced along their length at right angles to the stem it is suggested that huia may have originated from early cooksonia like plants others suggest that its position is uncertain a cladogram published in 2004 by crane et al places huia in a paraphyletic stem group of broadly defined zosterophylls

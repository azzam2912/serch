seven baltimore classes these types of viruses must enter the host nucleus before they are able to replicate furthermore these viruses require host cell polymerases to replicate the viral genome and hence are highly dependent on the cell cycle proper infection and production of progeny requires that the cell be in replication as it is during replication that the cell s polymerases are active the virus may induce the cell to forcefully undergo cell division which may lead to transformation of the cell and ultimately cancer examples include herpesviridae adenoviridae and papovaviridae there is only one well studied example in which a class 1 virus is not replicating within the nucleus the poxvirus family a highly pathogenic virus that infects vertebrates and includes the smallpox virus the mrna is transcribed regularly from viral dna using the host s rna polymerase ii this produces two types of mrna s 1 early mrna transcribed prior to the synthesis of viral dna and 2 late mrna transcribed from progeny dna viruses in this category include the anelloviridae circoviridae and parvoviridae which infect vertebrates the geminiviridae and nanoviridae which infect plants and the microviridae which infect prokaryotes most of them have circular genomes the

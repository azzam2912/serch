the map formula 1 is a bijection in case the ring is a finite field the dickson polynomials which are closely related to the chebyshev polynomials provide examples over a finite field every function so in particular every permutation of the elements of that field can be written as a polynomial function in the case of finite rings z n z such polynomials have also been studied and applied in the interleaver component of error detection and correction algorithms let be the finite field of characteristic that is the field having elements where for some prime a polynomial with coefficients in symbolically written as is a permutation polynomial of if the function from to itself defined by formula 2 is a permutation of due to the finiteness of this definition can be expressed in several equivalent ways a characterization of which polynomials are permutation polynomials is given by hermite s criterion is a permutation polynomial of if and only if the following two conditions hold if is a permutation polynomial defined over the finite field then so is for all and in the permutation polynomial is in normalized form if and are chosen so that is monic and provided the

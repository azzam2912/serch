it functions as a siderophore a small chelating agent with a high affinity for iron siderophores are deployed as ion scavengers for microbes siderophores solubilize compounds by forming strong complexes pdtc is secreted by the soil bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri and pseudomonas putida pdtc can be synthesized by treating the pyridine 2 6 dicarboxylic acid or its diacid dichloride with hs in dry pyridine this produces an orange 1 1 pyridinium salt of 2 6 pyridinedicarbothioate treatment of this salt with acid give pdtc which can then be extracted with dichloromethane the biosynthesis of pdtc remains unclear although some insights can be deduced from the genetics it is suggested that pseudomonas stutzeri may have acquired at least one of the genes by lateral transfer from mycobacteria in a proposed biosynthetic sequence pyridine 2 6 dicarboxylic acid a known bacterial metabolite is activated as its bis adenosine monophosphate amp derivative the sulfur donor and its activation remain uncertain pdtc binds to both fe and fe the ferric complex is brown whereas the ferrous complex is blue in the presence of air the ferrous complex oxidizes to the ferric compound it is iron selective as only the fe complex is soluble in water

it was an incremental improvement of earlier 2mv probes and was used for zond 1 zond 2 and zond 3 missions to mars as well as several venera probes it was standard practice of the soviet space program to use standardized components as much as possible all probes shared the same general characteristics and differed only in equipment necessary for specific missions each probe also incorporated improvements based on experience with earlier missions it was superseded by the 4mv family the probe consisted of three primary parts the core of the stack was a pressurized compartment called the orbital compartment this part housed the spacecraft s control electronics radio transmitters and receivers batteries astro orientation equipment and so on the compartment was pressurized to around 100 kpa and thermally controlled to simulate earth like conditions which removed the need for special electronic components that could reliably operate in extreme conditions on zond 1 the module depressurized in flight severely damaging the probe s systems mounted on the outside of the orbital compartment were two solar panels which supplied power to the spacecraft they were folded against the body of the probe during launch and were only deployed when the craft

mcr 1 the original variant is capable of horizontal transfer between different strains of a bacterial species after discovery in november 2015 in e coli strain shp45 from a pig in china it has been found in escherichia coli salmonella enterica klebsiella pneumoniae enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae it has been detected in more than 30 countries on 5 continents in less than a year the mobilized colistin resistance mcr 1 gene confers plasmid mediated resistance to colistin a polymyxin and one of a number of last resort antibiotics for treating infections the gene is found in no less than ten species of the enterobacteriaceae escherichia coli salmonella klebsiella pneumoniae enterobacter aerogenes enterobacter cloacae cronobacter sakazakii shigella sonnei kluyvera species citrobacter species and raoultella ornithinolytica the mechanism of resistance of the mcr gene is a phosphatidylethanolamine transferase the enzyme transfers a phosphoethanolamine residue to the lipid a present in the cell membrane of gram negative bacteria the altered lipid a has much lower affinity for colistin and related polymyxins resulting in reduced activity of the antimicrobial this type of resistance is known as target modification although the same mechanism has been observed before with enzymes like epta mcr 1 is

ice is very reflective therefore some of the solar energy is reflected back to space ice albedo feedback plays an important role in global climate change for instance at higher latitudes we see warmer temperatures melt the ice sheets however if warm temperatures decrease the ice cover and the area is replaced by water or land the albedo would decrease this increases the amount of solar energy absorbed leading to more warming the effect has mostly been discussed in terms of the recent trend of declining arctic sea ice the change in albedo acts to reinforce the initial alteration in ice area leading to more warming warming tends to decrease ice cover and hence decrease the albedo increasing the amount of solar energy absorbed and leading to more warming in the geologically recent past the ice albedo positive feedback has played a major role in the advances and retreats of the pleistocene 2 6 ma to 10 ma ice sheets inversely cooler temperatures increase ice which increases albedo leading to more cooling snow and ice albedo feedback tend to amplify regional warming due to anthropogenic climate change due to this amplification the cryosphere is sometimes called the natural thermometer of

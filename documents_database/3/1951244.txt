this will greatly enhance fleet air defense by making jamming more difficult and allocating defensive missiles on a battle group basis in the future cec will form a key pillar of the naval integrated fire control counter air nifc ca capability which will allow stealthy sensor platforms such as the f 35c lightning ii to act as forward observers with their observations channeled through the e 2d advanced hawkeye to less stealthy platforms such as the uclass or boeing f a 18e f super hornet in a combat situation where the united states navy would need to penetrate an anti access area denial a2 ad environment a carrier air wing would launch all of its aircraft the f 35c would use its stealth to fly deep into enemy airspace and use its sensors to gather intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr data the ea 18g growler would use the next generation jammer to provide stand off jamming or at least degradation of early warning radars when targets are detected by the f 35c they would transmit weapons quality track to the e 2d and pass that information on to super hornets or other f 35cs the f a 18e f fighters

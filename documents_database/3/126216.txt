being three times 20 it is called three score in older literature it is a composite number with divisors 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 12 15 20 30 and 60 making it a highly composite number because it is the sum of its unitary divisors excluding itself it is a unitary perfect number and it is an abundant number with an abundance of 48 being ten times a perfect number it is a semiperfect number it is the smallest number divisible by the numbers 1 to 6 there is no smaller number divisible by the numbers 1 to 5 it is the smallest number with exactly 12 divisors it is one of seven integers that have more divisors than any number less than twice itself one of six that are also lowest common multiple of a consecutive set of integers from 1 and one of six that are divisors of every highly composite number higher than itself it is the sum of a pair of twin primes 29 31 and the sum of four consecutive primes 11 13 17 19 it is adjacent to two primes 59 and 61 it is the smallest number that is the sum

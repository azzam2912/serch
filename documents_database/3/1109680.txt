additionally the terrestrial dwarf planet ceres is known to have water ice on its surface a significant amount of surface hydrogen has been observed globally by the mars odyssey grs stoichiometrically estimated water mass fractions indicate that when free of carbon dioxide the near surface at the poles consists almost entirely of water covered by a thin veneer of fine material this is reinforced by marsis observations with an estimated of water at the southern polar region with water equivalent to a global layer weg deep additional observations at both poles suggest the total weg to be while the mars odyssey ns observations places the lower bound at depth geomorphic evidence favors significantly larger quantities of surface water over geologic history with weg as deep as the current atmospheric reservoir of water though important as a conduit is insignificant in volume with the weg no more than since the typical surface pressure of the current atmosphere is less than the triple point of ho liquid water is unstable on the surface unless present in sufficiently large volumes furthermore the average global temperature is even below the eutectic freezing point of most brines for comparison the highest diurnal surface temperatures at

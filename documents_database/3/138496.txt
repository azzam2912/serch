in this sense each of the systems cannot be distinguished from the other by an observer given a labelled state transition system formula 1 formula 2 a bisimulation relation is a binary relation formula 3 over formula 1 i e formula 3 formula 1 formula 1 such that both formula 3 and its converse formula 9 are simulations equivalently formula 3 is a bisimulation if for every pair of elements formula 11 in formula 1 with formula 13 in formula 3 for all in formula 2 for all formula 16 in formula 1 and symmetrically for all formula 19 in formula 1 given two states formula 30 and formula 31 in formula 1 formula 30 is bisimilar to formula 31 written formula 35 if there is a bisimulation formula 3 such that formula 37 is in formula 3 the bisimilarity relation formula 39 is an equivalence relation furthermore it is the largest bisimulation relation over a given transition system note that it is not always the case that if formula 30 simulates formula 31 and formula 31 simulates formula 30 then they are bisimilar for formula 30 and formula 31 to be bisimilar the simulation between formula 30 and formula

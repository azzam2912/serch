it is called hyperbolic motion because the equation describing the path of the object through spacetime is a hyperbola as can be seen when graphed on a minkowski diagram whose coordinates represent a suitable inertial non accelerated frame this motion has several interesting features among them that it is possible to outrun a photon if given a sufficient head start as may be concluded from the diagram hermann minkowski 1908 showed the relation between a point on a worldline and the magnitude of four acceleration and a curvature hyperbola in the context of born rigidity max born 1909 subsequently coined the term hyperbolic motion for the case of constant magnitude of four acceleration then provided a detailed description for charged particles in hyperbolic motion and introduced the corresponding hyperbolically accelerated reference system born s formulas were simplified and extended by arnold sommerfeld 1910 for early reviews see the textbooks by max von laue 1911 1921 or wolfgang pauli 1921 see also galeriu 2015 or gourgoulhon 2013 and acceleration special relativity history the proper acceleration formula 1 of a particle is defined as the acceleration that a particle feels as it accelerates from one inertial reference frame to another if the

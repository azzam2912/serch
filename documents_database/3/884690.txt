a mechanism of this sort made using brass wheels allowed hooke to produce sound waves of a known frequency and to demonstrate to the royal society in 1681 how pitch relates to frequency for practical purposes hooke s device was soon supplanted by the invention of the tuning fork about a century and a half after hooke s work the mechanism was taken up again by savart for his investigations into the range of human hearing in the 1830s savart was able to construct large finely toothed brass wheels producing frequencies of up to 24 khz that seem to have been the world s first artificial ultrasonic generators in the later 19th century savart s wheels were also used in physiological and psychological investigations of time perception nowadays savart wheels are commonly demonstrated in physics lectures sometimes driven and sounded by an air hose in place of the card mechanism the basic device consists of a ratchet wheel with a large number of uniformly spaced teeth when the wheel is turned slowly while the edge of a card is held against the teeth a succession of distinct clicks can be heard when the wheel is spun rapidly it produces a

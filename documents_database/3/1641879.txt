the body has a moment of inertia with respect to this axis the parallel axis theorem states that if the body is made to rotate instead about a new axis which is parallel to the first axis and displaced from it by a distance then the moment of inertia with respect to the new axis is related to by explicitly is the perpendicular distance between the axes and the parallel axis theorem can be applied with the stretch rule and perpendicular axis theorem to find moments of inertia for a variety of shapes we may assume without loss of generality that in a cartesian coordinate system the perpendicular distance between the axes lies along the x axis and that the center of mass lies at the origin the moment of inertia relative to the z axis is the moment of inertia relative to the axis which is a perpendicular distance along the x axis from the centre of mass is expanding the brackets yields the first term is and the second term becomes the integral in the final term is a multiple of the x coordinate of the center of masswhich is zero since the center of mass lies at

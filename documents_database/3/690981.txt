it is present throughout the spinal cord and is most developed in the upper cervical regions the posterolateral tract contains centrally projecting axons from dorsal root ganglion cells carrying crude touch and pressure information location intensity and quality these axons enter the spinal column and penetrate the grey matter of the dorsal horn where they synapse on second order neurons in either the substantia gelatinosa of rolando or the nucleus proprius those neurons project their axon to the anterolateral quadrant of the contralateral half of the spinal cord where they give the spinothalamic tract the axons of second order neurons ultimately synapse on neurons in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus vpl of the thalamus after coursing in the spinal leminiscus after this the 3rd order neuron fibers traverse the internal capsule and the corona radiata ultimately synapsing in the post central gyrus somatosensory cortex the location of this synapse is dependent upon the somatotopic organisation of the somatosensory cortex it can be estimated according to the position on the somatosensory homunculus the posterolateral tract consists of fine fibers which do not receive their myelin sheaths until toward the close of fetal life in addition it contains great numbers of fine

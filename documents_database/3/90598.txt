to find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent one takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient or approximate gradient of the function at the current point if instead one takes steps proportional to the positive of the gradient one approaches a local maximum of that function the procedure is then known as gradient ascent gradient descent was originally proposed by cauchy in 1847 gradient descent is also known as steepest descent however gradient descent should not be confused with the method of steepest descent for approximating integrals gradient descent is based on the observation that if the multi variable function formula 1 is defined and differentiable in a neighborhood of a point formula 2 then formula 1 decreases fastest if one goes from formula 2 in the direction of the negative gradient of formula 5 at formula 6 it follows that if for formula 8 small enough then formula 9 in other words the term formula 10 is subtracted from formula 2 because we want to move against the gradient toward the minimum with this observation in mind one starts with a guess formula 12 for a local minimum of formula 5 and considers the

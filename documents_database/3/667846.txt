a metal can forms the bottom body and positive terminal of the cell an insulated top cap is the negative terminal button cells are used to power small portable electronics devices such as wrist watches pocket calculators artificial cardiac pacemakers implantable cardiac defibrillators automobile keyless entry transmitters and hearing aids wider variants are usually called coin cells devices using button cells are usually designed around a cell giving a long service life typically well over a year in continuous use in a wristwatch most button cells have low self discharge and hold their charge for a long time if not used relatively high power devices such as hearing aids may use a zinc air battery which have much higher capacity for a given size but dry out after a few weeks even if not used button cells are single cells usually disposable primary cells common anode materials are zinc or lithium common cathode materials are manganese dioxide silver oxide carbon monofluoride cupric oxide or oxygen from the air mercuric oxide button cells were formerly common but are no longer available due to the toxicity and environmental effects of mercury cells of different chemical composition made in the same size are

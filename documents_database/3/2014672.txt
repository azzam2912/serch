in a synchronous simulation with step formula 6 the number of synaptic updates per second would be formula 7 as formula 6 has to be chosen much smaller than the average interval between two successive afferent spikes which implies formula 9 giving an average of synaptic updates equal to formula 10 therefore spike driven synaptic dynamics leads to a linear scaling of computational complexity o n per neuron compared with the o n in the synchronous case developed in the 1980s adaptive solutions cnaps 1064 digital parallel processor chip is a full neural network nnw it was designed as a coprocessor to a host and has 64 sub processors arranged in a 1d array and operating in a simd mode each sub processor can emulate one or more neurons and multiple chips can be grouped together at 25 mhz it is capable of 1 28 gmac after the presentation of the rn 100 12 mhz single neuron chip at seattle 1991 ricoh developed the multi neuron chip rn 200 it had 16 neurons and 16 synapses per neuron the chip has on chip learning ability using a proprietary backdrop algorithm it came in a 257 pin pga encapsulation and drew

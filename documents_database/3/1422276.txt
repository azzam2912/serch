core math functions include blas lapack scalapack sparse solvers fast fourier transforms and vector math the routines in mkl are hand optimized specifically for intel processors the library supports intel processors and is available for windows linux and macos operating systems intel launched the math kernel library on may 9 2003 and called it blas lib the project s development teams are located in russia and the united states mkl is bundled with intel parallel studio xe intel cluster studio xe intel c fortran studio xe products as well as canopy standalone versions have not been sold for years to new customers but are now available for free the library is available free of charge under the terms of intel simplified software license which allow redistribution commercial support is available when purchased as a standalone software or as part of intel parallel studio xe or intel system studio intel mkl and other programs generated by the intel c compiler improve performance with a technique called function multi versioning a function is compiled or written for many of the x86 instruction set extensions and at run time a master function uses the cpuid instruction to select a version most appropriate for

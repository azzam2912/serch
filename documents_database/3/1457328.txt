systems of branching river channels dissect most of the sub aerial landscape each in a valley proportioned to its size whether formed by chance or necessity by headward erosion or downslope convergence whether inherited or newly formed depending on different geological factors such as weathering erosion depositional environment and sediment type different types of channel patterns can form there are two main types of channels bedrock and alluvial which are present no matter the sub classification bedrock channels are composed entirely of compacted rock with only patches of alluvium scattered throughout because the bedrock is constantly exposed it takes much less stream power to carve the channel the hydraulic force of flowing water can push and pull detached joint blocks out of their initial position and roll or drag them downstream plucking is common in jointed rocks where this occurs alluvial channels are much more common and can be large or small all large rivers and most small ones have channels that are usually lined with alluvium sediment that was carried to that channel reach by the river and that eventually will be carried farther downstream this lining of alluvium creates a protective shield over the bedrock which means it

tanenbaum to use as a simple but complete example in his teaching book structured computer organization it consists of a very simple control unit that runs microcode from a 512 words store the micro assembly language mal is engineered to allow simple writing of an ijvm interpreter and the source code for such an interpreter can be found in the book the data path is the core of the mic 1 it contains 32 bit registers buses an alu and a shifter there are 2 main buses of 32 lines or 32 bits each registers are selected by 2 control lines one to enable the b bus and the other to enable the c bus the b bus can be enabled by just one register at a time since the transfer of data from 2 registers at the same time would make this data inconsistent in contrast the c bus can be enabled by more than 1 register at the same time as a matter of fact the current value present in the c bus can be written to more than 1 register without problems the reading and writing operations are carried out in 1 clock cycle the mbr register

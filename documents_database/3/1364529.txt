each member formula 1 can be constructed as a formal series of the form where formula 3 are real numbers formula 4 is the set of rational numbers and formula 5 is to be interpreted as a positive infinitesimal the support of formula 1 i e the set of indices of the nonvanishing coefficients formula 7 must be a left finite set for any member of formula 4 there are only finitely many members of the set less than it this restriction is necessary in order to make multiplication and division well defined and unique the ordering is defined according to the dictionary ordering of the list of coefficients which is equivalent to the assumption that formula 5 is an infinitesimal the real numbers are embedded in this field as series in which all of the coefficients vanish except formula 10 if formula 24 and formula 25 are two levi civita series then one can check that the support of this series is left finite and that for each of its elements formula 30 the set formula 31 is finite so the product is well defined equipped with those operations and order the levi civita field is indeed an ordered

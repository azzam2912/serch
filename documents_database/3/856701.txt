in chemistry they are useful as evans auxiliaries which are used for chiral synthesis usually the acid chloride substrate reacts with the oxazolidinone to form an imide substituents at the 4 and 5 position of the oxazolidinone direct any aldol reaction to the alpha position of the carbonyl of the substrate oxazolidinones are mainly used as antimicrobials the antibacterial effect of oxazolidinones is by working as protein synthesis inhibitors targeting an early step involving the binding of n formylmethionyl trna to the ribosome see linezolid mechanism of action some of the most important oxazolidinones are antibiotics examples of antibiotic oxazolidinones include an oxazolidinone derivative used for other purposes is rivaroxaban which is approved by the fda for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis the first ever used oxazolidinone was cycloserine 4 amino 1 2 oxazolidin 3 one a second line drug against tuberculosis since 1956 developed during the nineties when several bacterial strains were becoming resistant against such antibiotics as vancomycin linezolid zyvox is the first approved agent in the class fda approval april 2000 the first commercially available 1 3 oxazolidinone antibiotic was linezolid discovered and developed by pharmacia upjohn in 2002 astrazeneca introduced posizolid azd2563

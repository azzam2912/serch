is a leading protein engineering company that applies its codeevolver platform technology to create high performing enzymes for improving the cost and quality of pharmaceuticals and food ingredients to enable sequencing of minute quantities of dna for medical diagnostics and to create novel biotherapeutics codexis engineers custom enzymes and microorganisms which are sometimes referred to as biocatalysts codexis proprietary technology called codeevolver is directed evolution technology based on the concept that natural genetic mutation and selection can be accelerated in the research laboratory to obtain specific improvements in the function of single proteins and multiprotein pathways codeevolver combines dna shuffling and bioinformatics with systems biology to create new biocatalysts codexis is using its work in biofuels to develop sustainable sources for the 2 million ton detergent alcohol market detergent alcohols go into household products such as shampoo and conditioner approximately 70 of detergent alcohols are derived from palm kernel oil the remaining 30 is derived from petroleum the rising price and price volatility of palm oil and crude oil combined with environmental concerns have prompted consumer product companies to seek out sustainable alternatives codexis supplies varying quantities of its enzymes to pharmaceutical companies from small to moderate quantities while they

creationists often claim that the theory of evolution lacks any practical applications however this claim has been refuted by scientists the evolutionary approach is key to much current research in biology that does not set out to study evolution per se especially in organismal biology and ecology for example evolutionary thinking is key to life history theory annotation of genes and their function relies heavily on comparative that is evolutionary approaches the field of evolutionary developmental biology investigates how developmental processes work by using the comparative method to determine how they evolved a major technological application of evolution is artificial selection which is the intentional selection of certain traits in a population of organisms humans have used artificial selection for thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals more recently such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate dna in molecular biology it is also possible to use repeated rounds of mutation and selection to evolve proteins with particular properties such as modified enzymes or new antibodies in a process called directed evolution antibiotic resistance can be a result of point mutations in the

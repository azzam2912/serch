it uses predictive arithmetic coding similar to prediction by partial matching ppm except that the input is predicted one bit at a time rather than one byte at a time dmc has a good compression ratio and moderate speed similar to ppm but requires somewhat more memory and is not widely implemented some recent implementations include the experimental compression programs hook by nania francesco antonio ocamyd by frank schwellinger and as a submodel in paq8l by matt mahoney these are based on the 1993 implementation in c by gordon cormack dmc predicts and codes one bit at a time it differs from ppm in that it codes bits rather than bytes and from context mixing algorithms such as paq in that there is only one context per prediction the predicted bit is then coded using arithmetic coding a bitwise arithmetic coder such as dmc has two components a predictor and an arithmetic coder the predictor accepts an n bit input string x x x x and assigns it a probability p x expressed as a product of a series of predictions p x p x x p x x x p x x x x the arithmetic coder maintains two

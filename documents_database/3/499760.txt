each vertex has 4 squares which pass through the vertex central axis and thus through the centre of the figure alternating with two triangles and two pentagrams another unusual feature is that the faces all occur in coplanar pairs this is also the only uniform polyhedron that cannot be made by the wythoff construction from a spherical triangle it has a special wythoff symbol 3 relating it to a spherical quadrilateral this symbol suggests that it is a sort of snub polyhedron except that instead of the non snub faces being surrounded by snub triangles as in most snub polyhedra they are surrounded by snub squares it has been nicknamed miller s monster after j c p miller who with h s m coxeter and m s longuet higgins enumerated the uniform polyhedra in 1954 if the definition of a uniform polyhedron is relaxed to allow any even number of faces adjacent to an edge then this definition gives rise to one further polyhedron the great disnub dirhombidodecahedron which has the same vertices and edges but with a different arrangement of triangular faces the vertices and edges are also shared with the uniform compounds of 20 octahedra or 20 tetrahemihexahedra

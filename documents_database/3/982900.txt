it forms predetermined bends by clamping the workpiece between a matching punch and die typically two c frames form the sides of the press brake connected to a table at the bottom and on a movable beam at the top the bottom tool is mounted on the table with the top tool mounted on the upper beam a brake can be described by basic parameters such as the force or tonnage and the working length additional parameters include the stroke length the distance between the frame uprights or side housings distance to the back gauge and work height the upper beam usually operates at a speed ranging from 1 to 15 mm s there are several types of brakes as described by the means of applying force mechanical pneumatic hydraulic and servo electric in a mechanical press energy is added to a flywheel with an electric motor a clutch engages the flywheel to power a crank mechanism that moves the ram vertically accuracy and speed are two advantages of the mechanical press hydraulic presses operate by means of two synchronized hydraulic cylinders on the c frames moving the upper beam servo electric brakes use a servo motor to drive a

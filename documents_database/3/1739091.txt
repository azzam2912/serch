the result was proved independently in 1926 by the french mathematician arnaud denjoy and the dutch mathematician julius wolff theorem let d be the open unit disk in c and let f be a holomorphic function mapping d into d which is not an automorphism of d i e a m bius transformation then there is a unique point z in the closure of d such that the iterates of f tend to z uniformly on compact subsets of d if z lies in d it is the unique fixed point of f the mapping f leaves invariant hyperbolic disks centered on z if z lies in d and disks tangent to the unit circle at z if z lies on the boundary of d when the fixed point is at z 0 the hyperbolic disks centred at z are just the euclidean disks with centre 0 otherwise f can be conjugated by a m bius transformation so that the fixed point is zero an elementary proof of the theorem is given below taken from and two other short proofs can be found in if f has a fixed point z in d then after conjugating by a m bius

they were classified in these can be defined more generally as tessellations of the sphere the euclidean plane or the hyperbolic plane each schwarz triangle on a sphere defines a finite group while on the euclidean or hyperbolic plane they define an infinite group a schwarz triangle is represented by three rational numbers p q r each representing the angle at a vertex the value n d means the vertex angle is d n of the half circle 2 means a right triangle when these are whole numbers the triangle is called a m bius triangle and corresponds to a non overlapping tiling and the symmetry group is called a triangle group in the sphere there are three m bius triangles plus one one parameter family in the plane there are three m bius triangles while in hyperbolic space there is a three parameter family of m bius triangles and no exceptional objects a fundamental domain triangle p q r with vertex angles p q and r can exist in different spaces depending on the value of the sum of the reciprocals of these integers this is simply a way of saying that in euclidean space the interior angles of

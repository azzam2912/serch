these transcripts are decoded and converted into an amino acid sequence during protein synthesis by ribosomes the pause sites of the mrnas only briefly interrupt the progress of translation within the ribosome transfer rna molecules recognize specific trinucleotide codons on the mrna and add their cognate amino acids to nascent protein chains it s been known since the 1980s that different mrnas are translated at different rates the main reason for these differences was thought to be the concentration of varieties of trna limiting the rate at which some transcripts could be decoded two techniques can localize the ribosomal pause site in vivo a micrococcal nuclease protection assay and isolation of polynomial transcript this works by taking the tissue that is extracted through a sucrose cushion with the translation elongation that inhabit it and centrifuging the whole ribosome pausing can be detected during preprolactin synthesis on free polysomes when the ribosome is paused the other ribosomes are tightly stacked together when the ribosome pauses while the translation takes place the fragments that started to translate before the pause took place is over presented however along with the mrna if the ribosome pauses then specific bands will be improved in the

light close to uv in the electromagnetic spectrum passes through the glass almost unhindered then is absorbed by the wall that then re radiates in the far infrared spectrum which does not pass back through the glass easily hence heating the inside of the building trombe walls are commonly used to absorb heat during sunlit hours of winter then slowly release the heat over night the essential idea was first explored by edward s morse and patented by him in 1881 in the 1960s it was fully developed as an architectural element by french engineer f lix trombe and architect jacques michel trombe walls work on the basic greenhouse principle that heat from the sun in the form of near visible shorter wavelength higher energy ultraviolet radiation passes through glass largely unimpeded when this radiation strikes objects the energy is absorbed and then re emitted in the form of longer wavelength infra red radiation that does not pass through glass as readily hence heat becomes trapped and builds up in an enclosed structure with high internal heat capacity and glass surfaces that face the sun how effectively objects absorb and shed radiant heat depends on a number of factors how

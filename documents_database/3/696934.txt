this kinase is a membrane bound receptor that upon neurotrophin binding phosphorylates itself autophosphorylation and members of the mapk pathway the presence of this kinase leads to cell differentiation and may play a role in specifying sensory neuron subtypes mutations in this gene have been associated with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis self mutilating behaviors intellectual disability and or cognitive impairment and certain cancers alternate transcriptional splice variants of this gene have been found but only three have been characterized to date trka is the high affinity catalytic receptor for the neurotrophin nerve growth factor or ngf as such it mediates the multiple effects of ngf which include neuronal differentiation and avoidance of programmed cell death trka is part of a sub family of protein kinases which includes trkb and trkc also there are other neurotrophic factors structurally related to ngf bdnf for brain derived neurotrophic factor nt 3 for neurotrophin 3 and nt 4 for neurotrophin 4 while trka mediates the effects of ngf trkb is bound and activated by bdnf nt 4 and nt 3 further trkc binds and is activated by nt 3 there is one other ngf receptor besides trka called the lngfr for low

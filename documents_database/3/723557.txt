the term eigenlicht dates back to the nineteenth century but has rarely been used in recent scientific publications common scientific terms for the phenomenon include visual noise or background adaptation these terms arise due to the perception of an ever changing field of tiny black and white dots seen in the phenomenon eigengrau is perceived as lighter than a black object in normal lighting conditions because contrast is more important to the visual system than absolute brightness for example the night sky looks darker than eigengrau because of the contrast provided by the stars researchers noticed early on that the shape of intensity sensitivity curves could be explained by assuming that an intrinsic source of noise in the retina produces random events indistinguishable from those triggered by real photons later experiments on rod cells of cane toads bufo marinus showed that the frequency of these spontaneous events is strongly temperature dependent which implies that they are caused by the thermal isomerization of rhodopsin in human rod cells these events occur about once every 100 seconds on average which taking into account the number of rhodopsin molecules in a rod cell implies that the half life of a rhodopsin molecule is

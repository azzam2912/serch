the specific glur subunit encoded by this gene is of the kainate receptor subtype receptor assembly and intracellular trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors are regulated by rna editing and alternative splicing these receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission and are critical for normal synaptic function two alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have been described exons of this gene are interspersed with exons from the c21orf41 gene which is transcribed in the same orientation as this gene but does not seem to encode a protein grik1 has been shown to interact with dlg4 pick1 and sdcbp a to i rna editing is catalyzed by a family of adenosine deaminases acting on rna adars that specifically recognize adenosines within double stranded regions of pre mrnas and deaminate them to inosine inosines are recognised as guanosine by the cells translational machinery there are three members of the adar family adars 1 3 with adar1 and adar2 being the only enzymatically active members adar3 is thought to have a regulatory role in the brain adar1 and adar2 are widely expressed in tissues whereas adar3 is restricted to the brain the double stranded regions of rna are formed by base pairing between residues in

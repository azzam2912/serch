it was first proposed by niels bjerrum in 1952 in order to explain the electrical polarization of ice in an electric field a hydrogen bond normally has one proton but a hydrogen bond with a bjerrum defect will have either two protons d defect or no proton l defect the unfavorable defect strain is resolved when a water molecule pivots about an oxygen atom to produce hydrogen bonds with single protons dislocations of ice ih along a slip plane create pairs of bjerrum defects one d defect and one l defect nonpolar molecules such as methane can form clathrate hydrates with water especially under high pressure although there is no hydrogen bonding of water molecules when methane is the guest molecule of the clathrate guest host hydrogen bonding often forms with guest molecules in clathrates of many larger organic molecules such as pinacolone and tetrahydrofuran in such cases the guest host hydrogen bonds result in the formation of l type bjerrum defect in the clathrate lattice oxygen atoms in alcohol or carbonyl functional groups and nitrogen atoms in amine functional groups in the guest molecules lead to transient hydrogen bonds and misoriented water molecules in the hydrate lattice

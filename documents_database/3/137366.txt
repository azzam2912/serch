dcf employs a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance csma ca with binary exponential backoff algorithm dcf requires a station wishing to transmit to listen for the channel status for a difs interval if the channel is found busy during the difs interval the station defers its transmission in a network where a number of stations contend for the wireless medium if multiple stations sense the channel busy and defer their access they will also virtually simultaneously find that the channel is released and then try to seize the channel as a result collisions may occur in order to avoid such collisions dcf also specifies random backoff which forces a station to defer its access to the channel for an extra period the length of the backoff period is determined by the following equation formula 1 dcf also has an optional virtual carrier sense mechanism that exchanges short request to send rts and clear to send cts frames between source and destination stations during the intervals between the data frame transmissions dcf includes a positive acknowledge scheme which means that if a frame is successfully received by the destination it is addressed to the destination needs to send an

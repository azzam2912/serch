formula 1 by introducing additional stabilization terms in the navier stokes galerkin formulation the finite element fe numerical computation of incompressible navier stokes equations ns suffers from two main sources of numerical instabilities arising from the associated galerkin problem equal order finite elements for pressure and velocity for example formula 2 do not satisfy the inf sup condition and leads to instability on the discrete pressure also called spurious pressure moreover the advection term in the navier stokes equations can produce oscillations in the velocity field also called spurious velocity such spurious velocity oscillations become more evident for advection dominated i e high reynolds number formula 3 flows to control instabilities arising from inf sup condition and convection dominated problem pressure stabilizing petrov galerkin pspg stabilization along with streamline upwind petrov galerkin supg stabilization can be added to the ns galerkin formulation let formula 4 be the spatial fluid domain with a smooth boundary formula 5 where formula 6 with formula 7 the subset of formula 8 in which the essential dirichlet boundary conditions are set while formula 7 the portion of the boundary where natural neumann boundary conditions have been considered moreover formula 10 and formula 11 introducing an

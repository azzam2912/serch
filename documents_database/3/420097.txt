the lov sz local lemma allows one to relax the independence condition slightly as long as the events are mostly independent from one another and aren t individually too likely then there will still be a positive probability that none of them occurs it is most commonly used in the probabilistic method in particular to give existence proofs there are several different versions of the lemma the simplest and most frequently used is the symmetric version given below a weaker version was proved in 1975 by l szl lov sz and paul erd s in the article problems and results on 3 chromatic hypergraphs and some related questions for other versions see let a a a be a sequence of events such that each event occurs with probability at most p and such that each event is independent of all the other events except for at most d of them lemma i lov sz and erd s 1973 published 1975 if then there is a nonzero probability that none of the events occurs lemma ii lov sz 1977 published by joel spencer if where e 2 718 is the base of natural logarithms then there is a nonzero probability that

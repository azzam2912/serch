the contract refers to an agreement reached by the polish united workers party and the solidarity solidarno in polish movement during the polish round table agreement the final agreement was signed on april 5 1989 as a result real political power was vested in a newly created bicameral legislature and in a president who would be the chief executive solidarno became a legitimate and legal political party perhaps the most important decision reached during the talks was to allow for partially free elections to be held in poland all seats to the newly created senate of poland were to be elected democratically as were 161 seats 35 percent of the total in sejm the remaining 65 of the seats were reserved for the communist party and its satellite parties in addition all 35 seats elected via the country wide list were reserved for the party s candidates provided they gained a certain quota of support this was to ensure that the most notable leaders of the party were elected the outcome of the election was largely unpredictable after all poland had not had a truly fair election since the 1920s so there was little precedent to go by it was

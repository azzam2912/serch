this group like other d block groups should contain four elements but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group scandium sc and yttrium y are always included but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum la and actinium ac or by lutetium lu and lawrencium lr less frequently it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements with all the lanthanides and actinides included or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium when the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides it subsumes the rare earth metals yttrium and less frequently scandium are sometimes also counted as rare earth metals three group 3 elements occur naturally scandium yttrium and either lanthanum or lutetium lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium while the choice of lutetium would be in accordance with the trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors the choice of lanthanum is in accordance with the trends in the s block which the group 3 elements are chemically more similar to they all are silvery white metals under

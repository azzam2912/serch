submerged arc furnaces are mainly used for the production of ferroalloys the nomenclature submerged means that the furnace s electrodes are buried deep in the furnace burden a reduction reaction takes place near the tip of the electrodes to facilitate the furnace s process large scale production of phosphorus uses the w hler process in this process apatites nearly always fluorapatite are reduced in the presence of carbon coke and silica gravel this is performed in a submerged arc furnace at temperatures of between 1150 and 1400c the main internal reaction is described below this main reaction produces a liquid calcium silicates slag carbon monoxide gas and the desired product phosphorus gas this process also has intermediate reactions and as such the phosphate rock created has impurities one such impurity and the most important one is iron oxide iron oxide impurities are reduced and form iron phosphides the resulting second liquid product is called ferrophosphorus iron is considered an impurity and undesirable because it requires additional carbon and power for reduction thus it locks up a certain percentage of the phosphorus another impurity is alumina this increases the slag bulk but reduces the melting point a submerge arc furnace s

microscopy is the science of investigating small objects and structures using such an instrument microscopic means invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope there are many types of microscopes and they may be grouped in different ways one way is to describe the way the instruments interact with a sample to create images either by sending a beam of light or electrons to a sample in its optical path or by scanning across and a short distance from the surface of a sample using a probe the most common microscope and the first to be invented is the optical microscope which uses light to pass through a sample to produce an image other major types of microscopes are the fluorescence microscope the electron microscope both the transmission electron microscope and the scanning electron microscope and the various types of scanning probe microscopes although objects resembling lenses date back 4000 years and there are greek accounts of the optical properties of water filled spheres 5th century bc followed by many centuries of writings on optics the earliest known use of simple microscopes magnifying glasses dates back to the widespread use of lenses in eyeglasses in the 13th century the

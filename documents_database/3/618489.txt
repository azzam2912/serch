developed in the 1940s it is named after statisticians donald cochrane and guy orcutt consider the model where formula 2 is the value of the dependent variable of interest at time t formula 3 is a column vector of coefficients to be estimated formula 4 is a row vector of explanatory variables at time t and formula 5 is the error term at time t if it is found for instance via the durbin watson statistic that the error term is serially correlated over time then standard statistical inference as normally applied to regressions is invalid because standard errors are estimated with bias to avoid this problem the residuals must be modeled if the process generating the residuals is found to be a stationary first order autoregressive structure formula 6 with the errors formula 7 being white noise then the cochrane orcutt procedure can be used to transform the model by taking a quasi difference in this specification the error terms are white noise so statistical inference is valid then the sum of squared residuals the sum of squared estimates of formula 9 is minimized with respect to formula 10 conditional on formula 11 the transformation suggested by cochrane and

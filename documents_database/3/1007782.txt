the test is based on transformations of the sample kurtosis and skewness and has power only against the alternatives that the distribution is skewed and or kurtic in the following x denotes a sample of n observations g and g are the sample skewness and kurtosis m s are the j th sample central moments and formula 1 is the sample mean frequently in the literature related to normality testing the skewness and kurtosis are denoted as and respectively such notation can be inconvenient since for example can be a negative quantity the sample skewness and kurtosis are defined as these quantities consistently estimate the theoretical skewness and kurtosis of the distribution respectively moreover if the sample indeed comes from a normal population then the exact finite sample distributions of the skewness and kurtosis can themselves be analysed in terms of their means variances skewnesses and kurtoses this has been done by who derived the following expressions and for example a sample with size drawn from a normally distributed population can be expected to have a skewness of and a kurtosis of where sd indicates the standard deviation the sample skewness g and kurtosis g are both asymptotically normal however

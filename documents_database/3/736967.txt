there are three primary types of vrla batteries sealed vr wet cell absorbent glass mat agm and gel cell gel cells add silica dust to the electrolyte forming a thick putty like gel these are sometimes referred to as silicone batteries agm absorbent glass mat batteries feature fiberglass mesh between the battery plates which serves to contain the electrolyte and separate the plates both designs offer advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional batteries and sealed vr wet cells as well as each other due to their construction the gel cell and agm types of vrla can be mounted in any orientation and do not require constant maintenance the term maintenance free is a misnomer as vrla batteries still require cleaning and regular functional testing they are widely used in large portable electrical devices off grid power systems and similar roles where large amounts of storage are needed at a lower cost than other low maintenance technologies like lithium ion lead acid cells consist of two plates of lead which serve as electrodes suspended in an electrolyte consisting of diluted sulfuric acid vrla cells have the same chemistry wet cell type vrla s contain acid in liquid form in agm and

federal communications commission fcc for the communication needs of diagnostic and therapeutic medical implants and body worn medical devices devices operating on medradio include cardiac pacemakers defibrillators neuromuscular stimulators and drug delivery systems communications spectrum for these and other similar devices is set aside at various points in the 400 mhz frequency band as well as the 2360 2400 mhz band though specifically for medical body area network mban devices the specification supersedes and incorporates a previous specification called the medical implant communication service mics the specification and nearly identical spectrum have also been created by the european telecommunications standards institute etsi with the specification largely referred to as mics meds medical data service in europe and other parts of the world the fcc created the medical implant communication service mics in 1999 in response to a petition for rule making by medtronic inc to permit use of a mobile radio device implanted in a patient for transmitting data in support of the diagnostic and or therapeutic functions associated with an implanted medical device this set aside the 402 405 mhz band and designated a low maximum transmit power eirp 25 microwatt in order to reduce the risk of interfering

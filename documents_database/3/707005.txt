each assigned record has a service number in this way the ip addresses and hostnames which have the same service number are grouped in an array in the resolution request the client will specify the service number too therefore it will get the record of the specified service number which is associated to the hostname the node x has registered the hostname angelica the default ip address of angelica is 1 2 3 4 x associates the depausceve hostname to the http service number port 80 of angelica x associates the 11 22 33 44 ip address to the ftp service number port 21 of angelica when the node y resolves angelica by default it gets 1 2 3 4 but when its web browser tries to resolve it it asks for the record associated to the http service therefore the resolution will return depausceve the browser will resolve depausceve and will finally contact the server when the ftp client of y resolves angelica it will get the 11 22 33 44 ip address if y tries to resolve a service which hasn t been associated to anything it will get the main ip 1 2 3 4 the node

it is the most important commercial compound of antimony it is found in nature as the minerals valentinite and senarmontite like most polymeric oxides sbo dissolves in aqueous solutions with hydrolysis global production of antimony iii oxide in 2012 was 130 000 tonnes an increase from 112 600 tonnes in 2002 china produces the largest share followed by us mexico europe japan and south africa and other countries 2 as of 2010 antimony iii oxide was produced at four sites in eu27 it is produced via two routes re volatilizing of crude antimony iii oxide and by oxidation of antimony metal oxidation of antimony metal dominates in europe several processes for the production of crude antimony iii oxide or metallic antimony from virgin material the choice of process depends on the composition of the ore and other factors typical steps include mining crushing and grinding of ore sometimes followed by froth flotation and separation of the metal using pyrometallurgical processes smelting or roasting or in a few cases e g when the ore is rich in precious metals by hydrometallurgical processes these steps do not take place in the eu but closer to the mining location step 1 crude stibnite

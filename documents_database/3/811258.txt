these chemical parameters are useful because the relative proportions of alkalis and silica play an important role in determining actual mineralogy and normative mineralogy the classification appears to be and can be simple to use for rocks that have been chemically analyzed except for the following quotation from johannsen 1937 this entry is based upon le maitre and others 2002 tas stands for total alkali silica before using the tas or any other classification however the following words of johannsen 1937 should be kept in mind the subtitle of the classification chapter by johannsen 1937 is chacun a son go t to each his own taste furthermore as discussed in considerable detail by le maitre and others 2002 the classification cannot be applied to all volcanic rocks certain rocks cannot be named using the diagram for others additional chemical mineralogic or textural criteria must be used as for lamprophyres the tas classification should be applied only to rocks for which the mineral mode cannot be determined otherwise use a scheme based on mineralogy such as the qapf diagram or one of the other diagrams presented in the entry for igneous rocks before classifying rocks using the tas diagram the chemical

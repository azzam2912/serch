because of a lack of historical data this list is incomplete and there may be gaps the high priests like all levitical priests belonged to the aaronic line the bible mentions the majority of high priests before the captivity but does not give a complete list of office holders lists would be based on various historical sources in several periods of gentile rule high priests were appointed and removed by kings still most high priests came from the aaronic line one exception is menelaus who may not have been from the tribe of levi at all but from the tribe of benjamin the following section is based on information found in the various books of the bible including the genealogies given in first book of chronicles and the book of ezra the works of josephus and the early medieval seder olam zutta though phinehas and his descendants are not directly attested as high priests this portion of the genealogy given in is assumed by other sources including josephus and seder olam zutta to give the succession of the office from father to son at some time the office was transferred from descendants of eleazar to those of his brother itamar

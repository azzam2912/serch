the theory proposes that the visual input is matched against structural representations of objects in the brain these structural representations consist of geons and their relations e g an ice cream cone could be broken down into a sphere located above a cone only a modest number of geons recognition by components theory one issue that generated some discussion was the finding that the geons were viewpoint invariant with little or no cost in the speed or accuracy of recognizing or matching a geon from an orientation in depth not previously experienced some studies reported modest costs in matching geons at new orientations in depth but these studies had several methodological shortcomings there is much research out about geons and how they are interpreted an important study happening now is one that is looking at how the scrambling of geons impacts image recognition in pigeons kim kirkpatrick steger edward a wasserman and irving biederman are conducting this research and have found that the individual geons along with their spatial composition are important in recognition furthermore the findings in this research seem to indicate that non accidental sensitivity can be found in all shape discriminating species

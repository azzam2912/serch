the pcb is the manifestation of a process in an operating system the role of the pcbs is central in process management they are accessed and or modified by most os utilities including those involved with scheduling memory and i o resource access and performance monitoring it can be said that the set of the pcbs defines the current state of the operating system data structuring for processes is often done in terms of pcbs for example pointers to other pcbs inside a pcb allow the creation of those queues of processes in various scheduling states ready blocked etc that was previously mentioned in modern sophisticated multitasking systems the pcb stores many different items of data all needed for correct and efficient process management though the details of these structures are obviously system dependent we can identify some very common parts and classify them in three main categories the approach commonly followed to represent this information is to create and update status tables for each relevant entity like memory i o devices files and processes memory tables for example may contain information about the allocation of main and secondary virtual memory for each process authorization attributes for accessing memory areas

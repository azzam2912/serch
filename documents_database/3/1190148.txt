from the heavy industry in the east where peters creek enters the monongahela river to the commercial northeast the suburban northern communities and the still rural and farming south the watershed is a veritable patchwork of land use types there is also a county park a turnpike a landfill and a coal mining legacy to add to the mix some communities are relatively stable while others are undergoing rapid development peters creek and its tributaries provide utility to them all in a myriad of ways peters creek also collects numerous unnamed tributaries along its course because of past water quality issues peters creek was not considered to have any recreational purpose but since the 1990s the water quality has improved dramatically once plagued with garbage and acid mine drainage the water quality is now high enough to support its own fish population which includes trout bass catfish carp and bluegill it is now again possible to enjoy the stream through such activities as fishing swimming and during high water kayaking there is also a new bike trail that runs along its bank formerly part of the montour railroad

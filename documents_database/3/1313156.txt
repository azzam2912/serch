developed at the baldwin locomotive works it featured two pistons moving in parallel driving a common crosshead and controlled by a common valve gear using a single complex piston valve the claimed advantage for this arrangement as with other compounding arrangements was greater economy due to lower fuel and water consumption in practice uneven forces at the crosshead produced excess wear with increased maintenance costs thus offsetting any fuel economies the integration of the compounding system into the smokebox saddle made conversion to conventional engines straightforward so most vauclain compounds were so converted and led normal lives thereafter the only known operable example is manitou and pikes peak railway 4 which is preserved on site along with the static display of its sister 5 the key to the vauclain compound is its valve system in essence there is an extra system of valves concentric with the usual middle steam passage in conventional single expansion piston valves this passage connects the high pressure cylinder exhaust to the low pressure cylinder intake the driving pistons are rigidly connected to either side of the crosshead so that they move in concert as high pressure steam is admitted to one side of the high

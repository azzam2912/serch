this is in contrast to flow sampling where the relationship of interest deals with duration or survival analysis in stock sampling rather than focusing on transitions within a certain time interval we only have observations at a certain point in time this can lead to both left and right censoring imposing the same model on data that have been generated under the two different sampling regimes can lead to research reaching fundamentally different conclusions if the joint distribution across the flow and stock samples differ sufficiently stock sampling essentially leads to a sample selection problem this selection issue is akin to the truncated regression model where we face selection on the basis of a binary response variable but the problem has been referred to as length biased sampling in this specific context consider for example the figure below that plots some duration data if a researcher would revert to stock sampling and only sample and survey individuals at the survey dates i e the survey data 12 months after the survey date etc there is a high likelihood the short duration spells will be omitted from the sample as some durations shorter than 12 months are necessarily omitted from the

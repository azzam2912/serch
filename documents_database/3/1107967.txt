this protein is one of the 17 essential subunits alpha subunits 1 7 constitutive beta subunits 1 7 and inducible subunits including beta1i beta2i beta5i that contributes to the complete assembly of 20s proteasome complex in particular proteasome subunit beta type 1 along with other beta subunits assemble into two heptameric rings and subsequently a proteolytic chamber for substrate degradation the eukaryotic proteasome recognized degradable proteins including damaged proteins for protein quality control purpose or key regulatory protein components for dynamic biological processes an essential function of a modified proteasome the immunoproteasome is the processing of class i mhc peptides the gene psmb1 encodes a member of the proteasome b type family also known as the t1b family that is a 20s core beta subunit this gene is tightly linked to the tbp tata binding protein gene in human and in mouse and is transcribed in the opposite orientation in both species the gene has 6 exons and locates at chromosome band 6q27 the human protein proteasome subunit beta type 1 is 26 5 kda in size and composed of 241 amino acids the calculated theoretical pi of this protein is 8 27 the proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex

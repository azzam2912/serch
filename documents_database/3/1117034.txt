these materials are double salts which means that they contain two different cations m and m crystallized in the same regular ionic lattice the univalent cation can be potassium rubidium cesium ammonium nh deuterated ammonium nd or thallium sodium or lithium ions are too small the divalent cation can be magnesium vanadium chromium manganese iron cobalt nickel copper zinc or cadmium in addition to sulfate and selenate the divalent anion can be chromate cro tetrafluoroberyllate bef hydrogenphosphate hpo or monofluorophosphate pof tutton s salts crystallize in the monoclinic space group p 2 a the robustness is the result of the complementary hydrogen bonding between the tetrahedral anions and cations as well their interactions with the metal aquo complex m ho perhaps the best known is mohr s salt ferrous ammonium sulfate nh fe so ho other examples include the vanadous tutton salt nh v so ho and the chromous tutton salt nh cr so ho in solids and solutions the m ion exists as a metal aquo complex m ho related to the tutton s salts are the alums which are also double salts but with the formula mm so ho the tutton s salts were once termed false alums

histological classification systems group lung cancers according to the appearance of the cells and surrounding tissues when they are viewed under a microscope clinical classification systems divide lung cancers into groups based on medical criteria particularly their response to different treatment regimens before the mid 1900s lung cancer was considered to be a single disease entity with all forms treated similarly in the 1960s small cell lung carcinoma sclc was recognized as a unique form of lung cancer based both on its appearance histology and its clinical properties including much greater susceptibility to chemotherapy and radiation more rapid growth rate and its propensity to metastasize widely early on in its course since then most oncologists have based patient treatment decisions on a dichotomous division of lung cancers into sclc and non small cell lung carcinomas nsclc with the former being treated primarily with chemoradiation and the latter with surgery an explosion of new knowledge accumulated mainly over the last 20 years has proved that lung cancers should be considered an extremely heterogeneous family of neoplasms with widely varying genetic biological and clinical characteristics particularly their responsiveness to the large number of newer treatment protocols well over 50 different histological variants

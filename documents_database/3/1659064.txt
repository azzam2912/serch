it is indicated for the treatment of vascular diseases this is a neuromuscular stimulator developed by an american scientist jozef cywinski veinoplus is composed of a pocket size device linked to two electrodes the device has three buttons a central one to turn on and off the device and two buttons marked and to adjust the intensity of stimulation the electrodes have to be placed on the calf either both electrodes on one calf if the venous disease affects only one leg or one electrode on each calf if the pathology concerns both legs veinoplus technology is based on the principle of electrostimulation thanks to a 9v battery the device delivers electrical impulses with low frequency and low voltage input power is below 0 3w and output power is under 0 05w the difference between veinoplus and others electrical muscle stimulators is due to the waveform of the impulses with this unique waveform the electrical field can deeply get through the calf and so stimulate an important volume of tissue as a consequence veinoplus triggers deep muscular contractions even if both electrodes are over one meter apart for instance with one electrode on each calf veinoplus produces safe and painless

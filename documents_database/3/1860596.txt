it allows the creation of larger types such as universes than inductive types the types created still remain predicative inside itt an inductive definition is given by rules for generating elements of a type one can then define functions from that type by induction on the way the elements of the type are generated induction recursion generalizes this situation since one can simultaneously define the type and the function because the rules for generating elements of the type are allowed to refer to the function induction recursion can be used to define large types including various universe constructions it increases the proof theoretic strength of type theory substantially nevertheless inductive recursive recursive definitions are still considered predicative induction recursion came out of investigations to the rules of martin l f s intuitionistic type theory the type theory has a number of type formers and four kinds of rules for each one martin l f had hinted that the rules for each type former followed a pattern which preserved the properties of the type theory e g strong normalization predicativity researchers started looking for the most general description of the pattern since that would tell what kinds of type formers could

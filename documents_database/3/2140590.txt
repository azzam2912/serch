it says that a heterogeneous resource cake can be divided among n partners with different valuations in a way that is both pareto efficient pe and envy free ef thus it is possible to divide a cake fairly without compromising on economic efficiency moreover weller s theorem says that there exists a price such that the allocation and the price are a competitive equilibrium ce with equal incomes ei thus it connects two research fields which were previously unrelated fair cake cutting and general equilibrium fair cake cutting has been studied since the 1940s there is a heterogeneous divisible resource such as a cake or a land estate there are n partners each of whom has a personal value density function over the cake the value of a piece to a partner is the integral of his value density over that piece this means that the value is a nonatomic measure over the cake the envy free cake cutting problem is to partition the cake to n disjoint pieces one piece per agent such for each agent the value of his piece is weakly larger than the values of all other pieces so no agent envies another agent s share

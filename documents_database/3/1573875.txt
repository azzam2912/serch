a relative of thurstan the archbishop of york osbert probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative after thurstan s death osbert was opposed to one of the candidates for the archbishopric william fitzherbert and worked to secure fitzherbert s deposition and replacement by henry murdac after murdac s death in 1153 osbert tried to prevent the return of fitzherbert but these attempts were unsuccessful when fitzherbert died suddenly in 1154 osbert was accused of murdering the newly returned archbishop although he was never convicted of the murder in either a secular or an ecclesiastical court he was stripped of his clerical status and became a layman before 1158 he died after 1184 perhaps even after 1194 osbert was first mentioned in the historical record between 1121 and 1128 when he appears in a charter which although likely a forgery probably contains an authentic witness list this document lists him as osbert archdeacon which means that he probably held the archdeaconry of richmond he was the nephew of thurstan who was archbishop of york from 1114 to 1140 presumably he owed his position as archdeacon to his uncle and was probably appointed at a young age a charter of thurstan

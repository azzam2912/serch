his main research interests are in stellar dynamics heggie has conducted pioneering theoretical research on the topic of the classical gravitational n body problem with a particular focus on the three body problem and related applications to the dynamical evolution of globular star clusters and high performance computing the article in which he presented the theory of binary evolution in stellar dynamics often referred to as heggie s law has found an outstanding spectrum of applications in many astrophysical domains one of the originators of the current paradigm of the dynamical evolution of collisional stellar systems he has made seminal contributions also to the quantitative study of prehistoric mathematics and astronomy on these subjects he has authored or co authored of two books the gravitational million body problem a multidisciplinary approach to star cluster dynamics and megalithic science ancient mathematics and astronomy in north west europe educated at george heriot s school in edinburgh scotland captain and dux 1965 he spent a decade as an undergraduate student wrangler 1968 graduate student phd 1973 and research fellow 1972 1976 at trinity college cambridge and institute of theoretical astronomy following his appointment to a lectureship 1975 at the then department of mathematics

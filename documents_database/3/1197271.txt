the format defines the math for three functions slope offset and power each function uses a number for the red green and blue color channels for a total of nine numbers comprising a single color decision a tenth number saturation specified in the version 1 2 release applies to the r g and b color channels in combination the asc cdl was developed by the asc technology committee a combined group of cinematographers post production engineers and other motion picture industry professionals although the basic controls of most color correction systems are similar they differ somewhat in specific implementation and detail the asc cdl is a common standard that color correctors can translate their proprietary settings to and from the asc cdl functions are mathematically orthogonal primitives that can be used to represent vendor specific corrections asc cdl correction functions also in some cases can appear in the user interface and be used directly the asc cdl allows color corrections made with one device at one location to be applied or modified by other devices elsewhere for example a cinematographer filming on location can create a color correction with a small portable device sending the asc cdl color correction to

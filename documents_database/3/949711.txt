because biological evolution is always autoconstructive this term mainly occurs in evolutionary computation to distinguish artificial life type systems from conventional genetic algorithms where the ga performs replication artificially the term was coined by lee spector autoconstructive evolution is a good platform for answering theoretical questions about the evolution of evolvability preliminary evidence suggests that the way in which offspring are generated changes substantially over the course of evolution by studying these patterns we can begin to understand how evolving systems organize themselves to evolve faster ultimately such an understanding could allow us to improve our ability to solve problems with evolutionary computation this increased ability for the process of self replication to evolve is also thought to be important for recreating the open ended evolutionary process observed on earth a relatively simple form of autoconstruction occurs in systems such as tierra and avida in these systems programs replicate themselves by allocating space in memory for their offspring and then looping over all of the instructions in their genome and copying each into the newly allocated space this is autoconstruction in that the programs are responsible for determining what code ends up in the offspring programs most commonly make exact

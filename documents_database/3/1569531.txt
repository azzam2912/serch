the constraint can be used as a way to incorporate expressive prior knowledge into the model and bias the assignments made by the learned model to satisfy these constraints the framework can be used to support decisions in an expressive output space while maintaining modularity and tractability of training and inference models of this kind have recently attracted much attention within the natural language processing nlp community formulating problems as constrained optimization problems over the output of learned models has several advantages it allows one to focus on the modeling of problems by providing the opportunity to incorporate domain specific knowledge as global constraints using a first order language using this declarative framework frees the developer from low level feature engineering while capturing the problem s domain specific properties and guarantying exact inference from a machine learning perspective it allows decoupling the stage of model generation learning from that of the constrained inference stage thus helping to simplify the learning stage while improving the quality of the solutions for example in the case of generating compressed sentences rather than simply relying on a language model to retain the most commonly used n grams in the sentence constraints can be used

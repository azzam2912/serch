these surfaces were first studied by and are named after bernhard riemann riemann surfaces can be thought of as deformed versions of the complex plane locally near every point they look like patches of the complex plane but the global topology can be quite different for example they can look like a sphere or a torus or several sheets glued together the main interest in riemann surfaces is that holomorphic functions may be defined between them riemann surfaces are nowadays considered the natural setting for studying the global behavior of these functions especially multi valued functions such as the square root and other algebraic functions or the logarithm every riemann surface is a two dimensional real analytic manifold i e a surface but it contains more structure specifically a complex structure which is needed for the unambiguous definition of holomorphic functions a two dimensional real manifold can be turned into a riemann surface usually in several inequivalent ways if and only if it is orientable and metrizable so the sphere and torus admit complex structures but the m bius strip klein bottle and real projective plane do not geometrical facts about riemann surfaces are as nice as possible and they

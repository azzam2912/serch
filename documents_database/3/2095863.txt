originally developed in the 1960s for reverse osmosis applications hollow fiber membranes have since become prevalent in water treatment desalination cell culture medicine and tissue engineering most commercial hollow fiber membranes are packed into cartridges which can be used for a variety of liquid and gaseous separations hfms are commonly produced using artificial polymers the specific production methods involved are heavily dependent on the type of polymer used as well as its molecular weight hfm production commonly referred to as spinning can be divided into four general types common to each of these methods is the use of a spinneret a device containing a needle through which solvent is extruded and an annulus through which a polymer solution is extruded as the polymer is extruded through the annulus of the spinneret it retains a hollow cylindrical shape as the polymer exits the spinneret it solidifies into a membrane through a process known as phase inversion the properties of the membrane such as average pore diameter and membrane thickness can be finely tuned by changing the dimensions of the spinneret temperature and composition of dope polymer and bore solvent solutions length of air gap for dry jet wet spinning temperature and

however there are many exceptions including processes and concepts such as various forms of apomixis autogamy automixis cloning or parthenogenesis the cells of the germline commonly are called germ cells for example gametes such as the sperm or the egg are part of the germline so are the cells that divide to produce the gametes called gametocytes the cells that produce those called gametogonia and all the way back to the zygote the cell from which the individual developed in sexually reproducing organisms cells that are not in the germline are called somatic cells according to this view mutations recombinations and other genetic changes in the germline may be passed to offspring but a change in a somatic cell will not be this need not apply to somatically reproducing organisms such as some porifera and many plants for example many varieties of citrus plants in the rosaceae and some in the asteraceae such as taraxacum produce seeds apomictically when somatic diploid cells displace the ovule or early embryo in an earlier stage of genetic thinking the distinction between germline and somatic cell was clear cut for example august weismann proposed and pointed out a germline cell is immortal in the

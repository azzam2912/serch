i was just the guitar player before and had never sung in my life and cash our bassist told me to sing because he liked my voice at the time i was embarrassed and thought he was crazy but it seemed to have turned out pretty well the songs on the glitz ep are so old and even though they hold a special place in our hearts because those were some of the first songs we wrote the ep was self released by the band and it is now very rare and out of print the only way to listen to the tracks is to download them from a file sharing service it was well received by fans who had been eagerly anticipating a release to accompany the songs on the band s myspace the band s sound has changed since the release of this ep and the band acknowledges this change many fans like the sound from glitz better than the band s lp whisper war but the band realizes they had to mature at some point alex deleon had this to say about the change in the band s sound we have definitely grown from the glitz songs

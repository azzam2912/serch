it captures the internal reality of the program as well as is possible most likely this is also the default format of the application a native file format therefore most likely has a one to one relationship with the applications features in turn a foreign format is not a true reflection of application internals even though it may be supported by an application to read a foreign file causes translation of data this can cause data loss and further editing may prevent faithful writing back to the foreign format a document writer application may support a multitude of files ranging from simple text files that only store characters and not font faces or sizes to complex documents containing text effects and images however when these text files or documents are opened they are not necessarily edited in their original format instead the document writer may first convert the file into its own native data structure once the file is done being edited the application will then convert the file back to its original format in some cases applications may be able to open import files but not save export them in the same format this may be due to licensing

coagulation is a chemical process that involves neutralization of charge whereas flocculation is a physical process and does not involve neutralization of charge the coagulation flocculation process can be used as a preliminary or intermediary step between other water or wastewater treatment processes like filtration and sedimentation iron and aluminium salts are the most widely used coagulants but salts of other metals such as titanium and zirconium have been found to be highly effective as well coagulation is affected by the type of coagulant used its dose and mass ph and initial turbidity of the water that is being treated and properties of the pollutants present the effectiveness of the coagulation process is also affected by pretreatments like oxidation in a colloidal suspension particles will settle very slowly or not at all because the colloidal particles carry surface electrical charges that mutually repel each other this surface charge is most commonly evaluated in terms of zeta potential the electrical potential at the slipping plane to induce coagulation a coagulant typically a metallic salt with the opposite charge is added to the water to overcome the repulsive charge and destabilize the suspension for example the colloidal particles are negatively charged and

in older classifications it used to be the only family of the order plantaginales but numerous phylogenetic studies summarized by the angiosperm phylogeny group have demonstrated that this taxon should be included within lamiales the plantain family as traditionally circumscribed consisted of only three genera bougueria littorella and plantago however phylogenetic research has indicated that plantaginaceae s s s s sensu stricto in the strict sense were nested within scrophulariaceae but forming a group that did not include the type genus of that family scrophularia although veronicaceae 1782 is the oldest family name for this group plantaginaceae 1789 is a conserved name under the international code of botanical nomenclature icbn and thus has priority over any earlier family name for a family including plantago furthermore the icbn does not consider family names published before 1789 to be names eligible for conservation thus ruling out veronicaceae the name antirrhinaceae has been proposed for conservation over plantaginaceae in the meantime the angiosperm phylogeny group has accepted the name plantaginaceae however olmstead 2003 has chosen to use the name veronicaceae a later synonym plantaginaceae s l s l sensu lato in the broad sense are a diverse cosmopolitan family occurring mostly in temperate

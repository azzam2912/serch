all systems receive data received from remote sensors measuring process variables pvs compare these with desired set points sps and derive command functions which are used to control a process through the final control elements fces such as control valves the larger systems are usually implemented by supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems or distributed control systems dcs and programmable logic controllers plcs though scada and plc systems are scalable down to small systems with few control loops such systems are extensively used in industries such as chemical processing pulp and paper manufacture power generation oil and gas processing and telecommunications the simplest control systems are based around small discrete controllers with a single control loop each these are usually panel mounted which allows direct viewing of the front panel and provides means of manual intervention by the operator either to manually control the process or to change control setpoints originally these would be pneumatic controllers a few of which are still in use but nearly all are now electronic quite complex systems can be created with networks of these controllers communicating using industry standard protocols networking allow the use of local or remote scada operator interfaces and enables

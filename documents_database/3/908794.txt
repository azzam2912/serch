pruning starts near the time of birth and continues into the mid 20s it was traditionally considered to be complete by the time of sexual maturation but this has been discounted by mri studies the infant brain will increase in size by a factor of up to 5 by adulthood reaching a final size of approximately 86 8 billion neurons two factors contribute to this growth the growth of synaptic connections between neurons and the myelination of nerve fibers the total number of neurons however remains the same pruning is influenced by environmental factors and is widely thought to represent learning after adolescence the volume of the synaptic connections decreases again due to synaptic pruning at birth the neurons in the visual and motor cortices have connections to the superior colliculus spinal cord and pons the neurons in each cortex are selectively pruned leaving connections that are made with the functionally appropriate processing centers therefore the neurons in the visual cortex prune the synapses with neurons in the spinal cord and the motor cortex severs connections with the superior colliculus this variation of pruning is known as large scaled stereotyped axon pruning neurons send long axon branches to appropriate and

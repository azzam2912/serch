such a grid does not have a straightforward relationship to latitude and longitude but conforms to many of the main criteria for a statistically valid discrete global grid primarily the cells area and shape are generally similar especially near the poles where many other spatial grids have singularities or heavy distortion the popular quaternary triangular mesh qtm falls into this category geodesic grids may use the dual polyhedron of the geodesic polyhedron which is the goldberg polyhedron goldberg polyhedra are made up of hexagons and if based on the icosahedron 12 pentagons one implementation that uses an icosahedron as the base polyhedron hexagonal cells and the snyder equal area projection is known as the icosahedron snyder equal area isea grid in biodiversity science geodesic grids are a global extension of local discrete grids that are staked out in field studies to ensure appropriate statistical sampling and larger multi use grids deployed at regional and national levels to develop an aggregated understanding of biodiversity these grids translate environmental and ecological monitoring data from multiple spatial and temporal scales into assessments of current ecological condition and forecasts of risks to our natural resources a geodesic grid allows local to global assimilation of

degradation is important in biomedicine for many reasons degradation of the polymeric implant means surgical intervention may not be required in order to remove the implant at the end of its functional life eliminating the need for a second surgery in tissue engineering biodegradable polymers can be designed such to approximate tissues providing a polymer scaffold that can withstand mechanical stresses provide a suitable surface for cell attachment and growth and degrade at a rate that allows the load to be transferred to the new tissue in the field of controlled drug delivery biodegradable polymers offer tremendous potential either as a drug delivery system alone or in conjunction to functioning as a medical device in the development of applications of biodegradable polymers the chemistry of some polymers including synthesis and degradation is reviewed below a description of how properties can be controlled by proper synthetic controls such as copolymer composition special requirements for processing and handling and some of the commercial devices based on these materials are discussed when investigating the selection of the polymer for biomedical applications important criteria to consider are mechanical performance of a biodegradable polymer depends on various factors which include monomer selection initiator selection process

built in the persian achaemenid empire and dating to approximately 480 470 bc the chamber topped a tall pillar and was decorated with marble panels carved in bas relief the tomb was built for an iranian prince or governor of xanthus perhaps kybernis the marble chamber is carved in the greek archaic style along with much other material in xanthos it is heavily influenced by greek art but there are also indications of non greek influence in the carvings the reliefs are reminiscent of reliefs at persepolis the monument takes its name from the four carved female winged figures resembling harpies the identities of the carved figures and the meaning of the scenes depicted are uncertain but it is generally now agreed that the winged creatures are not harpies the lycians absorbed much of greek mythology into their own culture and the scenes may represent greek deities but it is also possible they are unknown lycian deities an alternative interpretation is that they represent scenes of judgement in the afterlife and scenes of supplication to lycian rulers the carvings were removed from the tomb in the 19th century by archaeologist charles fellows and taken to england fellows visited lycia in

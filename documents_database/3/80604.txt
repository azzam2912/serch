music cds often included music videos wallpapers and other various content however more recently acts wishing to include enhanced content often include a dvd instead with the disadvantage of it not playing in a cd audio player but with the advantage of storing greater amounts of data and or higher quality video sometimes computer cd ripping programs particularly cdparanoia and cdburnerxp have problems ripping some enhanced cds especially those that have the data in a separate section after the audio section these cds have the data 11 400 sectors 2m32s after the audio but some cd rippers may try to rip this blank section with the last track the end result is that the ripper stalls during the last track or simply reports errors

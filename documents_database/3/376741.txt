the resulting force is proportional to the velocity but acts in the opposite direction slowing the motion and absorbing energy it is commonly used in conjunction with a spring which acts to resist displacement the process and instrumentation diagram p id symbol for a dashpot is two common types of dashpots exist linear and rotary linear dashpots are generally specified by stroke amount of linear displacement and damping coefficient force per velocity rotary dashpots will have damping coefficients in torque per angular velocity a less common type of dashpot is an eddy current damper which uses a large magnet inside a tube constructed of a non magnetic but conducting material such as aluminium or copper like a common viscous damper the eddy current damper produces a resistive force proportional to velocity dashpots frequently use a one way mechanical bypass to permit fast unrestricted motion in one direction and slow motion using the dashpot in the opposite direction this permits for example a door to be opened quickly without added resistance but then to close slowly using the dashpot for hydraulic dashpots this unrestricted motion is accomplished using a one way check valve that allows fluid to bypass the dashpot fluid

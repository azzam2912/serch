the process models family names as patrilineal passed from father to son while offspring are randomly either male or female and names become extinct if the family name line dies out holders of the family name die without male descendants this is an accurate description of y chromosome transmission in genetics and the model is thus useful for understanding human y chromosome dna haplogroups and is also of use in understanding other processes as described below but its application to actual extinction of family names is fraught in practice family names change for many other reasons and dying out of name line is only one factor as discussed in examples below the galton watson process is thus of limited applicability in understanding actual family name distributions there was concern amongst the victorians that aristocratic surnames were becoming extinct galton originally posed the question regarding the probability of such an event in an 1873 issue of the educational times and the reverend henry william watson replied with a solution together they then wrote an 1874 paper entitled on the probability of the extinction of families in the journal of the anthropological institute of great britain and ireland now the journal of

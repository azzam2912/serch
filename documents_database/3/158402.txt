the juxtaglomerular apparatus is named because it is next to juxta the glomerulus the juxtaglomerular apparatus consists of three types of cells the juxtaglomerular apparatus is part of the kidney nephron next to the glomerulus it is found between afferent arteriole and the distal convoluted tubule of the same nephron this location is critical to its function in regulating renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate renin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells these cells are similar to epithelium and are located in the tunica media of the afferent arterioles as they enter the glomeruli the juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin in response to extraglomerular mesangial cells are located in the junction between the afferent and efferent arterioles but their significance in this location is unknown renin is also found in these cells at the point where the afferent arterioles enter the glomerulus and the efferent arteriole leaves it the tubule of nephron touches the arterioles of the glomerulus from which it rose at this location thick ascending limb of loop of henle there is a modified region of tubular epithelium called the macula densa cells in the macula densa respond to changes in the sodium chloride levels in the distal tubule

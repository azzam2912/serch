the crystal violet and bile salts inhibit the growth of gram positive organisms which allows for the selection and isolation of gram negative bacteria enteric bacteria that have the ability to ferment lactose can be detected using the carbohydrate lactose and the ph indicator neutral red it contains bile salts to inhibit most gram positive bacteria crystal violet dye which also inhibits certain gram positive bacteria neutral red dye which turns pink if the microbes are fermenting lactose composition there are many variations of macconkey agar depending on the need if the spreading or swarming of proteus species is not required sodium chloride is omitted crystal violet at a concentration of 0 0001 0 001 g per litre is included when needing to check if gram positive bacteria are inhibited macconkey with sorbitol is used to isolate e coli o157 an enteric pathogen the medium was developed by alfred theodore macconkey while working as a bacteriologist for the royal commission on sewage disposal using neutral red ph indicator the agar distinguishes those gram negative bacteria that can ferment the sugar lactose lac from those that cannot lac this medium is also known as an indicator medium and a low selective

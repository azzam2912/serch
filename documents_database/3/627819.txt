it is most often abbreviated as fr but can often be seen abbreviated as fg fr or f it may also be abbreviated as ch or ch for charri re its inventor however simply gauge g or ga generally refers to birmingham gauge the french size is three times the diameter in millimeters a round catheter of 1 french has an external diameter of mm and therefore the diameter of a round catheter in millimetres can be determined by dividing the french size by 3 d mm fr 3 or fr d mm 3 for example if the french size is 9 the diameter is 9 3 3 0 mm it is seen that the french unit is fully redundant with the metric system but introduces potential for rounding errors this metrication problem is further complicated by the mixed use of metric and imperial units in medical professions using catheters from the basic math equation c d it follows that the catheter s circumference in mm is only slightly about 4 7 greater than the french size an increasing french size corresponds to a larger external diameter this is contrary to birmingham gauge where an increasing gauge corresponds to a

this article presents examples of technologies that have been hypothesized or proposed but that have not been developed yet artificial general intelligence agi is a hypothetical artificial intelligence that demonstrates a human like ability to learn agi is a machine which could do all human activities with the efficiency of a machine it is a primary goal of artificial intelligence research and a common topic among science fiction writers and futurists artificial general intelligence is also referred to as strong ai full ai or one that has the ability to perform general intelligent action agi is associated with traits such as consciousness sentience sapience and self awareness which are observed in living beings some examples of hypothetical technology are flying cars jetpacks teleportation or robot helpers whole brain emulation wbe or mind uploading sometimes called mind copying or mind transfer is the hypothetical process of copying mental content including long term memory and self from a particular brain substrate and copying it to a computational or storage device such as a digital analog quantum based or software based artificial neural network the computational device could then run a simulation model of the brain information processing such that it responds in

it was first defined in the h 261 standard in 1988 as the word common in its name implies cif was designed as a common compromise format to be relatively easy to convert for use either with pal or ntsc standard displays and cameras cif defines a video sequence with a resolution of 352 288 which has a simple relationship to the pal picture size but with a frame rate of 30000 1001 roughly 29 97 frames per second like ntsc with color encoded using a ycbcr representation with color sampling it was designed as a compromise between pal and ntsc schemes since it uses a picture size that corresponds most easily to pal but uses the frame rate of ntsc the compromise was established as a way to reach international agreement so that video conferencing systems in different countries could communicate with each other without needing two separate modes for displaying the received video the simple way to convert ntsc video to cif is to capture every other field e g the top fields of interlaced video downsample it by 2 1 horizontally to convert 704 samples per line to 352 samples per line and upsample it vertically by

the most likely scenario is when a bright visible laser light causes distraction or temporary flash blindness to a pilot during a critical phase of flight such as landing or takeoff it is far less likely though still possible that a visible or invisible beam could cause permanent harm to a pilot s eyes although laser weapons are under development by armed forces these are so specialized expensive and controlled that it is improbable for non military lasers to cause structural damage to an aircraft pointing a laser at an aircraft can be hazardous to pilots and has resulted in arrests trials and jail sentences it also results in calls to license or ban laser pointers some jurisdictions such as new south wales australia have restricted laser pointers as a result of multiple incidents in addition to lasers other bright directional lights such as searchlights and spotlights can have the same dazzling distracting and flashblinding effects lasers are used in industry and research such as in atmospheric remote sensing and as guide stars in adaptive optics astronomy lasers and searchlights are used in entertainment for example in outdoor shows such as the nightly illuminations show at walt disney world s

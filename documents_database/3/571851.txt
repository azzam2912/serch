the mitotic index is a measure of cellular proliferation it is defined as the percentage of cells undergoing mitosis in a given population of cells mitosis is the division of somatic cells into two daughter cells durations of the cell cycle and mitosis vary in different cell types an elevated mitotic index indicates more cells are dividing in cancer cells the mitotic index may be elevated compared to normal growth of tissues or cellular repair of the site of an injury the mitotic index is therefore an important prognostic factor predicting both overall survival and response to chemotherapy in most types of cancer it may lose much of its predictive value for elderly populations for example a low mitotic index loses any prognostic value for women over 70 years old with breast cancer the mitotic index is the number of cells undergoing mitosis divided by the total number of cells a typical figure of mitotic index includes statements like 10 mitotic figures are noted per 10 high power fields followed by 4 mitotic figures noted per 50 high power fields formula 1 where p m a t is the sum of all cells in phase as prophase metaphase anaphase and

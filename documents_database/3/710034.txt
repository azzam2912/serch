tectorial in anatomy means forming a cover the tm is located above the spiral limbus and the spiral organ of corti and extends along the longitudinal length of the cochlea parallel to the bm radially the tm is divided into three zones the limbal middle and marginal zones of these the limbal zone is the thinnest transversally and overlies the auditory teeth of huschke with its inside edge attached to the spiral limbus the marginal zone is the thickest transversally and is divided from the middle zone by hensen s stripe it overlies the sensory inner hair cells and electrically motile outer hair cells of the organ of corti and during acoustic stimulation stimulates the inner hair cells through fluid coupling and the outer hair cells via direct connection to their tallest stereocilia the tm is a gel like structure containing 97 water its dry weight is composed of collagen 50 non collagenous glycoproteins 25 and proteoglycans 25 three inner ear specific glycoproteins are expressed in the tm tectorin tectorin and otogelin of these proteins tectorin and tectorin form the striated sheet matrix that regularly organises the collagen fibres due to the increased structural complexity of the tm relative to

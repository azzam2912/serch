in situ capping provides a viable way to remediate an area that is contaminated it is an option when pump and treat becomes too expensive and the area surrounding the site is a low energy system the design of the cap and the characterization of the surrounding areas are of equal importance and drive the feasibility of the entire project numerous successful cases exist and more will exist in the future as the technology expands and grows more popular in situ capping uses techniques developed in chemistry biology geotechnical engineering environmental engineering and environmental geotechnical engineering contaminants located in sediments still pose a risk to the environment and human health some of the direct effects on aquatic life that can be associated with contaminated sediment include the development of cancerous tumors in fish exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sediments these high risk sediments need to be remediated there are usually only four options for remediation the cap can be made up of many different things including but not limited to sand gravel geotextiles and multiple layers of these options there are many ways that a contaminant inside sediment can become introduced to the environment these ways include but are

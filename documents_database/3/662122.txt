brochosomes were first described in 1952 with the aid of an electron microscope brochosomes are hydrophobic and help keep the insect cuticle dry these particles have also been found in samples of air and can easily contaminate foreign objects which explains erroneous reports of brochosomes on other insects the name derived from the greek words o brochos mesh of a net and soma body refers to the characteristic reticulated surface of the granules most species of leafhoppers produce hollow spherical brochosomes 0 2 0 7 micrometres in diameter with a honeycombed outer wall they often consist of 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal cells making the outline of each brochosome approximating a truncated icosahedron the geometry of a soccer ball and a c buckminsterfullerene molecule the chemical composition of brochosomes includes several kinds of proteins and according to some studies lipids the main protein family called brochosomins and other kinds of proteins identified in the composition of brochosomes and their corresponding genes show no relationship to proteins and genes of any organisms outside of membracoidea and thus are considered to be examples of orphan genes brochosomes are produced within cells of specialized glandular segments of the malpighian tubules the primary excretory

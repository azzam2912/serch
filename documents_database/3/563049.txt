this approach has the advantage that the gauge invariance is manifestly preserved if the approach is applied to gauge theory we typically want to calculate expressions like where j x is a source formula 3 is the lagrangian density of the system d is the number of dimensions and formula 4 is a field in the background field method one starts by splitting this field into a classical background field b x and a field x containing additional quantum fluctuations typically b x will be a solution of the classical equations of motion where s is the action i e the space integral of the lagrangian density switching on a source j x will change the equations into s j 0 then the action is expanded around the background b x the second term in this expansion is zero by the equations of motion the first term does not depend on any fluctuating fields so that it can be brought out of the path integral the result is the path integral which now remains is neglecting the corrections in the dots of gaussian form and can be integrated exactly where det signifies a functional determinant and c is a constant

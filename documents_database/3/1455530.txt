congress to deal with nuclear waste s prism is a commercial implementation of the integral fast reactor developed by argonne national laboratory between 1984 and 1994 it is a sodium cooled fast breeder reactor based on the experimental breeder reactor ii ebr ii design scaled up by a factor of ten the design utilizes reactor modules each having a power output of 311 mwe to enable factory fabrication at low cost in an identical fashion to the ebr ii that it is based on the reactor would transition to a much lower power level whenever temperatures rise significantly moreover the reactor vessel modules are pool type as opposed to loop type with the pool conferring substantial thermal inertia and the final key safety feature includes a rvacs which is a passive reactor vessel air cooling system to remove decay heat these safety systems are passive and therefore always operate and are to prevent core damage when no other means of heat removal are available the integral fast reactor was developed at the west campus of the argonne national laboratory in idaho falls idaho and was the intended successor to the experimental breeder reactor ii which achieved first criticality in 1965

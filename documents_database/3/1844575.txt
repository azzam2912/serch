examination of npiw at stations just east of the mwr indicates that the mixed waters in the mwr are the origin of the newest npiw the new npiw formed in the mwr is a mixture of relatively fresh recently ventilated oyashio water coming from the subpolar gyre and more saline older kuroshio water the mixing process results in a salinity minimum and also in rejuvenation of the npiw layer in the subtropical gyre due to the oyashio input the density of the npiw in the mwr about 26 6 26 9 is slightly higher than the apparent later winter surface density of the subpolar water the low salinity and high oxygen at the density of the npiw are attained in the subpolar gyre through vertical diffusion in the open north pacific and direct ventilation in the okhotsk sea as a result of sea ice formation according to recent studies the npiw is formed along three paths between the kuroshio extension and the subarctic front the formation time scale is estimated to be 1 1 5 years based on observations by floating instruments and the residence time of npiw is estimated to be about 20 years since the formation time is

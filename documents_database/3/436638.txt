hadrocodium remained undescribed until 2001 since then its large brain and advanced ear structure have greatly influenced the interpretation of the earliest stages of mammalian evolution as these mammalian characters could previously be traced only to some hadrocodium is known only from a skull but the body is estimated to have been a mere in length and about in mass making it one of the smallest mammals ever hadrocodium might have been the first animal to have a nearly fully mammalian middle ear it is the earliest known example of several features possessed only by mammals including the middle ear structure characteristic of modern mammals and a relatively large brain cavity these features had been considered limited to the crown group mammals which emerged in the middle jurassic the discovery of hadrocodium suggests that these attributes appeared 45 million years earlier than previously thought whether hadrocodium was warm blooded or cold blooded has not been settled although its apparent nocturnal features would seem to place it in the former group hadrocodium are capable of laying eggs like today s platypus and echidna

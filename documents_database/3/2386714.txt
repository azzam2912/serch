the bridge is located at 83 montague street between woodgate street and gladstone lane the bridge has a very low height clearance of three metres or nine feet and 10 inches and despite prominent signage warning tall vehicles not to approach drivers who miscalculate the height of their vehicles frequently collide with and sometimes become wedged under the bridge this has made the bridge a local landmark and the subject of much humorous media discussion construction firm johns waygood was contracted to build the bridge in 1914 as part of the infrastructure of the port melbourne railway line montague railway station was located just south of the bridge and mainly served workers at nearby factories flooding on montague street was a perennial problem in 1916 the area around the bridge was under a foot of water and pedestrians could not approach it in 1934 south melbourne council raised the underlying street level by about two feet thus lowering the height of the bridge the last passenger train ran to montague station on 10 october 1987 after it was announced that the line would be converted to light rail the replacement light rail line was officially opened on 18 december 1987

in kinetic resolution two enantiomers react with different reaction rates in a chemical reaction with a chiral catalyst or reagent resulting in an enantioenriched sample of the less reactive enantiomer as opposed to chiral resolution kinetic resolution does not rely on different physical properties of diastereomeric products but rather on the different chemical properties of the racemic starting materials this enantiomeric excess ee of the unreacted starting material continually rises as more product is formed reaching 100 just before full completion of the reaction kinetic resolution relies upon differences in reactivity between enantiomers or enantiomeric complexes kinetic resolution is a concept in organic chemistry and can be used for the preparation of chiral molecules in organic synthesis kinetic resolution reactions utilizing purely synthetic reagents and catalysts are much less common than the use of enzymatic kinetic resolution in application towards organic synthesis although a number of useful synthetic techniques have been developed in the past 30 years the first reported kinetic resolution was achieved by louis pasteur after reacting aqueous racemic ammonium tartrate with a mold from penicillium glaucum he reisolated the remaining tartrate and found it was levorotatory the chiral microorganisms present in the mold catalyzed the metabolization of

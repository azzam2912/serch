the objective is to minimize here formula 14 has the dimension 1x1 the number of columns of formula 15 so it is a scalar and equal to its own transpose hence formula 16 and the quantity to minimize becomes differentiating this with respect to formula 18 and equating to zero to satisfy the first order conditions gives which is equivalent to the above given normal equations a sufficient condition for satisfaction of the second order conditions for a minimum is that formula 20 have full column rank in which case formula 21 is positive definite when formula 21 is positive definite the formula for the minimizing value of formula 23 can be derived without the use of derivatives the quantity can be written as where formula 26 depends only on formula 27 and formula 28 and formula 29 is the inner product defined by it follows that formula 31 is equal to and therefore minimized exactly when in general the coefficients of the matrices formula 34 and formula 35 can be complex by using a hermitian transpose instead of a simple transpose it is possible to find a vector formula 36 which minimizes formula 37 just as for the real

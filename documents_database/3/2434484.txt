she was the inspiration behind so long marianne hey that s no way to say goodbye and bird on the wire critical reaction was generally positive on rotten tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 80 based on reviews from 103 critics on metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 69 based on reviews from 19 critics indicating generally favorable reviews the guardian gave it 4 stars out of 5 calling it a tender vivid snapshot of a singer and his muse the irish independent gave it 4 stars as well saying broomfield s film has an unhurried digressive style that seems oddly appropriate to its dreamy quasi mythical story but he sentimentalises neither leonard nor susanne and makes it clear that there was a downside to hydra s carefree hedonism rogerebert com awarded it 2 stars out of 4 and said the strongest aspect of marianne and leonard has nothing to do with ihlen or cohen but is the vivid picture painted of the 1960s counterculture particularly its manifestation on hydra the new statesman said that the film romanticises a sexist trope and that broomfield falls into the same trap as cohen rendering ihlen into nothing

the slncr considered ordering a garratt articulated locomotive to haul heavier trains but it could scarcely afford one locomotive of such a large size therefore it decided instead to order two more smaller locomotives on the basis that if one required maintenance the other could still be available for traffic in june 1946 the slncr ordered just one new locomotive from beyer peacock and company at gorton foundry manchester england the slncr s financial situation was worsening but despite this it ordered the second locomotive about a year later the lough class was a more modern and more powerful development of the sir henry class which was also built by beyer peacock but was introduced in 1904 beyer peacock completed both locomotives ready for delivery in spring 1949 but by then the slncr could not afford to pay for them the slncr therefore asked the government of northern ireland s ministry of commerce to lend it 22 000 to pay for the two locomotives protracted negotiations between the slncr ministry of commerce and beyer peacock eventually resulted in a hire purchase agreement in 1951 and the two locomotives were shipped from england to belfast in june and july of that

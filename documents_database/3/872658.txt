the game is based on the 1984 ms dos game by david clark sopwith originally released as shareware in 2009 dodekaedron placed the source code documentation images and sounds under the gplv3 on sourceforge hosted later on github com the community continued the support and ported the game via sdl to other platforms as linux and windows a sequel triplane turmoil 2 was released in 2006 the world of triplane turmoil appears to be set during or some time after the first world war possibly in the mid 1920s given the fact that triplanes still have nose mounted machine guns using interrupter gear and appear to be capable of carrying and releasing fairly heavy ordnance furthermore respirators do not appear to be in use the current state of affairs is that there are 4 major feuding powers england finland germany and japan the diplomatic relationships between these powers appear strained and the powers themselves fickle the single player campaigns all revolve around a series of rapidly shifting alliances and preemptive strikes players may control their aircraft by pitching up down rolling the aircraft 180 degrees fire the machine gun and dropping bombs the aircraft can be controlled through the keyboard

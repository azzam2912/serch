adam smith first described the principle of absolute advantage in the context of international trade using labor as the only input since absolute advantage is determined by a simple comparison of labor productiveness it is possible for a party to have no absolute advantage in anything the concept of absolute advantage is generally attributed to adam smith for his 1776 publication the wealth of nations in which he countered mercantilist ideas smith argued that it was impossible for all nations to become rich simultaneously by following mercantilism because the export of one nation is another nation s import and instead stated that all nations would gain simultaneously if they practiced free trade and specialized in accordance with their absolute advantage smith also stated that the wealth of nations depends upon the goods and services available to their citizens rather than their gold reserves because smith only focused on comparing labor productivities to determine absolute advantage he did not develop the concept of comparative advantage while there are possible gains from trade with absolute advantage the gains may not be mutually beneficial comparative advantage focuses on the range of possible mutually beneficial exchanges according to figure 1 england commits 80 hours

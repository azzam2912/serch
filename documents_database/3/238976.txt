in this formulation time is not required to be a continuous parameter but may be discrete or even finite in classical physics time evolution of a collection of rigid bodies is governed by the principles of classical mechanics in their most rudimentary form these principles express the relationship between forces acting on the bodies and their acceleration given by newton s laws of motion these principles can also be equivalently expressed more abstractly by hamiltonian mechanics or lagrangian mechanics the concept of time evolution may be applicable to other stateful systems as well for instance the operation of a turing machine can be regarded as the time evolution of the machine s control state together with the state of the tape or possibly multiple tapes including the position of the machine s read write head or heads in this case time is discrete stateful systems often have dual descriptions in terms of states or in terms of observable values in such systems time evolution can also refer to the change in observable values this is particularly relevant in quantum mechanics where the schr dinger picture and heisenberg picture are mostly equivalent descriptions of time evolution consider a system with state

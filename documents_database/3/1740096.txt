its length measures 5 mm the whorls of the protoconch are small smooth deeply obhquely immersed in the first post nuclear turn above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects the six whorls of the teleoconch are strongly rounded decidedly contracted at the sutures and strongly shouldered at the summit the first is marked by four slender spiral cords and numerous exceedingly fine axial threads the next three have twenty strong rounded axial ribs which terminate at the posterior edge of the fourth keel leaving this smooth on the body whorl the ribs are decidedly enfeebled being replaced by numerous axial threads the spiral sculpture consists of four strong cords between the sutures the three which cross the ribs form strong nodules at their junction with them while the supraperipheral one is smooth the utures are strongly impressed and slightly channeled the periphery and the base of the body whorl are well rounded they are marked by eight spiral keels which grow successively weaker from the periphery to the umbilical region the last three being very fine the spaces separating the cords equal to them are crossed by numerous slender axial threads the aperture is irregularly ovate

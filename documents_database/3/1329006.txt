the sitting governorate council was elected in the 2005 iraqi governorate elections these elections took place at the same time as the january 2005 iraqi legislative election and were boycotted by nearly all sunni arab parties the iraqi islamic party was the only significant sunni arab party to put up candidates but they also withdrew from the ballot days before the election the turnout in anbar was 2 for the legislative elections and only 0 5 for the governorate election therefore although the iraqi islamic party has traditionally been stronger in mosul they ended up with nearly all the seats on the governorate council from 2004 the governorate became a major site of the insurgency in iraq directed against the iraq government and occupying united states army however the formation in september 2006 of the anbar salvation council was a turning point and led to the american backed tribal forces driving al qaeda in iraq and other insurgents out of al anbar more than 520 candidates stood in anbar from 37 party lists the main contest was between the iraqi islamic party which ran the council since 2005 and various parties linked to the awakening movements formed by tribal leaders

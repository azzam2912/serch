it is sometimes considered a subspecies of the pale headed rosella p adscitus the term white cheeked rosella has been used for a species or superspecies combining the pale headed and eastern forms hybrids of the two taxa have been recorded where their ranges meet in northeastern new south wales and southeastern queensland however a mitochondrial study published in 2017 found that the eastern rosella was the earlier offshoot of the lineage that split into the pale headed and northern rosellas and that nonsister taxa were hence able to hybridise three subspecies of eastern rosella are recognised the eastern rosella is long it has a red head and white cheeks the beak is white and the irises are brown the upper breast is red and the lower breast is yellow fading to pale green over the abdomen the feathers of the back and shoulders are black and have yellowish or greenish margins giving rise to a scalloped appearance that varies slightly between the subspecies and the sexes the wings and lateral tail feathers are bluish while the tail is dark green the legs are grey the female is similar to the male though duller in colouration and has an underwing

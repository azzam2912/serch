the reference to nicholasville kentucky in the title of this page is incorrect popular legend has it that the house was the birthplace of bennett h young an american civil war soldier lawyer and architect however the reference given here does not substantiate this last claim apparently the national register information submitted in 1984 by glenn dorroh a previous owner correctly identifies this as the house of dr brown young 1823 1893 a fact confirmed by jessamine county maps from 1861 and 1877 which identify the house as belonging to dr b young but dorroh s file goes on to claim brown young s father john was a revolutionary war soldier and his son was the historian col bennett h young both of these claims are false bennett h young himself would say so as he wrote a history of jessamine county ky 1898 which he dedicated to his father bennett young identifies his father as robert young whom he describes as a native of fayette county ky who set up shop as a hatter hat maker in nicholasville ky jessamine county from 1825 to 1848 in 1848 robert sold the store and bought a farm the jessamine county atlas

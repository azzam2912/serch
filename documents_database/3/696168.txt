it was invented as a means to transfer files in a format which would survive character set translation particularly that between ascii and the ebcdic encoding used on ibm mainframes xxencoded data starts with a line of the form where is the file s read write execute permissions as three octal digits and is the name to be used when recreating the binary data xxencode repeatedly takes in groups of three bytes adding trailing zeroes if there are fewer than three bytes left these 24 bits are split into four 6 bit numbers each of which is then translated to the formula 1th character in the following table each group of sixty output characters corresponding to 45 input bytes is output as a separate line preceded by an encoded character giving the number of encoded bytes on that line for all lines except the last this will be the character h the character mapping to the value 45 if the input is not evenly divisible by 45 the last line will contain the remaining n output characters preceded by the number of remaining input bytes encoded as above finally a line containing just a single space or plus character is

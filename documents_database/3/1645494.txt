the acronym proaftn stands for proc dure d affectation floue pour la probl matique du tri nominal which means in english fuzzy assignment procedure for nominal sorting the method enables to determine the fuzzy indifference relations by generalizing the indices concordance and discordance used in the electre iii method to determine the fuzzy indifference relations proaftn uses the general scheme of the discretization technique described in that establishes a set of pre classified cases called a training set to resolve the classification problems proaftn proceeds by the following stages stage 1 modeling of classes in this stage the prototypes of the classes are conceived using the two following steps direct technique it consists in adjusting the parameters through the training set and with the expert intervention indirect technique it consists in fitting the parameters without the expert intervention as used in machine learning approaches in multicriteria classification problem the indirect technique is known as preference disaggregation analysis this technique requires less cognitive effort than the former technique it uses an automatic method to determine the optimal parameters which minimize the classification errors furthermore several heuristics and metaheuristics were used to learn the multicriteria classification method proaftn stage 2 assignment after

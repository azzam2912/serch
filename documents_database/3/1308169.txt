the procedure is most often performed in male cats where the opening is made in the perineum for many years perineal urethrostomy has been used in cattle sheep and goats especially young males that have been castrated at a young age for obstruction by uroliths however the anatomy of the male cat is quite different and the urethra is very small in diameter perineal urethrostomy in the male cat was developed in 1962 and published in the journal of the american veterinary medical association in 1963 it was modified in 1967 and further modified in 1971 since animals are potentially suffering from severe metabolic derangements at the time of initial presentation animals need to be stabilized prior to surgery common physiologic derangements noted on bloodwork are elevated kidneys values azotemia and elevated potassium levels hyperkalemia the presence of profound sedation low body temperature and or a slow heart rate bradycardia are usually associated with more severe blood derangements ideally the urethral obstruction is removed or temporarily bypassed with urethral flushing urohydropulsion and the placement of an in dwelling urinary catheter prior to surgery this catheter allows urine to be removed from the body and along with fluid therapy help normalize

his research into the biology of influenza viruses has been at the forefront of medical advances in epidemiology garc a sastre is the author of more than 200 publications born in burgos spain dr garc a sastre earned his ph d at the university of salamanca his research interest has been focused on the molecular biology of influenza viruses and several other negative strand rna viruses his contributions to his field have included the generation and evaluation of influenza virus vectors as potential vaccine candidates against infectious diseases including malaria and aids as well as the development with dr peter palese of the first reverse genetic approaches for the production of infectious recombinant influenza viruses from plasmid dna research which has resulted in techniques which are now routinely used with many negative strand rna viruses he was the first to identify the biological role of the non structural ns1 influenza protein during infection the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral encoded ifn antagonist among negative strand rna viruses and the first to demonstrate that the m1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology in 2005 as principal investigator of an niaid program project grant

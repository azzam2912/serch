this device can be inserted blindly through the oropharynx into the hypopharynx to create an airway during anaesthesia and cardiopulmonary resuscitation so as to enable mechanical ventilation of the lungs various studies have shown that insertion and use of the standard tracheal tube is easy providing a clear airway in the majority of cases comparative studies indicate that the standard laryngeal tube is generally as effective as the laryngeal mask airway while some studies indicate that the pro seal laryngeal mask may be more effective than the standard laryngeal tube under controlled ventilation conditions in general anaesthesia the indications and contraindications for use of the laryngeal tube are similar to those of the laryngeal mask airway and include the use in general anaesthesia for minor surgical operations several studies describe the usefulness of the device in securing a difficult airway even in cases where insertion of the laryngeal mask had failed the double lumen laryngeal tube suction ii with the possibility of placing a gastric tube has been found to have distinct advantages over the standard laryngeal tube and has been recommended as a first line device to secure the airway in emergency situations when direct laryngoscopy fails in neonates

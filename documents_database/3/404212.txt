all other chemicals are recycled the s i process requires an efficient source of heat the three reactions that produce hydrogen are as follows the sulfur and iodine compounds are recovered and reused hence the consideration of the process as a cycle this s i process is a chemical heat engine heat enters the cycle in high temperature endothermic chemical reactions 2 and 3 and heat exits the cycle in the low temperature exothermic reaction 1 the difference between the heat entering and leaving the cycle exits the cycle in the form of the heat of combustion of the hydrogen produced advantages disadvantages the s i cycle was invented at general atomics in the 1970s the japan atomic energy agency jaea has conducted successful experiments with the s i cycle in the helium cooled high temperature test reactor a reactor which reached first criticality in 1998 jaea have the aspiration of using further nuclear high temperature generation iv reactors to produce industrial scale quantities of hydrogen the japanese refer to the cycle as the is cycle plans have been made to test larger scale automated systems for hydrogen production under an international nuclear energy research initiative ineri agreement the french

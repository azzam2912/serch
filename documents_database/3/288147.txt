the value of the integral in the riemann or henstock sense can be derived in various ways for example the value can be determined from attempts to evaluate a double improper integral or by using differentiation under the integral sign one of the well known properties of laplace transforms is which allows one to evaluate the dirichlet integral succinctly in the following manner where formula 4 is the laplace transform of the function this is equivalent to attempting to evaluate the same double definite integral in two different ways by reversal of the order of integration viz first rewrite the integral as a function of the additional variable formula 7 let in order to evaluate the dirichlet integral we need to determineformula 9 differentiate with respect to formula 7 and apply the leibniz rule for differentiating under the integral sign to obtain now using euler s formula formula 12 one can express a sinusoid in terms of complex exponential functions we thus have formula 13 therefore formula 14 integrating with respect to formula 15 gives where formula 17 is a constant of integration to be determined since formula 18 formula 19 using the principal value this means formula 20 finally

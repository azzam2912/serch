in principle there is no difference between resting membrane potential and dynamic voltage changes like action potential from a biophysical point of view all these phenomena are caused by specific changes in membrane permeabilities for potassium sodium calcium and chloride ions which in turn result from concerted changes in functional activity of various ion channels ion transporters and exchangers conventionally resting membrane potential can be defined as a relatively stable ground value of transmembrane voltage in animal and plant cells voltage is the difference in electric potential between two points arising from the separation of positive and negative electric charges on opposite sides of a resistive barrier the typical resting membrane potential of a cell arises from the separation of potassium ions from intracellular relatively immobile anions across the membrane of the cell because the membrane permeability for potassium is much higher than that for other ions disregarding voltage gated channels at this stage and because of the strong chemical gradient for potassium potassium ions flow from the cytosol into the extracellular space carrying out positive charge until their movement is balanced by build up of negative charge on the inner surface of the membrane again because of the high

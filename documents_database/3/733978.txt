this carbon 27 biomarker is produced by diagenesis of cholesterol and is one of the most abundant biomarkers in the rock record presence of cholestane in environmental samples are commonly interpreted as an indicator of animal life and or traces of o as animals are known for exclusively producing cholesterol and thus has been used to draw evolutionary relationships between ancient organisms of unknown phylogenetic origin and modern metazoan taxa cholestane is made in low abundance by other organisms e g rhodophytes but because these other organisms produce a variety of sterols it cannot be used as a conclusive indicator of any one taxa it is often found in analysis of organic compounds in petroleum cholestane is a saturated c 27 animal biomarker often found in petroleum deposits it is a diagenetic product of cholesterol which is an organic molecule made primarily by animals and make up 30 of animal cell membranes cholesterol is responsible for membrane rigidity and fluidity as well as intracellular transport cell signaling and nerve conduction in humans it is also the precursor for hormones i e estrogen testosterone it is synthesized via squalene and naturally assumes a specific stereochemical orientation 3 ol 5 h 14

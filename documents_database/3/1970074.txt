its apparent magnitude varies from 10 2 to 12 7 over a period of 624 5 days although the binary is a symbiotic star system it is unusual in that it does not have an eruptive component it is an s type symbiotic system which means that the light comes from the stars rather than surrounding dust with optical spectrometry the red giant has been calculated as having a surface temperature of 3500 k and spectral type m4 5iii with around 1 3 times the sun s mass 86 times its radius and 1000 times its luminosity the white dwarf is only 0 43 times the mass of the sun the two stars are 1 72 astronomical units au apart and take 624 days to orbit each other the red giant also pulsates with a period of 56 days the surface of the giant star extends to 40 of the distance to the lagrange point l and hence does not fill its roche lobe and cause the white dwarf to gain an accretion disc the system was calculated at being around 850 parsecs 2771 light years distant

it is a device for measuring changes in the dimensions of a specimen optically the achieved resolution can result in greater values than those of a conventional pushrod dilatometer a monochromatic light source such as a laser illuminates the specimen some of the light is reflected by the specimen and interferes with the incoming light creating optical interference fringes as the specimen contracts or expands there is a proportional movement of the interference fringes which can be measured using a camera system the measurement resolution is determined by the wavelength of the light and is typically 0 5 m for blue light optical dilatometers are used to measure thermal expansion the optical dilatometer is in fact complementary to the traditional higher resolution push rod dilatometer when it comes to measure dimensional changes of materials as a function of temperature and no contact between specimen and instrument is required the most recent types of optical dilatometer use a direct beam system so as to avoid contact related problems by measuring the image that the specimen projects on an image sensor when irradiated by a light beam by using a single beam of light with short wavelength and a very high resolution

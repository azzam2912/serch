this is now known through the use of h nmr esr and fluorescent methods there are two approaches used to measure the relative affinity of lipids binding to specific membrane proteins these involve the use of lipid analogues in reconstituted phospholipid vesicles containing the protein of interest 1 spin labeled phospholipids are motionally restricted when they are adjacent to membrane proteins the result is a component in the esr spectrum which is broadened the experimental spectrum can be analyzed as the sum of the two components a rapidly tumbling species in the bulk lipid phase with a sharp spectrum and a motionally restricted component adjacent to the protein membrane protein denaturation causes further broadening of esr spin label spectrum and throws more light on membrane lipid proteins interactions 2 spin labeled and brominated lipid derivatives are able to quench the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence from membrane proteins the efficiency of quenching depends on the distance between the lipid derivative and the fluorescent tryptophans most h nmr experiments with deuterated phospholipids demonstrate that the presence of proteins has little effect on either the order parameter of the lipids in the bilayer or the lipid dynamics as measured by relaxation times the overall

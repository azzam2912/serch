in 1994 the reborn hinkley triumph became one of the first production motorcycles to embrace the new streetfighter style which was essentially a modern sport bike or race replica motorcycle but without the aerodynamic plastic fairing the style began when bikers who having crashed their race replicas put the bikes back on the road sans fairing mainly for reasons of economy the new bike was first released to the public in 1994 and in a nod to the 1938 speed twin was dubbed the speed triple the original speed twin was powered by a 498 cc vertical twin cylinder engine and was considered a high performance machine in its day the new speed triple was based on the new triumph triple series of modular engines which also powered the standard trident daytona sport bike and the thunderbird retro bike this engine came in two displacements as a triple 750 cc for some european markets and 885 cc for all other markets the speed triple originally was equipped only with the 885 cc engine but just before significant changes to the bike were made in 1997 a very few 750 machines were produced using leftover euro specification engines early speed triples

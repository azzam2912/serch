launch service provider united launch alliance with one main active version and one version under development the 3 8 m diameter common centaur centaur iii as referenced in the infobox flies as the upper stage of the atlas v launch vehicle while the 5 4 m diameter centaur v is being developed as the upper stage of ula s new vulcan rocket centaur was the first rocket stage to use liquid hydrogen lh and liquid oxygen lox propellants a high energy combination that is ideal for upper stages but has significant handling difficulties common centaur is built around stainless steel pressure stabilized propellant tanks with 0 020 inch thick walls that can nevertheless lift payloads of up to 19 000 kg the thin walls minimize the mass of the tanks maximizing the stage s overall performance a common bulkhead consisting of two stainless steel skins separated by a fiberglass honeycomb is located between the lox and lh tanks further reducing the tank mass heat transfer between the extremely cold lh and relatively warm lox is reduced by the fiberglass honeycomb insulating layer the main propulsion system consists of one or two aerojet rocketdyne rl 10 engines the stage is capable

for instance 4 cycle free graphs have edges 6 cycle free graphs have edges etc the result was stated without proof by erd s in 1964 published the first proof and strengthened the theorem to show that for vertex graphs with edges all even cycle lengths between and occur the bound of erd s s theorem is tight up to constant factors for some small values of k for k 2 3 or 5 there exist graphs with edges that have no cycle it is unknown for other than 2 3 or 5 whether there exist graphs that have no cycle but have edges matching erd s s upper bound only a weaker bound is known according to which the number of edges can be for odd values of or for even values of because a 4 cycle is a complete bipartite graph the maximum number of edges in a 4 cycle free graph can be seen as a special case of the zarankiewicz problem on forbidden complete bipartite graphs and the even circuit theorem for this case can be seen as a special case of the k v ri s s tur n theorem more precisely in this case

a synchronous orbit has a period equal to the rotational period of the body which contains the barycenter of the orbit one particular supersynchronous orbital regime of significant economic value to earth commerce is a band of near circular geocentric orbits beyond the geosynchronous belt with perigee altitude above approximately above synchronous altitude called the geo graveyard belt the geo graveyard belt orbital regime is valuable as a storage and disposal location for space debris after their useful economic life is completed as geosynchronous communication satellites artificial satellites are left in space because the economic cost of removing the debris would be high and current public policy does not require nor incentivize rapid removal by the party that first inserted the debris in outer space and thus created a negative externality for others a placing of the cost onto them one public policy proposal to deal with growing space debris is a one up one down launch license policy for earth orbits launch vehicle operators would have to pay the cost of debris mitigation they would need to build the capability into their launch vehicle robotic capture navigation mission duration extension and substantial additional propellant to be able to rendezvous

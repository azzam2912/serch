it was one of intel s first attempts at an entirely new high end instruction set architecture since the failed intel iapx 432 from the 1980s it was released with considerable fanfare slightly obscuring the earlier intel i960 which was successful in some niches of embedded systems and which many considered to be a better design the i860 never achieved commercial success and the project was terminated in the mid 1990s the first implementation of the i860 architecture was the i860 xr microprocessor code named n10 which ran at 25 33 or 40 mhz the second generation i860 xp microprocessor code named n11 added 4 mbyte pages larger on chip caches second level cache support faster buses and hardware support for bus snooping for cache consistency in multiprocessor systems a process shrink for the xp from 1 micrometre to 0 8 chmos v bumped it to 40 and 50 mhz both microprocessors supported the same instruction set for application programs the i860 combined a number of features that were unique at the time most notably its very long instruction word vliw architecture and powerful support for high speed floating point operations the design mounted a 32 bit alu core along

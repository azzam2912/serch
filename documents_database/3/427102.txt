in 1999 cck was adopted to supplement the barker code in wireless digital networks to achieve data rate higher than 2 mbit s at the expense of shorter distance this is due to the shorter chipping sequence in cck 8 bits versus 11 bits in barker code that means less spreading to obtain higher data rate but more susceptible to narrowband interference resulting in shorter radio transmission range beside shorter chipping sequence cck also has more chipping sequences to encode more bits 4 chipping sequences at 5 5 mbit s and 8 chipping sequences at 11 mbit s increasing the data rate even further the barker code however only has a single chipping sequence the complementary codes first discussed by golay were pairs of binary complementary codes and he noted that when the elements of a code of length n were either 1 or 1 it followed immediately from their definition that the sum of their respective autocorrelation sequences was zero at all points except for the zero shift where it is equal to k n k being the number of code words in the set cck is a variation and improvement on m ary orthogonal keying and uses polyphase

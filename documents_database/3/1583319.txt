digital holographic microscopy distinguishes itself from other microscopy methods by not recording the projected image of the object instead the light wave front information originating from the object is digitally recorded as a hologram from which a computer calculates the object image by using a numerical reconstruction algorithm the image forming lens in traditional microscopy is thus replaced by a computer algorithm other closely related microscopy methods to digital holographic microscopy are interferometric microscopy optical coherence tomography and diffraction phase microscopy common to all methods is the use of a reference wave front to obtain amplitude intensity and phase information the information is recorded on a digital image sensor or by a photodetector from which an image of the object is created reconstructed by a computer in traditional microscopy which do not use a reference wave front only intensity information is recorded and essential information about the object is lost holography was invented by dennis gabor to improve electron microscopy nevertheless it never found many concrete and industrial applications in this field actually dhm has mostly been applied to light microscopy in this field it has shown unique applications for 3d characterization of technical samples and enables quantitative characterization of

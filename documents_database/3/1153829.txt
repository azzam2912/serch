neuroligins act as ligands for neurexins which are cell adhesion proteins located presynaptically neuroligin and neurexin shake hands resulting in the connection between two neurons and the production of a synapse neuroligins also affect the properties of neural networks by specifying synaptic functions and they mediate signalling by recruiting and stabilizing key synaptic components neuroligins interact with other postsynaptic proteins to localize neurotransmitter receptors and channels in the postsynaptic density as the cell matures additionally neuroligins are expressed in human peripheral tissues and have been found to play a role in angiogenesis in humans alterations in genes encoding neuroligins are implicated in autism and other cognitive disorders neuroligins bind with the aid of ca to the neurexin lns laminin neurexin and sex hormone binding globulin like folding units domains and to the neurexin lns domain which then establishes a heterophilic trans synaptic recognition code through the observation of the crystal structure of neuroligin 1 it was determined that neuroligin 1 forms a protein dimer when two neurexin 1 beta monomers bind to the neuroligin 1 s two opposite surfaces this forms a heterotetramer which contains an interface for binding ca the interaction of neuroligin and neurexin to form a heterotetramer

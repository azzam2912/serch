recent papers have also proposed the use of viruses to treat infections caused by protozoa antiprotozoals are used to treat protozoal infections which include amebiasis giardiasis cryptosporidiosis microsporidiosis malaria babesiosis trypanosomiasis chagas disease leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis currently many of the treatments for these infections are limited by their toxicity once upon a time protists were considered protozoans but of late the categorization of unicellar organisms has undergone rapid development however in literature including scientific there tends to persist the usage of the term antiprotozoal when they really mean anti protist protists are a supercategory of eukaryota which includes protozoa the mechanisms of antiprotozoal drugs differ significantly drug to drug for example it appears that eflornithine a drug used to treat trypanosomiasis inhibits ornithine decarboxylase while the aminoglycoside antibiotic antiprotozoals used to treat leishmaniasis are thought to inhibit protein synthesis

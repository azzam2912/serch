before the aptian the island was uplifted particularly in the east likely due to the collision of a volcanic island arc in total hispaniola is formed from 11 distinct small island arcs from the albian to the campanian plutonism metamorphism and volcanism began simultaneously taking place underwater on the largely submerged landmass in the campanian a second arc collision took place picrite from the duarte complex in central hispaniola and the enriched basalts in southern haiti have been inferred as galapagos hotspot type island plateau rocks the beloc formation on the southern peninsula of haiti preserves tektites with shocked quartz and plagioclase formed by the asteroid that struck the yucat n peninsula and caused the k pg mass extinction into the paleogene at the start of the cenozoic volcanism metamorphism and plutonism continued underwater until the eocene still largely below water however by the middle eocene the amalgamated island arcs collided with the southern margin of the north american plate at the florida bahama platform leading to the formation of extensive carbonates and the end of volcanism and plutonism the island arc rocks became exposed above the water line and began to erode as an east west strike slip fault

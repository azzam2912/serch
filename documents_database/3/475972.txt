the massey product was created by william s massey an american algebraic topologist let formula 1 be elements of the cohomology algebra formula 2 of a differential graded algebra formula 3 if formula 4 the massey product formula 5 is a subset of formula 6 where formula 7 the massey product is defined algebraically by lifting the elements formula 1 to equivalence classes of elements formula 9 of formula 3 taking the massey products of these and then pushing down to cohomology this may result in a well defined cohomology class or may result in indeterminacy define formula 11 to be formula 12 the cohomology class of an element formula 13 of formula 3 will be denoted by formula 15 the massey triple product of three cohomology classes is defined by the massey product of three cohomology classes is not an element of formula 2 but a set of elements of formula 2 possibly empty and possibly containing more than one element if formula 19 have degrees formula 20 then the massey product has degree formula 21 with the formula 22 coming from the differential formula 23 the massey product is nonempty if the products formula 24 and formula 25

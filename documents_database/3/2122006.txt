the code is released as open source under the mit license although primarily driven by application based research it has been designed as a platform to support the development of novel numerical techniques in the area of high order finite element methods nektar is modern object oriented code written in c and is being actively developed by members of the sherwinlab at imperial college london uk and kirby s group at the university of utah us nektar includes the following capabilities stable versions of the software are released on a 1 month basis and it is supported by an extensive testing framework which ensures correctness across a range of platforms and architectures other capabilities currently under active development include p adaption r adaption and support for accelerators gpgpu intel xeon phi the development of the nektar framework is driven by a number of aerodynamics and biomedical engineering applications and consequently the software package includes a number of pre written solvers for these areas this solver time integrates the incompressible navier stokes equations for performing large scale direct numerical simulation dns in complex geometries it also supports the linearised and adjoint forms of the navier stokes equations for evaluating hydrodynamic stability

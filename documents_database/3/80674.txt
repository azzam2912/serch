it developed low power x86 compatible microprocessors based on a vliw core and a software layer called code morphing software code morphing software consisted of an interpreter a runtime system and a dynamic binary translator x86 instructions were first interpreted one instruction at a time and profiled then depending upon the frequency of execution of a code block cms would progressively generate more optimized translations the vliw core implemented features specifically designed to accelerate cms and translations among the features were support for general speculation detection of memory aliasing and detection of self modifying x86 code the combination of cms and the vliw core allowed for the achievement of full x86 compatibility while maintaining performance and reducing power consumption transmeta was founded in 1995 by bob cmelik dave ditzel colin hunter ed kelly doug laird malcolm wing and greg zyner its first product the crusoe processor was launched on january 19 2000 transmeta went public on november 7 2000 on october 14 2003 it launched its second major product the efficeon processor in 2005 transmeta increased its focus on licensing its portfolio of microprocessor and semiconductor technologies transmeta produced two x86 compatible cpu architectures crusoe and efficeon internal code names

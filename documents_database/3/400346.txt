entities are foundational to the organizational structure and definition of sgml documents the sgml specification defines numerous entity types which are distinguished by keyword qualifiers and context an entity string value may variously consist of plain text sgml tags and or references to previously defined entities certain entity types may also invoke external documents entities are called by reference entities are classified as general or parameter entities are also further classified as parsed or unparsed an internal entity has a value that is either a literal string or a parsed string comprising markup and entities defined in the same document such as a document type declaration or subdocument in contrast an external entity has a declaration that invokes an external document thereby necessitating the intervention of an entity manager to resolve the external document reference an entity declaration may have a literal value or may have some combination of an optional codice 2 identifier which allows sgml parsers to process an entity s string referent as a resource identifier and an optional codice 3 identifier which identifies the entity independent of any particular representation in xml a subset of sgml an entity declaration may not have a codice 3 identifier

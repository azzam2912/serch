it is used for barometric pressure in weather reports refrigeration and aviation in the united states it is the pressure exerted by a column of mercury in height at the standard acceleration of gravity conversion to metric units depends on the temperature of mercury and hence its density typical conversion factors are in older literature an inch of mercury is based on the height of a column of mercury at in english units 1 inhg 0 489 771 psi or 2 041 771 inhg 1 psi aircraft altimeters measure the relative pressure difference between the lower ambient pressure at altitude and a calibrated reading on the ground in the united states canada and japan these altimeter readings are provided in inches of mercury but most other nations use hectopascals ground readings vary with weather and along the route of the aircraft as it travels so current readings are relayed periodically by air traffic control aircraft operating at higher altitudes at or above what is called the transition altitude which varies by country set their barometric altimeters to a standard pressure of 29 92 inhg 1 atm 29 92 inhg or 1013 25 hpa 1 hpa 1 mbar regardless of the

the agc provided computation and electronic interfaces for guidance navigation and control of the spacecraft the agc has a 16 bit word length with 15 data bits and one parity bit most of the software on the agc is stored in a special read only memory known as core rope memory fashioned by weaving wires through and around magnetic cores though a small amount of read write core memory is available astronauts communicated with the agc using a numeric display and keyboard called the dsky for display and keyboard pronounced dis kee the agc and its dsky user interface were developed in the early 1960s for the apollo program by the mit instrumentation laboratory and first flew in 1966 the agc was the first silicon integrated circuit based computer the computer s performance was comparable to the first generation of home computers from the late 1970s such as the apple ii trs 80 and commodore pet astronauts manually flew project gemini with control sticks but computers flew most of project apollo except briefly during lunar landings each moon flight carried two agcs one each in the command module and the lunar module with the exception of apollo 8 which did

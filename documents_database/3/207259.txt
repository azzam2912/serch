some authors also require it to be normal toric varieties form an important and rich class of examples in algebraic geometry which often provide a testing ground for theorems the geometry of a toric variety is fully determined by the combinatorics of its associated fan which often makes computations far more tractable for a certain special but still quite general class of toric varieties this information is also encoded in a polytope which creates a powerful connection of the subject with convex geometry familiar examples of toric varieties are affine space projective spaces products of projective spaces and bundles over projective space the original motivation to study toric varieties was to study torus embeddings given the algebraic torus t the group of characters hom t c forms a lattice given a collection of points a a subset of this lattice each point determines a map to c and thus the collection determines a map to c by taking the zariski closure of the image of such a map one obtains an affine variety if the collection of lattice points a generates the character lattice this variety is a torus embedding in similar fashion one may produce a parametrized projective toric

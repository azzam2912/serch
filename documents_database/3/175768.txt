in visible light this shifts the color from the red end of the spectrum to the blue end doppler blueshift is caused by movement of a source towards the observer the term applies to any decrease in wavelength and increase in frequency caused by relative motion even outside the visible spectrum only objects moving at near relativistic speeds toward the observer are noticeably bluer to the naked eye but the wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or other particle is shortened in the direction of travel doppler blueshift is used in astronomy to determine relative motion unlike the relative doppler blueshift caused by movement of a source towards the observer and thus dependent on the received angle of the photon gravitational blueshift is absolute and does not depend on the received angle of the photon it is a natural consequence of conservation of energy and mass energy equivalence and was confirmed experimentally in 1959 with the pound rebka experiment gravitational blueshift contributes to cosmic microwave background cmb anisotropy via the sachs wolfe effect when a gravitational well evolves while a photon is passing the amount of blueshift on approach will differ from the amount of gravitational redshift as it

it has been erroneously called mycotic dermatitis rainscald is another condition often seen in animals which is also caused by dermatophilus congolensis bacteria d congolensis is facultative anaerobic actinomycete it has two morphologic forms filamentous hyphae and motile zoospores the hyphae are characterized by branching filaments 1 5 m in diameter that ultimately fragment by both transverse and longitudinal separation into packets of coccoid cells the coccoid cells mature into flagellated ovoid zoospores 0 6 1 m in diameter with the microscope one can observe the characteristic tramcar line like d congolensis colonies together with gram positive thin filaments and coccoid forms d congolensis is a carboxiphylic germ so they need carbon dioxide to properly grow on laboratory media the germ grows well on sheep blood enriched agarose media the media must then be incubated at 37 degrees celsius and in a 5 10 atmosphere colonies become visible in 24 48 hours initially they are small with a 1 mm diameter and with a grey yellow colour after 3 4 days the isolated bacterial colonies can reach a 3 mm diameter they have a rough surface and a yellow golden pigmentation beta hemolysis can be seen around the colonies d

albemet am162 is manufactured by materion corporation brush beryllium and composites formerly known as brush wellman albemet is formed by hot consolidating gas atomized prealloyed powder each powder particle contains aluminium between beryllium dendrites producing a uniform microstructure aluminium beryllium metal matrix composite combines the high modulus and low density characteristics of beryllium with the fabrication and mechanical property behaviors of aluminium due to weight advantage be al alloys are used in aerospace and satellite applications the composition of albemet am162 by relative weight is 38 al 62 be albemet has a density of 2 071 g cm 0 07482 lb in the mechanical properties of am162 have been characterized in all three product forms with the extruded product form of albemet having a significant design database the extruded bar is fabricated by cold isostatic pressing ciping the isotropic spherical aluminium beryllium powder into semi dense billets and then canning the billet for subsequent extrusion with a minimum of a 4 1 reduction ratio mechanical properties are minimum values at room temperature wrought mechanical properties for extrusions are in the longitudinal direction transverse properties are generally lower a number of standard extrusion dies are available rolled product is available in

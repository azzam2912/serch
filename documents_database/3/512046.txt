the transformed sequence is computed by an addition operation implemented as if filling a triangular array in a boustrophedon zigzag or serpentine like manner as opposed to a raster scan sawtooth like manner the boustrophedon transform is a numerical sequence generating transformation which is determined by an addition operation generally speaking given a sequence formula 1 the boustrophedon transform yields another sequence formula 2 where formula 3 is likely defined equivalent to formula 4 the entirety of the transformation itself can be visualized or imagined as being constructed by filling out the triangle as shown in figure 1 to fill out the numerical isosceles triangle figure 1 you start with the input sequence formula 1 and place one value from the input sequence per row using the boustrophedon scan zigzag or serpentine like approach the top vertex of the triangle will be the input value formula 4 equivalent to output value formula 3 and we number this top row as row 0 the subsequent rows going down to the base of the triangle are numbered consecutively from 0 as integers let formula 8 denote the number of the row currently being filled these rows are constructed according to the row

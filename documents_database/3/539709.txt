typically the light color is measured on a scale known as color temperature as well as along a green magenta axis orthogonal to the color temperature axis without color correction gels a scene may have a mix of various colors applying color correction gels in front of light sources can alter the color of the various light sources to match mixed lighting can produce an undesirable aesthetic when displayed on a television or in a theatre conversely gels may also be used to make a scene appear more natural by simulating the mix of color temperatures that occur naturally this application is useful especially where motivated lighting lending the impression that it is diegetic is the goal color gels may also be used to tint lights for artistic effect the particular color of a white light source can be simplified into a correlated color temperature cct the higher the cct the bluer the light appears sunlight at 5600k for example appears much bluer than tungsten light at 3200k unlike a chromaticity diagram the kelvin scale reduces the light source s color into one dimension thus light sources of the same cct may appear green or magenta in comparison with one

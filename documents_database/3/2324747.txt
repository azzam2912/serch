his phd advisor was sigurd zienau after postdoctoral positions at the university of sussex and queen mary university of london he became a professor first at the university of glasgow and then in 1971 moved to the university of cambridge where he remained ever since he is a fellow of trinity college in 1989 osborn has obtained the first proof of the four dimensional c theorem which was conjectured one year earlier by john cardy osborn s proof was applicable to renormalization group flows which are perturbative that is do not deviate far from the free quantum field theories and was valid to all orders in perturbation theory it provided a strong hint that the four dimensional c theorem must be universally valid but a nonperturbative proof of this fact was found only in 2011 by zohar komargodski and adam schwimmer in 2001 and 2004 osborn in collaboration with francis dolan obtained explicit expressions for the conformal blocks in four dimensional conformal field theories starting from 2008 these results found many important applications within the conformal bootstrap approach to conformal field theories

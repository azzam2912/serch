the location was at the edge of the bellingshausen sea southwest of chile the asteroid was estimated to be about in diameter and the impact would have left a crater approximately across the possible impact site was first discovered in 1981 as an iridium anomaly in sediment cores collected by the research vessel eltanin after which the site and impactor are named later studies were done by the vessel polarstern sediment at the bottom of the deep ocean in the area had an iridium enrichment a strong sign of extraterrestrial contamination possible debris from the asteroid is spread over an area of sediments from the eocene and paleocene were jumbled and deposited again chaotically also mixed in were melted and fragmented meteorite matter the area near the freeden seamounts over has a meteorite material surface density of of this 87 is melted and 13 only fragmented this area is the region of the earth s surface with the highest known density of meteorite material coverage the disturbed sediment had three layers the lowermost layer su iv is a chaotic mixture of crumbled sediments in the form of a breccia above this is layer su iii consisting of layered sand deposited

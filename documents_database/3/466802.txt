it forms several hydrates the most common being the pentahydrate 5 calcium lactate is used in medicine mainly to treat calcium deficiencies and as a food additive with e number of e327 some cheese crystals consist of calcium lactate the lactate ion is chiral with two enantiomers d r and l s the l isomer is the one normally synthesized and metabolized by living organisms but some bacteria can produce the d form or convert the l to d thus calcium lactate also has d and l isomers where all anions are of the same type some synthesis processes yield a mixture of the two in equal parts resulting in the dl racemic salt both the l and the dl forms occur as crystals on the surface of aging cheddar cheese the solubility of calcium l lactate in water increases significantly in presence of d gluconate ions from 6 7 g dl at 25 c to 9 74 g dl or more paradoxically while the solubility of calcium l lactate increases with temperature from 10 c 4 8 g dl to 30 c 8 5 g dl the concentration of free ions decreases by almost one half this is explained

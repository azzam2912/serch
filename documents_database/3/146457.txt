apparent specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a volume of the substance to the weight of an equal volume of the reference substance the reference substance for liquids is nearly always water at its densest at for gases it is air at room temperature nonetheless the temperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference pressure is nearly always temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry in british beer brewing the practice for specific gravity as specified above is to multiply it by 1 000 specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as brines hydrocarbons antifreeze coolants sugar solutions syrups juices honeys brewers wort must etc and acids being a ratio of densities specific gravity is a dimensionless quantity independent of the systems of units used to make measurements specific gravity varies with temperature and pressure reference and sample must be compared at the same temperature and pressure or be corrected to a standard reference temperature and pressure substances with a specific gravity of 1 are neutrally buoyant in water those with sg

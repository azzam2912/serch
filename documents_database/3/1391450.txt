display of great potential by nanostructures for thermoelectric applications also motivates the studies of thermal transport in such devices these fields however generate two contradictory demands high thermal conductivity to deal with heating issues in sub 100 nm devices and low thermal conductivity for thermoelectric applications these issues can be addressed with phonon engineering once nanoscale thermal behaviors have been studied and understood in general two carrier types can contribute to thermal conductivity electrons and phonons in nanostructures phonons usually dominate and the phonon properties of the structure become of a particular importance for thermal conductivity these phonon properties include phonon group velocity phonon scattering mechanisms heat capacity gr neisen parameter unlike bulk materials nanoscale devices have thermal properties which are complicated by boundary effects due to small size it has been shown that in some cases phonon boundary scattering effects dominate the thermal conduction processes reducing thermal conductivity depending on the nanostructure size the phonon mean free path values may be comparable or larger than the object size formula 1 when formula 1 is larger than the phonon mean free path umklapp scattering process limits thermal conductivity regime of diffusive thermal conductivity when formula 1 is comparable to or

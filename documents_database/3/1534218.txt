the term numerical response was coined by m e solomon in 1949 it is associated with the functional response which is the change in predator s rate of prey consumption with change in prey density as holling notes total predation can be expressed as a combination of functional and numerical response the numerical response has two mechanisms the demographic response and the aggregational response the numerical response is not necessarily proportional to the change in prey density usually resulting in a time lag between prey and predator populations for example there is often a scarcity of predators when the prey population is increasing the demographic response consists of changes in the rates of predator reproduction or survival due to a changes in prey density the increase in prey availability translates into higher energy intake and reduced energy output this is different from an increase in energy intake due to increased foraging efficiency which is considered a functional response this concept can be articulated in the lotka volterra predator prey model formula 1 a conversion efficiency the fraction of prey energy assimilated by the predator and turned into new predators p predator density v prey density m predator mortality demographic response

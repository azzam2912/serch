proposals for commemorating york s war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in january 1920 opted for a monument the city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged lutyens who had recently been commissioned by the north eastern railway ner to design their own war memorial also to be sited in york lutyens first design was approved but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city s and the ner s memorials members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with york s existing architecture especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls and that the ner s memorial would overshadow the city s continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on leeman road just outside the walls and lutyens submitted a new design of a war cross and stone of remembrance to fit the location this was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds

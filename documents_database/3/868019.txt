that prompted the development of the 7080 which was fully compatible with all models of the 705 and added many improvements for backward compatibility with the ibm 705 the machine had two switches on the operator s control panel 705 i ii and 40k memory that selected the mode the machine started in software can then command the 7080 to enter full 7080 mode from any 705 startup mode regardless of mode the 7080 operates at full 7080 speed the 7080 system included the ibm 7622 signal control which converted transistor signal levels to levels usable with first generation equipment allowing all 705 peripherals including punched card input output line printers and the ibm 727 magnetic tape drives to be used on the 7080 second generation ibm 729 tape drives connected to the cpu via the ibm 7621 tape control

although total nitrogen levels are fairly high up to 12 the bioavailability of this nitrogen may be low feather meal is used in formulated animal feed and in organic fertilizer worldwide more than 25 billion chickens are used for human consumption feather meal is made through a process called rendering steam pressure cookers with temperatures over 140 c are used to cook and sterilize the feathers this partially hydrolyzes the proteins which denatures them it is then dried cooled and ground into a powder for use as a nitrogen source for animal feed mostly ruminants or as an organic soil amendment containing up to 12 nitrogen it is a source of slow release organic high nitrogen fertilizer for organic gardens it is not water soluble and does not make a good liquid fertilizer it can be used to when adding it to a garden as a nitrogen source it must be blended into the soil to start the decomposition to make the nitrogenous compounds available to the plants as an organic garden fertilizer it is not synthetic or petroleum based a 2012 study found that feather meal contributes to inorganic arsenic exposure to humans whether it be in the form

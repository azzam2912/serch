atm was developed to meet the needs of the broadband integrated services digital network as defined in the late 1980s and designed to integrate telecommunication networks additionally it was designed for networks that must handle both traditional high throughput data traffic e g file transfers and real time low latency content such as voice and video the reference model for atm approximately maps to the three lowest layers of the iso osi reference model network layer data link layer and physical layer atm is a core protocol used over the sonet sdh backbone of the public switched telephone network pstn and integrated services digital network isdn but its use is declining in favour of all ip atm provides functionality that uses features of circuit switching and packet switching networks atm uses asynchronous time division multiplexing and encodes data into small fixed sized packets iso osi frames called cells this differs from approaches such as the internet protocol or ethernet that use variable sized packets and frames atm uses a connection oriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins these virtual circuits may be permanent i e dedicated connections that

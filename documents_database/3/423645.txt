the abwr is currently offered by ge hitachi nuclear energy geh and toshiba the abwr generates electrical power by using steam to power a turbine connected to a generator the steam is boiled from water using heat generated by fission reactions within nuclear fuel kashiwazaki kariwa unit 6 is considered the first generation iii reactor in the world boiling water reactors bwrs are the second most common form of light water reactor with a direct cycle design that uses fewer large steam supply components than the pressurized water reactor pwr which employs an indirect cycle the abwr is the present state of the art in boiling water reactors and is the first generation iii reactor design to be fully built with several reactors complete and operating the first reactors were built on time and under budget in japan with others under construction there and in taiwan abwrs were on order in the united states including two reactors at the south texas project site although the project is currently halted the projects in both taiwan and us are both reported over budgeted the standard abwr plant design has a net electrical output of about generated from about of thermal power the

however he noticed that these compounds tend to be highly unstable in 1989 a group finally synthesized a homoleptic complex with trimethylsilyl groups u ch sime since then variants of higher coordination numbers such as li tmeda ume have also been synthesized on the other hand only one homoleptic thorium alkyl is known the seven coordinate heptamethylthorate iv anion was synthesized in 1984 using a similar procedure to the equivalent uranium complex mixed phosphine containing complexes of thorium and uranium tetramethyls have also been made using dmpe as the organophosphorus ligand stabilising the structure amides can also assume this role uranium and thorium both form metallacycles with a diverse chemistry these complexes are of course very labile so trimethylsilyl groups are again present for protection these compounds are formed by reacting weaker alkylating agents lich and mg ch are simply too strong and they ll form simple alkyls with clan n si ch an th u a large majority of the organoactinides involve cyclopentadienyl cp cyclooctatetraene cot and their derivatives as ligands these usually take part in 5 and 8 bonding donating electron density through their pi orbitals actinides form sandwich complexes with cyclooctatetraene analogously to how transition metals react

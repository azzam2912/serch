it is one of the strongest acids triflic acid is mainly used in research as a catalyst for esterification it is a hygroscopic colorless slightly viscous liquid and is soluble in polar solvents trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is produced industrially by electrochemical fluorination ecf of methanesulfonic acid the resulting cfsof is hydrolyzed and the resulting triflate salt is preprotonated alternatively trifluoromethanesulfonic acid arises by oxidation of trifluoromethylsulfenyl chloride triflic acid is purified by distillation from triflic anhydride trifluoromethanesulfonic acid was first synthesized in 1954 by robert haszeldine and kidd by the following reaction in the laboratory triflic acid is useful in protonations because the conjugate base of triflic acid is nonnucleophilic it is also used as an acidic titrant in nonaqueous acid base titration because it behaves as a strong acid in many solvents acetonitrile acetic acid etc where common mineral acids such as hcl or hso are only moderately strong with a k 5 10 p k 14 7 2 0 triflic acid qualifies as a superacid it owes many of its useful properties to its great thermal and chemical stability both the acid and its conjugate base cfso known as triflate resist oxidation reduction reactions whereas many strong acids are

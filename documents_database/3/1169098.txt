the iupac name is poly 1 carboxyethylene they may be homopolymers of acrylic acid or crosslinked with an allyl ether of pentaerythritol allyl ether of sucrose or allyl ether of propylene in a water solution at neutral ph paa is an anionic polymer i e many of the side chains of paa will lose their protons and acquire a negative charge this makes paas polyelectrolytes with the ability to absorb and retain water and swell to many times their original volume dry paas are sold as white fluffy powders that are frequently used as gels in cosmetic and personal care products their role in cosmetics is to suspend solid in liquids prevent emulsions from separating and control the consistency in flow of cosmetics carbomer codes 910 934 940 941 and 934p are an indication of molecular weight and the specific components of the polymer for many applications paas are used in form of alkali metal or ammonium salts e g sodium polyacrylate in the dry powder form the positively charged sodium ions are bound to the polyacrylate however in aqueous solutions the sodium ions are free to move since they are replaced by positively charged hydrogen ions instead of an

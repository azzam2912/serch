recently there have been findings of fossils in the north to northeast of madagascar reconstructions indicate that the extinct lemurs did not climb very often and imply that they were much more adept at terrestrial living more than any other extant strepsirrhhine they are not believed to have been exclusively terrestrial but rather to have had a combined habitat of ground and arboreal life a modest degree of curvature found in the remains support this idea the hands and feet are very robust and large in size but are very short and said to be closer to the likeness of a baboon s hand the hind limbs are also known to be short which implies that the hands and feet are relatively short for the lemur s body weight archaeolemur is unique in the combination of post cranial features the overall look of the lemur beyond just the hands and feet was a relatively short and stocky one which gave them limited leaping abilities this indicates that the archaeolemur may have ranged over wide landscapes which is consistent with its subfossil distribution over much of madagascar this implies they had a high tolerance for broad habitats they are thought to

periostin functions as a ligand for alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 integrins to support adhesion and migration of epithelial cells periostin is a gla domain vitamin k dependent factor periostin is a secreted extracellular matrix protein that was originally identified in cells from the mesenchymal lineage osteoblasts osteoblast derived cells the periodontal ligament and periosteum it has been associated with the epithelial mesenchymal transition in cancer and with the differentiation of mesenchyme in the developing heart this protein shares a homology with fasciclin i a secreted cell adhesion molecule found in insects in many cancers periostin binds to integrins on cancer cells activating the akt pkb and fak mediated signaling pathways this leads to increased cell survival invasion angiogenesis metastasis and the epithelial mesenchymal transition in humans and mice periostin undergoes alternative splicing in its c terminal region resulting in specific isoforms that can be observed in a broad range of cancers such as pancreatic colon and breast cancer while periostin plays a wide variety of roles in tissue development along with disease its function in tissue remodeling as a response to injury is a common underlying role in these different mechanisms periostin is transiently upregulated

delta encoding is sometimes called delta compression particularly where archival histories of changes are required e g in revision control software the differences are recorded in discrete files called deltas or diffs in situations where differences are small for example the change of a few words in a large document or the change of a few records in a large table delta encoding greatly reduces data redundancy collections of unique deltas are substantially more space efficient than their non encoded equivalents from a logical point of view the difference between two data values is the information required to obtain one value from the other see relative entropy the difference between identical values under some equivalence is often called 0 or the neutral element perhaps the simplest example is storing values of bytes as differences deltas between sequential values rather than the values themselves so instead of 2 4 6 9 7 we would store 2 2 2 3 2 this reduces the variance range of the values when neighbor samples are correlated enabling a lower bit usage for the same data iff 8svx sound format applies this encoding to raw sound data before applying compression to it unfortunately not even

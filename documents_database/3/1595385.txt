the northwest southeast trending anticline was caused by tectonic movements probably starting in the upper cretaceous the anticline was named after mareuil a small town in the northwestern dordogne france the centre of the structure is near sainte croix de mareuil somewhat farther to the northwest in plan view the anticline has the shape of an elongated pear with its long axis aligned nw se and reaching about 5 km in length the cenomanian turonian boundary serving as a reference horizon the short axis is only 2 km in length the structure is doubly asymmetric with steeper dipping northeastern and northwestern limbs it is accompanied on its northeastern side by the mareuil fault which starts at la rochebeaucourt and continues to the north of brant me along this fault the northeastern side of the anticline was pushed up by about 30 m on the southeastern side of the anticline there are several smaller cross cutting faults locally disturbing the angle of dip these cross faults are all following riedel directions either the r or the r position hinting at an underlying shear zone seen from the edge of the northeastern aquitaine basin the mareuil anticline forms the first structural high

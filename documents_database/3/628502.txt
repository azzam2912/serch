while all the functional roles of apob within the ldl and all larger particles remains somewhat unclear it is the primary organizing protein of the entire complex shell enclosing carrying fat molecules within component of the particles and is absolutely required for the formation of these particles what is also clear is that the apob on the ldl particle acts as a ligand for ldl receptors in various cells throughout the body i e less formally apob indicates fat carrying particles are ready to enter any cells with apob receptors and deliver fats carried within into the cells through mechanisms only partially understood high levels of apob especially associated with the higher ldl particle concentrations are the primary driver of plaques that cause vascular disease atherosclerosis commonly first becoming obviously symptomatic as heart disease stroke many other body wide complications after decades of progression there is considerable evidence that concentrations of apob and especially the nmr assay specific for ldl particle concentrations are superior indicators of vascular heart disease driving physiology than either total cholesterol or ldl cholesterol as long promoted by the nih starting in the early 1970s however primarily for historic cost complexity reasons cholesterol and estimated ldl

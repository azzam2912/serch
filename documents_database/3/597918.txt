it is used by plants and photosynthetic bacteria to collect more of the incoming light than would be captured by the photosynthetic reaction center alone light harvesting complexes are found in a wide variety among the different photosynthetic species the complexes consist of proteins and photosynthetic pigments and surround a photosynthetic reaction center to focus energy attained from photons absorbed by the pigment toward the reaction center using f rster resonance energy transfer absorption of a photon by a molecule takes place leading to electronic excitation when the energy of the captured photon matches that of an electronic transition the fate of such excitation can be a return to the ground state or another electronic state of the same molecule when the excited molecule has a nearby neighbour molecule the excitation energy may also be transferred through electromagnetic interactions from one molecule to another this process is called resonance energy transfer and the rate depends strongly on the distance between the energy donor and energy acceptor molecules light harvesting complexes have their pigments specifically positioned to optimize these rates purple bacteria use bacteriochlorophyll and caretonoids to gather light energy these proteins are arranged in a ring like fashion creating a

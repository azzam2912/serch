researchers studying the swamp sparrow melospiza georgiana have demonstrated that young birds are born with this ability because juvenile males raised in acoustic isolation and tutored with artificial recordings choose to learn only songs that contain their own species syllables studies conducted at later life stages indicate that conspecific song preference is further refined and strengthened throughout development as a function of social experience the selective response properties of neurons in the songbird auditory pathway has been proposed as the mechanism responsible for both the innate and acquired components of this preference the mechanism responsible for the ability to distinguish song types has not yet been fully characterized by researchers in the field of neuroethology but it has been demonstrated that at least five different structures within the auditory pathway contain neurons that preferentially respond to conspecific song the structure of neural networks the morphology of neurons and the receptor and ion channel complement of pre synaptic connections cause some neurons to respond maximally to a particular stimulus frequency phase amplitude or temporal pattern and this is known as spectral temporal tuning tight spectral temporal tuning in the auditory pathway provides the central nervous system of songbirds with the ability

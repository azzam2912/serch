the receptor is a member of the prostaglandin receptors belonging to the subfamily a14 of rhodopsin like receptors activation of dp1 by pgd2 or other cognate receptor ligands is associated with a variety of physiological and pathological responses in animal models the ptgdr1 gene is located on chromosome 14 at position q22 1 i e 14q22 1 a chromosomal locus associated with asthma and other allergic disorders ptgdr1 which consists of 4 introns and 5 exons encodes for a 44 kilodalton protein but also multiple alternative spliced transcript variants https www ncbi nlm nih gov gene 5729 dp1 is expressed primarily by cells involved in mediating allergic and inflammatory reactions i e human and rodent mast cells basophils and eosinophils th2 cells and dendritic cells and by cells contributing to these reactions i e human and or rodent airway epithelial cells vascular endothelium mucus secreting goblet cells in the nasal and colonic mucosa and serous gland cells of the nose dp1 protein is expressed in mouse placenta and testes and mrna transcripts have also been detected in the meninges of the mouse brain by multiple reports and by single reports in the rat meninges as well as the mouse thalamus

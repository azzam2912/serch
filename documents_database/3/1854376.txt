regenerative processes may have applications in humans for treating degenerative retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa while mammals such as humans and mice lack the innate ability to regenerate the retina lower vertebrates such as teleost fish and salamanders are capable of regenerating lost retinal tissue in the event of damage zebrafish like other teleost fish possess the innate ability to regenerate retinal damage this ability combined with the considerable similarity between teleost and mammalian retinal structure makes zebrafish an attractive model for the study of retinal regeneration muller glia are a type of glial cell present in both the teleost and mammalian retina retinal regeneration in zebrafish is mediated by muller glia which dedifferentiate into stem like cells and proliferate into neural progenitor cells in response to retinal damage while muller glia division is responsible for the regeneration of the retina in all cases of retinal damage the case of photoreceptor loss due to light damage is particularly well characterized in response to photoreceptor ablation muller glia dedifferentiate and undergo a single asymmetric division to produce a neural progenitor cell and a new muller glia cell the neural progenitor cell proliferates to form a cluster of neural progenitors which

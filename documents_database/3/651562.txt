given an oriented line let formula 2 be the number of points at which formula 1 and intersect we can parametrize the general line by the direction formula 4 in which it points and its signed distance formula 5 from the origin the crofton formula expresses the arc length of the curve formula 1 in terms of an integral over the space of all oriented lines the differential form is invariant under rigid motions so it is a natural integration measure for speaking of an average number of intersections the right hand side in the crofton formula is sometimes called the favard length both sides of the crofton formula are additive over concatenation of curves so it suffices to prove the formula for a single line segment since the right hand side does not depend on the positioning of the line segment it must equal some function of the segment s length because again the formula is additive over concatenation of line segments the integral must be a constant times the length of the line segment it remains only to determine the factor of 1 4 this is easily done by computing both sides when is the unit circle the

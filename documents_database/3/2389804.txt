it is an alkane paraffin in older nomenclature a fully saturated hydrocarbon specifically one of the isomers of heptane like typical alkanes it is a colorless flammable compound under common ambient conditions it is a mobile liquid less dense than water 2 3 dimethylpentane is notable for being one of the two simplest alkanes with optical isomerism the optical center is the middle carbon of the pentane backbone which is connected to one hydrogen atom one methyl group one ethyl group and one isopropyl group the two enantiomers are denoted 3s 2 3 dimethylpentane and 3r 2 3 dimethylpentane the other simplest chiral alkane is its structural isomer 3 methylhexane most properties listed in the literature refer to the racemic compound equimolar mixture of the two optical isomers the boiling point of 89 7 c is 0 3 c higher than the value 89 4 c predicted by wiener s formula based on the structure of the molecule and the boiling point of n heptane the speed of sound at 3 mhz is 1149 5 m s at 20 c and 889 5 m s at 80 c the racemic mixture has a glass transition temperature at about 123 k

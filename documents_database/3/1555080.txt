its significance is that it was the first aircraft to fly and test the junkers doppelfl gel double wing control surfaces used very successfully on the later junkers ju 52 the junkers j 29 was a small aerodynamically clean low wing cantilever monoplane constructed with junkers standard method of duralumin tube frames skinned with corrugated sheets of the same alloy the wing of the j 29 was straight tapered almost entirely on the trailing edge and had nearly square tips the j 29 pioneered the patented junkers doppelfl gel double wing control system whose concept was used through to the third reich s junkers ju 87 stuka dive bomber using full span ailerons later used for both ailerons and flaps hinged just below the wing trailing edge and fully exposing the entire control surface cross section to the slipstream forming a slot between the two surfaces in normal flight these were used as standard ailerons but they could be lowered like flaps for landing whilst retaining the differential movement needed for lateral control the fuselage was flat sided with rounded decking the junkers l1a inline engine cowled with its cylinder heads slightly exposed pilot and passenger sat side by side

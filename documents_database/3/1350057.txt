physically the integrals represent statistical averages using the fermi dirac distribution when the inverse temperature formula 1 is a large quantity the integral can be expanded in terms of formula 1 as where formula 4 is used to denote the derivative of formula 5 evaluated at formula 6 and where the formula 7 notation refers to limiting behavior of order formula 8 the expansion is only valid if formula 5 vanishes as formula 10 and goes no faster than polynomially in formula 11 as formula 12 if the integral is from zero to infinity then the integral in the first term of the expansion is from zero to formula 13 and the second term is unchanged integrals of this type appear frequently when calculating electronic properties like the heat capacity in the free electron model of solids in these calculations the above integral expresses the expected value of the quantity formula 5 for these integrals we can then identify formula 1 as the inverse temperature and formula 13 as the chemical potential therefore the sommerfeld expansion is valid for large formula 1 low temperature systems we seek an expansion that is second order in temperature i e to formula 18

extrasolar liquid water has not yet been found to exist the following list contains candidates from the list of confirmed objects that meet the following criteria most known extrasolar planetary systems appear to have very different compositions from the solar system though there is sampling bias arising from the detection methods the goal of current searches is to find earth sized planets in the habitable zone of their planetary systems also called the goldilocks zone planets with oceans could include earth sized moons of giant planets though it remains speculative whether such moons really exist the kepler telescope might be sensitive enough to detect them but there is evidence that rocky planets hosting water may be commonplace throughout the milky way later work suggests that gliese 581 c would probably be too hot for liquid water it was then suggested that gliese 581 d might be warm enough for oceans if a greenhouse effect was operating gliese 581 d is eight times the mass of the earth and might have a thick atmosphere gliese 581 d looks an even better candidate the orbital period was originally estimated at 83 days and has now been revised to 66 days this was

in 1999 cloned coq7 from human heart they found that the predicted protein contains 179 amino acids is mostly helical and contains an alpha helical membrane insertion it has a potential n glycosylation site a phosphorylation site for protein kinase c and another for casein kinase ii and 3 n myristoylation sites northern blot analysis detected 3 transcripts a 1 kb transcript was predominant in heart and a 3 kb transcript was predominant in skeletal muscle kidney and pancreas vajo et al found in 2000 that alterations in venous reactivity to alpha and beta adrenergic nitric oxide no dependent and other drugs are present in many genetically determined and acquired conditions such as hypertension smoking and aging in 2001 fawcett bennett hamel vajo and duckworth showed that the effect of human insulin and its analogues on protein degradation vary significantly in different cell types and with different experimental conditions the differences seen in the action of the insulin analogues cannot be attributed to binding differences only post receptor mechanisms including intracellular processing and degradation must be also considered since then recombinant dna technology and the use of insulin analogues has become a major part of the treatment of diabetes more

the taxon is roughly identical to that defined for the homobasidiomycetes alternatively called holobasidiomycetes by hibbett thorn with the inclusion of auriculariales and sebacinales it includes not only mushroom forming fungi but also most species placed in the deprecated taxa gasteromycetes and homobasidiomycetes within the subdivision agaricomycotina which already excludes the smut and rust fungi the agaricomycetes can be further defined by the exclusion of the classes tremellomycetes and dacrymycetes which are generally considered to be jelly fungi however a few former jelly fungi such as auricularia are classified in the agaricomycetes according to a 2008 estimate agaricomycetes include 17 orders 100 families 1147 genera and about 21000 species modern molecular phylogenetic analyses have been since used to help define several new orders in the agaricomycetes amylocorticiales jaapiales stereopsidales and lepidostromatales although morphology of the mushroom or fruit body basidiocarp was the basis of early classification of the agaricomycetes this is no longer the case as an example the distinction between the gasteromycetes including puffballs and agaricomycetes most other agaric mushrooms is no longer recognized as a natural one various puffball species have apparently evolved independently from agaricomycete fungi however most mushroom guide books still group the puffballs or gasteroid

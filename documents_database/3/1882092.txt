they have temperatures in excess of 30 000 kelvins k stars of this type have strong absorption lines of ionised helium strong lines of other ionised elements and hydrogen and neutral helium lines weaker than spectral type b stars of this type are particularly rare only 0 00002 1 in 5 000 000 to 0 00005 1 in 2 000 000 of all stars are o type but because they are very bright they can be seen at great distances and four of the 90 brightest stars as seen from earth are o type due to their high mass o type stars end their lives rather quickly in violent supernova explosions resulting in black holes or neutron stars most of these stars are young massive main sequence giant or supergiant stars but the central stars of planetary nebulae old low mass stars near the end of their lives also usually have o spectra o type stars are typically located in regions of active star formation such as the spiral arms of a spiral galaxy or a pair of galaxies undergoing collision and merger such as the antennae galaxies these stars illuminate any surrounding material and are largely responsible for the

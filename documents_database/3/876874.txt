as a result of this reflection which is often key in the long distance propagation of radio waves some of the shortwave signal strength is decreased in this regard isab is the primary limiting factor in radio propagation isab is only a factor in the period of the day where radio signals travel through the portion of the ionosphere facing the sun the solar wind and radiation cause the ionosphere to become charged with electrons in the first place at night the atmosphere becomes drained of its charge and radio signals can go much farther with less loss of signal in particular low frequency signals that would be attenuated to nothing during the day will be received much farther away at night the specific amount of attenuation can be derived as a function of the inverse square law the lower the frequency the greater the attenuation relative ionospheric absorption can be measured using a riometer

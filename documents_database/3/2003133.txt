tremetone is the main constituent of at least 11 chemically related substances in tremetol tremetone is toxic to fish but not to chicken and is therefore not the major toxic compound in tremetol tremetol can be found in a number of different species of the family asteraceae including snakeroot and rayless goldenrod isocoma pluriflora tremetol an oil with a straw colored tinge was first isolated from white snakeroot by j f couch in 1929 column chromatography of tremetol yielded a hydrocarbon two steroids and three ketones further isolation experiments revealed that tremetone is the major ketone constituent of the compound tremetol hence tremetone was hypothesized to be responsible for the trembles that characterize the milk sickness disease tremetone was first synthesized in july 1963 by degraw bowen and bonner this synthesis is illustrated below this synthesis had a 75 yield but the final product was a racemate that wouldn t suitably undergo chiral resolution this prevented isolation of the natural levorotary enantiomer of tremetone thus limiting the ability to further analyze its biological mechanisms however in november 1963 the enantiomers of tremetone were isolated by bowen et al via the synthesis illustrated below

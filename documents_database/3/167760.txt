it is between ba10 and ba45 ba46 is known as middle frontal area 46 in the human brain it occupies approximately the middle third of the middle frontal gyrus and the most rostral portion of the inferior frontal gyrus brodmann area 46 roughly corresponds with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlpfc although the borders of area 46 are based on cytoarchitecture rather than function the dlpfc also encompasses part of granular frontal area 9 directly adjacent on the dorsal surface of the cortex cytoarchitecturally ba46 is bounded dorsally by the granular frontal area 9 rostroventrally by the frontopolar area 10 and caudally by the triangular area 45 brodmann 1909 there is some discrepancy between the extent of ba8 brodmann 1905 and the same area as described by walker 1940 the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays a central role in sustaining attention and managing working memory and has recently been shown to regulate self control it is one of the few cortical areas whose activity diminishes during rem sleep the high connectivity of this area within the frontal lobe as well as other parts of the brain means that damage can have a wide variety of effects lesions impair short term memory cause

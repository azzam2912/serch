it is an optimization problem that belongs to the class of covering problems and can be solved in polynomial time formally an edge cover of a graph g is a set of edges c such that each vertex in g is incident with at least one edge in c the set c is said to cover the vertices of g the following figure shows examples of edge coverings in two graphs a minimum edge covering is an edge covering of smallest possible size the edge covering number formula 1 is the size of a minimum edge covering the following figure shows examples of minimum edge coverings note that the figure on the right is not only an edge cover but also a matching in particular it is a perfect matching a matching m in which each vertex is incident with exactly one edge in m a perfect matching if it exists is always a minimum edge covering a smallest edge cover can be found in polynomial time by finding a maximum matching and extending it greedily so that all vertices are covered in the following figure a maximum matching is marked with red the extra edges that were added to

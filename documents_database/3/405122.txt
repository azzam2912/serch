specifically the power of a point p with respect to a circle o of radius r is defined by figure 1 where s is the distance between p and the center o of the circle by this definition points inside the circle have negative power points outside have positive power and points on the circle have zero power for external points the power equals the square of the length of a tangent from the point to the circle the power of a point is also known as the point s circle power or the power of a circle with respect to the point the power of point p see in figure 1 can be defined equivalently as the product of distances from the point p to the two intersection points of any ray emanating from p for example in figure 1 a ray emanating from p intersects the circle in two points m and n whereas a tangent ray intersects the circle in one point t the horizontal ray from p intersects the circle at a and b the endpoints of the diameter their respective products of distances are equal to each other and to the power of point p

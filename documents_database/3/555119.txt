named after max born and theodore von k rm n this condition is often applied in solid state physics to model an ideal crystal born and von karman published a series of articles in 1912 and 1913 that presented one of the first theories of specific heat of solids based on the crystaline hypothesis and included these boundary conditions the condition can be stated as where i runs over the dimensions of the bravais lattice the a are the primitive vectors of the lattice and the n are integers assuming the lattice has n cells where n nnn this definition can be used to show that for any lattice translation vector t such that note however the born von karman boundary conditions are useful when n are large infinite the born von karman boundary condition is important in solid state physics for analyzing many features of crystals such as diffraction and the band gap modeling the potential of a crystal as a periodic function with the born von karman boundary condition and plugging in schr dinger s equation results in a proof of bloch s theorem which is particularly important in understanding the band structure of crystals

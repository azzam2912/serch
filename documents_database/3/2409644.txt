mizrahi feminism is inspired by both black feminism and intersectional feminism and seeks to bring about the liberation of women and social equality through recognition of the particular place mizrahi women hold on the social map and all the ways it affects mizrahi women some of the sociological research on ethnicity and gender in israeli society describes and analyzes the ways in which mizrahi jews are excluded and marginalized by the ashkenazi hegemony as well as the ways in which women are excluded and marginalized by the patriarchal social structure the labor market and the state while marxist feminism had previously linked the gender factor of oppression to that of class it was mizrahi feminism that pointed to the close relationship that exists in israel between the class factor and the ethnic factor and thus sought to connect more closely the sociological discourse about mizrahim to the sociological discourse on women in israel the basic claim of mizrahi feminism is that lower class women find themselves positioned not only at the margins of the class ladder below men but also below upper class women therefore the differences between groups of women are sometimes greater than the differences between the men

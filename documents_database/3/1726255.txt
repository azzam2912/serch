the idea behind the gum s composition was developed by professor terence cosgrove at the university of bristol and it was developed by the british company revolymer rev7 is designed to be a low adhesive gum that unlike conventional gum can be easily removed from a variety of surfaces and which degrades and disperses over a short time scale when in contact with water conventional chewing gums use poly styrene co butadiene or poly ethylene co vinylacetate in contrast rev7 gum contains an amphiphilic material containing both hydrophobic water repellent and hydrophilic water attracting regions which aids in the degradability and removability of the substance it is composed of a polyisoprene backbone and grafts of poly ethylene oxide peo and has a cas number of 1246080 53 4 the polymer was developed at the university of bristol in an effort to curb pollution issues due to regular chewing gum which are prevalent in the united kingdom britain spends over 150 million annually as of 2008 on gum cleanup efforts using techniques such as high pressure steam hoses corrosive materials and freezing machines to help remove this synthetic material from sidewalks and other public spaces its name is derived from the

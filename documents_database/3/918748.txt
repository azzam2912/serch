the vertebrate host are birds this species was first described in 2007 by valkiunas et al the parasite infects erythrocytes the influence of trophozoites on the morphology of infected erythrocytes is not marked the parasite nucleus is small usually terminal in position or with chromatin concentrated along the outer periphery of trophozoites one or two small fan like and contain 7 8 merozoites range 4 10 they measure 5 0 micrometres range 3 3 6 2 in length 2 2 micrometres in width range 1 7 3 1 and 9 4 square micrometres range 5 4 12 2 in area the pigment granules occupy 0 8 1 3 square micrometres in area fully grown gametocytes occupy positions lateral to the nuclei of infected erythrocytes they are elongated in form and irregular in outline from the earliest stages of their development the influence of gametocytes on the morphology of infected erythrocytes usually is not pronounced but nuclei of some infected erythrocytes may be slightly displaced laterally the parasite nucleus is diffuse and its boundaries are difficult to discern the chromatin may be positioned anywhere in the gametocyte which is a rare feature for macrogametocytes of avian hemosporidians pigment granules are roundish

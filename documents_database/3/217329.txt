the architectural design and first implementation were carried out at the sti design center in austin texas over a four year period beginning march 2001 on a budget reported by sony as approaching us 400 million cell is shorthand for cell broadband engine architecture commonly abbreviated cbea in full or cell be in part the first major commercial application of cell was in sony s playstation 3 game console mercury computer systems has a dual cell server a dual cell blade configuration a rugged computer and a pci express accelerator board available in different stages of production toshiba had announced plans to incorporate cell in high definition television sets but seems to have abandoned the idea exotic features such as the xdr memory subsystem and coherent element interconnect bus eib interconnect appear to position cell for future applications in the supercomputing space to exploit the cell processor s prowess in floating point kernels the cell architecture includes a memory coherence architecture that emphasizes power efficiency prioritizes bandwidth over low latency and favors peak computational throughput over simplicity of program code for these reasons cell is widely regarded as a challenging environment for software development ibm provides a linux based development

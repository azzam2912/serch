this division into distinct sections is largely due to the fact that a genus wide monograph was performed by robson in 1977 which allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the genus s taxonomy a phylogenetic study was more recently completed for the genus which gave evidence to suggest that the genus triadenum is a clade within hypericum and that the genus thornea is sister to hypericum in addition the study found that about 60 of the sections of hypericum are monophyletic almost all species of hypericum are either perennial herbs shrubs or small trees but the genus also contains a small amount of subshrubs and annual herbs most of its species contain hypericin or hyperforin and some are used for their healing properties in folk medicine the species leaves are always placed opposite and are normally decussate their flowers are generally homostylous but very few are dimorphically heterostylous the petals are normally golden yellow or orange but some are white or cream and are veined dorsally they have 4 5 stamen fascicles 2 5 ovaries and 2 5 styles some species grow capsular fruit which are colored red or blackish hypericum species can be found all over the world in

it is not a hearing test but rather a measure of energy transmission through the middle ear the test should not be used to assess the sensitivity of hearing and the results of this test should always be viewed in conjunction with pure tone audiometry tympanometry is a valuable component of the audiometric evaluation in evaluating hearing loss tympanometry permits a distinction between sensorineural and conductive hearing loss when evaluation is not apparent via weber and rinne testing furthermore in a primary care setting tympanometry can be helpful in making the diagnosis of otitis media by demonstrating the presence of fluid build up in the middle ear cavity a tone of 226 hz is generated by the tympanometer into the ear canal where the sound strikes the tympanic membrane causing vibration of the middle ear which in turn results in the conscious perception of hearing some of this sound is reflected back and picked up by the instrument most middle ear problems result in stiffening of the middle ear which causes more of the sound to be reflected back while 226 hz is the most common probe tone others can be used in infants under 4 months of age research

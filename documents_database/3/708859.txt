most were small gracile animals with an erect limb posture they are now thought to be ancestral to crocodyliforms a group which includes all living crocodilians the earliest known members of the group i e hesperosuchus are early norian in age found in the blue mesa member of the chinle formation only one sphenosuchian is currently known from the middle jurassic junggarsuchus from the junggar basin shishugou formation of china during either the bathonian or the callovian 165 ma in age the monophyly of the group is debated although several synapomorphies characterize the clade including extremely slender limbs a compact carpus and an elongate coracoid process in 2002 clark and sues found a possible sphenosuchian clade of dibothrosuchus sphenosuchus and possibly hesperosuchus and saltoposuchus with several other genera in unresolved positions kayentasuchus litargosuchus pseudhesperosuchus and terrestrisuchus more recently however clark et al 2004 argued for the paraphyly of the group contending that morphological characters were secondarily lost in more highly derived crocodylomorphs further analysis and study is required before the group s monophyly is resolved with certainty a perfect phylogenetic analysis is at present impossible due to a paucity of fossil remains demonstrating phylogenetically informative characters below is a cladogram

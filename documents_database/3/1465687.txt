finord is the category whose objects are all finite ordinal numbers and whose morphisms are all functions between them finset is a full subcategory of set the category whose objects are all sets and whose morphisms are all functions like set finset is a large category finord is a full subcategory of finset as by the standard definition suggested by john von neumann each ordinal is the well ordered set of all smaller ordinals unlike set and finset finord is a small category finord is a skeleton of finset therefore finset and finord are equivalent categories like set finset and finord are topoi as in set in finset the categorical product of two objects a and b is given by the cartesian product the categorical sum is given by the disjoint union and the exponential object b is given by the set of all functions with domain a and codomain b in finord the categorical product of two objects n and m is given by the ordinal product the categorical sum is given by the ordinal sum and the exponential object is given by the ordinal exponentiation n the subobject classifier in finset and finord is the same as in

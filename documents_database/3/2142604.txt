the conference topics typically include atomic and molecular clusters and their assemblies supported and free standing nanostructures and particles and other nanometer scale systems the first isspic conference was held in 1976 in lyon the idea to organize an international meeting of scientists who research the nanomolecular and atomic structures was given by pioneers in nanophysics such as jean farges jacques friedel walter knight ryogo kubo and bernhardt m hlschlegel friedel was also the chairman of the first conference the main theme of the first couple of isspic symposiums was fundamental studies on the finite size effects of atomic and molecular clusters the discussion emphasized the physical aspects at the beginning the conference was organized every fourth year but since 1988 it was held every two years the conference has become a fundamental event on the area of the nanoscience and the research of nanoclusters during the last decades scientists such as chemists physicists and nanotechnogists who do the research on the area of atomic or molecular clusters and structures nanoparticles and nanostructures introduce and discuss about the latest results and scientific achievements in the isspic conference the discussion also provides new approaches into these topics on 12 september 1990

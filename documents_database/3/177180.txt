this linear operator is given by convolution with the function formula 1 the improper integral being understood in the principal value sense the hilbert transform has a particularly simple representation in the frequency domain it imparts a phase shift of 90 to every fourier component of a function for example the hilbert transform of formula 3 where 0 is formula 4 the hilbert transform is important in signal processing where it derives the analytic representation of a real valued signal u t specifically the hilbert transform of u is its harmonic conjugate v a function of the real variable t such that the complex valued function admits an extension to the complex upper half plane satisfying the cauchy riemann equations the hilbert transform was first introduced by david hilbert in this setting to solve a special case of the riemann hilbert problem for analytic functions the hilbert transform of u can be thought of as the convolution of u t with the function h t 1 t known as the cauchy kernel because h t is not integrable the integral defining the convolution does not always converge instead the hilbert transform is defined using the cauchy principal value denoted here

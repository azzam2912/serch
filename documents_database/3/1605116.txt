nicaragua nicaragua is sovereign over the r o san juan and costa rica has the right to navigate over part of the river with articles for trade which in case of need as determined by nicaragua can be accompanied by revenue cutters the treaty also states that no taxes would be imposed on costa rican trade in goods except those accepted by mutual agreement historically the possibility that the r o san juan might become the route for a nicaragua canal has exacerbated the dispute the construction of the panama canal as well as nicaragua s dry ecocanal project have largely deflated this motive for friction a dispute emerged in 1998 when nicaragua forbade the transit of costa rican policemen in the river which nicaragua claims to be a breach of sovereignty and unilaterally imposed a tax for any costa rican tourists who enter the san juan river as persons are not objects of trade but subjects of trade and are therefore not covered by the treaty this and other subjects were the subjects of a case in the international court of justice on july 13 2009 the international court of justice published the following ruling on october 8 2010

squeezenet was developed by researchers at deepscale university of california berkeley and stanford university in designing squeezenet the authors goal was to create a smaller neural network with fewer parameters that can more easily fit into computer memory and can more easily be transmitted over a computer network squeezenet was originally released on february 22 2016 this original version of squeezenet was implemented on top of the caffe deep learning software framework shortly thereafter the open source research community ported squeezenet to a number of other deep learning frameworks on february 26 2016 eddie bell released a port of squeezenet for the chainer deep learning framework on march 2 2016 guo haria released a port of squeezenet for the apache mxnet framework on june 3 2016 tammy yang released a port of squeezenet for the keras framework in 2017 companies including baidu xilinx imagination technologies and synopsys demonstrated squeezenet running on low power processing platforms such as smartphones fpgas and custom processors as of 2018 squeezenet ships natively as part of the source code of a number of deep learning frameworks such as pytorch apache mxnet and apple coreml in addition 3rd party developers have created implementations of squeezenet that

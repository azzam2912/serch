coordinates also extend outside the simplex where one or more coordinates become negative the system was introduced in 1827 by august ferdinand m bius let formula 1 be the vertices of a simplex in an affine space a if for some point formula 2 in a and at least one of formula 4 does not vanish then we say that the coefficients formula 4 are barycentric coordinates of formula 2 with respect to formula 1 the vertices themselves have the coordinates formula 8 barycentric coordinates are not unique for any b not equal to zero formula 9 are also barycentric coordinates of p when the coordinates are not negative the point formula 2 lies in the convex hull of formula 1 that is in the simplex which has those points as its vertices barycentric coordinates as defined above are a form of homogeneous coordinates indeed the usual homogeneous coordinates are the barycentric coordinates defined in the extended affine n space on the simplex whose vertices are the points at infinity on the coordinate axes plus the origin sometimes values of coordinates are restricted with a condition which makes them unique then they are affine coordinates the classical terminology in this

the term is usually reserved to describe the single thermodynamic property which is a weighted average of the many separate parameters entering the original gr neisen s formulation in terms of the phonon nonlinearities because of the equivalences between many properties and derivatives within thermodynamics e g see maxwell relations there are many formulations of the gr neisen parameter which are equally valid leading to numerous distinct yet correct interpretations of its meaning some formulations for the gr neisen parameter include formula 1 where v is volume formula 2 and formula 3 are the principal i e per mass heat capacities at constant pressure and volume e is energy s is entropy is the volume thermal expansion coefficient formula 4 and formula 5 are the adiabatic and isothermal bulk moduli formula 6 is the speed of sound in the medium and is density the gr neisen parameter is dimensionless the expression for the gr neisen constant of a perfect crystal with pair interactions in formula 7 dimensional space has the form formula 8 where formula 9 is the interatomic potential formula 10 is the equilibrium distance formula 7 is the space dimensionality relations between the gr neisen constant and parameters

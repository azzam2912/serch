the main contributors to the polar effect are the inductive effect mesomeric effect and the through space electronic field effect an electron withdrawing group ewg draws electrons away from a reaction center when this center is an electron rich carbanion or an alkoxide anion the presence of the electron withdrawing substituent has a stabilizing effect examples of electron withdrawing groups are an electron releasing group erg or electron donating groups edgs releases electrons into a reaction center and as such stabilizes electron deficient carbocations an erg can essentially promote groups into having a higher effect these higher effects are defined as steric effects to a degree however other effects include observations to changes in polarity which can thus produce an entirely different molecule this entirely different molecule is the erg plus whatever substituent was left behind this is partially true but in truth the entirely different molecule is composed of parts and can be further differentiated and stabilized as separate molecules as well although this can prove difficult for the beginner different steric effects can produce different molecules as well and these essentially allow certain molecular formations to take themselves apart and if this is done then the erg can

dinosaurs did not nurture their offspring as mammals typically do and because dinosaurs did not nurse it is likely that most dinosaurs were capable of surviving on their own after hatching a discovery of features in a tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided more evidence that dinosaurs and birds evolved from a common ancestor and for the first time allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur when laying eggs female birds grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the marrow of their limbs this medullary bone which is rich in calcium is used to make eggshells the presence of endosteally derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the tyrannosaurus rex specimen s hind limb suggested that t rex used similar reproductive strategies and revealed the specimen to be female further research has found medullary bone in the theropod allosaurus and the ornithopod tenontosaurus because the line of dinosaurs that includes allosaurus and tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to tenontosaurus very early in the evolution of dinosaurs this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue medullary bone has been found in specimens of sub adult size which suggests that

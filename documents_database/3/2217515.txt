unlike many other aas 17 alkylated aas are orally active and do not require intramuscular injection however they uniquely possess a high potential for hepatotoxicity which simultaneously limits their use in addition some have a high risk of gynecomastia due to uniquely high estrogenic activity although this does not apply to 17 alkylated aas that are also 4 5 reduced or 19 demethylated i e that are also dihydrotestosterone dht or nandrolone derivatives respectively the prototypical example of a 17 alkylated aas is methyltestosterone 17 methyltestosterone extension of the c17 alkyl chain longer than an ethyl group abolishes androgenic activity and converts the drug into an antiandrogen as in topterone 17 propyltestosterone and allylestrenol 17 allyl 3 deketo 19 nortestosterone an extended chain variant of ethylestrenol conversely replacement of the c17 alkyl group with an ethynyl group greatly reduces but does not abolish androgenic activity as in ethisterone 17 ethynyltestosterone and norethisterone 17 ethynyl 19 nortestosterone similarly to extension of the c17 alkyl chain extension of the c17 ethynyl chain abolishes androgenic activity as with dimethisterone 6 21 dimethylethisterone dienogest which is antiandrogenic features extension of the c17 chain in the form of a cyanomethyl group at the c17 position

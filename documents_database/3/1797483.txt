hypothalamic disorders result from a deficiency in the release of gonadotropic releasing hormone gnrh while pituitary gland disorders are due to a deficiency in the release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary gnrh is the central regulator in reproductive function and sexual development via the hpg axis gnrh is released by hypothalamic neuroendocrine cells into the hypophyseal portal system acting on gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary the release of gonadotropins lh and fsh act on the gonads for the development and maintenance of proper adult reproductive physiology lh acts on leydig cells in the male testes and theca cells in the female fsh acts on sertoli cells in the male and follicular cells in the female combined this causes the secretion of gonadal sex steroids and the initiation of folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis the production of sex steroids forms a negative feedback loop acting on both the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus causing a pulsatile secretion of gnrh gnrh neurons lack sex steroid receptors and mediators such as kisspeptin stimulate gnrh neurons for pulsatile secretion of gnrh there are 2 subtypes of hh congenital hh chh and acquired hh ahh chh is due to genetic abnormalities resulting in non functional gnrh secreting

originally it illustrated the theme of friendship which was later extended to cover political relations as well a lion keeps watch on a field in which two three or four bulls are grazing knowing that they will group together to defend each other the lion sows enmity between them so that they separate and he is able to kill them one by one early versions of the fable are in greek beginning with babrius and there is a later latinised version by avianus in the 4th century ce the rhetorician themistius introduced a variant in which it is a fox that brings discord so that the lion can profit from it the moral given the story was generally to distrust a foe and hold fast to friends but in the syntipas version it was later given a political turn this fable shows that the same is true of cities and people when they are in agreement with one another they do not allow their enemies to defeat them but if they refuse to cooperate it is an easy matter for their enemies to destroy them a similar sentiment was taken up in the collection illustrated by the english artist francis

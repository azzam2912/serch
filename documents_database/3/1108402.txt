the protein is largely involved in the mtor pathway and the regulation of the cell cycle rheb is a recently discovered member of the ras superfamily being a relative of ras the overexpression of rheb can be seen in multiple human carcinomas for this reason ways to inhibit rheb to control the mtor pathway are studied as possible treatments for uncontrollable tumor cell growth in several diseases especially in tuberous sclerosis rheb is a 21 kda protein monomer composed of 184 amino acids the first 169 amino acids by the n terminus make up the gtpase domain and the remaining amino acids are part of a hypervariable region ending at the c terminus in a caax motif c cysteine a aliphatic amino acid x c terminus amino acid the protein is a lipid anchored cell membrane protein with five repeats of the ras related gtp binding region also present are switch regions i and ii which undergo conformational changes when shuttling between gtp bound activated and gdp bound inactive forms rheb is expressed by the rheb gene in humans three pseudogenes have been mapped two on chromosome 10 and one on chromosome 22 rheb is vital in regulation of growth

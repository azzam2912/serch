spatial filtering is commonly used to clean up the output of lasers removing aberrations in the beam due to imperfect dirty or damaged optics or due to variations in the laser gain medium itself this filtering can be applied to transmit a pure transverse mode from a multimode laser while blocking other modes emitted from the optical resonator the term filtering indicates that the desirable structural features of the original source pass through the filter while the undesirable features are blocked apparatus which follows the filter effectively sees a higher quality but lower powered image of the source instead of the actual source directly an example of the use of spatial filter can be seen in advanced setup of micro raman spectroscopy in spatial filtering a lens is used to focus the beam because of diffraction a beam that is not a perfect plane wave will not focus to a single spot but rather will produce a pattern of light and dark regions in the focal plane for example an imperfect beam might form a bright spot surrounded by a series of concentric rings as shown in the figure to the right it can be shown that this two dimensional

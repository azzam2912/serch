an article by goren inbar and volcanologist sergiu peltz 1995 states that it has been modified to represent a female human figure identifying it as a possible artifact made by homo erectus of the later acheulean in the early middle paleolithic the term venus follows the convention for labelling the unrelated venus figurines of the upper paleolithic that statement is contested the base object is an anthropomorphic red tuff pebble 35 mm 1 4 in long which has had at least three grooves possibly incised on it by a sharp edged stone one is a deep groove that encircles the narrower more rounded end of the pebble two shallower curved grooves run down the sides these grooves can be interpreted as marking the neck and arms of a figure they closely resemble marks made in similar material by sharp edged tools during exercises in experimental archaeology the assertion that the pebble has been incised to represent a human figure has been questioned in three ways it is disputed whether these can be clearly distinguished from naturally created lines in 1997 american researcher alexander marshack argued using microscopic analysis that the grooves around the neck and down the arms were human

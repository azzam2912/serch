if k is the smallest such exponent for x then x is called a primitive k th root of unity modulo n see modular arithmetic for notation and terminology do not confuse this with a primitive root modulo n which is a generator of the group of units of the ring of integers modulo n the primitive roots modulo n are the primitive formula 2 roots of unity modulo n where formula 3 is euler s totient function for the lack of a widely accepted symbol we denote the number of k th roots of unity modulo n by formula 8 it satisfies a number of properties for the lack of a widely accepted symbol we denote the number of primitive k th roots of unity modulo n by formula 34 it satisfies the following properties by fast exponentiation you can check that formula 56 if this is true x is a k th root of unity modulo n but not necessarily primitive if it is not a primitive root then there would be some divisor of k with formula 57 in order to exclude this possibility one has only to check for a few s equal k divided by

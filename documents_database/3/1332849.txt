its green fluorescence 516 nm switches to red 581 nm upon uv irradiation of 390 nm violet blue light due to a photo induced modification resulting from a break in the peptide backbone near the chromophore eos was first discovered as a tetrameric protein in the stony coral lobophyllia hemprichii like other fluorescent proteins eos allows for applications such as the tracking of fusion proteins multicolour labelling and tracking of cell movement several variants of eos have been engineered for use in specific study systems including meos2 meos4 and campari eosfp was first discovered in 2005 during a large scale screen for pafps photoactivatable fluorescent proteins within the stony coral lobophyllia hemprichii it has since been successfully cloned in escherichia coli and fusion constructs have been developed for use in human cells eos was named after the greek goddess of dawn unlike the tetrameric fluorescent proteins derived from anthozoan coral which can interfere with normal cellular function due to interactions between protein subunits eosfp has been broken up into dimeric and monomeric variants through the introduction of single point mutations these variants have been successful in the tracking of cellular components without disturbing function in the host cell and maintain

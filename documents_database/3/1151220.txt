in computer science a system that allows concurrent operation of multiple processes and locking of resources and which does not provide mechanisms to avoid or prevent deadlock must support a mechanism to detect deadlocks and an algorithm for recovering from them one such deadlock detection algorithm makes use of a wait for graph to track which other processes a process is currently blocking on in a wait for graph processes are represented as nodes and an edge from process formula 1 to formula 2 implies formula 2 is holding a resource that formula 1 needs and thus formula 1 is waiting for formula 2 to release its lock on that resource if the process is waiting for more than a single resource to become available the trivial case multiple edges may represent a conjunctive and or disjunctive or set of different resources or a certain number of equivalent resources from a collection the possibility of a deadlock is implied by graph cycles in the conjunctive case and by knots in the disjunctive case there is no simple algorithm for detecting the possibility of deadlock in the final case srinavasan rajaram 2011 the wait for graph scheme is not applicable to

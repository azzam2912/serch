it was developed by meteorologist wayne palmer who first published his method in the 1965 paper meteorological drought for the office of climatology of the u s weather bureau the palmer drought index is based on a supply and demand model of soil moisture supply is comparatively straightforward to calculate but demand is more complicated as it depends on many factors not just temperature and the amount of moisture in the soil but also hard to calibrate factors including evapotranspiration and recharge rates palmer tried to overcome these difficulties by developing an algorithm that approximated them based on the most readily available data precipitation and temperature the index has proven most effective in determining long term drought a matter of several months but it is not as good with conditions over a matter of weeks it uses a 0 as normal and drought is shown in terms of negative numbers for example negative 2 is moderate drought negative 3 is severe drought and negative 4 is extreme drought palmer s algorithm also is used to describe wet spells using corresponding positive numbers palmer also developed a formula for standardizing drought calculations for each individual location based on the variability of

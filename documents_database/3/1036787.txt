it is a locally common diurnal species found near fast flowing small streams and creeks in lowland rainforest many authors have suggested this taxon might be a synonym of atelopus flavescens it is threatened by habitat loss to attract females and to defend their territories males of a franciscus use advertisement calls not visual displays as typical for atelopus this is somewhat unexpected given their environment is noisy and males must acoustically compete with males of several other frog species e g allobates femoralis and otophryne pyburni moreover this species lacks an external vocal sac so can only produce low intensity calls that propagate short distances tympana and could be considered anatomically deaf nevertheless it has a well developed inner ear and has been shown to respond acoustically to the calls of conspecifics in the field male territories are closely spaced only 2 4 m apart on average and despite the handicaps discussed above acoustic communication appears sufficiently efficient at these short distances eggs are laid in the water the tadpoles adhere to rocks

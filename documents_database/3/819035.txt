in the context of ecological systems adaptive capacity is determined by in the context of couple socio ecological social systems adaptive capacity is commonly associated with following characteristics adaptive capacity confers resilience to perturbation giving ecological and human social systems the ability to reconfigure themselves with minimum loss of function adaptive capacity can be enhanced in a number of different ways a report by the overseas development institute introduces the local adaptive capacity framework lac featuring five core characteristics of adaptive capacity these include many development interventions such as social protection programmes and efforts to promote social safety nets can play important roles in promoting aspects of adaptive capacity adaptive capacity is associated with r and k selection strategies in ecology and with a movement from explosive positive feedback to sustainable negative feedback loops in social systems and technologies the resilience alliance as illustrated by the work of c s holling and l h gunderson shows how the logistic curve of the r phase positive feedback becoming replaced by the k negative feedback strategy is an important part of adaptive capacity the r strategy is associated with situations of low complexity high resilience and growing potential k strategies are associated

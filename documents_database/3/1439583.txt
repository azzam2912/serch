more recently the technique has been used to monitor the appearance of rna in living cells at the site of transcription or simply by observing the changes in rna number in the cytoplasm this has revealed that transcription of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes occurs in a discontinuous fashion with bursts of transcription separated by irregular intervals start with single stranded rna and create a pattern of stem loop structures by adding copies of the ms2 rna binding sequences to a noncoding region the ms2 protein must be fused with gfp and bonded to an mrna a complex that contains the ms2 s rna binding sequence copies the ms2 gfp fusion protein was expressed by transferring it to a cell with a plasmid robert singer s lab the signal encodes within rna and the signal presences of the nuclear localization signal nls within gfp ms2 are two signals that introduce from egfp ms2 rna complexes ms2 biotin tagged rna affinity purification ms2 biotrap is one in vivo method of identifying protein rna interactions both the rna that tagged with ms2 and the ms2 protein tag were expressed and then the affinity interaction was used to help the process of identifying

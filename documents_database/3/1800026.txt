farmer s account was that his band was touring in sweden not long after a local pianist had had a commercially successful recording of swedish folk songs a record company official comes to me and says how about you guys do an album of swedish folk songs i said we don t know any swedish folk songs he said okay i ll get the music the band flicked through the book of songs that the man bought for them and selected some to play at the recording session that had been arranged one of them farmer said was sw folk song and so we thought that meant swedish we re in the studio and we had never seen the music before the guy runs out and says hey stop stop i said what s the matter he says that s not swedish that s swiss the band abandoned that song and went on to record genuine swedish ones the allmusic review states the band s cool and restrained style suits the music perfectly turning it into jazz without losing its essence all compositions are traditional except as indicated

chandra is sensitive to x ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous x ray telescope enabled by the high angular resolution of its mirrors since the earth s atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of x rays they are not detectable from earth based telescopes therefore space based telescopes are required to make these observations chandra is an earth satellite in a 64 hour orbit and its mission is ongoing chandra is one of the great observatories along with the hubble space telescope compton gamma ray observatory 1991 2000 and the spitzer space telescope the telescope is named after the nobel prize winning indian american astrophysicist subrahmanyan chandrasekhar its mission is similar to that of esa s xmm newton spacecraft also launched in 1999 but the two telescopes have different design foci chandra has much higher angular resolution in 1976 the chandra x ray observatory called axaf at the time was proposed to nasa by riccardo giacconi and harvey tananbaum preliminary work began the following year at marshall space flight center msfc and the smithsonian astrophysical observatory sao in the meantime in 1978 nasa launched the first imaging x ray telescope einstein heao 2 into orbit work continued on the

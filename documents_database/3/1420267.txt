in eukaryotes transcription is a prerequisite for translation during transcription the pre mrna transcript is processes where a 5 cap is attached onto mrna and this 5 cap allows for ribosome assembly onto the mrna as it acts as a binding site for the eukaryotic initiation factor eif4f once eif4f is bound to the mrna this protein complex interacts with the poly a binding protein which is present within the 3 utr and results in mrna circularization this multiprotein mrna complex then recruits the ribosome subunits and scans the mrna until it reaches the start codon transcription of viral genomes differs from eukaryotes as viral genomes produce mrna transcripts that lack a 5 cap site despite lacking a cap site viral genes contain a structural element within the 5 utr known as an internal ribosome entry site ires ires is a structural element that recruits the 40s ribosome subunit to the mrna within close proximity of the start codon rcnmv contains a genome that encodes for two positive sense rna strands known as rna1 and rna2 and both these rna strands lack a 5 cap and a 3 poly a tail rna1 is required in replication as it encodes for

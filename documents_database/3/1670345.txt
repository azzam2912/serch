computational algorithms are then used to manipulate a single random variate x or often several such variates into a new random variate y such that these values have the required distribution historically basic methods of pseudo random number sampling were developed for monte carlo simulations in the manhattan project they were first published by john von neumann in the early 1950s for a discrete probability distribution with a finite number n of indices at which the probability mass function f takes non zero values the basic sampling algorithm is straightforward the interval 0 1 is divided in n intervals 0 f 1 f 1 f 1 f 2 the width of interval i equals the probability f i one draws a uniformly distributed pseudo random number x and searches for the index i of the corresponding interval the so determined i will have the distribution f i formalizing this idea becomes easier by using the cumulative distribution function it is convenient to set f 0 0 the n intervals are then simply f 0 f 1 f 1 f 2 f n 1 f n the main computational task is then to determine i for which f i 1 x

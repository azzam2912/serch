it was invented at bell telephone laboratories in 1936 by walter b ellwood in its simplest and most common form it consists of a pair of ferromagnetic flexible metal reeds contacts in a hermetically sealed glass envelope the contacts are usually normally open closing when a magnetic field is present or they may be normally closed and open when a magnetic field is applied the switch may be actuated by an electromagnetic coil making a reed relay or by bringing a permanent magnet near the switch when the magnetic field is removed the reeds in the reed switch return to their original position the reed is the metal part inside the reed switch envelope that is relatively thin and wide to make it flexible it somewhat resembles part of some reed plants the term reed may also include the external wire lead as well as the internal part an example of a reed switch application is to detect the opening of a door when used as a proximity switch for a security alarm the most common type of reed switch contains a pair of magnetizable flexible metal reeds whose end portions are separated by a small gap when the switch

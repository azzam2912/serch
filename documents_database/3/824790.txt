it was released in november 2006 as the second and final single from their third album revelations and also the final single of their career musically the song begins with a unique dreamy slightly flanged arpeggio that is unusual for tom morello after a repeat of the arpeggio the main riff of the song crashes in accompanied by drums and bass tom s solo once again invokes the toggle switch technique with one handed tapping in the left hand that creates a hectic array of notes which seem to bounce off each other before entering the closing bridge of the solo where morello s digitech whammy pedal is put into full force the video premiered in november 2006 it simply shows the band playing the song with no added dramatics the music video begins with various band members playing their instrument in front of a camera shoot when the vocals begin a split screen of chris cornell and other band members begins as each guitar riff or drum part kicks in the player of that instrument gets their few seconds in front of the camera during tom morello s guitar solo the camera largely goes between him and drummer brad

development was initially motivated by collaborative text editing and mobile computing crdts have also been used in online chat systems online gambling and in the soundcloud audio distribution platform the nosql distributed databases redis and riak have crdt data types concurrent updates to multiple replicas of the same data without coordination between the computers hosting the replicas can result in inconsistencies between the replicas which in the general case may not be resolvable restoring consistency and data integrity when there are conflicts between updates may require some or all of the updates to be entirely or partially dropped accordingly much of distributed computing focuses on the problem of how to prevent concurrent updates to replicated data but another possible approach is optimistic replication where all concurrent updates are allowed to go through with inconsistencies possibly created and the results are merged or resolved later in this approach consistency between the replicas is eventually re established via merges of differing replicas while optimistic replication might not work in the general case it turns out that there is a significant and practically useful class of data structures crdts where it does work where it is mathematically always possible to merge or resolve

the fraction remaining on the filter is called particulate organic carbon poc doc is abundant in marine and freshwater systems and is one of the greatest cycled reservoirs of organic matter on earth accounting for the same amount of carbon as the atmosphere and up to 20 of all organic carbon in general organic carbon compounds are the result of decomposition processes from dead organic matter including plants and animals doc can originate from within or external to the body of water doc originating from within the body of water is known as autochthonous doc and typically comes from aquatic plants or algae while doc originating external to the body of water is known as allochthonous doc and typically comes from soils or terrestrial plants when water originates from land areas with a high proportion of organic soils these components can drain into rivers and lakes as doc the dissolved fraction of total organic carbon toc is an operational classification many researchers use the term dissolved for compounds that pass through a 0 45 m filter but 0 22 m filters have also been used to remove higher colloidal concentrations a practical definition of dissolved typically used in marine chemistry

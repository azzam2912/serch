its most limited sense refers to a suite of mainly cambrian panarthropod taxa with flexible non segmented limbs for example aysheaia hallucigenia and xenusion a broader definition of lobopodia would also incorporate the extant phyla onychophora and tardigrada the broadest definition proposes the monophyletic superphylum lobopodia to encompass all three panarthropod phyla the oldest near complete fossil lobopodians date to the lower cambrian some are also known from ordovician silurian and carboniferous lagerst tten some bear toughened claws plates or spines which are commonly preserved as carbonaceous or mineralized microfossils in cambrian strata the better known genera include for example aysheaia which was discovered in the canadian burgess shale and looks something like the modern velvet worms and hallucigenia known from chengjiang and the burgess shale the latter taxon was originally reconstructed with long stilt like legs and mysterious fleshy dorsal protuberances and was long considered a prime example of the way in which nature experimented with the most diverse and bizarre body designs during the cambrian however further discoveries showed that this reconstruction had placed the animal upside down interpreting the stilts as dorsal spines made it clear that the fleshy dorsal protuberances were actually legs this second reconstruction

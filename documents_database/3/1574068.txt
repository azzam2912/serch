pst is used to assist in determining that the safety function will operate on demand pst is most often used on high integrity emergency shutdown valves esdvs in applications where closing the valve will have a high cost burden yet proving the integrity of the valve is essential to maintaining a safe facility in addition to esdvs pst is also used on high integrity pressure protection systems or hipps partial stroke testing is not a replacement for the need to fully stroke valves as proof testing is still a mandatory requirement partial stroke testing is an accepted petroleum industry standard technique and is also quantified in detail by regulatory bodies such as the international electrotechnical commission iec and the instrument society of automation isa the following are the standards appropriate to these bodies these standards define the requirements for safety related systems and describe how to quantify the performance of pst systems iec61508 adapts a safety life cycle approach to the management of plant safety during the design phase of this life cycle of a safety system the required safety performance level is determined using techniques such as markov analysis fmea fault tree analysis and hazop these techniques allow the

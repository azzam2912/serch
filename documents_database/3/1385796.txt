the suction inlet air speed may be up to its construction is somewhat like a vacuum truck gully emptier but with a wider suction hose and a more powerful suction the suction nozzle may have two handles for the operator to grasp those handles may enable a collar to be rotated thus uncovering suction release openings with grilles over to release the suction this will make the suction nozzle drop objects too big to enter the tube the end of the tube may be toothed this helps to cut earth when used for excavating when it is used to suck up loose debris and litter some types of debris may snag on the teeth the earth to be sucked out may be loosened first with a compressed air lance or a powerful water jet excavating with a suction excavator may called vacuum excavation or hydro excavation if a water jet is used vacuum excavation also known as suction excavation is considered a best practice for safely finding and seeing underground utilities reducing by more than half the chance of damaging buried utilities the rsp gmbh have been making suction excavators and stationary suction units since 1993 since 2000 rsp developed

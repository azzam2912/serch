its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 27 and an inclination of 12 with respect to the ecliptic the asteroid was already observed as at crimea simeis in 1930 this observation however remained unused and the body s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at johannesburg in 1935 according to the space based surveys carried out by the infrared astronomical satellite iras the japanese akari satellite and nasa s wide field infrared survey explorer with its subsequent neowise mission hertzsprung measures between 30 95 and 41 97 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0 03 and 0 059 the collaborative asteroid lightcurve link agrees with the results obtained by iras that is an albedo of 0 048 and a diameter of 38 7 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 10 97 while the dark c type asteroid is classified as a rare cbu subtype on the tholen taxonomic scheme the neowise mission groups the body to the rare and reddish p type asteroids in august 1987 a rotational lightcurve of hertzsprung was obtained from photometric observations made with the eso 1 metre telescope at la silla observatory in chile the lightcurve gave it a

the idea is the information being transferred throughout the generations is compositional information the different types and quantities of molecules within an assembly this is different from the information encoded in rna or dna which is the specific sequence of bases in such molecule thus the model is viewed as an alternative or an ancestor to the rna world hypothesis the composition vector of an assembly is written as formula 1 where formula 2 are the molecular counts of lipid type i within the assembly and ng is how many different lipid types exist repertiore size the change in the count of molecule type i is described by formula 4 and formula 5 are the basel forward joining and backward leaving rate constants is a non negative rate enhancement exerted by molecule type j within the assembly on type i from the environment and is the environmental concentration of each molecule type is viewed as a directed weighted complex network the assembly current size is formula 6 the system is kept away from equilibrium by imposing a fission action once the assembly reaches a maximal size nmax usually in the order of ng this splitting action produces two progeny of

there exists a neighborhood formula 6 of formula 5 saturated in formula 1 also called invariant in which all the leaves are compact with finite holonomy groups further we can define a retraction formula 9 such that for every leaf formula 10 formula 11 is a covering map with a finite number of sheets and for each formula 12 formula 13 is homeomorphic to a disk of dimension k and is transverse to formula 1 the neighborhood formula 6 can be taken to be arbitrarily small the last statement means in particular that in a neighborhood of the point corresponding to a compact leaf with finite holonomy the space of leaves is hausdorff under certain conditions the reeb local stability theorem may replace the poincar bendixson theorem in higher dimensions this is the case of codimension one singular foliations formula 16 with formula 17 and some center type singularity in formula 18 the reeb local stability theorem also has a version for a noncompact codimension 1 leaf an important problem in foliation theory is the study of the influence exerted by a compact leaf upon the global structure of a foliation for certain classes of foliations this influence is considerable

the arrangements are done by rodrigo romani of milladoiro brais maceiras and seivane this is her most traditional album till now with no rock elements and many traditional songs seivane sang two songs tracks 5 and 12 the first solo the second with sonia lebedynski sung in gallego the liner notes contain a photograph of her playing bagpipes in a procession in folk costume at the age of three from a technical point of view xota dos 28 puntos has the most complex playing technique the liner notes are in spanish and english music critic peggy latkovich wrote in her allmusic review her playing is confident with a fine rhythmic sweep the simple arrangements though a bit dry at times keep the spotlight on her performance since the nasal moan of galician pipes is an acquired taste for many this can be seen as a plus or a minus there s a good variety of tune types from traditional jotas dance tunes to newly composed waltzes and rumbas seivane shows a lot of promise it will be interesting to watch her develop as an artist

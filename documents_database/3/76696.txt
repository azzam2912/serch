both techniques introduce errors and distortions in the sound and these methods can be systematically compared musicians and listeners have argued over the superiority of digital versus analog sound recordings arguments for analog systems include the absence of fundamental error mechanisms which are present in digital audio systems including aliasing and quantization noise advocates of digital point to the high levels of performance possible with digital audio including excellent linearity in the audible band and low levels of noise and distortion two prominent differences in performance between the two methods are the bandwidth and the signal to noise ratio s n the bandwidth of the digital system is determined according to the nyquist frequency by the sample rate used the bandwidth of an analog system is dependent on the physical capabilities of the analog circuits the s n of a digital system may be limited by the bit depth of the digitization process but the electronic implementation of conversion circuits introduces additional noise in an analog system other natural analog noise sources exist such as flicker noise and imperfections in the recording medium other performance differences are specific to the systems under comparison such as the ability for more transparent

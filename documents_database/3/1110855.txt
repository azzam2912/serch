it is developed by code synthesis and dual licensed under the gnu gpl and a proprietary license given an xml instance specification xml schema xsd e can produce three kinds of c mappings embedded c parser for event driven xml parsing embedded c serializer for event driven xml serialization and embedded c hybrid which provides a light weight in memory object model on top of the other two mappings the c hybrid mapping generates c classes for types defined in xml schema as well as parsing and serialization code the c classes represent the data stored in xml as a statically typed tree like object model and support fully in memory as well as partially in memory partially event driven xml processing the c parser mapping generates validating c parser skeletons for data types defined in xml schema one can then implement these parser skeletons to build a custom in memory representation or perform immediate processing as parts of the xml documents become available similarly the embedded c serializer mapping generates validating c serializer skeletons for types defined in xml schema which can be used to serialize application data to xml codesynthesis xsd e itself is written in c and

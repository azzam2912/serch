it is also used to determine compactibility of sands by using special specimen tubes and a linear scale sand rammer consists of calibrated sliding weight actuated by cam a shallow cup to accommodate specimen tube below ram head a specimen stripper to strip compacted specimen out of specimen tube a specimen tube to prepare the standard specimen of 50 mm diameter by 50 mm height or 2 inch diameter by 2 inch height for an afs standard specimen the cam is actuated by a user by rotating the handle causing a cam to lift the weight and let it fall freely on the frame attached to the ram head this produces a standard compacting action to a pre measured amount of sand variety of standard specimen for green sand and silicate based co sand are prepared using a sand rammer along with accessories the object for producing the standard cylindrical specimen is to have the specimen become 2 inches high plus or minus 1 32 inch with three rams of the machine after the specimen has been prepared inside the specimen tube the specimen can be used for various standard sand tests such as the permeability test the green sand

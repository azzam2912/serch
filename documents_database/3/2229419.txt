these methods of reconstructing three dimensional sound are used to recreate sounds to match natural environments and provide spatial cues of the sound source they also see applications in creating 3d visualizations on a sound field to include physical aspects of sound waves including direction pressure and intensity this technology is used in entertainment to reproduce a live performance through computer speakers the technology is also used in military applications to determine location of sound sources reconstructing sound fields is also applicable to medical imaging to measure points in ultrasound to reproduce robust and natural sounding audio from a three dimensional audio recording sound localization and reverberation reconstruction techniques are used these techniques process sound to reproduce the spatial cues as a result of this two step process the reconstructed three dimensional sound field contains information not only on the localization of the sound source but also on the physical aspects of the environment of the original signal source this is its difference from the results of the sound localization process after the sound is reconstructed and the spatial cues are available they need to be delivered to the customer the different methods to do this are included in this

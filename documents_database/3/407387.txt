for an entire system to be at steady state i e for all state variables of a system to be constant there must be a flow through the system compare mass balance a simple example of such a system is the case of a bathtub with the tap running but with the drain unplugged after a certain time the water flows in and out at the same rate so the water level the state variable volume stabilizes and the system is in a steady state the steady state concept is different from chemical equilibrium although both may create a situation where a concentration does not change in a system at chemical equilibrium the net reaction rate is zero products transform into reactants at the same rate as reactants transform into products while no such limitation exists in the steady state concept indeed there does not have to be a reaction at all for a steady state to develop the term steady state is also used to describe a situation where some but not all of the state variables of a system are constant for such a steady state to develop the system does not have to be a flow system

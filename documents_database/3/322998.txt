the term is generally meaningful only for fields that at each point vary sinusoidally in time with a single temporal frequency otherwise the phase is not well defined wavefronts usually move with time for waves propagating in a unidimensional medium the wavefronts are usually single points they are curves in a two dimensional medium and surfaces in a three dimensional one for a sinusoidal plane wave the wavefronts are planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation that move in that direction together with the wave for a sinusoidal spherical wave the wavefronts are spherical surfaces that expand with it if the speed of propagation is different at different points of a wavefront the shape and or orientation of the waverfronts may change by refraction in particular lenses can change the shape of optical wavefronts from planar to spherical or vice versa optical systems can be described with maxwell s equations and linear propagating waves such as sound or electron beams have similar wave equations however given the above simplifications huygens principle provides a quick method to predict the propagation of a wavefront through for example free space the construction is as follows let every point on the wavefront be considered

pnns are found around certain neuron cell bodies and proximal neurites in the central nervous system pnns play a critical role in the closure of the childhood critical period and their digestion can cause restored critical period like synaptic plasticity in the adult brain they are largely negatively charged and composed of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans molecules that play a key role in development and plasticity during postnatal development and in the adult pnns appear to be mainly present in the cortex hippocampus thalamus brainstem and the spinal cord studies of the rat brain have shown that the cortex contains high numbers of pnns in the motor and primary sensory areas and relatively fewer in the association and limbic cortices in the cortex pnns are associated mostly with inhibitory interneurons and are thought to be responsible for maintaining the excitatory inhibitory balance in the adult brain the existence of pnns has been inferred by golgi lugaro donaggio martinotti ram n y cajal and meyer however ram n y cajal credits golgi with the discovery of pnns because he was the first to draw attention to them and gave the first precise description in 1893 moreover golgi brought interest to the subject

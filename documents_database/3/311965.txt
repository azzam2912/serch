in dimension this formation is larger than several of the lunar mare areas on the near side it lies in the northwestern fringe of the blast radius of the mare orientale impact basin nearby craters of note include michelson across the northeast rim vavilov across the western rim and lucretius to the southeast the outer rim of hertzsprung has been damaged and modified by several notable impacts mentioned above and a number of smaller craters a chain of small craters designated catena lucretius begins at the southeastern outer rim and proceeds toward the west northwest until it connects with the perimeter of the inner basin this inner area is less rough than the outer ring of the floor and is surrounded by a circular range of ridges the inner perimeter is also pierced by several craters including hertzsprung d along the eastern portion and hertzsprung s on the western side nor is the interior of the inner basin free from impacts including k h x and l listed in the table below at the center of the basin is a mass concentration mascon or gravitational high the mascon was first identified by doppler tracking of the lunar prospector spacecraft the

the hypersonic regime is often alternatively defined as speeds where cp and cv are no longer able to be reasonably considered constant while the definition of hypersonic flow can be quite vague and is generally debatable especially due to the absence of discontinuity between supersonic and hypersonic flows a hypersonic flow may be characterized by certain physical phenomena that can no longer be analytically discounted as in supersonic flow the peculiarity in hypersonic flows are as follows as a body s mach number increases the density behind a bow shock generated by the body also increases which corresponds to a decrease in volume behind the shock due to conservation of mass consequently the distance between the bow shock and the body decreases at higher mach numbers as mach numbers increase the entropy change across the shock also increases which results in a strong entropy gradient and highly vortical flow that mixes with the boundary layer a portion of the large kinetic energy associated with flow at high mach numbers transforms into internal energy in the fluid due to viscous effects the increase in internal energy is realized as an increase in temperature since the pressure gradient normal to the flow

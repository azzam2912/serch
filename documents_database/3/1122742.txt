the equilibrium temperature is also independent of the quantities of the phases used as long as sufficient amounts of each are present to reach equilibrium without consuming one or more liquid water and ice for example form a frigorific mixture at 0 c or 32 f this mixture was once used to define 0 c that temperature is now defined as the triple point of water with well defined isotope ratios a mixture of ammonium chloride water and ice form a frigorific mixture at about 17 8 c or 0 f this mixture was once used to define 0 f the existence of frigorific mixtures can be viewed as a consequence of the gibbs phase rule which describes the relationship at equilibrium between the number of components the number of coexisting phases and the number of degrees of freedom permitted by the conditions of heterogeneous equilibrium specifically at constant atmospheric pressure in a system containing linearly independent chemical components if 1 phases are specified to be present in equilibrium then the system is fully determined there are no degrees of freedom that is the temperature and the compositions of all phases are determined thus in for example the chemical system

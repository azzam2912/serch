in contrast translation of hepatitis c virus hcv mrna is initiated by a different mechanism from the usual 5 cap binding model this alternate mechanism relies on the direct binding of the 40s ribosomal subunit by the internal ribosome entry site ires in the 5 utr of hcv rna the hcv ires adopts a complex structure and may differ significantly from ires elements identified in picornaviruses a small number of eukaryotic mrna have been shown to be translated by internal ribosome entry nucleotides 1 40 of the hcv mrna are thought not to contribute to translation and are rather required for genomic rna replication the remainder of the hcv 5 utr consists of three domains namely domains ii iv domain i is located on the 5 end of the mrna hcv ires independently binds two components of eukaryotic translation initiation machinery the multiprotein initiation factor eif3 and 40s small ribosomal subunit moreover it binds 40s in such a manner that aug initiator codon is positioned in the ribosomal p site thus no ribosomal scanning is required consequently scanning factors eif1 and eif1a are dispensable for the hcv translation as are components of the eif4f complex eif4a eif4e and eif4g and

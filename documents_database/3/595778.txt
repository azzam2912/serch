the distinguishing feature of a push pull converter is that the transformer primary is supplied with current from the input line by pairs of transistors in a symmetrical push pull circuit the transistors are alternately switched on and off periodically reversing the current in the transformer therefore current is drawn from the line during both halves of the switching cycle this contrasts with buck boost converters in which the input current is supplied by a single transistor which is switched on and off so current is only drawn from the line during half the switching cycle during the other half the output power is supplied by energy stored in inductors or capacitors in the power supply push pull converters have steadier input current create less noise on the input line and are more efficient in higher power applications conceptual schematic of a full bridge converter this is not a center tapped or split primary push pull converter the term push pull is sometimes used to generally refer to any converter with bidirectional excitation of the transformer for example in a full bridge converter the switches connected as an h bridge alternate the voltage across the supply side of the transformer

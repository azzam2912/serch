when x is not a null vector the multiplicative inverse of x is formula 4 when there is a non zero null vector n is an isotropic quadratic form and the algebra splits every unital composition algebra over a field can be obtained by repeated application of the cayley dickson construction starting from if the characteristic of is different from or a 2 dimensional composition subalgebra if the possible dimensions of a composition algebra are and for consistent terminology algebras of dimension 1 have been called unarion and those of dimension 2 binarion when the field is taken to be complex numbers and the quadratic form then four composition algebras over are the bicomplex numbers the biquaternions isomorphic to the complex matrix ring and the bioctonions which are also called complex octonions matrix ring has long been an object of interest first as biquaternions by hamilton 1853 later in the isomorphic matrix form and especially as pauli algebra the squaring function on the real number field forms the primordial composition algebra when the field is taken to be real numbers then there are just six other real composition algebras in two four and eight dimensions there are both a division

linear organic molecules such as acetylene hc ch are often described by invoking sp orbital hybridization for their carbon centers according to the vsepr model linear geometry occurs at central atoms with two bonded atoms and zero or three lone pairs ax or axe in the axe notation neutral ax molecules with linear geometry include beryllium fluoride f be f with two single bonds carbon dioxide o c o with two double bonds hydrogen cyanide h c n with one single and one triple bond the most important linear molecule with more than three atoms is acetylene h c c h in which each of its carbon atoms is considered to be a central atom with a single bond to one hydrogen and a triple bond to the other carbon atom linear anions include azide and thiocyanate scn and a linear cation is the nitronium ion linear geometry also occurs in axe molecules such as xenon difluoride xef and the triiodide ion with one iodide bonded to the two others as described by the vsepr model the five valence electron pairs on the central atom form a trigonal bipyramid in which the three lone pairs occupy the less crowded equatorial

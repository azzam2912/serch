a site of origin from a more proximal or distal portion of the right hepatic artery is also considered relatively normal after separating from the right hepatic artery the cystic artery travels superiorly to the cystic duct and produces 2 to 4 minor branches known as calot s arteries that supply part of the cystic duct and cervix of the gallbladder before dividing into the major superficial and deep branches at the superior aspect of the gallbladder neck when superficial and deep branches of the cystic artery do not share a common origin it is defined as a double cystic artery occurring with a frequency of 15 the deep branch consistently arises from the right hepatic artery which is generally also the source of origin of the superficial branch however in some cases it has been found to initiate from the anterior segmental artery middle hepatic artery left hepatic artery superior mesenteric artery gastroduodenal artery or retroduodenal artery approximately half of superficial cystic arteries have been shown to enter through the hepatobiliary triangle while deep cystic arteries are often quite small in length and diameter tripling of the cystic artery is very rare occurring in between 0 0 3 of

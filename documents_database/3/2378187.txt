it is similar in morphology and pigments to aureococcus anophagefferens and pelagococcus subviridis the cell shape is spherical to subspherical and is 2 5 to 5 0 m in diameter it is golden coloured and is encapsulated with extracellular polysaccharide layers and has a single chloroplast structure with pigments a lagunensis thrives in a warm hypersaline environment as the greatest cell density has been found in water with salinity higher than 40 psu and with temperatures between generally the density of a lagunensis is in the order of 10 cells ml being higher in the summer months with lower abundance during the winter a lagunensis causes harmful algal blooms and was the dominant microalga in the 7 year long brown tide 1990 1997 that happened in laguna madre texas its dominance over other coexisting phytoplankton is in part associated with its encapsulating mucus layer of exopolymer secretions eps and its ability to revert from vegetative and resting cell forms the a lagunensis blooms cause a substantial increase in light attenuation which in turn contributes to marine biodiversity loss particularly phytoplankton communities and benthic invertebrates a lagunensis thrives in low light conditions where it can maintain high growth rates at 150

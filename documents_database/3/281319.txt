an example of a chemical opacifier is titanium dioxide tio which is used as an opacifier in paints in paper and in plastics it has very high refraction index rutile modification 2 7 and anatase modification 2 55 and optimum refraction is obtained with crystals about 225 nanometers impurities in the crystal alter the optical properties it is also used to opacify ceramic glazes and milk glass bone ash is also used opacifiers must have a refractive index ri substantially different from the system conversely clarity may be achieved in a system by choosing components with very similar refractive indices ancient milk glasses used crystals of calcium antimonate formed in the melt from calcium present in the glass and an antimony additive opaque yellow glasses contained crystals of lead antimonate bindheimite mineral may have been used as the additive under oxidizing condition lead also forms incompletely dissolved lead pyroantimonate pbsbo from 2nd century bc tin oxide appears in use as opacifier likely in the form of cassiterite mineral opaque yellow can be produced as lead stannate the color is paler than the lead antimonate one later calcium and sodium phosphates became used bone ash contains calcium phosphate in a high

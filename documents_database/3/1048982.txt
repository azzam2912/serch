it is the convex hull of a skeletal frame made by placing two linked congruent circles in perpendicular planes so that the center of each circle lies on the edge of the other circle the distance between the circle centers equals the radius of the circles one third of each circle s perimeter lies inside the convex hull so the same shape may be also formed as the convex hull of the two remaining circular arcs each spanning an angle of 4 3 the surface area of an oloid is given by exactly the same as the surface area of a sphere with the same radius in closed form the enclosed volume is where formula 3 and formula 4 denote the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind respectively a numerical calculation gives the surface of the oloid is a developable surface meaning that patches of the surface can be flattened into a plane while rolling it develops its entire surface every point of the surface of the oloid touches the plane on which it is rolling at some point during the rolling movement unlike most axial symmetric objects cylinder sphere etc while rolling on a flat surface

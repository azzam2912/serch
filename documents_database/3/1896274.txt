they have application in the cobordism ring in algebraic topology let k be polynomials over a ring a in indeterminates p weighted so that p has weight i with p 1 and all the terms in k have weight n so that k is a polynomial in p p the sequence k is multiplicative if an identity implies in other words formula 3 is required to be an endomomorphism of the multiplicative monoid formula 4 the power series is the characteristic power series of the k a multiplicative sequence is determined by its characteristic power series q z and every power series with constant term 1 gives rise to a multiplicative sequence to recover a multiplicative sequence from a characteristic power series q z we consider the coefficient of z in the product for any m j this is symmetric in the and homogeneous of weight j so can be expressed as a polynomial k p p in the elementary symmetric functions p of the then k defines a multiplicative sequence as an example the sequence k p is multiplicative and has characteristic power series 1 z consider the power series where b is the k th bernoulli number the

each cell incorporates structural material and a reversible interlock allowing lattices of arbitrary size and shape rccm display three dimensional symmetry derived from the geometry as linked the discrete construction of reversibly assembled cellular composites introduces a new degree of freedom that determines global functional properties from the local placement of heterogeneous components because the individual parts are literally finite elements a hierarchical decomposition describes the part types and their combination in a structure rccm can be viewed as a digital material in which discrete parts link with a discrete set of relative positions and orientations an assembler can place them using only local information placement errors can be detected and corrected by assembly reversal these materials combine the size and strength of composites with the low density of cellular materials and the convenience of additive manufacturing rccm were introduced in 2013 by researchers at the mit center for bits and atoms rccm lattices behave as an elastic solid in both tension and compression they offer both a linear regime and a nonlinear super elastic deformation mode a modulus an order of magnitude breater than for an ultralight material 12 3 megapascals at a density of 7 2 mg per

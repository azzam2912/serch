he worked for over 40 years in theoretical analysis and design techniques applied to the solution of electromagnetic problems covering many different antenna types for radar electronic warfare and communication systems he coauthored the original paper on the application of cladded glass fibre as a transmission medium born in epsom surrey hockham received a bsc eng degree from the regent street polytechnic in 1961 and a phd in 1969 from the queen mary university of london he worked for over 40 years in theoretical analysis and design techniques applied to the solution of electromagnetic problems covering many different antenna types for radar electronic warfare and communication systems hockham also contributed significantly to the development of optical fibres for long distance communications systems he proposed and published together with a colleague professor k c kao in 1966 the original paper on the application of the cladded glass fibre as the transmission medium dielectric fibre surface waveguides for optical frequencies for which he received the rank prize in opto electronics in 1978 he is the holder of 16 scientific technical patents and authored and co authored 26 papers published in professional journals he was previously technical director of thorn emi electronics sensors

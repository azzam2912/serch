when f is given by a rational representation of an algebraic torus the definition of g is as the zariski closure of the image in the representation of the circle group over the rational numbers introduced mumford tate groups over the complex numbers under the name of hodge groups introduced the p adic analogue of mumford s construction for hodge tate modules using the work of on p divisible groups and named them mumford tate groups the algebraic torus t used to describe hodge structures has a concrete matrix representation as the 2 2 invertible matrices of the shape that is given by the action of a bi on the basis 1 i of the complex numbers c over r the circle group inside this group of matrices is the unitary group u 1 hodge structures arising in geometry for example on the cohomology groups of k hler manifolds have a lattice consisting of the integral cohomology classes not quite so much is needed for the definition of the mumford tate group but it does assume that the vector space v underlying the hodge structure has a given rational structure i e is given over the rational numbers q for

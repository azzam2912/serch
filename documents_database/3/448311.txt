the expression is most easily illustrated by a cladogram the sister group to a is b conversely the sister group to b is a groups a and b together with all other descendants of their most recent common ancestor form the clade ab the sister group to clade ab is c the whole clade abc is itself a subtree of a larger tree which offers yet more sister group branches that are related but farther removed from the leaf nodes such as a b and c in cladistic standards a b and c may represent specimens species taxon groups etc if they represent species the term sister species is sometimes used the term sister group is used in phylogenetic analysis and only groups identified in the analysis are labeled as sister groups an example is in birds whose sister group is commonly cited as the crocodiles but that is true only when dealing with extant taxa the bird family tree is rooted in the dinosaurs and there were a number of extinct groups branching off of dinosaurs before coming to the last common ancestor of birds and crocodiles thus the term sister group must be seen as a relative term

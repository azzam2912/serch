the project was announced on international supercomputing conference in june 2010 the first list was published at the acm ieee supercomputing conference in november 2010 new versions of the list are published twice a year the main performance metric used to rank the supercomputers is gteps giga traversed edges per second richard murphy from sandia says that the graph500 s goal is to promote awareness of complex data problems instead of focusing on computer benchmarks like hpl high performance linpack which top500 is based on despite its name there were several hundreds of systems in the rating growing up to 174 in june 2014 the algorithm and implementation that won the championship is published in the paper titled extreme scale breadth first search on supercomputers there is also list green graph 500 which uses same performance metric but sorts list according to performance per watt like green 500 works with top500 hpl the benchmark used in graph500 stresses the communication subsystem of the system instead of counting double precision floating point it is based on a breadth first search in a large undirected graph a model of kronecker graph with average degree of 16 there are two computation kernels in

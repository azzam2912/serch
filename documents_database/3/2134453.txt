acidic is a protein that in humans is encoded by the cnn3 gene the cnn3 gene is located at 1p22 p21 in the human chromosomal genome cnn3 gene contains 7 exons and encodes calponin 3 a 36 4 kda protein consisting of 329 amino acids with isoelectric point pi of 5 84 calponin 3 is known as acidic calponin among three isoforms of calponin less is known for the gene regulation and function of calponin 3 nonetheless much has been learned from extensive studies on the homologous genes cnn1 and cnn2 that encode calponin 1 and calponin 2 cnn3 is one of the three homologous calponin isoform genes calponin 3 is significantly diverged from calponin 1 and calponin 2 in the c terminal variable region the higher degree of divergence among vertebrate cnn3 genes than that in the cnn1 and cnn2 gene families suggests possibly earlier emergence of cnn3 indicating that calponin 3 may represent a prototype of calponin ancestral of the three present day isoforms fig 1 the primary structure of calponin 3 is similar as that of calponin 1 and calponin 2 consisting of a conserved n terminal calponin homology ch domain a conserved middle region containing two

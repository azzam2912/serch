the members of this family p16 p15 p18 p19 are inhibitors of cdk4 hence their name inhibitors of cdk4 and of cdk6 the other family of ckis cip kip proteins are capable of inhibiting all cdks enforced expression of ink4 proteins can lead to g1 arrest by promoting redistribution of cip kip proteins and blocking cyclin e cdk2 activity in cycling cells there is a resassortment of cip kip proteins between cdk4 5 and cdk2 as cells progress through g1 their function inhibiting cdk4 6 is to block progression of the cell cycle beyond the g restriction point in addition ink4 proteins play roles in cellular senescence apoptosis and dna repair ink4 proteins are tumor suppressors and loss of function mutations lead to carcinogenesis ink4 proteins are highly similar in terms of structure and function with up to 85 amino acid similarity they contain multiple ankyrin repeats the ink4a arf ink4b locus encodes three genes p15ink4b arf and p16ink4a in a 35 kilobase stretch of the human genome p15ink4b has a different reading frame that is physically separated from p16ink4a and arf p16ink4a and arf have different first exons that are spliced to the same second and third exon while

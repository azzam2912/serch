it involved a global eustatic rise in sea level it was named for the ka k member of the srbsko formation in bohemia where it is represented by a black shale interval within a sequence of limestone in marine environments this appears as an anoxic event often forming potential hydrocarbon source rocks such as the marcellus shale within the old red sandstone continent it is represented by the achanarras lake the deepest and most widespread lake that developed within the orcadian basin the event is associated with significant extinctions particularly amongst the ammonoidea the event occurred towards the end of the eifelian extending into the earliest part of the givetian in the mid devonian period the duration of the event has been estimated as 700 000 years from the seven cycles involved in the achanarras interval each cycle interpreted to represent 100 000 years but only 200 000 years using geochemical and magnetic resonance data from the eifelian givetian boundary in morocco the ka k interval was first named from its occurrence in bohemia as a black shale unit known as the ka k member this organic rich shale is found within a sequence of shallow water limestones forming the

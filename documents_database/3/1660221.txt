technically oil well control involves preventing the formation fluid usually referred to as kick from entering into the wellbore during drilling formation fluid can enter the wellbore if the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation being drilled oil well control also includes monitoring a well for signs of impending influx of formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling and procedures to stop the well from flowing when it happens by taking proper remedial actions failure to manage and control these pressure effects can cause serious equipment damage and injury or loss of life improperly managed well control situations can cause blowouts which are uncontrolled and explosive expulsions of formation fluid from the well potentially resulting in a fire oil well control is one of the most important aspects of drilling operations improper handling of kicks in oil well control can result in blowouts with very grave consequences including the loss of valuable resources and also lives of field personnel even though the cost of a blowout as a result of improper no oil well control can easily reach several millions of us dollars

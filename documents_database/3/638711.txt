customer 1 sits at the first table the next customer either sits at the same table as customer 1 or the next table this continues with each customer choosing to either sit at an occupied table with a probability proportional to the number of customers already there i e they are more likely to sit at a table with many customers than few or an unoccupied table at time n the n customers have been partitioned among m n tables or blocks of the partition the results of this process are exchangeable meaning the order in which the customers sit does not affect the probability of the final distribution this property greatly simplifies a number of problems in population genetics linguistic analysis and image recognition david j aldous attributes the restaurant analogy to jim pitman and lester dubins in his 1983 book at any positive integer time n the value of the process is a partition b of the set 1 2 3 n whose probability distribution is determined as follows at time n 1 the trivial partition 1 is obtained with probability 1 at time n 1 the element n 1 is either the random partition so generated has

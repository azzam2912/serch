in other words is hamiltonian if and only if where denotes the transpose suppose that the by matrix is written as the block matrix where and are by matrices then the condition that be hamiltonian is equivalent to requiring that the matrices and are symmetric and that another equivalent condition is that is of the form with symmetric it follows easily from the definition that the transpose of a hamiltonian matrix is hamiltonian furthermore the sum and any linear combination of two hamiltonian matrices is again hamiltonian as is their commutator it follows that the space of all hamiltonian matrices is a lie algebra denoted the dimension of is the corresponding lie group is the symplectic group this group consists of the symplectic matrices those matrices which satisfy thus the matrix exponential of a hamiltonian matrix is symplectic however the logarithm of a symplectic matrix is not necessarily hamiltonian because the exponential map from the lie algebra to the group is not surjective the characteristic polynomial of a real hamiltonian matrix is even thus if a hamiltonian matrix has as an eigenvalue then and are also eigenvalues it follows that the trace of a hamiltonian matrix is zero the square

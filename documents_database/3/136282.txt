this integral transform is closely connected to the theory of dirichlet series and is often used in number theory mathematical statistics and the theory of asymptotic expansions it is closely related to the laplace transform and the fourier transform and the theory of the gamma function and allied special functions the mellin transform of a function f is the inverse transform is the notation implies this is a line integral taken over a vertical line in the complex plane conditions under which this inversion is valid are given in the mellin inversion theorem the transform is named after the finnish mathematician hjalmar mellin the two sided laplace transform may be defined in terms of the mellin transform by and conversely we can get the mellin transform from the two sided laplace transform by the mellin transform may be thought of as integrating using a kernel x with respect to the multiplicative haar measure formula 5 which is invariant under dilation formula 6 so that formula 7 the two sided laplace transform integrates with respect to the additive haar measure formula 8 which is translation invariant so that formula 9 we also may define the fourier transform in terms of the

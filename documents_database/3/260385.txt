brucine poisoning is rare since it is usually ingested with strychnine and strychnine is more toxic than brucine in synthetic chemistry it can be used as a tool for stereospecific chemical syntheses brucine was discovered in 1819 by pelletier and caventou in the bark of the strychnos nux vomica tree while its structure was not deduced until much later it was determined that it was closely related to strychnine in 1884 when the chemist hanssen converted both strychnine and brucine into the same molecule the probable fatal dose of brucine in adults is 1 g in other animals the ld varies considerably brucine s mechanism of action closely resembles that of strychnine it acts as an antagonist at glycine receptors and paralyzes inhibitory neurons glycine binds to receptors on inhibitory neurons to terminate action potentials its binding terminates an action potential by causing an influx of chloride ions into the neuron repolarizing the neuron to its resting potential brucine also binds to these receptors but its binding does not trigger an influx of chloride ions brucine s toxicity arises because glycine is blocked from binding to its receptors making inhibition of an action potential more difficult historically brucine was distinguished

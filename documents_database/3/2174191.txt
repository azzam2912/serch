in order to model the stress strain relation in these fluids some fitting have been proposed such as the linear bingham equation and the non linear herschel bulkley and casson models analytical solutions exist for such models in simple flows for general flow fields it is necessary to develop numerical techniques to track down yielded unyielded regions this can be avoided by introducing into the models a continuation parameter which facilitates the solution process and produces virtually the same results as the ideal models by the right choice of its value viscoplastic materials like slurries pastes and suspension materials have a yield stress i e a critical value of stress below which they do not flow are also called bingham plastics after bingham viscoplastic materials can be well approximated uniformly at all levels of stress as liquids that exhibit infinitely high viscosity in the limit of low shear rates followed by a continuous transition to a viscous liquid this approximation could be made more and more accurate at even vanishingly small shear rates by means of a material parameter that controls the exponential growth of stress thus a new impetus was given in 1987 with the publication by papanastasiou of

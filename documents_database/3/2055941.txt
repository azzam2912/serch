on 27 january 2015 the kepler spacecraft is reported to have confirmed the detection of five sub earth sized rocky exoplanets orbiting the main star according to nasa no life as we know it could exist on these hot exoplanets due to their close orbital distances to the host star preliminary results of the planetary system around kepler 444 were first announced at the second kepler science conference in 2013 at that conference the star was known as koi 3158 the star kepler 444 is approximately 11 2 billion years old whereas the sun is only 4 6 billion years old the age of kepler 444 an orange main sequence star of spectral type k0 is more than 80 of the age of the universe the original research on kepler 444 was published in the astrophysical journal on 27 january 2015 under the title an ancient extrasolar system with five sub earth size planets by a team of 40 authors the abstract reads as follows the chemical composition of stars hosting small exoplanets with radii less than four earth radii appears to be more diverse than that of gas giant hosts which tend to be metal rich this implies that

it appears as a striking overdensity in the distribution of galaxies in the constellation of centaurus it is 650 million light years away z 0 046 in 1930 harlow shapley and his colleagues at the harvard college observatory started a survey of galaxies in the southern sky using photographic plates obtained at the 24 inch bruce telescope at bloemfontein south africa by 1932 shapley reported the discovery of 76 000 galaxies brighter than 18th apparent magnitude in a third of the southern sky based on galaxy counts from his plates some of this data was later published as part of the harvard galaxy counts intended to map galactic obscuration and to find the space density of galaxies in this catalog shapley could see most of the coma virgo cloud now known to be a superposition of the coma supercluster and the virgo supercluster but found a cloud in the constellation of centaurus to be the most striking concentration of galaxies he found it particularly interesting because of its great linear dimension the numerous population and distinctly elongated form this can be identified with what we now know as the core of the shapley supercluster shapley estimated the distance to this

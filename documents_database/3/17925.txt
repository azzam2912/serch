it typically consists of between 10 and 36 percent of kalsio and between 64 and 90 percent of naalsio anorthoclase is an intermediate member of the high albite sanidine alkali feldspar solid solution series intermediate members of this series high albite anorthoclase and high sodium sanidine are stable at temperatures of and above below 400 to 600 c only very limited solution exists less than about 5 on both the low albite and microcline ends anorthoclase and high albite exhibit triclinic symmetry whereas sanidine and the low temperature orthoclase have monoclinic symmetry if the high temperature intermediate composition alkali feldspars are allowed to cool slowly exsolution occurs and a perthite structure results anorthoclase occurs in high temperature sodium rich volcanic and hypabyssal shallow intrusive rocks the mineral is typically found as a constituent of the fine grained matrix or as small phenocrysts which may occur as loose crystals in a weathered rock it was first described in 1885 for an occurrence on pantelleria island trapani province sicily the name is from the greek and not cleaving at right angles for its oblique cleavage

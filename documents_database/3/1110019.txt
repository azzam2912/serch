the systematic name of this enzyme class is n 5 phospho beta d ribosyl anthranilate aldose ketose isomerase other names in common use include phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase is one of the many enzymes within the biosynthesis pathway of tryptophan an essential amino acid the upstream pathway substrates and intermediates are shown below fig 2 as seen in fig 3 n 5 phosphoribosyl anthranilate via this enzyme is converted into 1 o carboxyphenylamino 1 deoxribulose 5 phosphate as the name phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase suggests it functions as an isomerase rearranging the parts of the molecule without adding or removing molecules or atoms the reaction seen in fig 3 is an intramolecular redox reduction oxidation reaction its first step involves a proton transfer this product intermediate an enolamine is fluorescent which is useful for kinetic studies within this pathway however this product is unstable and quickly isomerases into an amino keto michaelis menten kinetic data is given in the table below for prai and indole glycerol phosphate synthase igps ec 4 1 1 48 depending on the microorganism prai s structure can vary between a mono functional enzyme monomeric and labile or a stable bi functional dimeric enzyme within saccharomyces cerevisiae bacillus subtilis pseudomonas

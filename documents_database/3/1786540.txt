unmanned space probes have used this method to collect data on mars as opposed to orbiting or landing a spacecraft designed for a flyby is also known as a flyby bus or flyby spacecraft one application of a mars flyby is for a human mission where after landing and staying on the surface for some time the ascent stage has a space rendezvous with another unmanned spacecraft that was launched separately from earth flying by this would mean the ascent stage of the lander to reach the speed necessary equal to that of the spacecraft flying by but the resources needed for earth return would not have to enter or leave mars orbit the spacecraft they live in on the journey to mars does the flyby but the crew separates and goes into a lander the excursion module s ascent stage must rejoin the main spacecraft before it gets too far away an advantage is that the resources needed for earth return don t have to enter and leave mars orbit but the ascent stage has to perform space rendezvous in solar orbit and the time on mars is constrained by the need to this mars cyclers orbit the sun

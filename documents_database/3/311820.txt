they are distinguished from the bacilli by lacking aerobic respiration they are obligate anaerobes and oxygen is toxic to them species of the class clostridia are often but not always gram positive see halanaerobium hydrogenoformans and have the ability to form spores studies show they are not a monophyletic group and their relationships are not entirely certain currently most are placed in a single order called clostridiales but this is not a natural group and is likely to be redefined in the future most species of the genus clostridium are saprophytic organisms that ferment plant polysaccharides and are found in many places in the environment most notably the soil however the genus does contain some human pathogens outlined below the toxins produced by certain members of the genus clostridium are among the most dangerous known examples are tetanus toxin known as tetanospasmin produced by c tetani and botulinum toxin produced by c botulinum some species have been isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis since they are commonly found in soils and in microbiota of humans and animals clostridia wounds and infections are found worldwide host defenses against the microbe are nearly absent and very little innate immunity exists if any

this results in a new strain of virus particles which cannot be inhibited as effectively by the antibodies that were originally targeted against previous strains making it easier for the virus to spread throughout a partially immune population antigenic drift occurs in both and viruses the immune system recognizes viruses when antigens on the surfaces of virus particles bind to immune receptors that are specific for these antigens this is similar to a lock recognizing a key after an infection the body produces many more of these virus specific immune receptors which prevent re infection by this particular strain of the virus and produce acquired immunity similarly a vaccine against a virus works by teaching the immune system to recognize the antigens exhibited by this virus however viral genomes are constantly mutating producing new forms of these antigens if one of these new forms of an antigen is sufficiently different from the old antigen it will no longer bind to the receptors of the body cells and viruses with these new antigens can infect the body cell as it avoids the immunity to the original strain of the virus when such a change occurs people who have had the illness

tooth wear is a very common condition that occurs in approximately 97 of the population this is a normal physiological process occurring throughout life but accelerated tooth wear can become a problem tooth wear varies substantially between people and groups with extreme attrition and enamel fractures common in archaeological samples and erosion more common today tooth wear is majorly the result of three processes attrition abrasion and erosion these forms of tooth wear can further lead to a condition known as abfraction where by tooth tissue is fractured due to stress lesions caused by extrinsic forces on the enamel tooth wear is a complex multi factorial problem and there is difficulty identifying a single causative factor however tooth wear is often a combination of the above processes many clinicians therefore make diagnoses such as tooth wear with a major element of attrition or tooth wear with a major element of erosion to reflect this this makes the diagnosis and management difficult therefore it is important to distinguish between these various types of tooth wear provide an insight into diagnosis risk factors and causative factors in order to implement appropriate interventions heavy wear is usually found on the occlusal chewing surface

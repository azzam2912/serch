this can happen as a result of exercise physiological remodeling or after injury to the heart muscle pathological remodeling the injury is typically due to acute myocardial infarction usually transmural or st segment elevation infarction but may be from a number of causes that result in increased pressure or volume causing pressure overload or volume overload forms of strain on the heart chronic hypertension congenital heart disease with intracardiac shunting and valvular heart disease may also lead to remodeling after the insult occurs a series of histopathological and structural changes occur in the left ventricular myocardium that lead to progressive decline in left ventricular performance ultimately ventricular remodeling may result in diminished contractile systolic function and reduced stroke volume physiological remodeling is reversible while pathological remodeling is mostly irreversible remodeling of the ventricles under left right pressure demand make mismatches inevitable pathologic pressure mismatches between the pulmonary and systemic circulation guide compensatory remodeling of the left and right ventricles the term reverse remodeling in cardiology implies an improvement in ventricular mechanics and function following a remote injury or pathological process ventricular remodeling may include ventricular hypertrophy ventricular dilation cardiomegaly and other changes it is an aspect of cardiomyopathy of which

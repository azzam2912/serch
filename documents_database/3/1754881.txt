the type and only described species is n tuberculatus which existed in what is now slovakia during the miocene epoch and was described by charlie j underwood and jan schlogl in 2011 it was described from 28 fossilized teeth nanocetorhinus was described by underwood and schlogl in 2011 from 28 partial and complete fossil teeth holotype z 27485 discovered at cerov lieskov vienna basin in slovakia it was placed incertae sedis into the chondrichthyan subclass neoselachii the authors expressed an uncertainty with regards to the validity of the genus being assigned to this subclass as the teeth from which it was described bore minimal resemblance to those of previously known neoselachian genera the generic name combines the latin term nano dwarvish with cetorhinus the generic name of the basking shark and references the resemblance the teeth of nanocetorhinus bear to those of cetorhinus but on a smaller scale the species epithet refers to the tuberculate surface ornament of the teeth underwood and schlogl theorized that nanocetorhinus was a planktivorous shark similarly to its namesake although there is no consequential evidence that the two genera are closely related the teeth were little more than 1 mm long at the largest the

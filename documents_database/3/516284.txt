this problem asks for the number and construction of circles that are tangent to three given circles points or lines in general the problem for three given circles has eight solutions which can be seen as 2 each tangency condition imposing a quadratic condition on the space of circles however for special arrangements of the given circles the number of solutions may also be any integer from 0 no solutions to six there is no arrangement for which there are seven solutions to apollonius problem a number of tools ranging from the elementary to the more advanced include enumerative geometry is very closely tied to intersection theory enumerative geometry saw spectacular development towards the end of the nineteenth century at the hands of hermann schubert he introduced for the purpose the schubert calculus which has proved of fundamental geometrical and topological value in broader areas the specific needs of enumerative geometry were not addressed until some further attention was paid to them in the 1960s and 1970s as pointed out for example by steven kleiman intersection numbers had been rigorously defined by andr weil as part of his foundational programme 1942 6 and again subsequently but this did not exhaust

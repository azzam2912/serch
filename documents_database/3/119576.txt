orbs promote interoperability of distributed object systems enabling such systems to be built by piecing together objects from different vendors while different parts communicate with each other via the orb orbs handle the transformation of in process data structures to and from the raw byte sequence which is transmitted over the network this is called marshalling or serialization in addition to marshalling data orbs often expose many more features such as distributed transactions directory services or real time scheduling some orbs such as corba compliant systems use an interface description language to describe the data that is to be transmitted on remote calls in object oriented languages an orb actually provides a framework which enables remote objects to be used over the network in the same way as if they were local and part of the same process on the client side so called stub objects are created and invoked serving as the only part visible and used inside the client application after the stub s methods are invoked client side orb performs the marshalling of invocation data and forwards the request to the server side orb on the server side orb locates the targeted object executes the requested operation

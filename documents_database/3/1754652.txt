composed in berlin between 2 march and 2 july 2008 and revised in 2011 2012 the concerto is about half an hour in duration and divides into a slow and a quick movement in each of which the five musical races combine in diverse ways the opening passacaglia la sarabande alternates three statements of a v i l n i u s motto a a e g a g e with three presentations of the sarabande from j s bach s fifth suite for unaccompanied cello bwv 1011 each incorporating some figurative or abstract representation of a national element sheng type chords quotations of zither music and poetic fragments from mediaeval china the rhythms and harmonies of brazilian indigenous and popular music the dissonant polyphony nonsense syllables and wide vocal glissandi of the lithuanian sutartines and in the optional soprano solo at the movement s core some spanish lines from cervantes don quixote the concluding fuga concertante exactly doubles the proportions of the finale of j s bach s fourth brandenburg concerto bwv 1049 as well as literally doubling its contrapuntal premise into a double fugue on two lithuanian folk songs as in the bach the fugal ritornelli are interspersed

it is closely related to the granny knot which is also a connected sum of two trefoils because the trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot the square knot and the granny knot are the simplest of all composite knots the square knot is the mathematical version of the common reef knot the square knot can be constructed from two trefoil knots one of which must be left handed and the other right handed each of the two knots is cut and then the loose ends are joined together pairwise the resulting connected sum is the square knot it is important that the original trefoil knots be mirror images of one another if two identical trefoil knots are used instead the result is a granny knot the square knot is amphichiral meaning that it is indistinguishable from its own mirror image the crossing number of a square knot is six which is the smallest possible crossing number for a composite knot the alexander polynomial of the square knot is which is simply the square of the alexander polynomial of a trefoil knot similarly the alexander conway polynomial of a square knot is these two polynomials are the same as those

this was to be accomplished by measuring very precisely tiny changes in the direction of spin of four gyroscopes contained in an earth satellite orbiting at 650 km 400 mi altitude crossing directly over the poles the satellite was launched on 20 april 2004 on a delta ii rocket the spaceflight phase lasted until 2005 its aim was to measure spacetime curvature near earth and thereby the stress energy tensor which is related to the distribution and the motion of matter in space in and near earth this provided a test of general relativity gravitomagnetism and related models the principal investigator was francis everitt initial results confirmed the expected geodetic effect to an accuracy of about 1 the expected frame dragging effect was similar in magnitude to the current noise level the noise being dominated by initially unmodeled effects due to nonuniform coatings on the gyroscopes work continued to model and account for these sources of error thus permitting extraction of the frame dragging signal by august 2008 the frame dragging effect had been confirmed to within 15 of the expected result and the december 2008 nasa report indicated that the geodetic effect was confirmed to better than 0 5

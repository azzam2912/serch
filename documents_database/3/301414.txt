lepton number is an additive quantum number so its sum is preserved in interactions as opposed to multiplicative quantum numbers such as parity where the product is preserved instead mathematically the lepton number formula 1 is defined by formula 2 where formula 3 is the number of leptons and formula 4 is the number of antileptons lepton number was introduced in 1953 to explain the absence of reactions such as formula 5 in the cowan reines neutrino experiment which instead observed formula 6 this process inverse beta decay conserves lepton number as the incoming antineutrino has lepton number 1 while the outgoing positron antielectron also has lepton number 1 in addition to lepton number lepton family numbers are defined as prominent examples of lepton flavor conservation are the muon decays formula 7 and formula 8 in these the creation of an electron is accompanied by the creation of an electron antineutrino and the creation of a positron is accompanied by the creation of an electron neutrino likewise a decaying negative muon results in the creation of a muon neutrino while a decaying positive muon results in the creation of a muon antineutrino lepton flavor is only approximately conserved and is

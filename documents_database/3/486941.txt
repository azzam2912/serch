generally third party extensions they added additional features to a computer s built in basic interpreter toolkits ran as extensions to the basic interpreter supplied with the machine at the time such interpreters almost always came programmed into the rom of the computer making it impossible to modify or patch the code it was also extremely rare for manufacturers to offer upgrades or bugfixes except as part of new models of machine as the original language was held in immutable rom it generally was difficult for a toolkit to directly extend the language except by adding new keywords to perform functions not implemented by the original interpreter typical toolkit functionality included editing extensions such as commands to renumber a program perform block line deletions and so on facilities to make structured programming possible and additional keywords to perform new functions in the case of the latter these new functions often allowed the programmer to easily access the computer s graphics sound and other hardware which was often partially or completely unsupported in the early basics this would have otherwise been achieved by arcane usage of peek and poke commands and machine language routines

at the time the script was first noticed by europeans micronesia was known as the caroline islands hence the name caroline island script the script has 99 known c v glyphs which are not quite enough for a complete representation of the woleaian language even given the fact that consonant and vowel length are ignored approximately a fifth of them derive from the latin alphabet the question for historians is whether the wolaians had proto writing which crystallized into full fledged writing under the influence of the latin alphabet or if they were exposed to the latin alphabet without completely understanding it see trans cultural diffusion and supplemented it either with existing signs from petroglyphs tattoos and the like or by creating new rebus or ad hoc symbols until it was sufficient to fully express woleaian the script was written from left to right since length was ignored one glyph stood for both ga and ka and and another for both la and na and some glyphs stood for longer syllables than just consonant plus vowel such as bag warr t t moi shr chroa gkaa etc not enough glyphs were recorded to write all woleaian syllables this way and

the sequence of nucleotides in other words epigenetically the less precise term epigenetic inheritance may cover both cell cell and organism organism information transfer although these two levels of epigenetic inheritance are equivalent in unicellular organisms they may have distinct mechanisms and evolutionary distinctions in multicellular organisms the environment can induce the epigenetic marks epigenetic tags for some epigenetically influenced traits and some marks are heritable leading some to view epigenetics as a relaxation of biology s rejection of the inheritance of acquired characteristics lamarckism four general categories of epigenetic modification are known epigenetic variation may take one of four general forms others may yet be elucidated but currently self sustaining feedback loops spatial templating chromatin marking and rna mediated pathways modify epigenes at the level of individual cells epigenetic variation within multicellular organisms may be endogenous generated by cell cell signaling e g during cell differentiation early in development or exogenous a cellular response to environmental cues in sexually reproducing organisms much of the epigenetic modification within cells is reset during meiosis e g marks at the flc locus controlling plant vernalization though some epigenetic responses have been shown to be conserved e g transposon methylation in plants differential

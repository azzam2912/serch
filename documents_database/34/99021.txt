the device usually displays the revolutions per minute rpm on a calibrated analogue dial but digital displays are increasingly common the word comes from greek tachos speed and metron measure essentially the words tachometer and speedometer have identical meaning a device that measures speed it is by arbitrary convention that in the automotive world one is used for engine and the other for vehicle speed in formal engineering nomenclature more precise terms are used to distinguish the two the first mechanical tachometers were based on measuring the centrifugal force similar to the operation of a centrifugal governor the inventor is assumed to be the german engineer dietrich uhlhorn he used it for measuring the speed of machines in 1817 since 1840 it has been used to measure the speed of locomotives tachometers or revolution counters on cars aircraft and other vehicles show the rate of rotation of the engine s crankshaft and typically have markings indicating a safe range of rotation speeds this can assist the driver in selecting appropriate throttle and gear settings for the driving conditions prolonged use at high speeds may cause inadequate lubrication overheating exceeding capability of the cooling system exceeding speed capability of sub parts

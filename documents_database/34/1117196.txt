the actual activating ligands for and some functions of this receptor are disputed initially discovered in 1998 as an orphan receptor i e a receptor whose activating ligand s and function were unknown gpr17 was deorphanized in a study that reported it to be a receptor for ltc4 ltd4 and uracil nucleotides in consequence gpr17 attracted attention as a potential mediator of reactions caused by ltc4 and ltd4 viz asthma rhinitis and urticarial triggered by allergens nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs and exercise see aspirin induced asthma subsequent reports however have varied in results studies focusing on the allergen and non allergen reactions find that gpr17 bearing cells do not respond to ltc4 ltd4 and uracil nucleotides while studies focusing on nerve tissue find that certain types of gpr17 bearing oligodendrocytes do indeed respond to them in 2013 and 2014 reports the international union of basic and clinical pharmacology took no position on which of these are true ligands for gpr17 gpr17 is a constitutively active receptor i e a receptor that has baseline activity which is independent of although potentially increased by its ligands gpr17 has a structure which is intermediate between the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor group i e cysteinyl

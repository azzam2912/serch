detection improvements on the order of 1 000 000 1 are common small fast moving objects can be identified close to terrain near the sea surface and inside storms this signal processing strategy is used in pulse doppler radar and multi mode radar which can then be pointed into regions containing a large number of slow moving reflectors without overwhelming computer software and operators other signal processing strategies like moving target indication are more appropriate for benign clear blue sky environments it is also used to measure blood flow in doppler ultrasonography pulse doppler begins with coherent pulses transmitted through an antenna or transducer there is no modulation on the transmit pulse each pulse is a perfectly clean slice of a perfect coherent tone the coherent tone is produced by the local oscillator there can be dozens of transmit pulses between the antenna and the reflector in a hostile environment there can be millions of other reflections from slow moving or stationary objects transmit pulses are sent at the pulse repetition frequency energy from the transmit pulses propagate through space until they are disrupted by reflectors this disruption causes some of the transmit energy to be reflected back to the

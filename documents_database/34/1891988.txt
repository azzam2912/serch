the circle has the property that the solutions of the quadratic equation are the horizontal coordinates of the intersections of the circle with the horizontal axis carlyle circles have been used to develop ruler and compass constructions of regular polygons given the quadratic equation the circle in the coordinate plane having the line segment joining the points a 0 1 and b s p as a diameter is called the carlyle circle of the quadratic equation the defining property of the carlyle circle can be established thus the equation of the circle having the line segment ab as diameter is the abscissas of the points where the circle intersects the x axis are the roots of the equation obtained by setting y 0 in the equation of the circle the problem of constructing a regular pentagon is equivalent to the problem of constructing the roots of the equation one root of this equation is z 1 which corresponds to the point p 1 0 removing the factor corresponding to this root the other roots turn out to be roots of the equation these roots can be represented in the form where exp 2 i 5 let these correspond to the

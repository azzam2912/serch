there are two types colour asking bids and notrump asking bids constructed by bridge pioneer ely culbertson in the 1940s they have been superseded by other methods however one remaining commonly used asking bid is the 5nt grand slam force the application of asking bids requires making distinctions between the asking colour the agreed trump and the two remaining side colours replies by partner are in accordance with a schedule of defined meanings first there has to be an agreed trump colour the trump agreement can be done explicit as well as implicit thereafter the first asking bid has to be either a double jump in a new colour not bid by the partner or the one who puts the asking bid forward or without a jump at the fourth level after an asking bid the one who has put the first asking bid forward will be like the captain of a ship and his partner has to reply to the questions only bids in the agreed trump can abort a series of asking bids examples after an opening of 1 partner s reply 3 establishes as trump explicit agreement the bids 4 4 and 4 are now asking bids

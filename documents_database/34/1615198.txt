most neurons of the nucleus basalis are rich in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and they have widespread projections to the neocortex and other brain structures the nucleus basalis in humans is a somewhat diffuse collection of large cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain the main body of the nucleus basalis lies inferior to the anterior commissure and the globus pallidus and lateral to the anterior hypothalamus in an area known as the substantia innominata rostrally the nucleus basalis is continuous with the cholinergic neurons of the nucleus of the diagonal band of broca the nucleus basalis is thought to consist of several subdivisions based on the location of the cells and their projections to other brain regions occasional neurons belonging to the nucleus basalis can be found in nearby locations such as the internal laminae of the globus pallidus and the genu of the internal capsule the widespread connections of the nucleus basalis with other parts of the brain indicate that it is likely to have an important modulatory influence on brain function studies of the firing patterns of nucleus basalis neurons in nonhuman primates indicate that the cells are associated with arousing stimuli both positive appetitive and negative aversive there

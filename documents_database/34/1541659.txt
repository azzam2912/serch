such placement is called linear graph arrangement linear graph layout or linear graph placement the weighted graph bandwidth problem is a generalization wherein the edges are assigned weights w and the cost function to be minimized is formula 2 in terms of matrices the unweighted graph bandwidth is the bandwidth of the symmetric matrix which is the adjacency matrix of the graph the bandwidth may also be defined as one less than the maximum clique size in a proper interval supergraph of the given graph chosen to minimize its clique size for several families of graphs the bandwidth formula 3 is given by an explicit formula the bandwidth of a path graph p on n vertices is 1 and for a complete graph k we have formula 4 for the complete bipartite graph k which was proved by chv tal as a special case of this formula the star graph formula 7 on k 1 vertices has bandwidth formula 8 for the hypercube graph formula 9 on formula 10 vertices the bandwidth was determined by to be chvat lov showed that the bandwidth of the m n square grid graph formula 12 that is the cartesian product of two path

the symbols of the icosian calculus can be equated to moves between vertices on a dodecahedron hamilton s work in this area resulted indirectly in the terms hamiltonian circuit and hamiltonian path in graph theory he also invented the icosian game as a means of illustrating and popularising his discovery the algebra is based on three symbols that are each roots of unity in that repeated application of any of them yields the value 1 after a particular number of steps they are hamilton also gives one other relation between the symbols the operation is associative but not commutative they generate a group of order 60 isomorphic to the group of rotations of a regular icosahedron or dodecahedron and therefore to the alternating group of degree five although the algebra exists as a purely abstract construction it can be most easily visualised in terms of operations on the edges and vertices of a dodecahedron hamilton himself used a flattened dodecahedron as the basis for his instructional game imagine an insect crawling along a particular edge of hamilton s labelled dodecahedron in a certain direction say from formula 3 to formula 4 we can represent this directed edge by formula 5

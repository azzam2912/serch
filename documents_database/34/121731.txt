it has been suggested that it developed along the same lines as okinawan kobud weapons as a modified farming tool another theory states that it is the result of the japanese modifying a chinese guan dao that bears a similar appearance others say that a creative samurai in need of a longer weapon attached a sword to a pole perhaps the simplest explanation is the natural development of polearms polearms are intended as mass weapons to be used not just by individual warriors but by formations of soldiers together on field battles and not for dueling when fighting in close order two handed cut and thrust weapons such as halberds and glaives are much more efficient than mere spears or swords because of their versatility compared to spears and longer reach compared to swords fighting in massed formation does not require similar individual weapon handling skills as required by a skilled swordsman naginata are almost identical in appearance to both the glaive and the guan dao and it is most likely result of parallel evolution in the early history of its use the naginata was primarily used against cavalry as its length kept the wielder a safe distance from horses

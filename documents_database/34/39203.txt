deadlock is a common problem in multiprocessing systems parallel computing and distributed systems where software and hardware locks are used to arbitrate shared resources and implement process synchronization in an operating system a deadlock occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state because a requested system resource is held by another waiting process which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process if a process is unable to change its state indefinitely because the resources requested by it are being used by another waiting process then the system is said to be in a deadlock in a communications system deadlocks occur mainly due to lost or corrupt signals rather than resource contention a deadlock situation on a resource can arise if and only if all of the following conditions hold simultaneously in a system these four conditions are known as the coffman conditions from their first description in a 1971 article by edward g coffman jr most current operating systems cannot prevent deadlocks when a deadlock occurs different operating systems respond to them in different non standard manners most approaches work by preventing one of the four coffman conditions from occurring especially the fourth

most of the neurons that project out of the pars reticulata are inhibitory gabaergic neurons i e these neurons release gaba which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter neurons in the pars reticulata are much less densely packed than those in the pars compacta they were sometimes named pars diffusa they are smaller and thinner than the dopaminergic neurons and conversely identical and morphologically similar to the pallidal neurons see primate basal ganglia their dendrites as well as the pallidal are preferentially perpendicular to the striatal afferents the massive striatal afferents correspond to the medial end of the nigrostriatal bundle nigral neurons have the same peculiar synaptology with the striatal axonal endings they make connections with the dopamine neurons of the pars compacta whose long dendrites plunge deeply in the pars reticulata the neurons of the pars reticulata produce the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid gaba the neurons of the pars reticulata through the nigrothalamic bundle send axons to a particular part of the motor thalamus the nigral territory corresponds to the nucleus ventralis anterior va see also list of thalamic nuclei different from the pallidal vo va is the origin of one output of the basal ganglia system it sends axons to

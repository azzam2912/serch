examples are interfaces that couple a human with a machine to do things usually done unaided such as shaping a three dimensional object using multiple modality interactions with a data base or using interactive video to allow a student to visually engage with mathematics concepts enactive interface design can be approached through the idea of raising awareness of affordances that is optimization of the awareness of possible actions available to someone using the enactive interface this optimization involves visibility affordance and feedback the enactive interface in the figure interprets manual input and provides a response in perceptual terms in the form of images sounds and haptic tactile feedback the system is called enactive because of the feedback loop in which the system response is decided by the user input and the user input is driven by the perceived system responses enactive interfaces are new types of human computer interface that express and transmit the enactive knowledge by integrating different sensory aspects the driving concept of enactive interfaces is then the fundamental role of motor action for storing and acquiring knowledge action driven interfaces enactive interfaces are then capable of conveying and understanding gestures of the user in order to provide

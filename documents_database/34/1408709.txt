it is named after albrecht d rer whose 1514 engraving melencolia i includes a depiction of d rer s solid a convex polyhedron having the d rer graph as its skeleton d rer s solid is one of only four well covered simple convex polyhedra d rer s solid is combinatorially equivalent to a cube with two opposite vertices truncated although d rer s depiction of it is not in this form but rather as a truncated rhombohedron or triangular truncated trapezohedron the exact geometry of the solid depicted by d rer is a subject of some academic debate with different hypothetical values for its acute angles ranging from 72 to 82 the d rer graph is the graph formed by the vertices and edges of the d rer solid it is a cubic graph of girth 3 and diameter 4 as well as its construction as the skeleton of d rer s solid it can be obtained by applying a y transform to the opposite vertices of a cube graph or as the generalized petersen graph g 6 2 as with any graph of a convex polyhedron the d rer graph is a 3 vertex connected simple planar graph

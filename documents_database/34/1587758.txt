the discipline typically also designs passive electrical components usually based on printed circuit boards electronics is a subfield within the wider electrical engineering academic subject but denotes a broad engineering field that covers subfields such as analog electronics digital electronics consumer electronics embedded systems and power electronics electronics engineering deals with implementation of applications principles and algorithms developed within many related fields for example solid state physics radio engineering telecommunications control systems signal processing systems engineering computer engineering instrumentation engineering electric power control robotics and many others the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee is one of the most important and influential organizations for electronics engineers based in the us on an international level the international electrotechnical commission iec prepares standards for electronic engineering developed through consensus and thanks to the work of 20 000 experts from 172 countries worldwide electronics is a subfield within the wider electrical engineering academic subject an academic degree with a major in electronics engineering can be acquired from some universities while other universities use electrical engineering as the subject the term electrical engineer is still used in the academic world to include electronic engineers however some people consider the term electrical engineer should

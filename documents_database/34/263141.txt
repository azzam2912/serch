this is necessary because if multiple tags respond simultaneously to a query they will jam each other in a typical commercial application such as scanning a bag of groceries potentially hundreds of tags might be within range of the reader when all the tags cooperate with the tag reader and follow the same anti collision protocol also called singulation protocol then the tag reader can read data from each and every tag without interference from the other tags generally collision occurs when two entities require the identical resource for example two ships with crossing courses in a narrows in wireless technology collision occurs when two transmitters transmit at the same time with the same modulation scheme on the same frequency in rfid technology various strategies have been developed to overcome this dangerous situation there are different methods of singulation but the most common is tree walking which involves asking all tags with a serial number that starts with either a 1 or 0 to respond if more than one responds the reader might ask for all tags with a serial number that starts with 01 to respond and then 010 it keeps doing this until it finds the tag it

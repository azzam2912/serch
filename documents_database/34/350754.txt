shortly after completing his studies in the seminary at verona abate zamboni was appointed to the chair of physics in the lyceum of that city he died in venice on july 25 1846 zamboni is known to students of physics for an improved version of the dry pile an electric battery which does not use an electrolyte which he invented in 1812 it consists of a number of paper discs coated with zinc foil on one side and manganese dioxide on the other the moisture of the paper serves as a conductor by pressing a large number of such discs together in a glass tube an electromotive force can be obtained that is sufficient to deflect the leaves of an ordinary electroscope by bringing the terminal knobs of the pile near each other and suspending a light brass ball between them zamboni devised what was called an electrostatic clock the device is so named because the ball oscillating between the knobs looks like a pendulum in the oxford electric bell experiment at the clarendon laboratory at oxford university the terminals of what is believed to be such a pile are fitted with bells that have been continuously ringing since the

it standardizes a language to transport store and exchange possibly large volumes of event data e g for process mining process mining aims to discover monitor and improve processes by extracting knowledge from event logs representing actual process executions in a given setting process mining depends on the availability of accurate and unambiguous event logs according to established standards the purpose of this standard is to provide a generally acknowledged w3c xml format for the interchange of event data between information systems in many applications domains on the one hand and analysis tools for such data on the other hand as such this standard aims to fix the syntax and the semantics of the event data which for example is being transferred from the site generating this data to the site analyzing this data as a result of this standard if the event data is transferred using the syntax as described by this standard its semantics will be well understood and clear at both sites ieee 1849 was the second ieee standard sponsored by the ieee computational intelligence society the first was ieee 1855

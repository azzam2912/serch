the stalling speed of an aircraft in straight level flight is partly determined by its wing loading an aircraft with a low wing loading has a larger wing area relative to its mass as compared to an aircraft with a high wing loading the faster an aircraft flies the more lift can be produced by each unit of wing area so a smaller wing can carry the same mass in level flight consequently faster aircraft generally have higher wing loadings than slower aircraft this increased wing loading also increases takeoff and landing distances a higher wing loading also decreases maneuverability the same constraints apply to winged biological organisms wing loading is a useful measure of the stalling speed of an aircraft wings generate lift owing to the motion of air around the wing larger wings move more air so an aircraft with a large wing area relative to its mass i e low wing loading will have a lower stalling speed therefore an aircraft with lower wing loading will be able to take off and land at a lower speed or be able to take off with a greater load it will also be able to turn at a greater

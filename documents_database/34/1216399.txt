the genre takes the form of a contest or war of words between two poets each trying to outclass the other in vituperation and verbal pyrotechnics it is not certain how the work was composed but it is likely to have been publicly performed probably in the style of a poetic joust by the two combatants william dunbar and walter kennedy before the court of james iv of scotland there are clues in the poem that suggest some of the features that the show must have contained each of the combatants had a commissar both of whom are named in the work and sometimes directly addressed by the performers these are respectively sir john the ross for dunbar and quentin shaw for kennedy both of whom were actual persons shaw certainly and ross probably were also poets and it seems possible that they played some material part in the performance ross shaw and kennedy are all three named as a group in the closing stanzas of dunbar s lament for the makaris in the poem as it survives there are two exchanges dunbar opens with a three stanza address to his commissar which pours lofty scorn on the poetic pretensions

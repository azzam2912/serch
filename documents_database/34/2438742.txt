a chp peptide usually possesses a high content of proline and hydroxyproline in the xaa and yaa positions which confers it a strong propensity to form the collagen s unique triple helix conformation in the single stranded monomeric status the peptide can recognize denatured collagen strands in tissues by forming a hybridized triple helix with the collagen strands this occurs via the triple helical chain assembly and inter chain hydrogen bonding in a manner similar to primers binding to melted dna strands during pcr the binding does not depend on a specific sequence or epitope on collagen enabling chps to target denatured collagen chains of different types collagen is the main component of the extracellular matrix ecm the collagen superfamily consists of 28 different types of collagen although the function and hierarchical structure of these collagens may vary they all shall the defining structural feature known as the triple helix where three left handed polyproline ii type ppii helices assemble to form a right handed supercoiled helical motif short synthetic peptides known as collagen mimetic peptides cmps or collagen like peptides clps have played a major role in elucidating the 3d structure of the collagen triple helix its folding kinetics

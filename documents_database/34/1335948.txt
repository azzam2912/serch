many log splitters consist of a hydraulic or electrical rod and piston assembly and these are often rated by the tons of force they can generate the higher the force rating the greater the thickness or length of the rounds that can be split the log splitter consists of all four major hydraulic components most log splitter models for home use have a rating around 10 tons but professional hydraulic models may exert 30 tons of force or more there are also manual log splitters which use mechanical leverage to force logs through a sharpened blade assembly and screw or corkscrew types that are driven directly from an agricultural tractor s power take off shaft where the splitter is mounted on the three point linkage a simple log splitter may be powered by an electric motor driving a hydraulic pump or by gasoline or diesel engine with or without a tractor the non electric versions can be used remotely where the splitter can be moved to the location of the cut wood source split logs can then be loaded into trucks trailers or bulk bags no matter what the power source a log splitter either uses a hydraulic piston to

for example multiple sclerosis and malaria often exhibit peaks of activity and sometimes very long periods of dormancy followed by relapse or recrudescence in the context of drug use relapse or reinstatement of drug seeking behavior is a form of spontaneous recovery that involves the recurrence of pathological drug use after a period of abstinence relapse is often observed in individuals who have developed a drug addiction or either form of drug dependence the availability of the dopamine receptor d2 plays a role in self administration and the reinforcing effects of cocaine and other stimulants the d2 receptor availability has an inverse relationship to vulnerability to the reinforcing effects of the drug that is as d2 receptors become limited the user becomes more susceptible to the reinforcing effects of cocaine it is currently unknown if a predisposition to low d2 receptor availability is possible however most studies support the idea that changes in d2 receptor availability are a result rather than a precursor of cocaine use it has also been noted that d2 receptors may return to the level existing prior to drug exposure during long periods of abstinence a fact which may have implications in relapse treatment social interactions

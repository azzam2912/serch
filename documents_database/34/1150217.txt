it is the salt formed by the neutralization of methylamine with nitric acid this substance is also known as methylamine nitrate and monomethylamine nitrate not to be confused with methyl nitramine or monomethyl nitramine methylammonium nitrate was first used as an explosive ingredient by the germans during world war ii it was originally called mono methylamine nitrate a name that has largely stuck among chemists who formulate energetic materials methylammonium nitrate is somewhat similar in explosive properties to ammonium nitrate an which yields 85 of the power of nitroglycerine when the ammonium nitrate is incorporated into an explosive the addition of the carbon containing methyl group in methylammonium nitrate imparts better explosive properties and helps create a more favorable oxygen balance after world war ii methylammonium nitrate was largely ignored by explosives manufacturers in favor of less costly ammonium nitrate ammonium nitrate fuel oil mixtures anfo were sufficient for most large diameter explosives uses methylammonium nitrate saw a resurgence when e i du pont de nemours and company dupont seeking to lower the cost of its tnt based tovex water gel explosives incorporated a mixture of methylammonium nitrate with ammonium nitrate which served as a basis for dupont s water

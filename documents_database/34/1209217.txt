this marked the thirteenth and final nba season for all star forward larry bird who missed nearly half of the season games due to a nagging back injury however one of the season highlights was a 49 point performance from bird in a nationally televised double overtime win over eventual western conference champion portland trail blazers it was the most points for bird since february 15 1988 when he scored 49 at phoenix suns bird was also selected for the 1992 nba all star game along with reggie lewis but did not play due to injury early into the season the celtics traded brian shaw to the miami heat for sherman douglas the celtics trailed the new york knicks in the atlantic division for much of the season but a furious rally at the end of the season helped the celtics finish 51 31 and claim the division title and the 2 eastern conference seed although since they finished behind 3 seed cleveland cavaliers in record cleveland would have home court in a head to head playoff series in the playoffs the celtics swept the indiana pacers in three straight games of the first round but succumbed to the cavaliers

with schl fli symbol 5 3 5 it has five dodecahedral cells around each edge and each vertex is surrounded by twenty dodecahedra its vertex figure is a regular icosahedron the dihedral angle of a euclidean regular dodecahedron is 116 6 so no more than three of them can fit around an edge in euclidean 3 space in hyperbolic space however the dihedral angle is smaller than it is in euclidean space and depends on the size of the figure the smallest possible dihedral angle is 60 for an ideal hyperbolic regular dodecahedron with infinitely long edges the dodecahedra in this dodecahedral honeycomb are sized so that all of their dihedral angles are exactly 72 there are four regular compact honeycombs in 3d hyperbolic space there is another honeycomb in hyperbolic 3 space called the order 4 dodecahedral honeycomb 5 3 4 which has only four dodecahedra per edge these honeycombs are also related to the 120 cell which can be considered as a honeycomb in positively curved space the surface of a 4 dimensional sphere with three dodecahedra on each edge 5 3 3 lastly the dodecahedral ditope 5 3 2 exists on a 3 sphere with 2 hemispherical

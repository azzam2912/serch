this is helpful when studying differential expression of a gene in a disease or analyzing any omics dataset with a large number of proteins by examining the changes in gene expression in a pathway its biological causes can be explored pathway is the term from molecular biology which depicts an artificial simplified model of a process within a cell or tissue a typical pathway model starts with an extracellular signaling molecule that activates a specific receptor thus triggering a chain of protein protein or protein small molecule interactions pathway analysis helps to understand or interpret omics data from the point of view of canonical prior knowledge structured in the form of pathways diagrams it allows finding distinct cell processes diseases or signaling pathways that are statistically associated with selection of differentially expressed genes between two samples often but erroneously pathway analysis is used as synonym for network analysis functional enrichment analysis and gene set analysis the data for pathway analysis come from high throughput biology this includes high throughput sequencing data and microarray data before pathway analysis can be done the omics data should be normalized and genes should be ranked by differential expression usually with help of student s

the study has its origins in the work by ferdinand hurter and vero charles driffield circa 1876 with early black and white emulsions they determined how the density of silver produced varied with the amount of light received and the method and time of development plots of film density log of opacity versus the log of exposure are called characteristic curves hurter driffield curves h d curves hd curves h d curves d loge curves or d logh curves at moderate exposures the overall shape is typically a bit like an s slanted so that its base and top are horizontal there is usually a central region of the hd curve which approximates to a straight line called the linear or straight line portion the slope of this region is called the gamma the low end is called the toe and at the top the curve rounds over to form the shoulder at extremely high exposures the density may come back down an effect known as solarisation different commercial film materials cover a gamma range from about 0 5 to about 5 often it is not the original film that one views but a second or later generation in these

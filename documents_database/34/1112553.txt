the encoded enzyme is an alpha 2 dimer which belongs to the class ii family of trna synthetases in enzymology a glycine trna ligase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction the 3 substrates of this enzyme are atp glycine and trna gly whereas its 3 products are amp diphosphate and glycyl trna gly this enzyme belongs to the family of ligases to be specific those forming carbon oxygen bonds in aminoacyl trna and related compounds the systematic name of this enzyme class is glycine trnagly ligase amp forming other names in common use include glycyl trna synthetase glycyl transfer ribonucleate synthetase glycyl transfer rna synthetase glycyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase and glycyl translase this enzyme participates in glycine serine and threonine metabolism and aminoacyl trna biosynthesis glycyl trna synthetase has been shown to interact with eef1d mutant forms of the protein associated with peripheral nerve disease have been shown to aberrantly bind to the transmembrane receptor proteins neuropilin 1 and trk receptors a c glycyl trna synthetase has been shown to be a target of autoantibodies in the human autoimmune diseases polymyositis or dermatomyositis the peripheral nerve diseases charcot marie tooth disease type 2d cmt2d and distal spinal

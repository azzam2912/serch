from the innovation of the method in 1969 it has been further developed and broadened and is a worldwide accepted philosophy for condition monitoring of rolling bearings and machine maintenance consider a metal ball hitting a metal bar at the moment of impact a pressure wave spreads through the material of both bodies 1 the wave is transient quickly damps out when the wave front hits the shock pulse transducer it will cause a dampened oscillation of the transducer s reference mass the peak amplitude is a function of the impact velocity v during the next phase of the collision both bodies start to vibrate 2 the frequency of this vibration is a function of the mass and the shape of the colliding bodies a shock pulse transducer reacts with a large amplitude oscillation to the weak shock pulses because it is excited at its resonance frequency of 32 khz machine vibration of a much lower frequency is filtered out the first frame shows the symbol for a transducer and below the vibration signal from the machine with superimposed transients at the resonance frequency caused by shock pulses the second frame shows the electric filter which passes a train of

the attack allows an attacker to recover the key in an rc4 encrypted stream from a large number of messages in that stream the fluhrer mantin and shamir attack applies to specific key derivation methods but does not apply in general to rc4 based ssl tls since ssl generates the encryption keys it uses for rc4 by hashing meaning that different ssl sessions have unrelated keys however the closely related bar mitzvah attack based on the same research and revealed in 2015 does exploit those cases where weak keys are generated by the ssl keying process the fluhrer mantin and shamir fms attack published in their 2001 paper weaknesses in the key scheduling algorithm of rc4 takes advantage of a weakness in the rc4 key scheduling algorithm to reconstruct the key from encrypted messages the fms attack gained popularity in network attack tools including airsnort weplab and aircrack which use it to recover the key used by wep protected wireless networks this discussion will use the below rc4 key scheduling algorithm ksa the following pseudo random generation algorithm prga will also be used the basis of the fms attack lies in the use of weak initialization vectors ivs used with

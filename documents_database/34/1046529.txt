this colourless liquid is one of the more common lactones gvl is chiral but is usually used as the racemate it is readily obtained from cellulosic biomass and is a potential fuel and green solvent gvl behaves as a prodrug to hydroxyvaleric acid ghv a drug with similar effects to those of hydroxybutyric acid ghb albeit with less potentcy in comparison because ghb is controlled in many parts of the world while gvl is not gvl has gained popularity as a legal substitute for ghb gvl is produced from levulinic acid which is obtained from hexoses in a typical process cellulosic biomasses such as corn stover sawgrass or wood is hydrolysed into glucose and other sugars using acid catalysts the resulting glucose can then be dehydrated via hydroxymethylfurfural to yield formic acid and levulinic acid which cyclises to intermediate unsaturated ring compounds which can then be hydrogenated to gamma valerolactone which has potential applications as a liquid fuel gvl has been identified as a potential green solvent because of its herbal odor it is used in the perfume and flavor industries it is a structural isomer of valerolactone since it is readily obtained from glucose gvl has long been identified

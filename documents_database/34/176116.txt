delta waves like other brain waves are recorded with an electroencephalogram eeg and are usually associated with the deep stage 3 of nrem sleep also known as slow wave sleep sws and aid in characterizing the depth of sleep delta waves were first described in the 1930s by w grey walter who improved upon hans berger s electroencephalograph machine eeg to detect alpha and delta waves delta waves can be quantified using quantitative electroencephalography delta waves like all brain waves can be detected by electroencephalography eeg delta waves were originally defined as having a frequency between 1 4 hz although more recent classifications put the boundaries at between 0 5 and 2 hz they are the slowest and highest amplitude classically described brainwaves although recent studies have described slower stage n3 slow wave sleep during n3 sws delta waves account for 20 or more of the eeg record during this stage delta waves occur in all mammals and potentially all animals as well delta waves are often associated with another eeg phenomenon the k complex k complexes have been shown to immediately precede delta waves in slow wave sleep delta waves have also been classified according to the location of

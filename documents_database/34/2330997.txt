concentrations found have been low it can be synthesized in six steps from pseudoionone and propargyl alcohol total synthesis begins with the combination of acetylene and acetone to produce 3 methyl 1 butyn 3 ol hydrogenation by palladium catalysis results in 3 methyl 1 buten 3 ol reaction with diketene or acetic acid ester creates the acetoacetate thermal reaction leads to 2 methyl 2 hepten 6 one the steps of adding acetylene and then isopropenyl methyl ether and hydrogenating the product are done twice this involves an intermediate of pseudoionone then acetylene is added to create dehydroisophytol hydrogenation results in isophytol production industrially was estimated to be 35000 to 40000 tons in 2002 created by total synthesis with about 99 9 used in synthesizing vitamin e and vitamin k more than 95 of the less than 40 tons used annually in consumer products is as a fragrance less than 2 tons a year is used for flavoring in perfumes the concentration is 0 2 v v at most oral values in mammals are greater than 5000 mg kg

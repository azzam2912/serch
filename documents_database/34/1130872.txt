limp 2 is expressed in brain heart liver lung and kidney mainly in the membrane of lysosome organelles however in cardiac muscle limp 2 is also expressed at intercalated discs limp 2 in a membrane protein in lysosomes that functions to regulate lysosomal endosomal transport mutations in limp 2 have been shown to cause gaucher disease myoclonic epilepsy and action myoclonus renal failure syndrome abnormal levels of limp 2 have also been found in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy human limp 2 has a theoretical molecular weight of 54 3 kda and is 478 amino acids in length though limp 2 was initially discovered in 1985 by lewis et al from rat liver lysosomes limp 2 was cloned in 1992 by two groups one isolated limp 2 from human metastatic pancreatic islet tumor cells and one from rat liver lysosomal membranes limp 2 was isolated as a protein of approximate molecular weight 85 kda synthesized from a precursor oform of approximately 77 kda the weight discrepancy between its theoretical 54 3 kda and observed 85 kda is due to the presence of 10 high mannose type n linked oligosaccharide chains in the human form of this protein compared to 11 in

this is a widely investigated topic in molecular spintronics since the role of interfaces plays a huge part in the functioning of a device in particular spinterfaces are widely studied in the scientific community because of their hybrid organic inorganic composition in fact the hybridization between the metal and the organic material can be controlled by acting on the molecules which are way more responsive to electrical and optical stimuli with respect to metals this gives rise to the possibility of efficiently tuning the magnetic properties of the interface at the atomic scale the field of spintronics which is the scientific field that aims to study the spin dependent electron transport in solid state devices emerged in the last decades of the 20th century first with the observation of the injection of a spin polarized current from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic metal and subsequently with the discovery of tunnel magnetoresistance and giant magnetoresistance the field evolved turning towards spin orbit related phenomena such as rashba effect only more recently spintronics has been extended to the organic world with the idea of exploiting the weak spin relaxation mechanisms of molecules in order to use them for spin transport research in

an important feature of clarion is the distinction between implicit and explicit processes and focusing on capturing the interaction between these two types of processes the system was created by the research group led by ron sun clarion is an integrative architecture consisting of a number of distinct subsystems with a dual representational structure in each subsystem implicit versus explicit representations sun et al 2005 its subsystems include the action centered subsystem the non action centered subsystem the motivational subsystem and the meta cognitive subsystem the role of the action centered subsystem is to control both external and internal actions the implicit layer is made of neural networks called action neural networks while the explicit layer is made up of action rules there can be synergy between the two layers for example learning a skill can be expedited when the agent has to make explicit rules for the procedure at hand it has been argued that implicit knowledge alone cannot optimize as well as the combination of both explicit and implicit the role of the non action centered subsystem is to maintain general knowledge the implicit layer is made of associative neural networks while the bottom layer is associative rules

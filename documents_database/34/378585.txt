it is set over the course of about one week in 1945 in a joseph stalin era soviet prison camp as in many of solzhenitsyn s works the author paints a vivid and honest picture of the suffering prisoners and their incompetent but powerful wardens most of the prisoners depicted in the play are serving 10 year sentences for violations of soviet penal code article 58 in this play the author first explores the analogy of the camp system to a separate nation within the soviet union an analogy which would dominate his later work most clearly in the gulag archipelago the play has a fairly large cast of characters mostly prisoners at the camp the play has many difficult staging and set directions truckloads of prisoners arrive onstage characters appear onstage pouring and spilling molten iron in a camp foundry and one scene calls for a three story building in the foreground of the set with layered barbed wire and bare steppe stretching into the background as far as the eye can see with an excavator operating in the distance despite this the play has been performed in public many times making its american premiere at the guthrie theater

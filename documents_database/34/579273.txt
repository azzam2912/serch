it is seen nearly edge on ngc 4216 is one of the largest and brightest spiral galaxies of the virgo cluster with an absolute magnitude that has been estimated to be 22 i e brighter than the andromeda galaxy and like most spiral galaxies of this cluster shows a deficiency of neutral hydrogen that s concentrated within the galaxy s optical disk and has a low surface density for a galaxy of its type this explains why ngc 4216 is considered an anemic galaxy by some authors also with a low star formation activity for a galaxy of its type in fact the galaxy s disk shows pillar like structures that may have been caused by interactions with the intracluster medium of virgo and or with nearby galaxies in ngc 4216 s halo besides a rich system of globular clusters with a number of them estimated in around 700 nearly five times more than the milky way two stellar streams that are interpreted as two satellite galaxies being disrupted and absorbed by this galaxy are present ngc 4216 seems to be in a place of the virgo cluster where dwarf galaxies are being destroyed accreted at a high rate with

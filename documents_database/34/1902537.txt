between the surface of a neutron star and the quark gluon plasma at the core at matter densities of 10 g cm nuclear attraction and coulomb repulsion forces are of similar magnitude the competition between the forces leads to the formation of a variety of complex structures assembled from neutrons and protons astrophysicists call these types of structures nuclear pasta because the geometry of the structures resembles various types of pasta neutron stars form as remnants of massive stars after a supernova event unlike their progenitor star neutron stars do not consist of a gaseous plasma rather the intense gravitational attraction of the compact mass overcomes the electron degeneracy pressure and causes electron capture to occur within the star the result is a compact ball of nearly pure neutron matter with sparse protons and electrons in between in a space several thousand times smaller than the progenitor star at the surface the pressure is low enough that conventional nuclei such as helium and iron can exist independently of one another and are not crushed together due to the mutual coulomb repulsion of their nuclei at the core the pressure is so great that this coulomb repulsion cannot support individual nuclei

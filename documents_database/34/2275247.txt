the mud volcano is accessible via a foot track mud volcanoes are landforms where water and gas are extruded from the ground in southeastern iran they occur in two places one close to volcanoes such as bazman and taftan and are hot effusions the other is colder and linked to the extrusion of carbon dioxide and tectonic sedimentary processes several theories have been proposed to explain cold mud volcanoes one of which posits that water in clay is trapped and thus pressurized causing the clay to liquefy and erupt on the surface along faults despite its location close to the two aforementioned volcanoes pirgel is considered to be a cold mud volcano with temperatures of pirgel contains a main cone with an elevation of above sea level and above the terrain this makes it a relatively high mud volcano the highest in iran there are eleven individual craters of which seven are active but they are all relatively small the mud volcano covers an area of on a marl hill also a relatively large size erosion from flowing water has affected both the surroundings as well as the mud volcano itself forming gullies and ravines probably from the collapse of

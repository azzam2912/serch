it makes only two cuts so each partner receives a single connected piece its main advantage over the earlier stromquist moving knives procedure and the later barbanel brams moving knives procedure is that it requires only a single moving knife this advantage uses the two dimensional nature of the cake initially each partner makes a vertical cut such that the cake to its left is worth for him exactly 1 3 the leftmost cut is selected suppose this cut belongs to alice so alice receives the leftmost piece and her value is exactly 1 3 the remainder has to be divided between the remaining partners bob and carl note that alice s part is worth at most 1 3 and the remainder is worth at least 2 3 for bob and carl so if bob and carl each receive at least half of the remainder they do not envy the challenge is to make sure alice won t envy any of them the solution is based on the following observation for each angle formula 1 alice can put a knife in angle formula 2 and cut the remainder to two halves equal in her eyes this means that alice can

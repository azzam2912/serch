this affects the aerodynamics of many forms of transport moving non parallel to the wind s direction creates a crosswind component on the object and thus increasing the apparent wind on the object such use of cross wind travel is used to advantage by sailing craft kiteboarding craft power kiting etc on the other side crosswind moves the path of vehicles sideways and can be a hazard when winds are not parallel to or directly with against the line of travel the wind is said to have a crosswind component that is the force can be separated into two vector components a vehicle behaves as though it is directly experiencing a lateral effect of the magnitude of the crosswind component only the crosswind component is computed by multiplying the wind speed by the sine of the angle between the wind and the direction of travel while the headwind component is computed in the same manner using cosine instead of sine for example a 10 knot wind coming at 45 degrees from either side will have a crosswind component of 10 knots sin 45 and a head tailwind component of 10 knots cos 45 both equals to 7 07 knots to

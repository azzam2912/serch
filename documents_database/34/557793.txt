a shielding gas is sometimes used but pressure is not applied a major difference between egw and its cousin electroslag welding is that the arc in egw is not extinguished instead remains struck throughout the welding process it is used to make square groove welds for butt and t joints especially in the shipbuilding industry and in the construction of storage tanks in egw the heat of the welding arc causes the electrode and workpieces to melt and flow into the cavity between the parts being welded this molten metal solidifies from the bottom up joining the parts being welded together the weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by a separate shielding gas or by the gas produced by the disintegration of a flux cored electrode wire the electrode is guided into the weld area by either a consumable electrode guide tube like the one used in electroslag welding or a moving head when the consumable guide tube is used the weld pool is composed of molten metal coming from the parts being welded the electrode and the guide tube the moving head variation uses an assembly of an electrode guide tube which travels upwards as the weld is

it was recorded on photographic survey plates as a faint variable star between photographic magnitude m 9 to 16 6 from 1889 to 1944 in late 1944 the star began to brighten increasing by about 7 magnitudes from m 14 to brighter than 8 brightening continued with a diminished rate of increase after early 1945 but the overall outburst was not noted until the star was seen at about 6 0 the threshold of naked eye brightness in july 1948 at that time it was given the designation nova telescopii 1948 since mid 1949 it has declined in brightness slowly albeit accompanied by some remarkable changes in its spectrum and as of august 2013 it had faded to visual magnitude around 12 rr telescopii was periodically observed in a survey program by the southern station of harvard college observatory starting in 1889 as well as other southern observatories begun at later dates williamina fleming in 1908 reported variations in brightness between about magnitude 9 and 11 5 and suggested it might be the same type of star as ss cygni in later plates it showed modest irregular variability between m 12 5 and 14 up to about 1930 at that

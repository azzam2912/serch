it is a nonlinear sigma model with the principal homogeneous space of the lie group su n as its target manifold where n is the number of quark flavors the riemannian metric of the target manifold is given by a positive constant multiplied by the killing form acting upon the maurer cartan form of su n the internal global symmetry of this model is su n su n the left and right copies respectively where the left copy acts as the left action upon the target space and the right copy acts as the right action the left copy represents flavor rotations among the left handed quarks while the right copy describes rotations among the right handed quarks while these l and r are completely independent of each other the axial pieces of these symmetries are spontaneously broken so that the corresponding scalar fields are the requisite nambu goldstone bosons this model admits topological solitons called skyrmions departures from exact chiral symmetry are dealt with in chiral perturbation theory the chiral model of g rsey 1960 also see gell mann and l vy is now appreciated to be an effective theory of qcd with two light quarks u and d

then f p is a probability space with sample space event space f and probability measure p an alternative approach to formalising probability favoured by some bayesians is given by cox s theorem the probability of an event is a non negative real number where formula 3 is the event space it follows that formula 1 is always finite in contrast with more general measure theory theories which assign negative probability relax the first axiom this is the assumption of unit measure that the probability that at least one of the elementary events in the entire sample space will occur is 1 this is the assumption of additivity some authors consider merely finitely additive probability spaces in which case one just needs an algebra of sets rather than a algebra quasiprobability distributions in general relax the third axiom from the kolmogorov axioms one can deduce other useful rules for calculating probabilities in some cases formula 9 is not the only event with probability 0 if a is a subset of or equal to b then the probability of a is less than or equal to the probability of b it immediately follows from the monotonicity property that the proofs of

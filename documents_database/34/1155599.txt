recently linguists such as malcolm ross and andrew pawley have built large lexicons for proto oceanic and proto polynesian proto austronesian is reconstructed by constructing sets of correspondences among consonants in the various austronesian languages according to the comparative method although in theory the result should be unambiguous in practice given the large number of languages there are numerous disagreements with various scholars differing significantly on the number and nature of the phonemes in proto austronesian in the past some disagreements concerned whether certain correspondence sets were real or represent sporadic developments in particular languages for the currently remaining disagreements however scholars generally accept the validity of the correspondence sets but disagree on the extent to which the distinctions in these sets can be projected back to proto austronesian or represent innovations in particular sets of daughter languages below are proto austronesian phonemes reconstructed by robert blust a professor of linguistics at the university of hawaii at manoa a total of 25 proto austronesian consonants 4 vowels and 4 diphthongs were reconstructed however blust acknowledges that some of the reconstructed consonants are still controversial and debated the symbols below are frequently used in reconstructed proto austronesian words d only appears

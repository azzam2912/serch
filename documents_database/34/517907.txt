it was designed under the leadership of sergei alekseevich gavrilov the tumansky r 25 was designed as a replacement for tumansky r 13 in mig 21 fighters r 25 is a two spool axial flow turbojet featuring a new compressor with increased overall pressure ratio and airflow variable two stage afterburner and greater use of titanium the r 25 jet engine s specialty was the addition of a second fuel pump in the afterburning stage activating the rus emergency mode booster feature allows the engine to develop of thrust under of altitude the limit of operation is 1 minute for dogfight practice and 3 minutes for an actual wartime emergency as further use causes the engine to overheat and potentially explode use of csr requires engine take out inspection upon landing and every minute of its use counts as one full hour of engine runtime on the logbook this further shortens the already limited cycle time of soviet made engines between industrial level overhauls and adds great cost but the extreme thrust of csr allowed the mig 21bis to reach a better than 1 1 thrust to weight ratio for dogfight and theoretically outclimb the f 16 the r 25

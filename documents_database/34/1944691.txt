the rapid growth in the multidimensionality and throughput of flow cytometry data particularly in the 2000s has led to the creation of a variety of computational analysis methods data standards and public databases for the sharing of results computational methods exist to assist in the preprocessing of flow cytometry data identifying cell populations within it matching those cell populations across samples and performing diagnosis and discovery using the results of previous steps for preprocessing this includes compensating for spectral overlap transforming data onto scales conducive to visualization and analysis assessing data for quality and normalizing data across samples and experiments for population identification tools are available to aid traditional manual identification of populations in two dimensional scatter plots gating to use dimensionality reduction to aid gating and to find populations automatically in higher dimensional space in a variety of ways it is also possible to characterize data in more comprehensive ways such as the density guided binary space partitioning technique known as probability binning or by combinatorial gating finally diagnosis using flow cytometry data can be aided by supervised learning techniques and discovery of new cell types of biological importance by high throughput statistical methods as part of pipelines incorporating

as currently circumscribed the group includes six species all native to southern australasia four of these are endemic to tasmania and the other two endemic to new zealand it does not contain any economically important taxa but due to their attractive small tubular flowers reticulate leaf venation and limited distribution the shrubs have a long history of being admired by australasian naturalists archeria can be found scattered throughout south west north and central tasmania but is largely absent from the east in new zealand the distribution is highly disjunct with a racemosa being found only in the northern north island and a traversii being scattered locally throughout the south island and stewart island like most ericads archeria species are largely found on acidic soils they grow at lowland to montane altitudes although a comberi and a hirtella reach the sub alpine in parts of their range five of the six species are found rather locally throughout shrublands and forests while a comberi is found in heaths sedgelands and wetlands habit the six species of archeria are all self supporting shrubs with dark coloured bark leaves they have simple alternately arranged glabrous leaves with margins that are entire or serrulate the

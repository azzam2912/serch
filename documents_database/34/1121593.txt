other names in common use include common abbreviations include fps fds fpps and fdps the structure and mechanism of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase fpps a type of geranyltranstransferase is well characterized fpps is a 30 kda mg dependent homodimeric enzyme that synthesizes e e farnesyl pyrophosphate in a successive manner from two equivalents of isopentenyl pyrophosphate ipp and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate dmapp fpps adopts a 3 layered helical fold characteristic of many prenyltransferases with 11 helices and flexible loops in between the centrally located helices 4 and 8 contain conserved aspartate motifs ddxxd that participate in substrate binding and catalysis motif aspartate residues water oxygens and pyrophosphate coordinate three mgin an octahedral manner the trinuclear mg complex is critical for binding dmapp and stabilizing the pyrophosphate leaving group while the growing hydrocarbon tail wedges into a deep hydrophobic pocket site directed mutagenesis studies have shown that the ultimate length of the isoprenoid product is determined by bulky residues often phenyalanine at the hydrophobic pocket s base from crystal structures and kinetic assays it is believed that fpps catalyzes the condensation reaction in three concerted steps 1 ionization 2 condensation and 3 elimination in the first step three mgstabilize the anionic leaving group

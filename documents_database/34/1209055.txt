c3a is a 77 residue anaphylatoxin that binds to the c3a receptor c3ar a class a g protein coupled receptor it plays a large role in the immune response c3a molecules induce responses through the gpcr c3a receptor like other anaphylatoxins c3a is regulated by cleavage of its carboxy terminal arginine which results in a molecule with lowered inflammatory function c3a desarginine c3a is an effector of the complement system with a range of functions including t cell activation and survival angiogenesis stimulation chemotaxis mast cell degranulation and macrophage activation it has been shown to have both proinflammatory and anti inflammatory responses its activity able to counteract the proinflammatory effects of c5a c3a is a strongly basic and highly cationic 77 residue protein with a molecular mass of approximately 10 kda residues 17 66 are made up of three anti parallel helices and three disulfide bonds which confer stability to the protein the n terminus consists of a fourth flexible helical structure while the c terminus is disordered c3a has a regulatory process and a structure homologous to complement component c5a with which it shares 36 of its sequence identity c3a induces an immunological response through a 482 residue g

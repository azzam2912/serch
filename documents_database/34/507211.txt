it can be defined over either real or p adic numbers the construction covers more generally the case of an arbitrary local or finite field and even the ring of adeles the metaplectic group has a particularly significant infinite dimensional linear representation the weil representation it was used by andr weil to give a representation theoretic interpretation of theta functions and is important in the theory of modular forms of half integral weight and the theta correspondence the fundamental group of the symplectic lie group sp r is infinite cyclic so it has a unique connected double cover which is denoted mp r and called the metaplectic group the metaplectic group mp r is not a matrix group it has no faithful finite dimensional representations therefore the question of its explicit realization is nontrivial it has faithful irreducible infinite dimensional representations such as the weil representation described below it can be proved that if f is any local field other than c then the symplectic group sp f admits a unique perfect central extension with the kernel z 2z the cyclic group of order 2 which is called the metaplectic group over f it serves as an algebraic replacement of

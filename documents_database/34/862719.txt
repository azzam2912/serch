in 2003 it merged with the real time application interface rtai project to produce a production grade real time free software platform for linux called rtai fusion on top of xenomai s abstract real time operating system rtos core eventually the rtai fusion effort became independent from rtai in 2005 as the xenomai project xenomai is based on an abstract rtos core usable for building any kind of real time interface over a nucleus which exports a set of generic rtos services any number of rtos personalities called skins can then be built over the nucleus providing their own specific interface to the applications by using the services of a single generic core to implement it there is a long list of differences between xenomai and rtai though both projects share a few ideas and support the rtdm layer the major differences derive from the goals the projects aim for and from their respective implementation while rtai is focused on lowest technically feasible latencies xenomai also considers clean extensibility rtos skins portability and maintainability as very important goals xenomai s path towards ingo moln r s preempt rt support is another major difference compared to rtai s objectives

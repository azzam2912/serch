carrier generation and recombination processes are fundamental to the operation of many optoelectronic semiconductor devices such as photodiodes light emitting diodes and laser diodes they are also critical to a full analysis of p n junction devices such as bipolar junction transistors and p n junction diodes the electron hole pair is the fundamental unit of generation and recombination in inorganic semiconductors corresponding to an electron transitioning between the valence band and the conduction band where generation of electron is a transition from the valence band to the conduction band and recombination leads to a reverse transition like other solids semiconductor materials have an electronic band structure determined by the crystal properties of the material energy distribution among electrons is described by the fermi level and the temperature of the electrons at absolute zero temperature all of the electrons have energy below the fermi level but at non zero temperatures the energy levels are filled following a boltzmann distribution in undoped semiconductors the fermi level lies in the middle of a forbidden band or band gap between two allowed bands called the valence band and the conduction band the valence band immediately below the forbidden band is normally very nearly

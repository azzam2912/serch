these pore diameters are similar in size to small molecules and thus large molecules cannot enter or be adsorbed while smaller molecules can as a mixture of molecules migrate through the stationary bed of porous semi solid substance referred to as a sieve or matrix the components of highest molecular weight which are unable to pass into the molecular pores leave the bed first followed by successively smaller molecules some molecular sieves are used in chromatography a separation technique that sorts molecules based on their size other molecular sieves are used as desiccants some examples include activated charcoal and silica gel the diameter of a molecular sieve is measured in ngstr ms or nanometres nm according to iupac notation microporous materials have pore diameters of less than 2 nm 20 and macroporous materials have pore diameters of greater than 50 nm 500 the mesoporous category thus lies in the middle with pore diameters between 2 and 50 nm 20 500 molecular sieves can be microporous mesoporous or macroporous material molecular sieves are often utilized in the petroleum industry especially for drying gas streams for example in the liquid natural gas lng industry the water content of the gas needs to

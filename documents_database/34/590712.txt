it is where the paths from eskdale borrowdale langdale and wasdale all meet esk hause is a first step to reaching higher summits such as scafell pike great end esk pike and allen crags which are all nearby this can be a confusing place for walkers especially in mist this is because two paths cross at right angles on a tilted grass plateau but not at the summit of the plateau the popular great langdale wasdale path crosses at the height of 2386ft at the wall shelter this is the lower of the two passes known as esk hause but is in fact not the true pass which is 100ft higher and 300 yards distant a less used pass between eskdale and borrowdale that occupies the depression between great end 2984ft and esk pike 2903ft the true esk hause is the highest pass in the lake district 70ft higher than sticks pass which crosses the helvellyn range near stybarrow dodd but sticks pass is commonly named as lakeland s highest pass most probably because fellwalkers equate esk hause with the lower of the two passes the source of the river esk is close to esk hause

it is found in the palearctic the imagines occur everywhere where remnants of carrion can be found the species prefers dry bones fur with meat remnants or dried carrion as well as dry fish it is not infrequent to find them feeding on leather smoked meat and bacon the beetle is also regularly found in forensic studies of older bodies in studies in switzerland the imagines appeared during the fourth stage of the body decomposition ammoniacal decay and were to be found until the carcasses had dried completely this corresponds to a period of five to nine months after death so the presence of the beetle on a carcass usually has little significance for forensic entomology a period of 25 to 35 days is assumed for the development period of the beetle larvae in contrast to necrobia rufipes the larvae do not eat the carrion but feed on insect larvae that develop in the carcass and in fleshy products they are therefore useful and can not be classified as pests according to other observations they have the same food preferences as the fly piophila casei and can also feed on the decomposition products of animal tissues themselves in laboratory tests

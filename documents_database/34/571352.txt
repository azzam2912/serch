it can be used as a stand alone pump a hydraulic motor or an automotive air conditioning compressor an axial piston pump has a number of pistons usually an odd number arranged in a circular array within a housing which is commonly referred to as a cylinder block rotor or barrel this cylinder block is driven to rotate about its axis of symmetry by an integral shaft that is more or less aligned with the pumping pistons usually parallel but not necessarily designers have a number of problems to overcome in designing axial piston pumps one is managing to be able to manufacture a pump with the fine tolerances necessary for efficient operation the mating faces between the rotary piston cylinder assembly and the stationary pump body have to be almost a perfect seal while the rotary part turns at perhaps 3000 rpm the pistons are usually less than half an inch 13 mm in diameter with similar stroke lengths keeping the wall to piston seal tight means that very small clearances are involved and that materials have to be closely matched for similar coefficient of expansion the pistons have to be drawn outwards in their cylinder by some means

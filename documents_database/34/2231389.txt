it is one of four large astrophysics space mission concepts being studied in preparation for the national academy of sciences 2020 astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey while luvoir is a concept for a general purpose observatory it has the key science goal of characterizing a wide range of exoplanets including those that might be habitable an additional goal is to enable a broad range of astrophysics from the reionization epoch through galaxy formation and evolution to star and planet formation powerful imaging and spectroscopy observations of solar system bodies would also be possible luvoir would be a large strategic science mission and will be considered for a development start sometime after 2020 the luvoir team has produced designs for two variants of luvoir one with a 15 m diameter telescope mirror luvoir a and one with an 8 m diameter mirror luvoir b luvoir can observe ultraviolet visible and near infrared wavelengths of light the final report on the 3 5 year luvoir mission concept study was publicly released on august 26 2019 in 2016 nasa began considering four different space telescope concepts for future large strategic science missions they are the habitable exoplanet imaging mission habex large uv optical

as a subcategory or field of digital signal processing digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing it allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build up of noise and signal distortion during processing since images are defined over two dimensions perhaps more digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems many of the techniques of digital image processing or digital picture processing as it often was called were developed in the 1960s at the jet propulsion laboratory massachusetts institute of technology bell laboratories university of maryland and a few other research facilities with application to satellite imagery wire photo standards conversion medical imaging videophone character recognition and photograph enhancement the purpose of early image processing was to improve the quality of the image it was aimed at human beings to improve the visual effect of people in image processing the input is a low quality image and the out put is an image with improved quality common image processing include image enhancement restoration encoding and compression the first successful application was the american jet propulsion laboratory jpl they used

in general bow tie architectures refer to ordered and recurrent structures that often underlie complex technological or biological systems and that are capable of conferring them a balance among efficiency robustness and evolvability in other words bow ties are able to take into account a great diversity of inputs fanning in to the knot showing a much smaller diversity in the protocols and processes the knot able to elaborate these inputs and finally an extremely heterogeneous diversity of outputs fanning out of the bowtie these architectures thus manage a wide range of inputs through a core knot constituted by a limited number of elements in such structures inputs are conveyed into a sort of funnel towards a synthesis core where they can be duly organized processed and managed by means of protocols and from where in turn a variety of outputs or responses is propagated according to csete and doyle bow ties are able to optimally organize fluxes of mass energy signals in an overall structure that forcedly deals with a highly fluctuating and sloppy environment in a biological perspective a bow tie manages a large fan in of stimuli input it accounts for a compressed core and it expresses

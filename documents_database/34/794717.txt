acoustic tags are commonly used to monitor the behavior of fish studies can be conducted in lakes rivers tributaries estuaries or at sea acoustic tag technology allows researchers to obtain locational data of tagged fish depending on tag and receiver array configurations researchers can receive simple presence absence data 2d positional data or even 3d fish tracks in real time with sub meter resolution acoustic tags allow researchers to acoustic tags transmit a signal made up of acoustic pulses or pings that sends location information about the tagged organism to the hydrophone receiver by tying the received acoustic signature to the known type of programmed signal code the specific tagged individual is identified the transmitted signal can propagate up to 1 km in freshwater receivers can be actively held by a researcher active tracking or affixed to specific locations passive tracking arrays of receivers can allow the triangulation of tagged individuals over many kilometers acoustic tags can have very long battery life some tags last up to four years acoustic tags are produced in many different shapes and sizes depending on the type of species being studied or the type of environment in which the study is conducted sound parameters

the magnetic moment also called magnetic dipole moment is a measure of the strength of a magnetic source the dirac magnetic moment corresponding to tree level feynman diagrams which can be thought of as the classical result can be calculated from the dirac equation it is usually expressed in terms of the g factor the dirac equation predicts formula 1 for particles such as the electron this classical result differs from the observed value by a small fraction of a percent the difference is the anomalous magnetic moment denoted formula 2 and defined as the one loop contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment corresponding to the first and largest quantum mechanical correction of the electron is found by calculating the vertex function shown in the adjacent diagram the calculation is relatively straightforward and the one loop result is where is the fine structure constant this result was first found by julian schwinger in 1948 and is engraved on his tombstone as of 2016 the coefficients of the qed formula for the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron are known analytically up to and have been calculated up to order the qed prediction agrees with the experimentally measured value to more

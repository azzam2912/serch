the case is also shortened by about 4 mm to fit a standard length rifle action it was developed as an evolution of jeff cooper s super scout medium rifle concept which was in turn an extension of his original scout rifle concept cooper used a version of steyr s scout rifle chambered in 350 remington magnum to hunt large and dangerous game originally calling it a super scout after taking a lion at close range with the weapon he switched to calling that rifle his lion scout an additional motivation for development of the new cartridge was that authorities in certain areas of the world dictate a minimum caliber of round which may be used in hunting dangerous game such as cape buffalo and lion in general the minimum is either 366 or 375 caliber so to make the cartridge accepted in almost all african countries the newly designed cartridge uses a 375 caliber bore when steyr initially discussed the new round with cooper they intended to call it the 375 steyr cooper said they should instead call it a 376 to avoid confusion with the 375 h h magnum cooper subsequently referred to the scout rifle in 376

a mechanical ascender employs a cam which allows the device to slide freely in the intended direction of movement but provide a firm grip on the rope when pulled in the opposite direction to prevent an ascender from accidentally coming off the rope a locking mechanism or trigger is deployed the ascender is first attached to the climber s harness by a piece of webbing or sling and then is clipped onto the rope and locked on ascenders are usually used in pairs so that one is free to be slid up the rope whilst the other bears the weight of the climber the ascender which has just been slid upwards is then made to take the climbers load so locking him to the rope and freeing the other one so it too can then be slid upwards too the process is then repeated to ascend the rope for climbing on with a fixed rope attached for security for example to snow anchors on a steep slope only one ascender is used keeping the other hand free for holding an ice axe ascenders are not typically used on free climbing routes where a climber uses his or her hands and

this scheme can be performed in simple optical molasses or in molasses where an optical lattice has been superimposed which are called respectively free space raman cooling and raman side band cooling both techniques make use of raman scattering of laser light by the atoms the transition between two hyperfine states of the atom can be triggered by two laser beams the first beam excites the atom to a virtual excited state for example because its frequency is lower than the real transition frequency and the second beam deexcites the atom to the other hyperfine level the frequency difference of the two beams is exactly equal to the transition frequency between the two hyperfine levels the illustration of this process is shown in the schematic illustration of a two photon raman process it enables the transition between the two levels formula 1 and formula 2 the intermediate virtual level is represented by the dashed line and is red detuned with respect to the real excited level formula 3 the frequency difference formula 4 here matches exactly the energy difference between formula 1 and formula 2 in this scheme a pre cooled cloud of atoms whose temperature is of a few

the car can be powered solely by air or combined as in a hybrid electric vehicle with gasoline diesel ethanol or an electric plant with regenerative braking compressed air cars are powered by motors driven by compressed air which is stored in a tank at high pressure such as 31 mpa 4500 psi or 310 bar rather than driving engine pistons with an ignited fuel air mixture compressed air cars use the expansion of compressed air in a similar manner to the expansion of steam in a steam engine there have been prototype cars since the 1920s with compressed air used in torpedo propulsion in contrast to hydrogen s issues of damage and danger involved in high impact crashes air on its own is non flammable it was reported on seven network s beyond tomorrow that on its own carbon fiber is brittle and can split under sufficient stress but creates no shrapnel when it does so carbon fiber tanks safely hold air at a pressure somewhere around 31 mpa making them comparable to steel tanks the cars are designed to be filled up at a high pressure pump in compressed air vehicles tank designs tend to be isothermal a

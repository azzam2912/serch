studies were carried out in 2008 and construction began in december 2010 it is expected to last 6 years as of april 2017 the dam is completed the pumped storage power plant will operate by using two reservoirs to generate power an upper and a lower during periods of high energy demand water is released from the upper reservoir and sent to the power station to generate electricity after power generation the water is discharged into the lower reservoir when energy demand is low such as at night water is pumped back up to the upper reservoir as stored energy the process repeats as needed and the pump generators serve the dual role of both pumping and generating electricity forming the lower reservoir will be a tall and long concrete face rock fill dam cfrd its storage capacity will be of which is active or usable for pumping the upper reservoir will be formed by a cfrd as well this one will be tall and long withholding a man made lake the normal elevation of the lower reservoir will be and the upper this difference in elevation affords a rated hydraulic head of the power station will be located underground

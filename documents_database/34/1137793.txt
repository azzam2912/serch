despite that single s success clark proceeded to record her next album without hatch s involvement again working with burke except for the track the cat in the window the bird in the sky which was released as an advance single in august 1967 the cat in the window the bird in the sky at 26 became clark s lowest charting us single to that date and missed the uk top 50 entirely causing clark to reunite with hatch for a track to be added to her album as the title track and to serve as a second advance single this track the other man s grass is always greener which hatch says contains a lot of deep thought and a lot of philosophy clark enjoyed singing those kind of songs was musically similar to don t sleep in the subway but failed to approach that hit s success reaching only 31 on the hot 100 in billboard for the last week of december 1967 and the first week of january 1968 the song did best on the easy listening chart where it reached a peak of number three in the uk the other man s grass is always greener

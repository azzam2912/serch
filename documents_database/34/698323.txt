it is faster but less accurate than dead end elimination and is generally used in situations where the protein of interest is too large for the problem to be tractable by dee like dead end elimination the scmf method explores conformational space by discretizing the dihedral angles of each side chain into a set of rotamers for each position in the protein sequence the method iteratively develops a probabilistic description of the relative population of each possible rotamer at each position and the probability of a given structure is defined as a function of the probabilities of its individual rotamer components the basic requirements for an effective scmf implementation are the process is generally initialized with a uniform probability distribution over the rotamers that is if there are formula 1 rotamers at the formula 2 position in the protein then the probability of any individual rotamer formula 3 is formula 4 the conversion between energies and probabilities is generally accomplished via the boltzmann distribution which introduces a temperature factor thus making the method amenable to simulated annealing lower temperatures increase the likelihood of converging to a single solution rather than to a small subpopulation of solutions the energy of an

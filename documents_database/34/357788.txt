alternative names for invertase include saccharase glucosucrase beta h fructosidase beta fructosidase invertin sucrase maxinvert l 1000 fructosylinvertase alkaline invertase acid invertase and the systematic name beta fructofuranosidase the resulting mixture of fructose and glucose is called inverted sugar syrup related to invertases are sucrases invertases and sucrases hydrolyze sucrose to give the same mixture of glucose and fructose invertases cleave the o c fructose bond whereas the sucrases cleave the o c glucose bond for industrial use invertase is usually derived from yeast it is also synthesized by bees which use it to make honey from nectar optimal temperature at which the rate of reaction is at its greatest is 60 c and an optimum ph of 4 5 typically sugar is inverted with sulfuric acid invertase is expensive so it may be preferable to make fructose from glucose using glucose isomerase instead chocolate covered cherries other cordials and fondant candies include invertase which liquefies the sugar once the candy is manufactured it needs at least a few days to a few weeks in storage so the invertase has time to break down the sucrose urea acts as a non competitive inhibitor of invertase presumably by breaking the intramolecular

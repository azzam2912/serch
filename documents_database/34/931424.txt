this is used on point to point links within broadcasting networks including studio transmitter links stl it is not used for broadcasts to the public the technique was first developed by the bbc in the late 1960s in 1966 the corporation s research department made a feasibility study of the use of pulse code modulation pcm for transmitting television sound during the synchronising period of the video signal this had several advantages it removed the necessity for a separate sound link and offered improved sound quality and reliability sound in syncs and its r d engineers have won several awards including in the original system as applied to 625 line analogue tv the audio signal was sampled twice during each television line and each sample converted to 10 bit pcm two such samples were inserted into the next line synchronising pulse at the destination the audio samples were converted back to analogue form and the video waveform restored to normal compandors operating on the signal before encoding and after decoding enabled the required signal to noise ratio to be achieved as the pcm noise was predominantly high pitched the compandor only needed to operate on the high frequencies also the

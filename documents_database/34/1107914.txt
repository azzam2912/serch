the name is derived from p b fellgett who first made the observation as part of his phd when measuring a signal whose noise is dominated by detector noise a multiplexed measurement such as the signal generated by a fourier transform spectrometer can produce a relative improvement in signal to noise ratio snr compared to an equivalent scanning monochromator of the order of the square root of m where m is the number of sample points comprising the spectrum sellar and boreman have argued that this snr improvement can be considered as a result of freedom from needing an exit slit inside the spectrometer since an exit slit reduces the light collected by the detector by the same factor there is an additional multiplex advantage for emission lines of atomic and molecular spectra at the peak of the emission line a monochromator measurement will be noisy since the noise is proportional to the square root of the signal for the same reason the measurement will be less noisy at the baseline of the spectrum in a multiplexed measurement however the noise in a given measurement is spread more or less evenly across the spectrum regardless of the local signal intensity

cognitive walkthrough is task specific whereas heuristic evaluation takes a holistic view to catch problems not caught by this and other usability inspection methods the method is rooted in the notion that users typically prefer to learn a system by using it to accomplish tasks rather than for example studying a manual the method is prized for its ability to generate results quickly with low cost especially when compared to usability testing as well as the ability to apply the method early in the design phases before coding even begins a common trait with usability testing a cognitive walkthrough starts with a task analysis that specifies the sequence of steps or actions required by a user to accomplish a task and the system responses to those actions the designers and developers of the software then walk through the steps as a group asking themselves a set of questions at each step data is gathered during the walkthrough and afterwards a report of potential issues is compiled finally the software is redesigned to address the issues identified the effectiveness of methods such as cognitive walkthroughs is hard to measure in applied settings as there is very limited opportunity for controlled experiments

a linear oscillator circuit which uses an rc network a combination of resistors and capacitors for its frequency selective part is called an rc oscillator rc oscillators are a type of feedback oscillator they consist of an amplifying device a transistor vacuum tube or op amp with some of its output energy fed back into its input through a network of resistors and capacitors an rc network to achieve positive feedback causing it to generate an oscillating sinusoidal voltage they are used to produce lower frequencies mostly audio frequencies in such applications as audio signal generators and electronic musical instruments at radio frequencies another type of feedback oscillator the lc oscillator is used but at frequencies below 100 khz the size of the inductors and capacitors needed for the lc oscillator become cumbersome and rc oscillators are used instead their lack of bulky inductors also makes them easier to integrate into microelectronic devices since the oscillator s frequency is determined by the value of resistors and capacitors which vary with temperature rc oscillators do not have as good frequency stability as crystal oscillators the frequency of oscillation is determined by the barkhausen criterion which says that the circuit will only

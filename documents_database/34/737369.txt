esd commonly also stands for electrostatic discharge as electronic parts like computer central processing units cpus become packed more and more densely with transistors the transistors shrink and become more and more vulnerable to esd common electrostatic sensitive devices include the notion of a symbol for an esd protection device came about in response to the increased usage and failures of static sensitive components by then the computer systems manufacturer sperry univac field repairs to and handling of esd printed circuit boards pcbs were resulting in extremely high failure rates studies of pcb failures indicated that static damage to chips and pcbs were being caused by field service engineers who were often unaware of the need to employ precautionary procedures in handling esd sensitive parts in response to this problem robert f gabriel a systems engineer at sperry univac devised a large number of possible symbols that could be affixed to parts packaging and pcbs to alert the user that the part is esd sensitive gabriel developed a proposal for an esd warning symbol and circulated it to numerous electronics standards groups c everett coon at the eia electronics industry association enthusiastically responded to the concept and coordinated a world

it was in use between 1927 and 1950 and was instrumental in the drag reduction research of early american aeronautics in 1929 naca was awarded its first collier trophy for the naca cowling which was tested and developed using the propeller research tunnel the main purpose of the propeller research tunnel was researching the aerodynamic efficiency of propellers on radial engine aircraft in 1917 william f durand published naca technical report 17 on his work with isolated propellers in stanford university s wind tunnel however these results did not match with the data naca had collected for propellers connected to fuselages additionally little was known about the limitations of propellers propellers had efficiency issues caused by loss of compression at the tips at high speeds in 1923 langley engineer fred weick suggested naca build a wind tunnel with a 20 foot diameter throat capable of speeds up to 100 miles per hour in order to perform full scale propeller tests according to weick british engineers were running tests on scale propellers at the time but were unable to obtain accurate results due to a scaling issue related to the reynolds number in the smaller wind tunnels naca had been using

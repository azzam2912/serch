ordinal utility theory claims that it is only meaningful to ask which option is better than the other but it is meaningless to ask how much better it is or how good it is all of the theory of consumer decision making under conditions of certainty can be and typically is expressed in terms of ordinal utility for example suppose george tells us that i prefer a to b and b to c george s preferences can be represented by a function u such that but the only meaningful message of this function is the order formula 2 the actual numbers are meaningless hence george s preferences can also be represented by the following function v the functions u and v are ordinally equivalent they represent george s preferences equally well ordinal utility contrasts with cardinal utility theory the latter assumes that the differences between preferences are also important in u the difference between a and b is much smaller than between b and c while in v the opposite is true hence u and v are not cardinally equivalent the ordinal utility concept was first introduced by pareto in 1906 suppose the set of all states of the world

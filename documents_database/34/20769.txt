the lyon hypothesis states that in cells with multiple x chromosomes all but one are inactivated during mammalian embryogenesis this happens early in embryonic development at random in mammals except in marsupials and in some extra embryonic tissues of some placental mammals in which the father s x chromosome is always deactivated in humans with more than one x chromosome the number of barr bodies visible at interphase is always one fewer than the total number of x chromosomes for example men with klinefelter syndrome 47 xxy karyotype have a single barr body whereas women with a 47 xxx karyotype have two barr bodies barr bodies can be seen in the nucleus of neutrophils at the rim of the nucleus in female somatic cells between divisions a genotypical human female has only one barr body per somatic cell while a genotypical human male has none mammalian x chromosome inactivation is initiated from the x inactivation centre or xic usually found near the centromere the center contains twelve genes seven of which code for proteins five for untranslated rnas of which only two are known to play an active role in the x inactivation process xist and tsix the centre also

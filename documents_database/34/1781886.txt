this enzyme can not be differentiated from its members distinctly since there are more features that this enzyme shares with its family members than features that it possess alone the research on the question of how new functions arrive in proteins in evolution led the scientists to find an uncommon consequence for a usual biological event called gene conversion in the case of the ribonuclease rnase protein family the most well known member of this family rnase a also called pancreatic rnase is expressed in the pancreas of oxen it serves to digest rna in intestine and evolved from bacteria fermenting in the stomach of the first ox the homologous rnase called seminal rnase differs from rnase a by 23 amino acids and is expressed in seminal plasma in the concentration of 1 1 5 mg ml which constitutes more than 3 of the fluid protein content bovine seminal ribonuclease bs rnase is a homologue of rnase a with specific antitumor activity the physiological role of this enzyme is not yet found and thus it is still a mystery why the seminal fluid in bovine has such a higher concentration of this enzyme in the evolutionary process it has acquired

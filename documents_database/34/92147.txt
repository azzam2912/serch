basically the configuration consists of two sensors observing the item one of the sensors is typically a digital camera device and the other one can also be a camera or a light projector the projection centers of the sensors and the considered point on the object s surface define a spatial triangle within this triangle the distance between the sensors is the base b and must be known by determining the angles between the projection rays of the sensors and the basis the intersection point and thus the 3d coordinate is calculated from the triangular relations triangulation today is used for many purposes including surveying navigation metrology astrometry binocular vision model rocketry and gun direction of weapons the use of triangles to estimate distances dates to antiquity in the 6th century bc about 250 years prior to the establishment of the ptolemaic dynasty the greek philosopher thales is recorded as using similar triangles to estimate the height of the pyramids of ancient egypt he measured the length of the pyramids shadows and that of his own at the same moment and compared the ratios to his height intercept theorem thales also estimated the distances to ships at sea as seen

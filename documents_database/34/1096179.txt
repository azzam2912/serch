he is an expert in the field of evolutionary and comparative genomics caetano anolles obtained his doctorate in biochemistry at the national university of la plata in argentina in 1986 during his early career at ohio state university and the university of tennessee he studied the symbiosis between nitrogen fixing root nodule forming bacteria and legumes from different angles exploring the role of bacterial attachment and chemotaxis and plant systemic signals that control nodule number while in tennessee he co invented the technique of dna amplification with arbitrary primers see dna amplification fingerprinting daf and randomly amplified polymorphic dna rapd this technique generates fingerprints of nucleic acids and molecular markers useful for genome mapping and molecular ecology and evolution he also developed widely used methods for the silver staining of dna that are commercially available he holds several us patents in molecular biology he joined the faculty of the department of biology at the university of oslo in 1998 and directed the laboratory of molecular ecology and evolution since 2003 he is at the university of illinois and is an affiliate of the carl r woese institute for genomic biology he received the emile zuckerkandl prize in molecular evolution in

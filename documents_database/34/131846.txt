in general the operation of exchanging two identical particles may cause a global phase shift but cannot affect observables anyons are generally classified as abelian or non abelian abelian anyons have been detected and play a major role in the fractional quantum hall effect non abelian anyons have not been definitively detected although this is an active area of research in quantum mechanics there can exist indistinguishable particles unlike in classical mechanics where each particle is labeled by a distinct state vector formula 1 and different configurations of the set of formula 1s correspond to different many body states in quantum mechanics the particles are identical such that exchanging the states of two particles i e formula 3 does not lead to a measurably different many body quantum state for example a system with two indistinguishable particles with particle 1 in state and particle 2 in state has state in dirac notation formula 4 now suppose we exchange the states of the two particles then the state of the system would be formula 5 these two states should not have a measurable difference so they should be the same vector up to a phase factor in space of three or

most endemic species to the british isles are considered to be subspecies of a larger species with mutations or adaptations slightly changing the species in the islands or in certain localities british conservationists often describe this as a wiped clean effect with repeated glaciations forcing many species out of the modern area of the islands to more southern latitudes in europe and perhaps even driving some species extinct some species which were present in britain before past glaciations often during periods with a warmer climate than now failed to return after the last glacial maximum amongst these are rhododendron ponticum and rabbits now considered invasive and non native a species is only deemed native if it reached the british isles without human intervention either intentional or unintentional that means that to be native the species must have reached britain before the land bridge joining britain to the continent was submerged alternatively species can also be native when they have flown or swum to britain as is the case with many bird species which arrived after the submersion of the land bridge a recent example is the collared dove which arrived in the 1950s this also applies for plants which spread

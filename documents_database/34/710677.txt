the iucn notes the importance of re evaluating near threatened taxon at appropriate intervals the rationale used for near threatened taxa usually includes the criteria of vulnerable which are plausible or nearly met such as reduction in numbers or range near threatened species evaluated from 2001 onwards may also be ones which are dependent on conservation efforts to prevent their becoming threatened whereas prior to this conservation dependent species were given a separate category conservation dependent additionally the 402 conservation dependent taxa may also be considered near threatened prior to 2001 the iucn used the version 2 3 categories and criteria to assign conservation status which included a separate category for conservation dependent species conservation dependent lr cd with this category system near threatened and conservation dependent were both subcategories of the category lower risk taxa which were last evaluated prior to 2001 may retain their lr cd or lr nt status although had the category been assigned with the same information today the species would be designated simply near threatened nt in either case

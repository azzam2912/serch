during his more than thirty years at clark he served as a mentor and advisor to hundreds of undergraduate graduate and post doctoral students he was a leading researcher in the field of nmr and polymer physics his research focused on solid state nmr spectroscopy of polymer systems this work was supported for many years through grants from agencies such as the national science foundation petroleum research fund and the army research office he attended colgate university and received his b a in 1966 he earned a ph d in chemistry at the university of wisconsin madison in 1972 and worked at clark after working as a postdoctoral fellow at dartmouth college under walter h stockmayer from 1972 74 at clark jones and fellow professor paul inglefield built a nmr facility at the university and wrote over 100 research papers some of jones ideas led to new ideas for the use of nmr in studying polymer systems such as his highly cited 1977 paper models for spin relaxation in dilute solutions of randomly coiled polymers as a professor at clark dr jones was noted as one of the best professors and he received the institution s outstanding teacher award in

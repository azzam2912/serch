coleoptera insects serve as natural hosts there are currently seven species in this genus including the type species melolontha melolontha entomopoxvirus group dsdna viruses in alphaentomopoxvirus are enveloped with ovoid geometries the diameter is around 250 nm genomes are linear around 260 370kb in length viral replication is cytoplasmic entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral proteins to host glycosaminoglycans gags mediates endocytosis of the virus into the host cell fusion with the plasma membrane to release the core into the host cytoplasm early phase early genes are transcribed in the cytoplasm by viral rna polymerase early expression begins at 30 minutes post infection core is completely uncoated as early expression ends viral genome is now free in the cytoplasm intermediate phase intermediate genes are expressed triggering genomic dna replication at approximately 100 minutes post infection late phase late genes are expressed from 140 min to 48 hours post infection producing all structural proteins assembly of progeny virions starts in cytoplasmic viral factories producing an spherical immature particle this virus particle matures into brick shaped intracellular mature virion imv imv virion can be released upon cell lysis or can acquire a second double membrane from

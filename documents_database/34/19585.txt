the bijective functions from x to x fall into two classes of equal size the even permutations and the odd permutations if any total ordering of x is fixed the parity oddness or evenness of a permutation formula 1 of x can be defined as the parity of the number of inversions for i e of pairs of elements of x such that formula 2 and formula 3 the sign signature or signum of a permutation is denoted sgn and defined as 1 if is even and 1 if is odd the signature defines the alternating character of the symmetric group s another notation for the sign of a permutation is given by the more general levi civita symbol formula 4 which is defined for all maps from x to x and has value zero for non bijective maps the sign of a permutation can be explicitly expressed as where n is the number of inversions in alternatively the sign of a permutation can be defined from its decomposition into the product of transpositions as where is the number of transpositions in the decomposition although such a decomposition is not unique the parity of the number of transpositions in all

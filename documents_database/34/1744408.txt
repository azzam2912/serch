it is developed and distributed directly by the emi project it is the base for other grid middleware distributions used by scientific research communities and distributed computing infrastructures all over the world especially in europe south america and asia emi supports broad scientific experiments and initiatives such as the worldwide lhc computing grid for the large hadron collider the emi middleware is a cooperation among three general purpose grid platforms the advanced resource connector glite and unicore and the dcache storage software the purpose of the emi distribution is to consolidate harmonize and support the original software platforms evolve and extend them redundant or duplicate services resulting from the merging are deprecated in favour of new services added to satisfy user requirements or specific consolidation needs standardizing and developing common interfaces these include the adoption of a common structure for accounting resource information exchange or authentication and authorization input for the development activities is taken from users infrastructures projects standardization initiatives or changing technological innovations the software products will be adapted as necessary to comply with standard open source guidelines to facilitate the integration in mainstream operating system distributions a cooperation with futuregrid a us distributed testbed for clouds grids

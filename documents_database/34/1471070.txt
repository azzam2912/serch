form n sectors of the disk with equal angles by choosing an arbitrary line through p rotating the line times by an angle of radians and slicing the disk on each of the resulting lines number the sectors consecutively in a clockwise or anti clockwise fashion then the pizza theorem states that the pizza theorem is so called because it mimics a traditional pizza slicing technique it shows that if two people share a pizza sliced in this way by taking alternating slices then they each get an equal amount of pizza the pizza theorem was originally proposed as a challenge problem by the published solution to this problem by michael goldberg involved direct manipulation of the algebraic expressions for the areas of the sectors the requirement that the number of sectors be a multiple of four is necessary as don coppersmith showed dividing a disk into four sectors or a number of sectors that is not divisible by four does not in general produce equal areas answered a problem of by providing a more precise version of the theorem that determines which of the two sets of sectors has greater area in the cases that the areas are unequal

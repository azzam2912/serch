the facility had two concentric loops with a covered crescent shaped structure that protected passengers from the sun and rain as they boarded unboarded or waited for their vehicles the inner loop was reserved exclusively for streetcars which entered the inner loop in a counter clockwise direction so their doors opened onto the inner edge of the crescent shaped structure buses and trolleybuses entered the outer loop in a clockwise direction so their doors opened onto the outer edge of the crescent shaped structure passengers could ask for paper transfers when they boarded the first vehicle on their route if they planned to transfer to another vehicle in the same zone a small structure in the center of the loops housed a ticket agent and coffee shop the ttc owned and operated a subsidiary gray coach which ran intercity buses throughout southern ontario tickets for intercity gray couch routes could be purchased there

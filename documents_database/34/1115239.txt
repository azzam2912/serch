it is unique amongst the mini basins in this area in containing a large brine pool of anoxic salt brine the pool is approximately in area and up to deep under depth of gulf water and is derived from dissolution of underlying jurassic age louann salt with a volume of the pool results from the dissolution of about 3 62 billion tonnes of the louann salt bed into seawater the basin owes its shape to ongoing salt tectonics and is surrounded by salt diapirs gas hydrates were detected in a number of cores collected in the orca basin during leg 96 of the deep sea drilling program dsdp the cores were recovered from a water depth of at holes 618 and 618a with first evidence of gas hydrate occurring in hole 618 hydrates were observed in the top section of core 618 4 at 85 fbsf 26 mbsf in gray mud and consisted of a few white crystals of a few millimeters in diameter at hole 618a gas hydrates were observed in both cores 618a 2 and 618 3 in the 62 121 fbsf 19 37 mbsf range with hydrates distributed throughout core 618a 3 the hydrates ranged in size

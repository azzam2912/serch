many methods have been developed to enhance or quench the radiation by adjusting the size changing the structure and adding other materials to the quantum structures by doing these the radiation patterns are regulated which are expected to have the potential to lead to a new class of light sources in this page recent research on zinc oxide zno nanostructures is introduced and the principles of the enhancement and quenching in the structures are discussed the optical properties of zno quantum dots can be controlled by changing of the size as the size of the zno nanocolloids increases the absorbance increases but optical band gap of the nanocolloids decreases the third order optical susceptibility increases with increasing particle size radiation fields are changed by the methods to fabricate the quantum wires micro photoluminescence spectra of an individual suspended as grown zno nanowire and an individual zno nanowire processed by sonication dispersion procedure the thickness of the nanowire tends to change the radiation fields the thickness of the nanowire is also related to the peak wavelength for the nanowire with regular shape shown only slight difference in uv to visible emission ratios was observed for the two parts with different diameters

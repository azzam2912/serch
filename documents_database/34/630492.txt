in the disarticulated bone many of these cells are opened into but when the bones are articulated they are closed in at every part except where they open into the nasal cavity the upper surface of the labyrinth presents a number of half broken cells the walls of which are completed in the articulated skull by the edges of the ethmoidal notch of the frontal bone crossing this surface are two grooves converted into two openings by articulation with the frontal they are the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina and open on the inner wall of the orbit the posterior surface presents large irregular cellular cavities which are closed in by articulation with the sphenoidal concha and orbital process of palatine bone the lateral surface is formed of a thin smooth oblong plate the lamina papyracea os planum which covers in the middle and posterior ethmoidal cells and forms a large part of the medial wall of the orbit it articulates above with the orbital plate of the frontal bone below with the maxilla and orbital process of the palatine in front with the lacrimal and behind with the sphenoid in front of the lamina papyracea are some broken air

triz methodology claims that by studying an individual parameter which is causing a problem e g the weight of an object needs to be reduced and the other parameters which are in conflict with it e g lower weight would require thinner material which is more likely to undergo catastrophic failure if over stressed engineering solutions can be created for invention problems and this is actually the simplification of some fact namely the structured contents of each of the cells within contradiction matrix i e cells fulfilled with ordered principles and identified by their order numbers the principles of inventions have been chosen due to realized necessary statistical extensive studies these were the studies led by g s altshuller based on virtually all known technical solutions up to that time as well as the registered patents in altshuller s opinion every technical problem which has not yet any effective or satisfactory solution nonetheless can be categorized in terms of its main technical contradiction for the analyzed system therefore it could be then analyzed using proper column and row of the contradiction matrix indicated by correctly defined main technical contradiction of the system finally indicating the dedicated and suggested in process

the propeller can be driven directly by a sealed motor in the pipe or by electric motor or petrol diesel engines mounted to the pipe from the outside or by a right angle drive shaft that pierces the pipe fluid particles in course of their flow through the pump do not change their radial locations since the change in radius at the entry called suction and the exit called discharge of the pump is very small hence the name axial pump an axial flow pump has a propeller type of impeller running in a casing the pressure in an axial flow pump is developed by the flow of liquid over the blades of impeller the fluid is pushed in a direction parallel to the shaft of the impeller that is fluid particles in course of their flow through the pump do not change their radial locations it allows the fluid to enter the impeller axially and discharge the fluid nearly axially the propeller of an axial flow pump is driven by a motor work done on the fluid per unit weight formula 2 where formula 3 is the blade velocity for maximum energy transfer formula 4 that is formula 5

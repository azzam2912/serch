it was the first complete philosophical exposition for separating the beautiful and the sublime into their own respective rational categories it attracted the attention of prominent thinkers such as denis diderot and immanuel kant according to burke the beautiful is that which is well formed and aesthetically pleasing whereas the sublime is that which has the power to compel and destroy us the preference for the sublime over the beautiful was to mark the transition from the neoclassical to the romantic era the origins of our ideas of the beautiful and the sublime for burke can be understood by means of their causal structures according to aristotelian physics and metaphysics causation can be divided into formal material efficient and final causes the formal cause of beauty is the passion of love the material cause concerns aspects of certain objects such as smallness smoothness delicacy etc the efficient cause is the calming of our nerves the final cause is god s providence what is most peculiar and original to burke s view of beauty is that it cannot be understood by the traditional bases of beauty proportion fitness or perfection the sublime also has a causal structure that is unlike that

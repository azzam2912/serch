many fungi e g calocera viscosa and mosses are saproxylic or epixylic as well e g marchantiophyta some moss species completing their entire life cycle on a single log where trees are managed under a commercial regime competition is reduced by removing adjacent stems that exhibit less favourable timber quality potential when left in a natural state trees will self thin but this process can be unreliable in some circumstances examples of this can be found in the buxus ironbark forests and woodlands of victoria australia where a large proportion of trees are coppice resultant from timber cutting in decades gone by thinning decreases canopy closure and increases the penetration of solar radiation into the canopy the photosynthetic efficiency of this energy is improved and needle retention is prolonged especially in the lower parts of the crown the root system crown length crown diameter and crown area all increase after thinning even if soil evaporation and individual tree transpiration increases after thinning total evapo transpiration at stand level tends to decrease canopy water interception is reduced and throughfall increased so that tree water status usually improves after thinning radial annual growth is an integrative index of tree physiological response to

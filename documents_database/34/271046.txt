it is interrupted by the casparian strip in roots by air spaces between plant cells and by the plant cuticle structurally the apoplast is formed by the continuum of cell walls of adjacent cells as well as the extracellular spaces forming a tissue level compartment comparable to the symplast the apoplastic route facilitates the transport of water and solutes across a tissue or organ this process is known as apoplastic transport the apoplast is important for all the plant s interaction with its environment the main carbon source carbon dioxide needs to be solubilized in the apoplast before it diffuses through the plasma membrane into the cell s cytoplasm symplast and is used by the chloroplasts during photosynthesis in the roots ions diffuse into the apoplast of the epidermis before diffusing into the symplast or in some cases being taken up by specific ion channels and being pulled by the plant s transpiration stream which also occurs completely within the boundaries of the apoplast similarly all gaseous molecules emitted and received by plants such as plant hormones and other pheromones must pass the apoplast in nitrate poor soils acidification of the apoplast increases cell wall extensibility and root growth rate

the knowledge obtained is then used for design of full scale production systems and commercial products as well as for identification of further research objectives and support of investment decisions other non technical purposes include gaining public support for new technologies and questioning government regulations pilot plant is a relative term in the sense that pilot plants are typically smaller than full scale production plants but are built in a range of sizes also as pilot plants are intended for learning they typically are more flexible possibly at the expense of economy some pilot plants are built in laboratories using stock lab equipment while others require substantial engineering efforts cost millions of dollars and are custom assembled and fabricated from process equipment instrumentation and piping they can also be used to train personnel for a full scale plant pilot plants tend to be smaller compared to demonstration plants a word similar to pilot plant is pilot line essentially pilot plants and pilot lines perform the same functions but pilot plant is used in the context of bio chemical and advanced materials production systems whereas pilot line is used for new technology in general pilot plants are used to reduce the

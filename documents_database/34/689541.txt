these single celled organisms are known as anaerobic methanogens that produce methane using all three metabolic pathways for methanogenesis they live in diverse environments where they can remain safe from the effects of oxygen whether on the earth s surface in groundwater in deep sea vents and in animal digestive tracts methanosarcina grow in colonies the amino acid pyrrolysine was first discovered in a methanosarcina species m barkeri primitive versions of hemoglobin have been found in m acetivorans suggesting the microbe or an ancestor of it may have played a crucial role in the evolution of life on earth species of methanosarcina are also noted for unusually large genomes m acetivorans has the largest known genome of any archaeon according to a theory published in 2014 methanosarcina may have been largely responsible for the largest extinction event in the earth s history the permian triassic extinction event the theory suggests that acquisition of a new metabolic pathway via gene transfer followed by exponential reproduction allowed the microbe to rapidly consume vast deposits of organic carbon in marine sediments leading to a sharp buildup of methane and carbon dioxide in the earth s oceans and atmosphere that killed around 90 of

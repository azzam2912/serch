it is denoted by x unrelated to the number of great interest in number theory is the growth rate of the prime counting function it was conjectured in the end of the 18th century by gauss and by legendre to be approximately in the sense that this statement is the prime number theorem an equivalent statement is where li is the logarithmic integral function the prime number theorem was first proved in 1896 by jacques hadamard and by charles de la vall e poussin independently using properties of the riemann zeta function introduced by riemann in 1859 proofs of the prime number theorem not using the zeta function or complex analysis were found around 1948 by atle selberg and by paul erd s for the most part independently more precise estimates of formula 4 are now known for example where the o is big o notation for most values of formula 6 we are interested in i e when formula 6 is not unreasonably large formula 8 is greater than formula 4 however formula 10 is known to change sign infinitely many times for a discussion of this see skewes number of profound importance bernhard riemann proved that the prime

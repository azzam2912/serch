it is designed for quantitative absorption measurement at single wavelengths because it measures the transmittance or absorption of visible light through a solution it is sometimes referred to as a colorimeter the name of the instrument is a trademark of the manufacturer developed by bausch lomb and launched in 1953 the spectronic 20 was the first low cost spectrophotometer it rapidly became an industry standard due to its low cost durability and ease of use and has been referred to as an iconic lab spectrophotometer approximately 600 000 units were sold over its nearly 60 year production run it has been the most widely used spectrophotometer worldwide production was discontinued in 2011 when it was replaced by the spectronic 200 but the spectronic 20 is still in common use it is sometimes referred to as the spec 20 the bausch lomb spectronic 20 colorimeter uses a diffraction grating monochromator combined with a system for the detection amplification and measurement of light wavelengths in the 340 nm to 950 nm range as shown in the schematic optical diagram see left polychromatic light from a source in the system passes through lenses which are reflected and dispersed by the diffraction grating to

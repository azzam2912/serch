the conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes important processes in the nitrogen cycle include fixation ammonification nitrification and denitrification the majority of earth s atmosphere 78 is atmosphere nitrogen making it the largest source of nitrogen however atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems the nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes including primary production and decomposition human activities such as fossil fuel combustion use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle human modification of global nitrogen cycle can negatively affect the natural environment system and also human health nitrogen is present in the environment in a wide variety of chemical forms including organic nitrogen ammonium nh nitrite no nitrate no nitrous oxide no nitric oxide no or inorganic nitrogen gas n organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism humus or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition the processes in the nitrogen cycle is to transform nitrogen from one form to another

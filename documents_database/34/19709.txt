in his 1924 phd thesis he postulated the wave nature of electrons and suggested that all matter has wave properties this concept is known as the de broglie hypothesis an example of wave particle duality and forms a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics de broglie won the nobel prize for physics in 1929 after the wave like behaviour of matter was first experimentally demonstrated in 1927 the 1925 pilot wave model and the wave like behaviour of particles discovered by de broglie was used by erwin schr dinger in his formulation of wave mechanics the pilot wave model and interpretation was then abandoned in favor of the quantum formalism until 1952 when it was rediscovered and enhanced by david bohm louis de broglie was the sixteenth member elected to occupy seat 1 of the acad mie fran aise in 1944 and served as perpetual secretary of the french academy of sciences de broglie became the first high level scientist to call for establishment of a multi national laboratory a proposal that led to the establishment of the european organization for nuclear research cern louis de broglie was born to a noble family in dieppe seine maritime younger

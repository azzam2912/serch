this can happen due to many reasons which may include obstruction from primary teeth bone surrounding the unerupted tooth or other mechanical factors the two types of failure of eruption are primary failure of eruption and mechanical failure of eruption primary failure of eruption has been known to be associated with parathyroid hormone 1 receptor mutation the term primary failure of eruption was named by william proffit and katherine vig in 1981 this type of failure of eruption has a genetic or familial background precursor as a cause the prevalence is of pfe is about 0 06 in population in this type of failure teeth that are non ankylosed fail to erupt in the mouth these teeth do not have a precursor tooth that is blocking their path these teeth tend to erupt partially but then fail to erupt as the time goes on profitt stated that only the posterior teeth are the ones to be affected and all the teeth which are distal to the affected tooth are also affected both permanent and primary teeth may equally be affected this often results in posterior open bite in patients mouth who have primary failure of eruption this phenomenon can occur

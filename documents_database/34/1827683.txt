development testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to qa this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development and qa process development testing is applied for the following main purposes vdc research reports that the standardized implementation of development testing processes within an overarching standardized process not only improves software quality by aligning development activities with proven best practices but also increases project predictability voke research reports that development testing makes software more predictable traceable visible and transparent throughout the software development lifecycle in each of the above applications development testing starts by defining policies that express the organization s expectations for reliability security performance and regulatory compliance then after the team is trained on these policies development testing practices are implemented to align software development activities with these policies these development testing practices include the emphasis on applying a broad spectrum of defect prevention and defect detection practices is based on the premise that different development testing techniques are tuned to expose different types of defects at different points in the software development lifecycle so applying multiple techniques in concert decreases the risk

this means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized the algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time from an arbitrary starting vertex at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex the algorithm was developed in 1930 by czech mathematician vojt ch jarn k and later rediscovered and republished by computer scientists robert c prim in 1957 and edsger w dijkstra in 1959 therefore it is also sometimes called the jarn k s algorithm prim jarn k algorithm prim dijkstra algorithm or the djp algorithm other well known algorithms for this problem include kruskal s algorithm and bor vka s algorithm these algorithms find the minimum spanning forest in a possibly disconnected graph in contrast the most basic form of prim s algorithm only finds minimum spanning trees in connected graphs however running prim s algorithm separately for each connected component of the graph it can also be used to find the minimum spanning forest in terms of their asymptotic time complexity these three algorithms are equally fast for sparse

this time delay includes the propagation times for the paths between the two communication endpoints in the context of computer networks the signal is generally a data packet and the rtt is also known as the ping time an internet user can determine the rtt by using the ping command end to end delay is the length of time it takes for a signal to travel in one direction and is often approximated by half the rtt network links with both a high bandwidth and a high rtt and thus high bandwidth delay product can have a very large amount of data in flight at any given time such long fat pipes require a special protocol design one example is the tcp window scale option the rtt was originally estimated in tcp by where is constant weighting factor formula 2 choosing a value for close to 1 makes the weighted average immune to changes that last a short time e g a single segment that encounters long delay choosing a value for close to 0 makes the weighted average respond to changes in delay very quickly this was improved by the jacobson karels algorithm which takes standard deviation into account

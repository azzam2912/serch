introduced in 1983 the w65c816s is an enhanced version of the wdc 65c02 8 bit mpu itself a cmos enhancement of the venerable mos technology 6502 nmos mpu the 65816 was the cpu for the apple iigs and super nintendo entertainment system the 65 in the part s designation comes from its 65c02 compatibility mode and the 816 signifies that the mpu has selectable 8 and 16 bit register sizes in addition to the availability of 16 bit registers the w65c816s features extended memory addressing to 24 bits supporting up to 16 megabytes of random access memory an enhanced instruction set and a 16 bit stack pointer as well as several new electrical signals for improved system hardware management at reset the w65c816s starts in emulation mode meaning it substantially behaves as a 65c02 thereafter the w65c816s may be switched to native mode with a two instruction sequence causing it to enable all enhanced features yet still maintain a substantial degree of backward compatibility with most 65c02 software however unlike the pdip40 version of the 65c02 which is a pin compatible replacement for its nmos ancestor the pdip40 w65c816s is not pin compatible with any other 6502 family mpu related

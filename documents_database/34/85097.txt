whether by biological or technological means night vision is made possible by a combination of two approaches sufficient spectral range and sufficient intensity range humans have poor night vision compared to many animals in part because the human eye lacks a tapetum lucidum night useful spectral range techniques can sense radiation that is invisible to a human observer human vision is confined to a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light enhanced spectral range allows the viewer to take advantage of non visible sources of electromagnetic radiation such as near infrared or ultraviolet radiation some animals such as the mantis shrimp trout can see using much more of the infrared and or ultraviolet spectrum than humans sufficient intensity range is simply the ability to see with very small quantities of light many animals have better night vision than humans do the result of one or more differences in the morphology and anatomy of their eyes these include having a larger eyeball a larger lens a larger optical aperture the pupils may expand to the physical limit of the eyelids more rods than cones or rods exclusively in the retina and a tapetum lucidum enhanced intensity range is achieved

geoinformatics has at its core the technologies supporting the processes of acquiring analyzing and visualizing spatial data both geomatics and geoinformatics include and rely heavily upon the theory and practical implications of geodesy geography and earth science increasingly rely on digital spatial data acquired from remotely sensed images analyzed by geographical information systems gis and visualized on paper or the computer screen geoinformatics combines geospatial analysis and modeling development of geospatial databases information systems design human computer interaction and both wired and wireless networking technologies geoinformatics uses geocomputation and geovisualization for analyzing geoinformation branches of geoinformatics include research in this field is used to support global and local environmental energy and security programs the geographic information science and technology group of oak ridge national laboratory is supported by various government departments and agencies including the united states department of energy it is currently the only group in the united states department of energy national laboratory system to focus on advanced theory and application research in this field there are also a lot of interdiscipline research involved in geoinformatics fields including computer science information technology software engineering biogeography geography conservation architecture spatial analysis and reinformacement learning many fields benefit from geoinformatics

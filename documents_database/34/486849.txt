it is the subject of academic study in fields including personal construct psychology organisational theory and human computer interaction first proposed by james bieri in 1955 in an attempt to explain how humans perceive relevance cognitive complexity is defined as an extension of the notion of kolmogorov complexity it amounts to the length of the shortest description available to the observer here is an example individuating a particular inuit woman among one hundred people is simpler in a village in congo rather than in an inuit village cognitive complexity is related to probability see simplicity theory situations are cognitively improbable if they are simpler to describe than to generate human individuals attach two complexity values to events to generate an event such as an encounter with an inuit woman in congo one must add up the complexity of each event in the causal chain that brought her there the significant gap between both complexities hard to produce easy to describe makes the encounter improbable and thus narratable in human computer interaction cognitive or psychological complexity distinguishes human factors related to psychology and human cognition from for example computational complexity cognitive complexity is a psychological characteristic or psychological variable that indicates

it was developed by merck and completed phase iii trials used in combination with the ns5a replication complex inhibitor elbasvir under the trade name zepatier either with or without ribavirin grazoprevir is a second generation hepatitis c virus protease inhibitor acting at the ns3 4a protease targets it has good activity against a range of hcv genotype variants including some that are resistant to most currently used antiviral medications side effects have only be assessed in the combination with elbasvir common side effects of the combination include feeling tired nausea reduced appetite and headache low red blood cell count has occurred when co administered with ribavirin in some cases the most important risks are alanine transaminase elevation hyperbilirubinemia drug resistance development and drug interactions grazoprevir is transported by the solute carrier proteins slco1b1 and slco1b3 drugs that inhibit this proteins such as rifampicin ciclosporin and a number of aids medications atazanavir darunavir lopinavir saquinavir tipranavir cobicistat can cause a significant increase in grazoprevir blood plasma levels the substance is degraded by the liver enzyme cyp3a4 combination with drugs that induce this enzyme such as efavirenz carbamazepine or st john s wort can lead to ineffectively low plasma levels of grazoprevir

although both cis and trans isomers are possible for the unsaturated ketone only the trans isomer is observed its original preparation demonstrated the scope of condensation reactions to construct new complex organic compounds benzylideneacetone is used as a flavouring ingredient in food and perfumes benzylideneacetone can be efficiently prepared by the naoh induced condensation of the readily available reagents acetone and benzaldehyde however the benzylideneacetone formed via this reaction can undergo another claisen schmidt condensation with another molecule of benzaldehyde to form dibenzylideneacetone because relatively weak bases such as naoh make very little of the enolate ion at equilibrium there is still a lot of unreacted base left in the reaction mixture which can go on and remove protons from the alpha carbon of benzylideneacetone allowing it to undergo another claisen schmidt condensation and make dibenzylideneacetone if on the other hand lithium diisopropylamide lda is used as the base all of the acetone will deprotonated making enolate ion quantitatively therefore the most efficient way to make benzylideneacetone is to use equimolar amounts of lda in thf acetone and benzaldehyde the reaction must be done with anhydrous chemicals as lda breaks down in water as with most methyl ketones benzylidineacetone is

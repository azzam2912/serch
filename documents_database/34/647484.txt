temperature changes can affect the colour of a liquid crystal which makes them useful for temperature measurement the resolution of liquid crystal sensors is in the 0 1 c range disposable liquid crystal thermometers have been developed for home and medical use for example if the thermometer is black and it is put onto someone s forehead it will change colour depending on the temperature of the person there are two stages in the liquid crystals liquid crystal thermometers portray temperatures as colors and can be used to follow temperature changes caused by heat flow they can be used to observe that heat flows by conduction convection and radiation in medical applications liquid crystal thermometers may be used to read body temperature by placing them against the forehead these are safer than a mercury in glass thermometer and may be advantageous in some patients but do not always give an exact result except for the analytic liquid crystal thermometer which shows the exact temperature between 35 5 to 40 5 celsius liquid crystal thermometers are also commonly used in aquariums in homebrewing and in mood rings the liquid crystal thermometer was invented by bob parker in california one of many

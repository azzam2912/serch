it describes how much more massive the vehicle is with propellant than without that is the ratio of the rocket s wet mass vehicle plus contents plus propellant to its dry mass vehicle plus contents a more efficient rocket design requires less propellant to achieve a given goal and would therefore have a lower mass ratio however for any given efficiency a higher mass ratio typically permits the vehicle to achieve higher delta v the mass ratio is a useful quantity for back of the envelope rocketry calculations it is an easy number to derive from either formula 1 or from rocket and propellant mass and therefore serves as a handy bridge between the two it is also a useful for getting an impression of the size of a rocket while two rockets with mass fractions of say 92 and 95 may appear similar the corresponding mass ratios of 12 5 and 20 clearly indicate that the latter system requires much more propellant typical multistage rockets have mass ratios in the range from 8 to 20 the space shuttle for example has a mass ratio around 16 the definition arises naturally from tsiolkovsky s rocket equation where this equation can

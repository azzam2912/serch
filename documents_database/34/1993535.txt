kapteyn b is within the estimated habitable zone of its star it was the closest suspected potentially habitable exoplanet to the solar system other than tau ceti e up until 2016 when proxima centauri b at 4 22 light years was confirmed it was pushed into fourth when ross 128 b was confirmed in 2017 however later research had cast doubt on the existence of kapteyn b suggesting the signal is consistent with stellar activity rather than a planet this doubt however has been refuted by the original discovery team the system itself is estimated to be 11 billion years old substantially older than the solar system kapteyn b if it exists is a super earth a planet that has a radius and mass bigger than that of earth but smaller than that of the ice giants uranus and neptune it has a surface temperature of it has a mass greater than that or equal to 4 8 and a radius less than or equal to around 1 6 depending on its composition making it a likely rocky world the planet orbits a red subdwarf star named kapteyn s star the star has a mass of 0 27 and a

gielis suggested that the formula can be used to describe many complex shapes and curves that are found in nature gielis has filed a patent application related to the synthesis of patterns generated by the superformula in polar coordinates with formula 1 the radius and formula 2 the angle the superformula is by choosing different values for the parameters formula 4 and formula 5 different shapes can be generated the formula was obtained by generalizing the superellipse named and popularized by piet hein a danish mathematician in the following examples the values shown above each figure should be formula 6 formula 7 m n n and n a gnu octave program for generating these figures it is possible to extend the formula to 3 4 or n dimensions by means of the spherical product of superformulas for example the 3d parametric surface is obtained by multiplying two superformulas r and r the coordinates are defined by the relations where formula 11 latitude varies between 2 and 2 and longitude between and 3d superformula a b 1 formula 6 formula 7 m n n and n are shown in the pictures a gnu octave program for generating these figures the superformula

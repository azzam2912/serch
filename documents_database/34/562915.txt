also note that the scalars in the definition are positive meaning that the origin does not have to belong to c some authors use a definition that ensures the origin belongs to c because of the scaling parameters and cones are infinite in extent and not bounded if c is a convex cone then for any positive scalar and any x in c the vector formula 1 it follows that a convex cone c is a special case of a linear cone it follows from the above property that a convex cone can also be defined as a linear cone that is closed under convex combinations or just under additions more succinctly a set c is a convex cone if and only if and for any positive scalar an affine convex cone is the set resulting from applying an affine transformation to a convex cone a common example is translating a convex cone by a point p p c technically such transformations can produce non cones for example unless p 0 p c is not a linear cone however it is still called an affine convex cone a linear hyperplane is a set in the form formula 7 where f

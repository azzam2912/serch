it is mostly used in mining and demolition the use of the term machine dates from early designs that used an electrical generator operated by winding a rotary handle or pushing down a t handle modern blasting machines are battery powered and operated by key switches and push buttons and do not resemble the older designs a typical capacitive discharge blasting machine works by charging a capacitor from a battery then discharging the capacitor through an external circuit called the firing line to fire the blasting cap while the machine is idle an internal shunt is connected across the output terminals so that any stray voltages induced in the external circuit for example by nearby radio transmitters are harmlessly short circuited without triggering the blasting cap the machines also typically include an abort feature to discharge the internal capacitor without firing the cap the first satisfactory magnetic induction blasting machine was constructed in 1878 by henry julius smith of mountain view new jersey its mechanism consisted of a t handle that was pushed down the lower end of the handle was a rack that drove a pinion which in turn drove a high voltage magneto which generated the high voltage

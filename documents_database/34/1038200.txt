the keel may be partially flexible or articulated and may be located inside or outside the main envelope the outer shape of the airship is maintained by gas pressure as with the non rigid blimp semi rigid dirigibles were built in significant quantity from the late 19th century but in the late 1930s they fell out of favour along with rigid airships no more were constructed until the design was revived by the zeppelin nt in 1997 semi rigid construction is lighter weight than the outer framework of a rigid airship while it allows greater loading than a non rigid type more or less integrally attached to the hull are the gondola engines and sometimes the empennage tail the framework has the task of distributing the suspension loads of these attachments and the lifting gas loads evenly throughout the whole hull s surface and may also partially relieve stresses on the hull during manoeuvres in early airships which relied on nets fabric bands or complicated systems of rope rigging to unite the lifting envelope with the other parts of the ship semi rigid construction was able to achieve improvements in weight aerodynamic and structural performance the boundary between semi rigid

it covers satellites massing from to with power outputs from 3 to 18 kw and can carry more than 100 high power transponders the baseline boeing 702 is compatible with several orbital launch systems including atlas v ariane 5 delta iv falcon 9 proton and sea launch operated zenit 3sl after the introduction of the original 702 in 1997 the platform has been continually updated new members of the platform have been introduced through the years which allowed the common systems and approaches to span the whole range of mass and power for geosynchronous orbit satellites the family currently spans four different members the 702hp for high power applications the 702hp geo for mobile telephone services the 702mp for medium power requirements and the 702sp for small satellites the high power 702 platform was originally announced in october 1998 with the 2009 introduction of the 702mp mid power version the legacy boeing 702 platform which had been continuously evolved was designated the boeing 702hp for high power according to moog isp the 702hp platform uses its bipropellant thrusters the ses 9 a 702hp model launched aboard the falcon 9 flight 22 on 4 march 2016 developed in 1997 for their

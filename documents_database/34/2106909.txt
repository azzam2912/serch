this gene is normally switched on during the development of pain sensing nerve cells people with homozygous mutations of the prdm12 gene experience congenital insensitivity to pain cip prmd12 is a part of a larger domain that mediate histone methyltransferases enzymes target gene promoters in order to control gene expression the human protein isoform is made up of 367 amino acids containing a pr domain related to the set methyltransferase domain 3 zinc fingers and a c terminal polyalanine tract prdm12 influences the development of nerve cells that assist in perception and sensation of pain which is an important evolutionary advantage in humans mutations in the prdm12 gene can cause loss of pain perception brought on by defects in the development of sensory neurons it also has a range of interactions with and affects on various proteins in vertebrates prdm12 directly represses the dbx1 and nkx6 genes this is thought to be accomplished by utilizing g9a a strong h3k9 methyltransferase the indicated result of prdm12 s cross repressive interaction with the dbx1 and nkx6 genes is that the prdm12 partially acts as a promoter of v1 interneurons which are essential to the locomotion of vertebrates it is a member of

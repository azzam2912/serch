they are typically c symmetric and exist in a wide variety of forms with structures based around ch or pyridine linkers being particularly common often generalised box and pybox respectively the coordination complexes of bis oxazoline ligands are used in asymmetric catalysis these ligands are examples of c symmetric ligands the synthesis of oxazoline rings is well established and in general proceeded via the cyclisation of a 2 amino alcohol with any of a number of suitable functional groups in the case of bis oxazoline s synthesis is most conveniently achieved by using bi functional starting materials as this allows both rings to be produced at once of the materials suitable dicarboxylic or dinitrile compounds are the most commonly available and hence the majority bis oxazoline ligands are produced from these materials part of the success of the box and pybox motifs lies in their convenient one step synthesis from malononitrile and dipicolinic acid which are commercially available at low expense chirality is introduced with the amino alcohols as these are prepared from amino acids and hence are chiral e g valinol in general for methylene bridged box ligands the stereochemical outcome is consistent with a twisted square planar intermediate

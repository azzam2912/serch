he is one of the pioneers of cosmochemistry in 1962 he was awarded his d phil oxford university s equivalent of a phd in nuclear physics professor turner has been a leading figure in cosmochemistry since the 1960s his pioneering work on rare gases in meteorites led him to develop the argon argon dating technique that demonstrated the great age of meteorites and provided a precise chronology of rocks which were held by olivia sunderland brought back by the apollo missions he was one of the few uk scientists to be a principal investigator of these apollo samples his argon dating technique involved stepped pyrolysis of the rocks to force out the argon then determining the isotopic ratios in the gas by mass spectrometry this was later refined by the use of lasers these techniques have been invaluable to cosmochemists and geochemists and have been applied by turner and others to determine the geochronology of diamonds and inclusions in them and the precise ages of mantle and crustal rocks from the earth he went on to develop even better techniques such as iodine xenon chronology he used laser resonance ionisation of xenon to measure samples with only a few thousand

these proteins are isolated to inhibit the virus from replicating in a host s cells and stop it from spreading to other cells the pokeweed antiviral protein and the zinc finger antiviral protein are two major antiviral proteins that have undergone several tests for viruses including hiv and influenza pokeweed is a common plant that is often used as a dye it is also eaten when the plant is young and tender studies and experiments have shown that a specific protein the pokeweed antiviral protein pap could possibly be used therapeutically in t cell leukemia lymphoma hodgkin s lymphoma and aids in an experiment posted in the journal of virology mice immune systems were integrated to mimic that of humans the mice were then infected with hiv and later given the pap the experiment showed that the pap treated the mice from the hiv and with no side effects ribosomal protein synthesis in the nucleolus stalls when pap strips purine bases from viral mrna before they reach ribosomes research is still being conducted with pap to see the effectiveness on other viruses including the common cold the zinc finger antiviral protein zap is a specific antiviral protein that aids in

it contains a single species e antiquior eoplesiosaurus is known only from the holotype specimen ttncm 8348 a complete and articulated postcranial skeleton it preserved three dimensionally with some gastralia presented it was collected at watchet of somerset from the pre planorbis beds of the blue lias formation of the lower lias group these beds likely occur below the first occurrence of the ammonite psiloceras planorbis thus they probably fall within the earliest hettangian p tilmanni chronozone which is about 199 6 198 million years old immediately following the triassic jurassic boundary plesiosaurs fossils which were discovered at street e g avalonnectes and thalassiodracon or at penecontemporaneous strata such as the watchet locality represent the earliest known occurrence of the plesiosauria hence eoplesiosaurus is the oldest plesiosauroid and one of the oldest plesiosaurs to date eoplesiosaurus is a proportionally long necked plesiosaurian with at least 38 cervical vertebrae the presence of small conical lateral projections on the bases of the anterior cervical prezygapophyses represents its autapomorphy a phylogenetic analysis performed by benson et al 2012 found it to be the basalmost known plesiosauroid the cladogram below shows eoplesiosaurus phylogenetic position among other plesiosaurs following benson et al 2012 eoplesiosaurus was

examples of this included the ecw world tag team wcw world tag team and wwf world tag team championship however some are also correctly known simply as the world tag team championship without bearing the name of an organization in some cases this occurs in organizations where other world tag team championships are also competed for as was the case in wcw in the early 1990s and wwe in the 2000s the term world tag team championship can apply to any world tag team championship in general or to a specific one in particular though this often creates confusion over which tag team championship is being referenced when the term is used due to the variations of tag team wrestling other world tag team championships may exclude the tag team portion of the name and use a more suitable term like trios or six man tag to indicate a championship for tag teams with three members promotions can also recognize subordinate titles to world tag team championships that are often designated as regional national or international championships examples of these subordinate titles include the nwa canadian tag team championship and wwf international tag team championship which are national and international

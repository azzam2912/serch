engine coolant is usually water based but may also be oil it is common to employ a water pump to force the engine coolant to circulate and also for an axial fan to force air through the radiator in automobiles and motorcycles with a liquid cooled internal combustion engine a radiator is connected to channels running through the engine and cylinder head through which a liquid coolant is pumped this liquid may be water in climates where water is unlikely to freeze but is more commonly a mixture of water and antifreeze in proportions appropriate to the climate antifreeze itself is usually ethylene glycol or propylene glycol with a small amount of corrosion inhibitor a typical automotive cooling system comprises the radiator transfers the heat from the fluid inside to the air outside thereby cooling the fluid which in turn cools the engine radiators are also often used to cool automatic transmission fluids air conditioner refrigerant intake air and sometimes to cool motor oil or power steering fluid radiators are typically mounted in a position where they receive airflow from the forward movement of the vehicle such as behind a front grill where engines are mid or rear mounted it

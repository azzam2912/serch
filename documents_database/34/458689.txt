a standard atomic weight cannot be given the first isotope to be synthesized was sg in 1974 there are 12 known radioisotopes from sg to sg and 2 known isomers sg and sg the longest lived isotope is sg with a half life of 14 minutes this section deals with the synthesis of nuclei of seaborgium by so called cold fusion reactions these are processes that create compound nuclei at low excitation energy 10 20 mev hence cold leading to a higher probability of survival from fission the excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of one or two neutrons only the first attempt to synthesise seaborgium in cold fusion reactions was performed in september 1974 by a soviet team led by g n flerov at the joint institute for nuclear research at dubna they reported producing a 0 48 s spontaneous fission sf activity which they assigned to the isotope sg based on later evidence it was suggested that the team most likely measured the decay of sg and its daughter rf the twg concluded that at the time the results were insufficiently convincing the dubna team revisited this problem in 1983 1984 and were

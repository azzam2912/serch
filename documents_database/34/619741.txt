psl was inspired by its predecessor standard lisp and the portable lisp compiler it is tail recursive late binding or dynamically bound and was developed by researchers at the university of utah in 1980 which released psl 3 1 development was handed over to developers at hewlett packard in 1982 who released psl 3 3 and up portable standard lisp was available as a kit containing a screen editor a compiler and an interpreter for several hardware and operating system computing platforms including motorola 68000 series decsystem 20s cray 1s vax and many others today psl is mainly developed by and available from konrad zuse zentrum f r informationstechnik berlin zib its main modern use is as the underlying language for implementations of reduce like most older lisps in the first step psl compiles lisp code to lap code which is another cross platform language however where older lisps mostly compiled lap directly to assembly language or some architecture dependent intermediate psl compiles the lap to c code which would run in a virtual machine language so programs written in it are as portable as c in principle which is very portable the compiler was written in psl or a

dissorophids were a group of fully terrestrial often heavily armored faunivores this along with their relatively large size and geographical range suggest that they were able to coexist with amniotes as predators during the early permian dissorophidae has four distinct clades differentiated largely on the morphology of the osteoderms the eucacopinae previously cacopinae the dissorophinae the aspidosaurinae and the platyhystricinae cacops is one of the few olsoniforms dissorophids and the larger trematopids whose ontogeny is beginning to surface cacops fossils were almost exclusively known from the cacops bone bed of the lower permian arroyo formation of texas for much of the 20th century new material collected from the dolese brothers quarry near richards spur oklahoma in the past few decades has been recovered painting a clearer picture of what the animal looked and acted like american paleontologist samuel w williston used the details of the species cacops aspidephorus to first describe its features however because of the poor preservation of specimens collected from the cacops bone bed in texas other researchers who collected specimens from other localities have described many of cacops features with more certainty features that distinguish cacops from other dissorophids include a large dorsal process of the

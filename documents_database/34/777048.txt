there is also a generalization to infinite dimensional spaces gaussian measures are named after the german mathematician carl friedrich gauss one reason why gaussian measures are so ubiquitous in probability theory is the central limit theorem loosely speaking it states that if a random variable x is obtained by summing a large number n of independent random variables of order 1 then x is of order formula 1 and its law is approximately gaussian let n n and let b r denote the completion of the borel algebra on r let b r 0 denote the usual n dimensional lebesgue measure then the standard gaussian measure b r 0 1 is defined by for any measurable set a b r in terms of the radon nikodym derivative more generally the gaussian measure with mean r and variance 0 is given by gaussian measures with mean 0 are known as centred gaussian measures the dirac measure is the weak limit of formula 5 as 0 and is considered to be a degenerate gaussian measure in contrast gaussian measures with finite non zero variance are called non degenerate gaussian measures the standard gaussian measure on r so gaussian measure is a radon

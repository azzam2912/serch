these include managed access points in the secure network plus access points in the neighborhood a wireless intrusion prevention system facilitates the job of auditing these access points on a continuous basis to learn whether there are any rogue access points among them in order to detect rogue access points two conditions need to be tested the first of the above two conditions is easy to test compare wireless mac address also called as bssid of the access point against the managed access point bssid list however automated testing of the second condition can become challenging in the light of following factors a need to cover different types of access point devices such as bridging nat router unencrypted wireless links encrypted wireless links different types of relations between wired and wireless mac addresses of access points and soft access points b necessity to determine access point connectivity with acceptable response time in large networks and c requirement to avoid both false positives and negatives which are described below false positives occur when the wireless intrusion prevention system detects an access point not actually connected to the secure network as wired rogue frequent false positives result in wastage of administrative bandwidth

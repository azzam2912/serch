the term can also be used for robots capable of handling micrometer size components microbots were born thanks to the appearance of the microcontroller in the last decade of the 20th century and the appearance of miniature mechanical systems on silicon mems although many microbots do not use silicon for mechanical components other than sensors the earliest research and conceptual design of such small robots was conducted in the early 1970s in then classified research for u s intelligence agencies applications envisioned at that time included prisoner of war rescue assistance and electronic intercept missions the underlying miniaturization support technologies were not fully developed at that time so that progress in prototype development was not immediately forthcoming from this early set of calculations and concept design as of 2008 the smallest microrobots use a scratch drive actuator the development of wireless connections especially wi fi i e in household networks has greatly increased the communication capacity of microbots and consequently their ability to coordinate with other microbots to carry out more complex tasks indeed much recent research has focused on microbot communication including a 1 024 robot swarm at harvard university that assembles itself into various shapes and manufacturing microbots

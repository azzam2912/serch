in 1992 the us economist harry saunders dubbed this hypothesis the khazzoom brookes postulate and showed that it was true under neo classical growth theory over a wide range of assumptions in short the postulate states that energy efficiency improvements that on the broadest considerations are economically justified at the microlevel lead to higher levels of energy consumption at the macrolevel this idea is a more modern analysis of a phenomenon known as the jevons paradox in 1865 william stanley jevons observed that england s consumption of coal increased considerably after james watt introduced his improvements to the steam engine jevons argued that increased efficiency in the use of coal would tend to increase the demand for coal and would not reduce the rate at which england s deposits of coal were running out like jevons paradox the khazzoom brookes postulate is a deduction that is largely counter intuitive as an efficiency paradox when individuals change behavior and begin to use methods and devices that are more energy efficient there are cases where on a macro economic level energy usage actually increases the effect of higher energy prices either through taxes or producer induced shortages initially reduces demand but in

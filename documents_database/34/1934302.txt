it was introduced by amd the latest specification was dated march 2009 it was still in the proposal stage no released microprocessors implement the extension asf provides the capability to start end and abort transactional execution and to mark cache lines for protected memory access in transactional code regions it contains four new instructions codice 1 codice 2 codice 3 and codice 4 and turns the otherwise invalid codice 5 prefixed codice 6 codice 7 and codice 8 instructions into valid ones inside transactional code regions up to 256 levels of nested transactional code regions is supported the codice 1 and codice 2 instructions mark the start and end of a transactional code region inside transactional code regions the codice 5 prefixed codice 12 codice 7 and codice 8 instructions can mark up to four cache lines for protected memory access accesses from other processor cores to the protected cache lines result in exceptions which in turn cause transaction aborts stores to protected cache lines must be performed using the codice 15 instructions marked cache lines can be released from protection with the codice 4 instruction transaction aborts generated by hardware or explicitly requested through the codice 3 instruction rolls

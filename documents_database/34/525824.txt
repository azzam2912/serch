the specification allows any compliant boot loader implementation to boot any compliant operating system kernel thus it allows different operating systems and boot loaders to work together and interoperate without the need for operating system specific boot loaders as a result it also allows easier coexistence of different operating systems on a single computer which is also known as multi booting the specification was originally created in 1995 and developed by the free software foundation gnu hurd vmware esxi xen and l4 microkernels all need to be booted using this method gnu grub is the reference implementation used in the gnu operating system and other operating systems the latest version of multiboot specification is 0 6 96 defined in 2009 an incompatible second iteration with uefi support multiboot2 specification was later introduced the latest version of multiboot2 is 2 0 defined in 2016 while multiboot defines a header as a struct which needs to be present in the image file as a whole in multiboot2 fields or group of fields have a type tag which allows them to be omitted from the multiboot2 header within the os image file the header must be in the first 8192 2 13 bytes

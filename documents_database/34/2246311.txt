the backdoors may be directly implemented as hardware trojans in the integrated circuit hardware backdoors are intended to undermine security in smartcards and other cryptoprocessors unless investment is made in anti backdoor design methods they have also been considered for car hacking hardware backdoors are considered highly problematic because skorobogatov has developed a technique capable of detecting malicious insertions into chips new york university tandon school of engineering researchers have developed a way to corroborate a chip s operation using verifiable computing whereby manufactured for sale chips contain an embedded verification module that proves the chip s calculations are correct and an associated external module validates the embedded verification module another technique developed by researchers at university college london ucl relies on distributing trust between multiple identical chips from disjoint supply chains assuming that at least one of those chips remains honest the security of the device is preserved ptychographic x ray laminography researchers at the university of southern california ming hsieh department of electrical and computer engineering and the photonic science division at the paul scherrer institute have developed a new technique called ptychographic x ray laminography this technique is the only current method that allows for verification of

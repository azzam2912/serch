most of the world s data is recorded on hdds and there is continuous pressure on manufacturers to create greater data storage capacity in a given hdd form factor and for a given cost in an hdd data is stored using magnetic recording on a and is accessed through a write head and read head or read element tdmr allows greater storage capacity by advantageously combining signals simultaneously from multiple read back heads to enhance the recovery of one or more of data tracks in this manner data can be stored with higher areal density on the disks thus providing higher capacity in each hdd tdmr is a read back technology and thus applies equally well to future recording writing technologies such as heat assisted magnetic recording hamr and microwave assisted magnetic recording mamr the tdmr approach arose from a working group set up under insic to explore alternative future storage technologies in the initial concept the data tracks were assumed to be very narrow tracks created by shingled recording and subject to considerable mutual interference the read heads were assumed to be each centered over a corresponding data track and a joint detector would optimally recover data from several

different definitions are used in electric power transmission and distribution and electrical safety codes define low voltage circuits that are exempt from the protection required at higher voltages these definitions vary by country and specific codes or regulations the international electrotechnical commission iec defines supply system low voltage as voltage in the range 50 to 1000 v ac or 120 to 1500 v dc in electrical power systems low voltage most commonly refers to the mains voltages as used by domestic and light industrial and commercial consumers low voltage in this context still presents a risk of electric shock but only a minor risk of electric arcs through the air in electrical power distribution the united states 2005 national electrical code nec defines low distribution system voltage as 0 to 49 volts low distribution system voltage is covered by article 725 of this code the nfpa standard 79 article 6 4 1 1 defines distribution protected extralow voltage pelv as nominal voltage of 30 vrms or 60 vdc ripple free for dry locations and 6 vrms or 15 vdc in all other cases ul standard 508a article 43 table 43 1 defines 0 to 20 v peak 5 a or

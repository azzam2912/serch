it was a baryonychine member of the spinosauridae a group of large bipedal carnivores with well built forelimbs and elongated crocodile like skulls the type species cristatusaurus lapparenti was named in 1998 by scientists philippe taquet and dale russell on the basis of jaw bones and some vertebrae two claw fossils were also later assigned to cristatusaurus the animal s generic name which means crested reptile alludes to a sagittal crest on top of its snout while the specific name is in honor of the french paleontologist albert f lix de lapparent cristatusaurus is known from the albian to aptian erlhaz formation where it would have coexisted with sauropod and iguanodontian dinosaurs other theropods and various crocodylomorphs originally proposed to be an indeterminate species of baryonyx the identity of cristatusaurus has been subject to debate in part due to the fragmentary nature of its fossils some argue that it is probably the same dinosaur as suchomimus which has also been found in niger in the same sediment layers in that case the genus cristatusaurus would have priority since it was named two months earlier others have concluded however that cristatusaurus is a nomen dubium considering it indistinguishable from both suchomimus

it functions at a very low level directly interacting with the disk drive hardware to override a copy protection scheme that the floppy disk s data may be stored in in most cases the nibbler software still analyses the data on a byte level only looking to the bit level when dealing with synchronization marks syncs zero gaps and other sector track headers when possible nibblers will work with the low level data encoding format used by the disk system being group coded recording gcr apple commodore frequency modulation fm atari or modified frequency modulation mfm amiga atari ibm pc software piracy began to be a problem when floppy disks became the common storage media the ease of copying depended on the system jerry pournelle wrote in byte in 1983 that cp m doesn t lend itself to copy protection so its users haven t been too worried about it while apple users though have always had the problem so have those who used trs dos and i understand that ms dos has copy protection features apple and commodore 64 copy protection schemes were extremely varied and creative because most of the floppy disk reading and writing was controlled by

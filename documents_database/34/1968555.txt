airlocks have a very similar design allowing free ingress and egress while also restricting airflow in a manual mantrap a guard locks and unlocks each door in sequence an intercom and or video camera are often used to allow the guard to control the trap from a remote location in an automatic mantrap identification may be required for each door sometimes even possibly different measures for each door for example a key may open the first door but a personal identification number entered on a number pad opens the second other methods of opening doors include proximity cards or biometric devices such as fingerprint readers or iris recognition scans metal detectors are often built in to prevent the entrance of people carrying weapons this use is particularly frequent in banks and jewelry shops fire codes require that automatic mantraps allow exit from the intermediate space while denying access to a secure space such as a data center or research lab a manually operated mantrap may allow a guard to lock both doors trapping a suspect between the doors for questioning or detainment in a lower security variation of a mantrap banks often locate automated teller machines within the dead space

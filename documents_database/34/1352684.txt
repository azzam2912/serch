discussion of analog verification began in 2005 when it started to become recognized that the analog portion of large mixed signal chips had become so complex that a significant and ever increasing number of these chips were being designed with functional errors in the analog portion that prevented them from operating correctly analog verification is built on the idea that transistor level simulation will always be too slow to provide adequate functional verification instead it is necessary to build simple and efficient models of the blocks that make up the analog portion of the design and use those to verify the design those models are typically written in verilog or verilog ams but could also be written in vhdl or vhdl ams however simply using a simple functional model is not sufficient it is also necessary to build a comprehensive self checking testbench that thoroughly exercises the design and compare its response against a previously written specification for the design furthermore this testbench should be applied in turn to both the model and the design in this case the design is represented with a transistor level schematic if both the model and the design pass all tests and if the

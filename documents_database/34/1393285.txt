there are precisely fifteen supersingular prime numbers the first eleven primes 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 and 31 as well as 41 47 59 and 71 the non supersingular primes are 37 43 53 61 67 and any prime number greater than or equal to 73 all supersingular primes are chen primes but 37 53 and 67 are also chen primes and there are infinitely many chen primes greater than 73 supersingular primes are related to the notion of supersingular elliptic curves as follows for a prime number p the following are equivalent the equivalence is due to andrew ogg more precisely in 1975 ogg showed that the primes satisfying the first condition are exactly the 15 supersingular primes listed above and shortly thereafter learned of the then conjectural existence of a sporadic simple group having exactly these primes as prime divisors this strange coincidence was the beginning of the theory of monstrous moonshine three non supersingular primes occur in the orders of two other sporadic simple groups 37 and 67 divide the order of the lyons group and 37 and 43 divide the order of the fourth janko group it immediately follows that these

ice shelves are only found in antarctica greenland canada and the russian arctic the boundary between the floating ice shelf and the anchor ice resting on bedrock that feeds it is called the grounding line the thickness of ice shelves can range from about to in contrast sea ice is formed on water is much thinner typically less than and forms throughout the arctic ocean it also is found in the southern ocean around the continent of antarctica ice shelves are principally driven by gravity induced pressure from the grounded ice that flow continually moves ice from the grounding line to the seaward front of the shelf the primary mechanism of mass loss from ice shelves was thought to have been iceberg calving in which a chunk of ice breaks off from the seaward front of the shelf a study by nasa and university researchers published in the june 14 2013 issue of science found however that ocean waters melting the undersides of antarctic ice shelves are responsible for most of the continent s ice shelf mass loss typically a shelf front will extend forward for years or decades between major calving events snow accumulation on the upper surface and

the sectional curvature k depends on a two dimensional plane in the tangent space at a point p of the manifold it is the gaussian curvature of the surface which has the plane as a tangent plane at p obtained from geodesics which start at p in the directions of in other words the image of under the exponential map at p the sectional curvature is a smooth real valued function on the 2 grassmannian bundle over the manifold the sectional curvature determines the curvature tensor completely given a riemannian manifold and two linearly independent tangent vectors at the same point u and v we can define here r is the riemann curvature tensor if we take the opposite sign for the curvature tensor then we should reverse the sign of the previous quotient so the sphere has positive sectional curvature in particular if u and v are orthonormal then the sectional curvature in fact depends only on the 2 plane in the tangent space at p spanned by u and v it is called the sectional curvature of the 2 plane and is denoted k riemannian manifolds with constant sectional curvature are the simplest these are called space forms

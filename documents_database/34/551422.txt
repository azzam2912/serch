it can apply to both metals and non metallic materials some sulfate reducing bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide which can cause sulfide stress cracking acidithiobacillus bacteria produce sulfuric acid acidothiobacillus thiooxidans frequently damages sewer pipes ferrobacillus ferrooxidans directly oxidizes iron to iron oxides and iron hydroxides the rusticles forming on the rms titanic wreck are caused by bacterial activity other bacteria produce various acids both organic and mineral or ammonia in presence of oxygen aerobic bacteria like acidithiobacillus thiooxidans thiobacillus thioparus and thiobacillus concretivorus all three widely present in the environment are the common corrosion causing factors resulting in biogenic sulfide corrosion without presence of oxygen anaerobic bacteria especially desulfovibrio and desulfotomaculum are common desulfovibrio salixigens requires at least 2 5 concentration of sodium chloride but d vulgaris and d desulfuricans can grow in both fresh and salt water d africanus is another common corrosion causing microorganism the genus desulfotomaculum comprises sulfate reducing spore forming bacteria dtm orientis and dtm nigrificans are involved in corrosion processes sulfate reducers require reducing environment an electrode potential lower than 100 mv is required for them to thrive however even a small amount of produced hydrogen sulfide can achieve this shift so the growth once

small particles are slowed more rapidly by non target environments like air resistance and are less likely to cause injury or damage to persons and objects distant from the point of bullet impact most frangible bullets are subject to brittle failure upon striking a hard target this mechanism has been used to minimize the tendency of malleable lead and copper bullets to ricochet from hard targets as large cohesive particles brittle failure may occur at subsonic velocity attempting to crimp a brittle frangible bullet into the cartridge case may break the bullet brittle frangible bullets may break during the self loading cycle of semi automatic firearms and those fired from revolvers often break as the bullet encounters the barrel forcing cone after leaving the cylinder powder metallurgy techniques fabricate bullets from mixtures of powdered metals typically tin copper zinc and or tungsten compressed at room temperature to produce a high density material mechanical interlocking and cold welding bond the metals together either pressed directly to shape or into bar stock billets that can be swaged into projectiles with or without jacketing alternative manufacturing techniques include heat treating or sintering powdered metals at temperatures below the melting point or binding the

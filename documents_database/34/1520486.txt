these fluids are engineered colloidal suspensions of nanoparticles in a base fluid the nanoparticles used in nanofluids are typically made of metals oxides carbides or carbon nanotubes common base fluids include water ethylene glycol and oil nanofluids have novel properties that make them potentially useful in many applications in heat transfer including microelectronics fuel cells pharmaceutical processes and hybrid powered engines engine cooling vehicle thermal management domestic refrigerator chiller heat exchanger in grinding machining and in boiler flue gas temperature reduction they exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and the convective heat transfer coefficient compared to the base fluid knowledge of the rheological behaviour of nanofluids is found to be critical in deciding their suitability for convective heat transfer applications nanofluids also have special acoustical properties and in ultrasonic fields display additional shear wave reconversion of an incident compressional wave the effect becomes more pronounced as concentration increases in analysis such as computational fluid dynamics cfd nanofluids can be assumed to be single phase fluids however almost all new academic papers use a two phase assumption classical theory of single phase fluids can be applied where physical properties of nanofluid is taken as a function of properties of both constituents and their

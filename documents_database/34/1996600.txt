the framework defines the domain and sub domains for interoperability research and development in order to identify a set of pieces of knowledge for solving enterprise interoperability problems by removing barriers to interoperability some existing works on interoperability have been carried out to define interoperability framework or reference models in particular the lisi reference model european interoperability framework eif ideas interoperability framework athena interoperability framework and e health interoperability framework these existing approaches constitute the basis for the enterprise interoperability framework the necessity to elaborate the enterprise interoperability framework has been discussed in existing interoperability frameworks do not explicitly address barriers to interoperability which is a basic assumption of this research they are not aimed at structuring interoperability knowledge with respect to their ability to remove various barriers the enterprise interoperability framework has three basic dimensions the framework with its three basic dimensions is shown the enterprise interoperability framework allows to the enterprise interoperability framework not only aims at structuring concepts defining research domain and capturing knowledge but also at helping industries to solve their interoperability problems when carrying out an interoperability project involving two particular enterprises interoperability concerns and interoperability barriers between the two enterprises will be identified first

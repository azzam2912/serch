postage stamps depicting george washington and benjamin franklin issued by the u s post office between 1908 and 1922 the distinctive feature of this issue is that it employs only two engraved heads set in ovals washington and franklin in full profile and replicates one or another of these portraits on every stamp denomination in the series this is a significant departure from previous definitive issues which had featured pantheons of famous americans with each portrait image confined to a single denomination at the same time this break with the recent past represented a return to origins washington and franklin after all had appeared on the first two american stamps issued in 1847 and during the next fifteen years each of the eight stamp denominations available with one exception featured either washington or franklin in the early washington franklin issues 1908 11 every design incorporated a pair of olive branches surrounding one or the other of the two profiles from 1912 on however the franklin head issues would instead appear with oak leaves near the bottom of the oval in the image olive branches and oak leaves are often used as symbols for peace olive branches and strength oak leaves

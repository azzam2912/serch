this signal can then be made traceable to an external clock the aim of synchronous ethernet is to provide a synchronization signal to those network resources that may eventually require such a type of signal the synchronous ethernet signal transmitted over the ethernet physical layer should be traceable to an external clock ideally a master and unique clock for the whole network applications include cellular networks access technologies such as ethernet passive optical network and applications such as iptv or voip unlike time division multiplexing networks the ethernet family of computer networks do not carry clock synchronization information several means are defined to address this issue ietf s network time protocol ieee s 1588 2008 precision time protocol are some of them synce was standardized by the itu t in cooperation with ieee as three recommendations synce architecture minimally requires replacement of the internal clock of the ethernet card by a phase locked loop in order to feed the ethernet phy extension of the synchronization network to consider ethernet as a building block itu t g 8261 this enables synchronous ethernet network equipment to be connected to the same synchronization network as synchronous digital hierarchy sdh synchronization for sdh can

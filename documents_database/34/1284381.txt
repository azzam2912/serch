in more recent works geologists often refer to both ur and other proposed archaean continental assemblages as supercratons ur can nevertheless be half a billion years younger than vaalbara but the concepts of these two early cratonic assemblages are incompatible about 1 300 1 071 mya ur joined the continents nena and atlantica to form the supercontinent rodinia in the reconstruction of ur remained the nucleus of east gondwana until the break up of gondwana in other reconstructions however india and east antarctica did not collide until rodinia formed 1 071 mya furthermore in the early archaean earth s mantle was 200 c hotter than today and many characteristics of modern tectonics such as ophiolites blueschists lawsonite bearing eclogites and ultra high pressure rocks did not exist or were rare this makes most proposed archaean supercontinents controversial including rogers s 3 gya supercontinent reconstructions of the supercontinent vaalbara places two cratons kaapvaal in southern africa and pilbara in western australia next to each other based on stratigraphic similarities in roger s configuration of ur these cratons are placed far apart in their gondwana configuration this configuration is contradicted by widespread precambrian collisional events between australia and africa yet another possible

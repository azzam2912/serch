bacteria serve as natural hosts with transmission achieved through passive diffusion there are currently 62 species in this genus including the type species mycobacterium phage l5 group dsdna l5likeviruses are nonenveloped with a head and tail the icosahedral head is about 60 nm in diameter with covalently linked capsid proteins the tail is long and flexible at about 135 nm long 8 nm wide and has a terminal knob with one short tail fiber bxb1 d29 and l5 and have been fully sequenced they range between 49k and 53k nucleotides with 79 to 90 proteins their complete genomes are available here the virus attaches to the host cell s adhesion receptors using its terminal fiber and ejects the viral dna into the host cytoplasm via long flexible tail ejection system viral replication is cytoplasmic replication follows the replicative transposition model dna templated transcription is the method of transcription once the viral genes have been replicated the procapsid is assembled and packed the tail is then assembled and the mature virions are released via lysis bacteria serve as the natural host transmission routes are passive diffusion according to ictv s 1996 report the genus l5likevirus was first accepted under the name

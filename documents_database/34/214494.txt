the t dna is transferred from bacterium into the host plant s nuclear dna genome the capability of this specialized tumor inducing ti plasmid is attributed to two essential regions required for dna transfer to the host cell as the t dna is bordered by 25 base pair repeats on each end transfer is initiated at the right border and terminated at the left border and requires the vir genes of the ti plasmid the bacterial t dna is about 24 000 base pairs long and contains genes that code for enzymes synthesizing opines and phytohormones by transferring the t dna into the plant genome the bacterium essentially reprograms the plant cells to grow into a tumor and produce a unique food source for the bacteria the synthesis of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin by enzymes encoded in the t dna enables the plant cell to grow uncontrollably thus forming the crown gall tumors typically induced by agrobacterium tumefaciens infection whereas agrobacterium rhizogenes causes hairy root disease the opines are amino acid derivatives used by the bacterium as a source of carbon and energy this natural process of horizontal gene transfer in plants is being utilized as a tool

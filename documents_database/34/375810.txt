this is illustrated by the equation where p means product s the reaction or reaction step is an isomerization if there is only one product molecule or a dissociation if there is more than one product molecule in either case the rate of the reaction or step is described by the first order rate law where a is the concentration of species a t is time and k is the reaction rate constant as can be deduced from the rate law equation the number of a molecules that decay is proportional to the number of a molecules available an example of a unimolecular reaction is the isomerization of cyclopropane to propene unimolecular reactions can be explained by the lindemann hinshelwood mechanism in a bimolecular reaction two molecules collide and exchange energy atoms or groups of atoms this can be described by the equation which corresponds to the second order rate law formula 2 here the rate of the reaction is proportional to the rate at which the reactants come together an example of a bimolecular reaction is the sn2 type nucleophilic substitution of methyl bromide by hydroxide ion a termolecular or trimolecular reaction in solutions or gas mixtures involves three

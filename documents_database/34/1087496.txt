surface and volume conductivity of liquids correspond to the electrically driven motion of ions in an electric field a layer of counter ions of the opposite polarity to the surface charge exists close to the interface it is formed due to attraction of counter ions by the surface charges this layer of higher ionic concentration is a part of the interfacial double layer the concentration of the ions in this layer is higher as compared to the ionic strength of the liquid bulk this leads to the higher electric conductivity of this layer smoluchowski was the first to recognize the importance of surface conductivity at the beginning of the 20th century there is a detailed description of surface conductivity by lyklema in fundamentals of interface and colloid science the double layer dl has two regions according to the well established gouy chapman stern model the upper level which is in contact with the bulk liquid is the diffuse layer the inner layer that is in contact with interface is the stern layer it is possible that the lateral motion of ions in both parts of the dl contributes to the surface conductivity the contribution of the stern layer is less

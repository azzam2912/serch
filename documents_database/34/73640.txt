the landward retreat of the shoreline can measured and described over a temporal scale of tides seasons and other short term cyclic processes coastal erosion may be caused by hydraulic action abrasion impact and corrosion by wind and water and other forces natural or unnatural on non rocky coasts coastal erosion results in rock formations in areas where the coastline contains rock layers or fracture zones with varying resistance to erosion softer areas become eroded much faster than harder ones which typically result in landforms such as tunnels bridges columns and pillars over time the coast generally evens out the softer areas fill up with sediment eroded from hard areas and rock formations are eroded away also abrasion commonly happens in areas where there are strong winds loose sand and soft rocks the blowing of millions of sharp sand grains creates a sandblasting effect this effect helps to erode smooth and polish rocks the definition of abrasion is grinding and wearing away of rock surfaces through the mechanical action of other rock or sand particles a place where erosion of a cliffed coast has occurred is at wamberal in the central coast region of new south wales where houses built

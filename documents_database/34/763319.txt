the rule finds application in thermodynamics where frequently three variables can be related by a function of the form f x y z 0 so each variable is given as an implicit function of the other two variables for example an equation of state for a fluid relates temperature pressure and volume in this manner the triple product rule for such interrelated variables x y and z comes from using a reciprocity relation on the result of the implicit function theorem and is given by here the subscripts indicate which variables are held constant when the partial derivative is taken that is to explicitly compute the partial derivative of x with respect to y with z held constant one would write x as a function of y and z and take the partial derivative of this function with respect to y only the advantage of the triple product rule is that by rearranging terms one can derive a number of substitution identities which allow one to replace partial derivatives which are difficult to analytically evaluate experimentally measure or integrate with quotients of partial derivatives which are easier to work with for example various other forms of the rule are present

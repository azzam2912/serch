however some of them may use third party proprietary software as part of their workflows to input process or output data preferably these models use open data which facilitates open science energy system models are used to explore future energy systems and are often applied to questions involving energy and climate policy the models themselves vary widely in terms of their type design programming application scope level of detail sophistication and shortcomings for many models some form of mathematical optimization is used to inform the solution process the open energy modeling projects listed here fall exclusively within the bottom up paradigm in which a model is a relatively literal representation of the underlying system several drivers favor the development of open models and open data there is an increasing interest in making public policy energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public there is also a desire to leverage the benefits that open data and open software development can bring including reduced duplication of effort better sharing of ideas and information improved quality and wider engagement and adoption model development is therefore usually a team effort and constituted as either an academic project a commercial

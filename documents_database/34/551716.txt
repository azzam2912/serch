neodymium isotope ratios together with samarium neodymium ratios are used to provide information on age information and the source of igneous melts it is sometimes assumed that at the moment when crustal material is formed from the mantle the neodymium isotope ratio depends only on the time when this event occurred but thereafter it evolves in a way that depends on the new ratio of samarium to neodymium in the crustal material which will be different from the ratio in the mantle material samarium neodymium dating allows us to determine when the crustal material was formed the usefulness of sm nd dating stems from the fact that these two elements are rare earth elements and are thus theoretically not particularly susceptible to partitioning during sedimentation and diagenesis fractional crystallisation of felsic minerals changes the sm nd ratio of the resultant materials this in turn influences the rate at which the nd nd ratio increases due to production of radiogenic nd in many cases sm nd and rb sr isotope data are used together samarium has five naturally occurring isotopes and neodymium has seven the two elements are joined in a parent daughter relationship by the alpha decay of parent sm

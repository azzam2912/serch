a complex magnesium silicate a typical chemical formula for which is mgsio oh 6ho it can be present in fibrous fine particulate and solid forms originally named meerschaum by abraham gottlob werner in 1788 it was named sepiolite by ernst friedrich glocker in 1847 for an occurrence in bettolino baldissero canavese torino province piedmont italy the name comes from greek sepion meaning cuttlebone the porous internal shell of the cuttlefish lithos meaning stone after a perceived resemblance of this mineral to cuttlebone because of its low specific gravity and its high porosity it may float upon water hence its german name it is sometimes found floating on the black sea and rather suggestive of sea foam hence the german origin of the name as well as the french name for the same substance cume de mer sepiolite is opaque and off white grey or cream color breaking with a conchoidal or fine earthy fracture and occasionally fibrous in texture due to the fact it can be readily scratched with the finger nail its hardness is ranked at about 2 on the mohs scale the specific gravity varies from 0 988 to 1 279 but the porosity of the mineral may

in organic chemistry water is added to an unsaturated substrate which is usually an alkene or an alkyne this type of reaction is employed industrially to produce ethanol isopropanol and 2 butanol several billion kilograms of ethylene glycol are produced annually by the hydration of oxirane a cyclic compound also known as ethylene oxide acid catalysts are typically used for the hydration of alkenes the general chemical equation of the reaction is the following a hydroxyl group oh attaches to one carbon of the double bond and a proton h adds to the other carbon of the double bond the reaction is highly exothermic in the first step the alkene acts as a nucleophile and attacks the proton following markovnikov s rule in the second step an ho molecule bonds to the other more highly substituted carbon the oxygen atom at this point has three bonds and carries a positive charge i e the molecule is an oxonium another water molecule comes along and takes up the extra proton this reaction tends to yield many undesirable side products for example diethyl ether in the process of creating ethanol and in its simple form described here is not considered very useful

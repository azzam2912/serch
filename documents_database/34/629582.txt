it is also known as chlorosulfonic acid being the sulfonic acid of chlorine it is a distillable colorless liquid which is hygroscopic and a powerful lachrymator salts and esters of chlorosulfuric acid are known as chlorosulfates chlorosulfuric acid is a tetrahedral molecule the formula is more descriptively written so oh cl but hsocl is traditional it is an intermediate chemically and conceptually between sulfuryl chloride socl and sulfuric acid hso the compound is rarely obtained pure upon standing with excess sulfur trioxide it decomposes to pyrosulfuryl chlorides the industrial synthesis entails the reaction of hydrogen chloride with a solution of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid it can also be prepared by chlorination of sulfuric acid written here for pedagogical purposes as hso oh vs the usual format hso the latter method is more suited for laboratory scale operations clsooh is used to prepare alkyl sulfates which are useful as detergents and as chemical intermediates an early synthesis of saccharin begins with the reaction of toluene with clsooh to give the ortho and para toluenesulfonyl chloride derivatives oxidation of the ortho isomer gives the benzoic acid derivative that then is cyclized with ammonia and neutralized with base to afford saccharin chlorosulphonic

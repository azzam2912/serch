he holds a ph d in physics from the university of georgia 1990 where he studied with m howard lee he is also interested in applying physics to study problems of relevance in a societal context he is a professor of physics at the state university of new york buffalo sen is credited with developing an exact solution for the heisenberg equation of motion in a quantum mechanical many body system in 1991 his studies include work on how solitary waves travel in alignments of elastic beads on how they interact with one another and how these systems tend to reach an equilibrium like state where equipartitioning of energy is not respected which he called the quasi equilibrium state suggestion of a similar state was made soon thereafter by berges et al recently neyenhuis et al may have found some experimental evidence of this quasi equilibrium prethermalization state recently his group has also shown how the energy equipartitioned state may in fact be realized in these systems in 1997 he investigated the possible use of sound bursts in detecting buried small landmines in 2001 he introduced the tapered granular chain impact dispersion system which has since been extensively probed sen

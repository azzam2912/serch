likewise the polynomial ring may be regarded as a free commutative algebra for r a commutative ring the free associative unital algebra on n indeterminates x x is the free r module with a basis consisting of all words over the alphabet x x including the empty word which is the unit of the free algebra this r module becomes an r algebra by defining a multiplication as follows the product of two basis elements is the concatenation of the corresponding words and the product of two arbitrary r module elements is thus uniquely determined because the multiplication in an r algebra must be r bilinear this r algebra is denoted r x x this construction can easily be generalized to an arbitrary set x of indeterminates in short for an arbitrary set formula 2 the free associative unital r algebra on x is with the r bilinear multiplication that is concatenation on words where x denotes the free monoid on x i e words on the letters x formula 4 denotes the external direct sum and rw denotes the free r module on 1 element the word w for example in r x x x x for scalars r

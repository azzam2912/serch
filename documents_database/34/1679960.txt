geometrical optical illusions then relate in the first instance to object characteristics as defined by geometry though vision is three dimensional in many situations depth can be factored out and attention concentrated on a simple view of a two dimensional tablet with its x and y co ordinates whereas their counterparts in the observer s object space are public and have measurable properties the illusions themselves are private to the observer s human or animal experience nevertheless they are accessible to portrayal by verbal and other communication and even to measurement by psychophysics a nulling technique is particularly useful in which a target is deliberately given an opposing deformation in an effort to cancel the illusion visual or optical illusions can be categorized according to the nature of the difference between objects and percepts for example these can be in brightness or color called intensive properties of targets e g mach bands or they can be in their location size orientation or depth called extensive when an illusion involves properties that fall within the purview of geometry it is geometrical optical a term given to it in the first scientific paper devoted to the topic by j j oppel a

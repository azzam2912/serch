the main characteristics of problems that lie in pls are that the cost of a solution can be calculated in polynomial time and the neighborhood of a solution can be searched in polynomial time therefore it is possible to verify whether or not a solution is a local optimum in polynomial time furthermore depending on the problem and the algorithm that is used for solving the problem it might be faster to find a local optimum instead of a global optimum when searching for a local optimum there are two interesting issues to deal with first how to find a local optimum and second how long it takes to find a local optimum for many local search algorithms it is not known whether they can find a local optimum in polynomial time or not so to answer the question of how long it takes to find a local optimum johnson papadimitriou and yannakakis introduced the complexity class pls in their paper how easy is local search it contains local search problems for which the local optimality can be verified in polynomial time a local search problem is in pls if the following properties are satisfied with these properties it is

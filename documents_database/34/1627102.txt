the location where these two winds collide produces a strong shock front that can cause radio x ray and possibly synchrotron radiation emission wind compression in the bow shock region between the two stellar winds allows dust formation when this dust streams away from the orbiting pair it can form a pinwheel nebula of spiraling dust such pinwheels have been observed in the quintuplet cluster the archetype of such a colliding wind binary system is wr 140 hd 193793 which consists of a 20 solar mass wolf rayet star orbiting about a spectral class o4 5 main sequence star every 7 9 years the high orbital eccentricity of the pair allows astronomers to observe changes the colliding winds as their separation varies another prominent example of a colliding wind binary is thought to be eta carinae one of the most luminous objects in the milky way galaxy the first colliding wind binary to be detected in the x ray band outside the milky way galaxy was hd 5980 located in the small magellanic cloud

wavelengths from slightly over one centimeter down to 7 5 millimeters the band is called k short for k above because it is the upper part of the original nato k band which was split into three bands because of the presence of the atmospheric water vapor resonance peak at 22 24 ghz 1 35 cm which made the center unusable for long range transmission the 30 20 ghz band is used in communications satellite uplinks in either the 27 5 ghz and 31 ghz bands and high resolution close range targeting radars aboard military airplanes some frequencies in this radio band are used for vehicle speed detection by law enforcement the kepler mission used this frequency range to downlink the scientific data collected by the space telescope the designation k band is from kurz above which stems from the german word kurz meaning short in satellite communications the k band allows higher bandwidth communication it was first used in the experimental acts gigabit satellite network and is currently used in the inmarsat i 5 system and will be used in the iridium next satellite series kacific k 1 satellite as well as the james webb space telescope the k

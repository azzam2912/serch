in other words it is motion of one species a in response to a concentration gradient in another species b typically a is colloidal particles which are in aqueous solution in which b is a dissolved salt such as sodium chloride and so the particles of a are much larger than the ions of b but both a and b could be polymer molecules and b could be a small molecule for example concentration gradients in ethanol solutions in water move 1 m diameter colloidal particles with diffusiophoretic velocities formula 1 of order 0 1 to 1 m s the movement is towards regions of the solution with lower ethanol concentration and so higher water concentration both species a and b will typically be diffusing but diffusiophoresis is distinct from simple diffusion in simple diffusion a species a moves down a gradient in its own concentration diffusioosmosis also referred to as capillary osmosis is flow of a solution relative to a fixed wall or pore surface where the flow is driven by a concentration gradient in the solution this is distinct from flow relative to a surface driven by a gradient in the hydrostatic pressure in the fluid in diffusioosmosis

in humans bile is produced continuously by the liver liver bile and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder after eating this stored bile is discharged into the duodenum the composition of hepatic bile is 97 98 water 0 7 bile salts 0 2 bilirubin 0 51 fats cholesterol fatty acids and lecithin and 200 meq l inorganic salts about 400 to 800 milliliters of bile is produced per day in adult human beings bile or gall acts to some extent as a surfactant helping to emulsify the lipids in food bile salt anions are hydrophilic on one side and hydrophobic on the other side consequently they tend to aggregate around droplets of lipids triglycerides and phospholipids to form micelles with the hydrophobic sides towards the fat and hydrophilic sides facing outwards the hydrophilic sides are negatively charged and this charge prevents fat droplets coated with bile from re aggregating into larger fat particles ordinarily the micelles in the duodenum have a diameter around 14 33 m the dispersion of food fat into micelles provides a greatly increased surface area for the action of the enzyme pancreatic lipase which actually digests the triglycerides and is able to reach the fatty core

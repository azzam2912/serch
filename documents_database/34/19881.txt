a sequence of functions formula 1 converges uniformly to a limiting function formula 2 on a set formula 3 if given any arbitrarily small positive number formula 4 a number formula 5 can be found such that each of the functions formula 6 differ from formula 2 by no more than formula 4 at every point formula 9 in formula 3 described in an informal way if formula 11 converges to formula 2 uniformly then the rate at which formula 13 approaches formula 14 is uniform throughout its domain in the following sense in order to determine how large formula 15 needs to be to guarantee that formula 13 falls within a certain distance formula 4 of formula 14 we do not need to know the value of formula 19 in question there is a single value of formula 20 independent of formula 9 such that choosing formula 15 to be larger than formula 5 will suffice the difference between uniform convergence and pointwise convergence was not fully appreciated early in the history of calculus leading to instances of faulty reasoning the concept which was first formalized by karl weierstrass is important because several properties of the functions formula 11

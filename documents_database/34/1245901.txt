it is a variant of gaussian quadrature in which the evaluation points are chosen so that an accurate approximation can be computed by re using the information produced by the computation of a less accurate approximation it is an example of what is called a nested quadrature rule for the same set of function evaluation points it has two quadrature rules one higher order and one lower order the latter called an embedded rule the difference between these two approximations is used to estimate the calculational error of the integration these formulas are named after alexander kronrod who invented them in the 1960s and carl friedrich gauss the problem in numerical integration is to approximate definite integrals of the form such integrals can be approximated for example by n point gaussian quadrature where w x are the weights and points at which to evaluate the function f x if the interval a b is subdivided the gauss evaluation points of the new subintervals never coincide with the previous evaluation points except at the midpoint for odd numbers of evaluation points and thus the integrand must be evaluated at every point gauss kronrod formulas are extensions of the gauss quadrature formulas

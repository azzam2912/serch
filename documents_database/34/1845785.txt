the model name is written in kendall s notation agner krarup erlang first published on this model in 1909 starting the subject of queueing theory an extension of this model with more than one server is the m d c queue an m d 1 queue is a stochastic process whose state space is the set 0 1 2 3 where the value corresponds to the number of entities in the system including any currently in service the state space diagram for m d 1 queue is as below the transition probability matrix for an m d 1 queue with arrival rate and service time 1 such that m g 1 type markov chain and the stationary distribution found for state i written in the case d 1 to be define as the utilization then the mean delay in the system in m d 1 queue is and in the queue the busy period is the time period measured from the instant a first customer arrives at an empty queue to the time when the queue is again empty this time period is equal to d times the number of customers served if borel distribution with parameter a stationary distribution

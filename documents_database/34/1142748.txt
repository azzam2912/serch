when implemented this model ensures the same event message is received by multiple physical devices using multicast or broadcast services the gse control model is further subdivided into goose generic object oriented substation events and gsse generic substation state events generic object oriented substation events goose is a controlled model mechanism in which any format of data status value is grouped into a data set and transmitted within a time period of 4 milliseconds the following mechanisms are used to ensure specified transmission speed and reliability generic substation state events gsse is an extension of event transfer mechanism in uca2 0 only status data can be exchanged through gsse and it uses a status list string of bits rather than a dataset as is used in goose gsse messages are transmitted directly over iec iso 8802 2 and 8802 3 using a similar mechanism to goose messages refer iec 61850 7 1 clause 12 2 iec 61850 8 1 clause 6 4 as the gsse format is simpler than goose it is handled faster in some devices gsse is being progressively superseded by the use of goose and support for it may eventually disappear equipment manufacturers have started to offer

robin an approximate formula for the capacity of a sealed expanded bag is where w is the width of the bag the shorter dimension h is the height the longer dimension and v is the maximum volume the approximation ignores the crimping round the equator of the bag a very rough approximation to the capacity of a bag that is open at one edge is this latter formula assumes that the corners at the bottom of the bag are linked by a single edge and that the base of the bag is not a more complex shape such as a lens in the special case where the bag is sealed on all edges and is square with unit sides h w 1 and so the first formula estimates a volume for this of roughly or roughly 0 19 according to andrew kepert at the university of newcastle australia an upper bound for this version of the teabag problem is 0 217 and he has made a construction that appears to give a volume of 0 2055 in the article referred to above a c robin also found a more complicated formula for the general paper bag whilst this is beyond

like other strains of clostridium it is an anaerobic rod shaped bacterium that produces oval subterminal endospores and is commonly found in soil unlike clostridium botulinum it does not produce the botulinum neurotoxins in colonized animals it has a mutualistic rather than pathogenic interaction with the host it is being investigated as a way to deliver cancer treating drugs to tumours in patients c sporogenes is often used as a surrogate for c botulinum when testing the efficacy of commercial sterilisation clostridium sporogenes colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract but is only present in a subset of the population in the intestine it uses tryptophan to synthesize indole and subsequently ipa a type of auxin plant hormone which serves as a potent neuroprotective antioxidant within the human body and brain ipa is an even more potent scavenger of hydroxyl radicals than melatonin similar to melatonin but unlike other antioxidants it scavenges radicals without subsequently generating reactive and pro oxidant intermediate compounds c sporogenes is the only species of bacteria known to synthesize 3 indolepropionic acid in vivo at levels which are subsequently detectable in the blood stream of the host

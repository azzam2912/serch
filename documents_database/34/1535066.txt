it can be compared to long short term memory lstm in functionality but is more biologically explainable it uses the primary value learned value model to train prefrontal cortex working memory updating system based on the biology of the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia it is used as part of the leabra framework and was implemented in emergent the prefrontal cortex has long been thought to subserve both working memory the holding of information online for processing and executive functions deciding how to manipulate working memory and perform processing although many computational models of working memory have been developed the mechanistic basis of executive function remains elusive pbwm is a computational model of the prefrontal cortex to control both itself and other brain areas in a strategic task appropriate manner these learning mechanisms are based on subcortical structures in the midbrain basal ganglia and amygdala which together form an actor critic architecture the critic system learns which prefrontal representations are task relevant and trains the actor which in turn provides a dynamic gating mechanism for controlling working memory updating computationally the learning mechanism is designed to simultaneously solve the temporal and structural credit assignment problems the model s performance compares

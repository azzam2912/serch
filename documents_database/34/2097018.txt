each die in the system is responsible for adding more shape to the part until the metal work piece attains its final shape what makes transfer stamping unique is that a single press operates a number of tools the movement of the sheet metal work piece from one operation to the next is performed by automation either built into the press or onto the dies with each closing of the press the entire system of tools will close each performing its designed work to the sheet metal upon opening the built in transfer mechanism moves the workpiece from one operation to the next in the sequence in the past these operations may have been performed using individual presses and the workpieces may have been moved from press to press and die to die by hand as automation improved hand loading was replaced by pick and place automation and by robots the transfer press is a natural extension of this practice simplifying the operation by having all tools in a single large press and using automation which is specifically designed for the press operations named for the movement of the transfer mechanism tri axis transfer mechanisms motion is defined by the

invented in october 2013 by urbanalps ag in switzerland it is a 3d metal printed key which hides the mechanical security features inside of the key rendering it virtually unscannable i e except by using x ray analysis the complimentary cylinder is a purely mechanical design and is able to read the internal bittings of the key if the code is matching the user is then able to turn the cylinder and open the lock history the stealth key concept originated as the response to an important physical security breach unauthorized key duplication by 3d printing with 3d printers and 3d scanners reaching the consumer market in early 2010 the key copy and patent protection of most security keys was made obsolete many amateur users were reported duplicating security keys and several companies offering key duplication services using smartphone images began commercial operation in essence mostly any object can be 3d printed the core point is if the mechanical code of the key can be 3d scanned or photographed with code concealing being one of the most secure ways to protect it additive manufacturing of keys unlike most ordinary keys which were produced by key blank stamping and subsequent hole

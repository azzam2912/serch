oct 4 is a homeodomain transcription factor of the pou family it is critically involved in the self renewal of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells as such it is frequently used as a marker for undifferentiated cells oct 4 expression must be closely regulated too much or too little will cause differentiation of the cells oct 4 is a member of the octamer transcription factor family so named because they bind the octameric 8 unit dna nucleotide sequence atttgcat oct 4 transcription factor is initially active as a maternal factor in the oocyte and remains active in embryos throughout the preimplantation period oct 4 expression is associated with an undifferentiated phenotype and tumors gene knockdown of oct 4 promotes differentiation demonstrating a role for these factors in human embryonic stem cell self renewal oct 4 can form a heterodimer with sox2 so that these two proteins bind dna together mouse embryos that are oct 4 deficient or have low expression levels of oct 4 fail to form the inner cell mass lose pluripotency and differentiate into trophectoderm therefore the level of oct 4 expression in mice is vital for regulating pluripotency and early cell differentiation since one of its main functions

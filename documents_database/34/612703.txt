its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral it has a composite wythoff symbol 3 5 3 3 2 5 2 requiring two different schwarz triangles to generate it 3 5 3 3 2 and 3 5 3 5 2 3 5 3 3 2 represents the great dodecicosahedron with an extra 12 10 2 pentagons and 3 5 3 5 2 represents it with an extra 20 6 2 triangles its vertex figure 6 10 3 6 5 10 7 is also ambiguous having two clockwise and two counterclockwise faces around each vertex it shares its vertex arrangement with the truncated dodecahedron it additionally shares its edge arrangement with the great icosicosidodecahedron having the hexagonal faces in common and the great ditrigonal dodecicosidodecahedron having the decagrammic faces in common there is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space hence the neo filling is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling in the neo filling orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally but non orientable polyhedra have their faces

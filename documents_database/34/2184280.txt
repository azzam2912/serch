this definition distinguishes them from smaller variants that are less than 1 kb in size such as short deletions insertions and single nucleotide variants humans have an incredibly complex and intricate genome that has been shaped and modified over time by evolution about 99 9 of the dna sequence in the human genome is conserved between individuals from all over the world but some variation does exist single nucleotide polymorphisms snps are considered to be the largest contributor to genetic variation in humans since they are so abundant and easily detectable it is estimated that there are at least 10 million snps within the human population but there are also many other types of genetic variants and they occur at dramatically different scales the variation between genomes in the human population range from single nucleotide polymorphisms to dramatic alterations in the human karyotype human genetic variation is responsible for the phenotypic differences between individuals in the human population there are different types of genetic variation and it is studied extensively in order to better understand its significance these studies lead to discoveries associating genetic variants to certain phenotypes as well as their implications in disease at first before dna sequencing

he is considered one of the founders of the theory of automorphic representations and their associated l functions and his results play a central role in modern number theory jacquet entered the cole normale sup rieure in 1959 and obtained his doctorat d tat under the direction of roger godement in 1967 he held academic positions at the centre national de la recherche scientifique 1963 1969 the institute for advanced study in princeton 1967 1969 the university of maryland at college park 1969 1970 the graduate center of the city university of new york 1970 1974 and became a professor at columbia university in 1974 becoming professor emeritus in 2007 the book by herv jacquet and robert langlands on formula 1 was an eclipsing event in the history of number theory it presented a representation theory of automorphic forms and their associated l functions for the general linear group formula 1 establishing among other things the jacquet langlands correspondence which explains very precisely how automorphic forms for formula 1 relate to those for quaternion algebras equally important was the book by roger godement and herv jacquet which defined for the first time the standard l functions attached to automorphic representations

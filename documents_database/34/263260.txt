in non mammalian vertebrates the homologous structure is known as the optic tectum or optic lobe the adjective form tectal is commonly used for both structures in mammals the superior colliculus forms a major component of the midbrain it is a paired structure and together with the paired inferior colliculi form the corpora quadrigemina the superior colliculus is a layered structure with a number of layers that varies by species the layers can be grouped into the superficial layers stratum opticum and above and the deeper remaining layers neurons in the superficial layers receive direct input from the retina and respond almost exclusively to visual stimuli many neurons in the deeper layers also respond to other modalities and some respond to stimuli in multiple modalities the deeper layers also contain a population of motor related neurons capable of activating eye movements as well as other responses the general function of the tectal system is to direct behavioral responses toward specific points in egocentric body centered space each layer contains a topographic map of the surrounding world in retinotopic coordinates and activation of neurons at a particular point in the map evokes a response directed toward the corresponding point in space

according to the modern discoveries in physics forces are not transmitted directly between interacting objects but instead are described and interrupted by intermediary entities called fields classically however a duality of the fields is combined into a single physical field for over a century unified field theory remains an open line of research and the term was coined by albert einstein who attempted to unify his general theory of relativity with electromagnetism the theory of everything and grand unified theory are closely related to unified field theory but differ by not requiring the basis of nature to be fields and often by attempting to explain physical constants of nature earlier attempts based on classical physics are described in the article on classical unified field theories the goal of a unified field theory has led to a great deal of progress for future theoretical physics and progress continues governed by a global event formula 1 under the universal topology an operational environment is initiated by the scalar fields formula 2 of a rank 0 tensor a differentiable function of a complex variable in its domain at its zero derivative where a scalar function formula 3 or formula 4 is characterized as

such corrections may or may not be possible to do on line as opposed to an off line repair during which the system is unavailable to users many raid configurations feature spare disks that are already installed and can be automatically added to the array as needed when this happens the array may or may not go into degraded mode until the spare is rebuilt but in any case should not be in degraded mode after the spare is rebuilt if no spares are available the array will remain in degraded mode until a spare disk is added or the array is reconfigured if that is possible for the configuration in question a typical case where a raid enters degraded mode is a simple two drive mirror after a power failure it is unlikely the drives are in sync every time blocks are written to the storage elements physical drives in this case certain accounting information is updated after the write the raid controller will notice that the storage elements are not in sync will place the array in degraded mode and generally will start a background resync rebuild operation simple mirroring solutions will resynchronize the entire array block by

it is also the logical phase of a typical flight the climb phase or climbout following takeoff and preceding the cruise during the climb phase there is an increase in altitude to a predetermined level a steady climb is carried out by using excess thrust the amount by which the thrust from the power plant exceeds the drag on the aircraft the aircraft will climb steadily until the excess thrust falls to zero excess thrust might fall to zero as a result of the pilot s deliberate action in control of the output of the engines or as the engines response to reducing air density the climb phase also known as climb out or initial climb is the period during which the aircraft climbs to a predetermined cruising altitude after take off the climb phase immediately follows take off and precedes the cruise phase of the flight although a single climb phase is typical multiple climb phases may alternate with cruise phases particularly for very long flights in which altitude is increased as the weight of fuel aboard decreases see step climb as the climb progresses the rate of climb decreases as thrust reduces due to reducing air density a

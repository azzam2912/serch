the suture strongly margined the whorls are angulated by a row of large nodules the spire is high the anal sinus is moderately deep the sculpture consists of a row of large oval nodules on the middle of the whorls about 14 on a whorl those on the last two whorls are somewhat stretched out towards the suture below and incised in the middle by a spiral linear groove a very strong spiral cord margins the suture below and a fine thread above the latter is continued as a rather strong cord on the body whorl and is succeeded below by a similar cord the base of the body whorl is adorned with fine spiral threads close together upon the beak the whole sculpture is crossed by very fine strongly flexuous and oblique growth lines the spire is high conic somewhat less than twice the height of the aperture the protoconch consists of 2 whorls which are microscopically spirally striate the nucleus is oblique rounded the second volution shows a sharp median keel the shell contains 7 whorls regularly increasing roundly angled at the middle by the nodules concave above and below it the body whorl is slightly convex contracted

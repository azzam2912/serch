prob1 is also known as c5orf65 and weakly similar to basic proline rich protein the prob1 gene is 3251 bp long and contains a single exon the prob1 gene is located on human chromosome 5 cytogenetic band 5q31 2 prob1 is expressed in 89 types of tissue in the human body with highest expression in the skeletal muscle of the leg and cardiac muscle of the heart while mrna expression is somewhat ubiquitous and was also elevated in the spinal cord cerebrum and lymphocytes measurable protein expression was only recorded in cardiac and skeletal muscle prob1 is composed of 1015 amino acids it contains two proline rich regions which compose the majority of the protein and a domain of unknown function duf predicted secondary structures for prob1 reveal that the protein is mostly composed of random coils with a small percentage of alpha helices and beta sheets present this is likely due to the properties of proline its large size ring structure and confined phi angle cause it to disrupt secondary structure formation the duf which resides in the second proline rich region of the protein is also predicted to be completely composed of random coils a tertiary structure prediction

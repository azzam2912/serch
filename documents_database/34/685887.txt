typically some members of a target library have been well characterized where both the function has been determined and compounds that modulate the function of those targets ligands in the case of receptors inhibitors of enzymes or blockers of ion channels have been identified other members of the target family may have unknown function with no known ligands and hence are classified as orphan receptors by identifying screening hits that modulate the activity of the less well characterized members of the target family the function of these novel targets can be elucidated furthermore the hits for these targets can be used as a starting point for drug discovery the completion of the human genome project has provided an abundance of potential targets for therapeutic intervention chemogenomics strives to study the intersection of all possible drugs on all of these potential targets a common method to construct a targeted chemical library is to include known ligands of at least one and preferably several members of the target family since a portion of ligands that were designed and synthesized to bind to one family member will also bind to additional family members the compounds contained in a targeted chemical library should collectively

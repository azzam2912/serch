the researcher defines the sets of operations variables and parameters the computer program generates a number of mathematical equations that satisfy given restrictions then the optimization algorithm finds the structure of appropriate mathematical expression and its parameters network operator is a directed graph that corresponds to some mathematical expressions every source nodes of the graph are variables or constants of mathematical expression inner nodes correspond to binary operations and edges correspond to unary operations the calculation s result of mathematical expression is kept in the last sink node consider the following mathematical expression the graph for expression is presented in fig 1 on the edges we place unary operations formula 1 formula 2 formula 3 formula 4 in the inner and sink nodes we place binary operations formula 5 formula 6 expression 1 can be presented in the pc memory as a nom any mathematical expression can be presented as a network operator matrix to calculate the mathematical expression by the network operator matrix the node vector is used each component of node vector corresponds to the nodes of the network operator graph initially each component is equal to the argument for the given node or the unit element of

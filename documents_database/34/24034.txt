the term usually indicates ribose which occurs widely in nature and is discussed here its synthetic mirror image ribose is not found in nature ribose was first reported in 1891 by emil fischer it is a c 2 carbon epimer of the sugar arabinose both isomers of which are named for their source gum arabic and ribose itself is named as a partial rearrangement of letters in the word arabinose the ribose ribofuranose forms part of the backbone of rna it is related to deoxyribose which is found in dna phosphorylated derivatives of ribose such as atp and nadh play central roles in metabolism camp and cgmp formed from atp and gtp serve as secondary messengers in some signalling pathways ribose is an aldopentose a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms that in its open chain form has an aldehyde functional group at one end in the conventional numbering scheme for monosaccharides the carbon atoms are numbered from c1 in the aldehyde group to c5 the deoxyribose derivative found in dna differs from ribose by having a hydrogen atom in place of the hydroxyl group at c2 this hydroxyl group performs a function in rna splicing like many monosaccharides ribose exists

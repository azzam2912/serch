paul feyerabend argued for counterinduction as a way to test unchallenged scientific theories unchallenged simply because there are no structures within the scientific paradigm to challenge itself see crotty 1998 p 39 for instance feyerabend is quoted as saying the following therefore the first step in our criticism of customary concepts and customary reactions is to step outside the circle and either to invent a new conceptual system for example a new theory that clashes with the most carefully established observational results and confounds the most plausible theoretical principles or to import such a system from the outside science from religion from mythology from the ideas of incompetents or the ramblings of madmen feyerabend 1993 pp 52 3 this gets into the pluralistic methodology that feyerabend espouses that will help support counterinductive methods paul feyerabend s anarchist theory popularized the notion of counterinduction most of the time when counterinduction is mentioned it is not presented as a valid rule instead it is given as a refutation of max black s proposed inductive justification of induction since the counterinductive justification of counterinduction is formally identical to the inductive justification of induction for further information see problem of induction

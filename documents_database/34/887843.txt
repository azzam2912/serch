thus they may be constructed in the same way as the quaternions except using dual numbers instead of real numbers as coefficients a dual quaternion can be represented in the form where a and b are ordinary quaternions and is the dual unit which satisfies and commutes with every element of the algebra unlike quaternions the dual quaternions do not form a division algebra in mechanics the dual quaternions are applied as a number system to represent rigid transformations in three dimensions since the space of dual quaternions is 8 dimensional and a rigid transformation have six real degrees of freedom three for translations and three for rotations dual quaternions obeying two algebraic constraints are used in this application similar to the way that rotations in 3d space can be represented by quaternions of unit length rigid motions in 3d space can be represented by dual quaternions of unit length this fact is used in theoretical kinematics see mccarthy and in applications to 3d computer graphics robotics and computer vision w r hamilton introduced quaternions in 1843 and by 1873 w k clifford obtained a broad generalization of these numbers that he called biquaternions which is an example of what

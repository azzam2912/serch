it has a rotating axis positioned vertically while the wind catching blades move parallel to the wind by contrast the shaft of a horizontal axis wind turbine hawt points into the wind while its blades move at right angles to the wind s thrust that is a panemone primarily uses drag whereas the blades of a hawt use lift historically the earliest known wind machine was made by the persians and it was the panemone design consisting of a wall with slits surrounding a vertical axle containing four to eight fabric sails as the wind blew the sails would turn the axle which was in turn connected to grain grinders or some form of water transportation device though little is known of the actual details of such methods the earliest recorded windmill design found was persian in origin and was invented some time around 700 900 ad this design was the panemone with vertical lightweight wooden sails attached by horizontal struts to a central vertical shaft it was first built to pump water and subsequently modified to grind grain as well wind powered machines may have been known earlier but there is no clear evidence of windmills prior to the

often the unit square refers specifically to the square in the cartesian plane with corners at the four points and in a cartesian coordinate system with coordinates the unit square is defined as the square consisting of the points where both and lie in a closed unit interval from to that is the unit square is the cartesian product where denotes the closed unit interval the unit square can also be thought of as a subset of the complex plane the topological space formed by the complex numbers in this view the four corners of the unit square are at the four complex numbers and it is not known whether any point in the plane is a rational distance from all four vertices of the unit square however according to p riat the only points included in the square of rational distances of the four vertices are necessarily on the sides with the point formula 1 suppose that formula 2 then the distance formula 3 what is becoming general for the plan let the point formula 1 be in the first dial formula 5 if we have the distance formula 2 then the distance formula 7

normally patients would be allocated to a treatment group randomly and while this maintains a good overall balance it can lead to imbalances within sub groups for example if a majority of the patients who were receiving the active drug happened to be male or smokers the statistical usefulness of the study would be reduced the traditional method to avoid this problem known as blocked randomisation is to stratify patients according to a number of factors e g male and female or smokers and non smokers and to use a separate randomisation list for each group each randomisation list would be created such that after every block of x patients there would be an equal number in each treatment group the problem with this method is that the number of lists increases exponentially with the number of stratification factors minimisation addresses this problem by calculating the imbalance within each factor should the patient be allocated to a particular treatment group the various imbalances are added together to give the overall imbalance in the study the treatment group that would minimise the imbalance can be chosen directly or a random element may be added perhaps allocating a higher chance to the

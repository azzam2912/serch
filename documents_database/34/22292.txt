this scientific law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target fitts s law is used to model the act of pointing either by physically touching an object with a hand or finger or virtually by pointing to an object on a computer monitor using a pointing device fitts s law has been shown to apply under a variety of conditions with many different limbs hands feet the lower lip head mounted sights eye gaze manipulanda input devices physical environments including underwater and user populations young old special educational needs and drugged participants the original 1954 paper by paul morris fitts proposed a metric to quantify the difficulty of a target selection task the metric was based on an information analogy where the distance to the center of the target d is like a signal and the tolerance or width of the target w is like noise the metric is fitts s index of difficulty id in bits formula 1 fitts also proposed an index of performance ip in bits per second as a measure of human performance

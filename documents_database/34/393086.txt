emile zuckerkandl and the physical chemist linus carl pauling introduced the term paleogenetics in 1963 in reference to the examination of possible applications in the reconstruction of past polypeptide sequences the first sequence of an ancient dna isolated from a museum specimen of the extinct quagga was published in 1984 by a team led by allan wilson paleogeneticists do not recreate actual organisms but piece together ancient dna sequences using various analytical methods in many ways an organism s genetics are the only direct witnesses of extinct species and of evolutionary events similar sequences are often found along protein polypeptide chains in different species this similarity is directly linked to the sequence of the dna the genetic material of the organism due to the improbability of this being random chance and its consistency too long to be attributed to convergence by natural selection these similarities can be plausibly linked to the existence of a common ancestor with common genes this allows polypeptide sequences to be compared between species and the difference between two genetic sequences can be used to determine within error the time at which a common ancestor existed using the thigh bone of a neanderthal female 63 of

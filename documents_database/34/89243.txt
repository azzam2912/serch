specifically ban logic helps its users determine whether exchanged information is trustworthy secured against eavesdropping or both ban logic starts with the assumption that all information exchanges happen on media vulnerable to tampering and public monitoring this has evolved into the popular security mantra don t trust the network a typical ban logic sequence includes three steps ban logic uses postulates and definitions like all axiomatic systems to analyze authentication protocols use of the ban logic often accompanies a security protocol notation formulation of a protocol and is sometimes given in papers ban logic and logics in the same family are decidable there exists an algorithm taking ban hypotheses and a purported conclusion and that answers whether or not the conclusion is derivable from the hypotheses the proposed algorithms use a variant of magic sets ban logic inspired many other similar formalisms such as gny logic some of these try to repair one weakness of ban logic the lack of a good semantics with a clear meaning in terms of knowledge and possible universes however starting in the mid 1990s crypto protocols were analyzed in operational models assuming perfect cryptography using model checkers and numerous bugs were found in protocols

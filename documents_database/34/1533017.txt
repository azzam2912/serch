three leading views of the rhetorical situation exist today one argues that a situation determines and brings about rhetoric another proposes that rhetoric creates situations by making issues salient and yet another explores the rhetor as an artist of rhetoric creating salience through a knowledge of commonplaces lloyd bitzer began the conversation in his 1968 piece titled the rhetorical situation bitzer wrote that rhetorical discourse is called into existence by situation he defined the rhetorical situation as a complex of persons events objects and relations presenting an actual or potential exigence which can be completely or partially removed if discourse introduced into the situation can so constrain human decision or action as to bring about the significant modification of the exigence with any rhetorical discourse a prior rhetorical situation exists the rhetorical situation dictates the significant physical and verbal responses as well as the sorts of observations to be made an example of this would be a president focusing on health care policy reform because it is an apparent problem the situation thus calls for the president to respond with rhetorical discourse concerning this issue in other words rhetorical meaning is brought about by events although many situations may exist

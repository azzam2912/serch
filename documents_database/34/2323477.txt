the first spo algorithm was proposed for two dimensional unconstrained optimization based on two dimensional spiral models this was extended to n dimensional problems by generalizing the two dimensional spiral model to an n dimensional spiral model there are effective settings for the spo algorithm the periodic descent direction setting and the convergence setting the motivation for focusing on spiral phenomena was due to the insight that the dynamics that generate logarithmic spirals share the diversification and intensification behavior the diversification behavior can work for a global search exploration and the intensification behavior enables an intensive search around a current found good solution exploitation the spo algorithm is a multipoint search algorithm that has no objective function gradient which uses multiple spiral models that can be described as deterministic dynamical systems as search points follow logarithmic spiral trajectories towards the common center defined as the current best point better solutions can be found and the common center can be updated the general spo algorithm for a minimization problem under the maximum iteration formula 1 termination criterion is as follows the search performance depends on setting the composite rotation matrix formula 15 the step rate formula 8 and the initial points

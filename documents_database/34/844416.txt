an abnormal development in the optic stalk causes optic disc dysplasia which is caused by a mutation in the pax2 gene the nerve head typically resembles the morning glory disc anomaly but has also been described as a coloboma a coloboma is the failure to close the choroid fissure which is the opening from the ventral side of the retina in the optic stalk despite the similarities with coloboma and morning glory anomaly significant differences exist such that optic disc dysplasia cannot be classified as either one entity optic disc dysplasia is noted by an ill defined inferior excavation convoluted origin of the superior retinal vessels excessive number of vessels infrapapillary pigmentary disturbance and slight band of retinal elevation adjacent to the disk some patients have normal or near normal vision but others have visual impairment associated with the disease though it is not certain if this is due only to the dysplastic optic nerves or a possible contribution from macular and retinal malformations the retinal vessels are abnormal or absent in some cases having small vessels exiting the periphery of the disc there is a great deal of clinical variability the most common malformation in patients with the syndrome

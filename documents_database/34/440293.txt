mfsk is a form of m ary orthogonal modulation where each symbol consists of one element from an alphabet of orthogonal waveforms m the size of the alphabet is usually a power of two so that each symbol represents logm bits in a m ary signaling system like mfsk an alphabet of m tones is established and the transmitter selects one tone at a time from the alphabet for transmission m is usually a power of 2 so each tone transmission from the alphabet represents log m data bits mfsk is classed as an m ary orthogonal signaling scheme because each of the m tone detection filters at the receiver responds only to its tone and not at all to the others this independence provides the orthogonality like other m ary orthogonal schemes the required e n ratio for a given probability of error decreases as m increases without the need for multisymbol coherent detection in fact as m approaches infinity the required e n ratio decreases asymptotically to the shannon limit of 1 6db however this decrease is slow with increasing m and large values are impractical because of the exponential increase in required bandwidth typical values in practice

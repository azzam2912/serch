rgps also produce certain lineages of glia including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes their cell bodies somata reside in the embryonic ventricular zone which lies next to the developing ventricular system during development newborn neurons use radial glia as scaffolds traveling along the radial glial fibers in order to reach their final destinations despite the various possible fates of the radial glial population it has been demonstrated through clonal analysis that most radial glia have restricted unipotent or multipotent fates radial glia can be found during the neurogenic phase in all vertebrates studied to date the term radial glia refers to the morphological characteristics of these cells that were first observed namely their radial processes and their similarity to astrocytes another member of the glial cell family m ller glia are radial glial cells that are present in the developing as well as the adult retina as in the cortex m ller glia have long processes that span the entire width of the retina from the basal cell layer to the apical layer however unlike cortical radial glia m ller glia do not appear in the retina until after the first rounds of neurogenesis have occurred studies suggest that m ller glia

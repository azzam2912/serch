its unit is kilogram per second in si units and slug per second or pound per second in us customary units the common symbol is formula 1 pronounced m dot although sometimes greek lowercase mu is used sometimes mass flow rate is termed mass flux or mass current see for example fluid mechanics schaum s et al in this article the more intuitive definition is used mass flow rate is defined by the limit the reason for the dot product is as follows the only mass flowing through the cross section is the amount normal to the area i e parallel to the unit normal this amount is where is the angle between the unit normal formula 4 and the velocity of mass elements the amount passing through the cross section is reduced by the factor formula 5 as increases less mass passes through all mass which passes in tangential directions to the area that is perpendicular to the unit normal doesn t actually pass through the area so the mass passing through the area is zero this occurs when 2 these results are equivalent to the equation containing the dot product sometimes these equations are used to define the

this idea is more broadly referred to as programmable matter claytronics has the potential to greatly affect many areas of daily life such as telecommunication human computer interfaces and entertainment current research is exploring the potential of modular reconfigurable robotics and the complex software necessary to control the shape changing robots locally distributed predicates or ldp is a distributed high level language for programming modular reconfigurable robot systems mrrs there are many challenges associated with programming and controlling a large number of discrete modular systems due to the degrees of freedom that correspond with each module for example reconfiguring from one formation to one similar may require a complex path of movements controlled by an intricate string of commands even though the two shapes differ slightly in 2005 research efforts to develop a hardware concept were successful on the scale of millimeters creating cylindrical prototypes 44 millimeters in diameter which interact with each other via electromagnetic attraction their experiments helped researchers verify the relationship between mass and potential force between objects as a 10 fold reduction in size which should translate to a 100 fold increase in force relative to mass recent advancements in this prototype concept are in the

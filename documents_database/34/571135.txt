when the target analyte concentration changes the current through the transistor will change accordingly here the analyte solution separates the source and gate electrodes a concentration gradient between the solution and the gate electrode arises due to a semi permeable membrane on the fet surface containing receptor moieties that preferentially bind the target analyte this concentration gradient of charged analyte ions creates a chemical potential between the source and gate which is in turn measured by the fet a chemfet s source and drain are constructed as for an isfet with the gate electrode separated from the source electrode by a solution the gate electrode s interface with the solution is a semi permeable membrane containing the receptors and a gap to allow the substance under test to come in contact with the sensitive receptor moieties a chemfet s threshold voltage depends on the concentration gradient between the analyte in solution and the analyte in contact with its receptor embedded semi permeable barrier often ionophores are used to facilitate analyte ion mobility through the substrate to the receptor for example when targeting anions quaternary ammonium salts such as tetraoctylammonium bromide are used to provide cationic nature to the membrane facilitating

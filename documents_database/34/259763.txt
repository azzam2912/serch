it is a complex process that is not completely understood because of the variety and complexity of mechanisms that can lead to embrittlement mechanisms that have been proposed to explain embrittlement include the formation of brittle hydrides the creation of voids that can lead to bubbles and pressure build up within a material and enhanced decohesion or localised plasticity that assist in the propagation of cracks for hydrogen embrittlement to occur a combination of three conditions are required hydrogen is often introduced during manufacture from operations such as forming coating plating or cleaning hydrogen may also be introduced over time through environmental exposure soils and chemicals including water corrosion processes especially galvanic corrosion including corrosion of a coating and cathodic protection the hydrogen embrittlement phenomenon was first described in 1875 during hydrogen embrittlement hydrogen is introduced to the surface of a metal and individual hydrogen atoms diffuse through the metal structure because the solubility of hydrogen increases at higher temperatures raising the temperature can increase the diffusion of hydrogen when assisted by a concentration gradient where there is significantly more hydrogen outside the metal than inside hydrogen diffusion can occur even at lower temperatures there are a variety of mechanisms

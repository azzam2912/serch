it is usually denoted by the symbols the laplacian of a function at a point is up to a factor the rate at which the average value of over spheres centered at deviates from as the radius of the sphere shrinks towards 0 in a cartesian coordinate system the laplacian is given by the sum of second partial derivatives of the function with respect to each independent variable in other coordinate systems such as cylindrical and spherical coordinates the laplacian also has a useful form the laplace operator is named after the french mathematician pierre simon de laplace 1749 1827 who first applied the operator to the study of celestial mechanics where the operator gives a constant multiple of the mass density when it is applied to the gravitational potential due to the mass distribution with that given density solutions of the equation now called laplace s equation are the so called harmonic functions and represent the possible gravitational fields in regions of vacuum the laplacian occurs in differential equations that describe many physical phenomena such as electric and gravitational potentials the diffusion equation for heat and fluid flow wave propagation and quantum mechanics the laplacian represents the flux density

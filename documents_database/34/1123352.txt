it belongs to the benitoite group of minerals the chemical formula of pabstite is ba sn ti sio it is found in santa cruz california the crystal system of the mineral is hexagonal pabstite is 37 7 sio 3 8 tio 24 4 sno and 33 2 bao however ti and sn could vary from point to point by approximately 0 5 tio and 1 sno pabstite is a tin bearing analog of benitoite although sn 0 71 and ti 0 68 have similar charge and ionic size it is uncommon to find them substituting each other pabstite commonly occurs as anhedral crystals and masses that vary in their color from colorless to white they produce a pink tinge when they are freshly broken large amounts of pabstite were found in santa cruz as fracture filling and disseminated grains in recrystallized siliceous limestones this is geologic evidence of contact metamorphism in addition pabstite can be found in rush creek in california when benitoite contains small amounts of tin it is commonly occurs in rocks that contain calcite quartz tremolite witherite phlogopite diopside minor amounts of forsterite and taramellite pabstite can also be found associated with galena cassiterite and sphalerite pabstite

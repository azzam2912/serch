if in the above definition one interchanges left and right one obtains a negatively oriented curve crucial to this definition is the fact that every simple closed curve admits a well defined interior that follows from the jordan curve theorem all simple closed curves can be classified as negatively oriented clockwise positively oriented counterclockwise or non orientable the inner loop of a beltway road in the united states or other countries where people drive on the right side of the road would be an example of a negatively oriented clockwise curve a circle oriented counterclockwise is an example of a positively oriented curve the same circle oriented clockwise would be a negatively oriented curve the concept of orientation of a curve is just a particular case of the notion of orientation of a manifold that is besides orientation of a curve one may also speak of orientation of a surface hypersurface etc here the interior and the exterior of a curve both inherit the usual orientation of the plane the positive orientation on the curve is then the orientation it inherits as the boundary of its interior the negative orientation is inherited from the exterior in two dimensions given an

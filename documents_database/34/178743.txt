a great variety of physical processes belonging to the areas of quantum computing condensed matter atomic and molecular physics and nuclear and particle physics can be conveniently studied in terms of two level quantum mechanical systems and exhibit rabi flopping when coupled to an oscillatory driving field the effect is important in quantum optics magnetic resonance and quantum computing and is named after isidor isaac rabi a two level system has two possible levels and if they are not degenerate i e not equal energy the system can become excited when it absorbs a quantum of energy when an atom or some other two level system is illuminated by a coherent beam of photons it will cyclically absorb photons and re emit them by stimulated emission one such cycle is called a rabi cycle and the inverse of its duration the rabi frequency of the photon beam the effect can be modeled using the jaynes cummings model and the bloch vector formalism a detailed mathematical description of the effect can be found on the page for the rabi problem for example for a two state atom an atom in which an electron can either be in the excited or ground

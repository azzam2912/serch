it generalizes the discrete form of jensen s inequality and generalizes in turn to the concept of schur convex functions let be an interval of the real line and let denote a real valued convex function defined on if and are numbers in such that majorizes then here majorization means that and satisfies and we have the inequalities and the equality if is a strictly convex function then the inequality holds with equality if and only if we have for all the finite form of jensen s inequality is a special case of this result consider the real numbers and let denote their arithmetic mean then majorizes the tuple since the arithmetic mean of the largest numbers of is at least as large as the arithmetic mean of all the numbers for every by karamata s inequality for the convex function dividing by gives jensen s inequality the sign is reversed if is concave we may assume that the numbers are in decreasing order as specified in if for all then the inequality holds with equality hence we may assume in the following that for at least one if for an then the inequality and the majorization properties and are

this type of software is used to take the tedium out of proving change ringing compositions that is checking that no change within the composition is repeated the software will perform the checks required to prove a composition in milliseconds rather than the hours or days required for paper based proving methods often these programs can also analyse compositions to determine the musical rows that they contain in recent years more advanced tools have emerged which can assist the human composer in other ways these range from pure composition generation programs such as byroc and elf to more sophisticated programs such as smc32 which can work alongside the human composer for instance by linking together existing musical blocks which the composer has created the main examples of proving software are some examples of composition generation tools the original use of simulators was to allow the practicing of change ringing in the tower but nowadays is perhaps used more in the home using a dumbbell or keyboard many different scenarios can now be accommodated by the software sensors are used to give temporal information to the computer the main examples of simulator software are keeping records is very important to some

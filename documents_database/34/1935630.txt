centroblasts form following exposure to follicular dendritic cell cytokines such as il 6 il 15 8d6 and baff and stimulation from helper t cell interactions between their cd40 ligand and the b cell cd40 induces centroblasts to express activation induced cytidine deaminase leading to somatic hypermutation morphologically centroblasts are large lymphoid cells containing a moderate amount of cytoplasm round to oval vesicular i e containing small fluid filled sacs nuclei vesicular chromatin and 2 3 small nucleoli often located adjacent to the nuclear membrane they are derived from b cells immunoblasts are distinguished from centroblasts by being b cell derived lymphoid cells that have moderate to abundant basophilic cytoplasm and a prominent centrally located trapezoid shaped single nucleolus which often has fine strands of chromatin attached to the nuclear membrane spider legs in some cases immunoblasts can show some morphologic features of plasma cells centroblasts do not express immunoglobulins and are unable to respond to the follicular dendritic cell antigens present in the secondary lymphoid follicles

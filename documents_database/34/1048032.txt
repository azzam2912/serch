based on its original design nor flash memory is designed to store binary code of programs because it supports xip execute in place and high performance in read operations while nand flash memory is used as a data storage because of its lower price and higher performance in write erase operations compared to nor flash in recent years the price of nand flash has gone down much faster than that of nor flash thus to reduce the hardware cost ultimately using nand flash to replace nor flash motivated by a strong market demand becomes a new trend in embedded system designs especially on mobile phones and arcade games the replacement depends on well designed management of flash memory which is carried out by either software on a host system as a raw medium or hardware circuits firmware inside its devices here an efficient prediction mechanism with limited memory space requirements and an efficient implementation is proposed the prediction mechanism collects the access patterns of program execution to construct a prediction graph by adopting the working set concept according to the prediction graph the prediction mechanism prefetches data code to the sram cache so as to reduce the cache miss rate

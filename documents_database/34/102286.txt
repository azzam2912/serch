this result was first proven by mathias lerch in 1903 and is known as lerch s theorem the laplace transform and the inverse laplace transform together have a number of properties that make them useful for analysing linear dynamical systems an integral formula for the inverse laplace transform called the mellin s inverse formula the bromwich integral or the fourier mellin integral is given by the line integral where the integration is done along the vertical line re s in the complex plane such that is greater than the real part of all singularities of f s and f s is bounded on the line for example if contour path is in the region of convergence if all singularities are in the left half plane or f s is an entire function then can be set to zero and the above inverse integral formula becomes identical to the inverse fourier transform in practice computing the complex integral can be done by using the cauchy residue theorem

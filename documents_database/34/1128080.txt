lrp5 is a key component of the lrp5 lrp6 frizzled co receptor group that is involved in canonical wnt pathway mutations in lrp5 can lead to considerable changes in bone mass a loss of function mutation causes osteoporosis pseudoglioma decrease in bone mass while a gain of function mutation causes drastic increases in bone mass lrp5 is a transmembrane low density lipoprotein receptor that shares a similar structure with lrp6 in each protein about 85 of its 1600 amino acid length is extracellular each has four propeller motifs at the amino terminal end that alternate with four epidermal growth factor egf like repeats most extracellular ligands bind to lrp5 and lrp6 at the propellers each protein has a single pass 22 amino acid segment that crosses the cell membrane and a 207 amino acid segment that is internal to the cell lrp5 acts as a co receptor with lrp6 and the frizzled protein family members for transducing signals by wnt proteins through the canonical wnt pathway this protein plays a key role in skeletal homeostasis the lrp5 promoter contains binding sites for klf15 and sp1 in addition 5 region region of the lrp5 gene contains four runx2 binding sites lrp5

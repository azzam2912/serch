because of chow s theorem any compact complex manifold of dimension 2 and with kodaira dimension 2 will actually be an algebraic surface and in some sense most surfaces are in this class gieseker showed that there is a coarse moduli scheme for surfaces of general type this means that for any fixed values of the chern numbers formula 1 there is a quasi projective scheme classifying the surfaces of general type with those chern numbers it remains a very difficult problem to describe these schemes explicitly and there are few pairs of chern numbers for which this has been done except when the scheme is empty there are some indications that these schemes are in general too complicated to write down explicitly the known upper bounds for the number of components are very large some components can be non reduced everywhere components may have many different dimensions and the few pieces that have been studied explicitly tend to look rather complicated the study of which pairs of chern numbers can occur for a surface of general type is known as and there is an almost complete answer to this question there are several conditions that the chern numbers of

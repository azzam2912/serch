this gauge is wider than the usual some early subway proposals involved using streetcars at least partially in tunnels so using the same gauge would be advantageous but ultimately dedicated rapid transit rolling stock was chosen though the line was still constructed with the broader gauge track however the later built line 3 scarborough light metro and line 5 eglinton light rail transit use standard gauge track tunnels are either square or round depending on the method of their construction square tunnels were built with the cut and cover method of digging trenches down from the surface constructing the tunnel structure and then backfilling round tunnels are bored using a tunnel boring machine tbm the cut and cover technique was used extensively on the oldest portions of the subway system while newer sections were predominantly or in the case of the toronto york spadina subway extension tysse which opened in 2017 entirely bored some sections of track run on the surface the most notable on the heavy rail subway system being the stretch of line 1 yonge university in the median of allen road however the light metro line 3 is a surface or elevated route for its entire length

studies of spiral galaxies in the nearby virgo cluster have shown not only how unlike in isolated spiral galaxies in most cases their neutral gas and star formation are truncated within their optical disks in some cases quite severely but also how star formation activity in them is lower than on spirals outside clusters this means that processes that take place in galaxy clusters as interactions with the intracluster medium like ram pressure stripping and or interactions with other neighboring galaxies are responsible of the origin of anemic galaxies stripping the normal spirals of their gas increasing in some cases their star formation activity and thus in the end quenching the latter as their gas is exhausted and not replenished spiral galaxies may have become anemic ones by exhausting their supply of gas via star formation activity an anemic galaxy s most probable fate is to lose their remaining gas and star formation becoming similar to a lenticular galaxy it therefore is likely that most lenticular galaxies in clusters are former spiral galaxies passive spiral galaxies also known as passive spirals are a type of spiral galaxy located in rich galaxy clusters at high redshifts that present spiral structure but

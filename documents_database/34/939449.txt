it is generally regarded as the final play shirley wrote as a professional dramatist though the court secret can seem to a modern taste a confection of romantic fluff exaggerated and wildly unrealistic see the synopsis below it has been read as an index of the social anxieties and stresses of england at the crisis point of 1642 suggesting the conflict between royalty and the rest between the demands of royalist absolutism and the urges of ordinary humanity at the start of the english civil war the play s title page in its first edition states that the court secret was never acted but was intended to be produced at the blackfriars theatre this identifies the play as belonging to the final phase of shirley s professional career he wrote regularly for the king s men at the blackfriars in the 1640 42 era after he had returned from ireland and the werburgh street theatre the implication is that the court secret would have followed the sisters on the blackfriars stage but was forestalled when the theatres closed in september 1642 the play however was staged during the restoration era by the king s company at their bridge street theatre

in male cicadas the tymbals are membranes in the abdomen responsible for the characteristic sound produced by the insect in tiger moths the tymbals are modified regions of the thorax and produce high frequency clicks in lesser wax moths the left and right tymbals emit high frequency pulses that are used as mating calls the paired tymbals of a cicada are located on the sides of the abdominal base the singing of a cicada is not stridulation as in many other familiar sound producing insects like crickets where one structure is rubbed against another the tymbals are regions of the exoskeleton that are modified to form a complex membrane with thin membranous portions and thickened ribs these membranes vibrate rapidly and enlarged chambers derived from the tracheae make the cicada s body serve as a resonance chamber greatly amplifying the sound some cicadas produce sounds louder than 106 db spl among the loudest of all insect produced sounds they modulate their noise by positioning their abdomens toward or away from the substrate the tymbals of a tiger moth are specialized regions on the metathoracic episterna normally corrugated such that sound is produced when the entire tymbal surface is buckled by

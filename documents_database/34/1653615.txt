it is a weakening of the concept of a topological group all topological groups are semitopological groups but the converse does not hold a semitopological group formula 1 is a topological space that is also a group such that is continuous with reference to both formula 3 and formula 4 note that a topological group is continuous with reference to both variables simultaneously and formula 5 is also required to be continuous here formula 6 is viewed as a topological space with the product topology clearly every topological group is a semitopological group to see that the converse does not hold consider the real line formula 7 with its usual structure as an additive abelian group apply the semiopen topology to formula 8 with topological basis the family formula 9 then formula 10 is continuous but formula 11 is not continuous at 0 formula 12 is an open neighbourhood of 0 but there is no neighbourhood of 0 continued in formula 13 it is known that any locally compact hausdorff semitopological group is a topological group other similar results are also known

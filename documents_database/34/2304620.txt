ovenden moor is located north of halifax and west of bradford in west yorkshire the site was opened in 1993 with 23 turbines but these were later removed in favour of larger turbines but with 14 fewer towers this updated the output of the site from 9 2 mwh to 22 5 mwh with an expected generation lifetime of 25 years as the turbines can be seen from some distance and the fact that they overlook the bront country to the north they have the subject of continued criticism and objections this moorland area of the south pennines is mostly overlaid with peat and underlaid with sandstone that is 310 million years old the area in and around ovenden moor was quarried for the rough rock flagstone that was used for buildings in the halifax area there are also bands of mudstone and coal with coal being worked historically in the area east of ovenden moor even though the seams were very narrow by commercial colliery standards the site was first proposed as a wind farm in the early 1990s and development took place soon after government approval was granted in 1992 at a cost of 10 6 million 23

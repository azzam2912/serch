a unibranch local ring is said to be geometrically unibranch if the residue field of b is a purely inseparable extension of the residue field of a a complex variety x is called topologically unibranch at a point x if for all complements y of closed algebraic subsets of x there is a fundamental system of neighborhoods in the classical topology of x whose intersection with y is connected in particular a normal ring is unibranch the notions of unibranch and geometrically unibranch points are used in some theorems in algebraic geometry for example there is the following result theorem let x and y be two integral locally noetherian schemes and formula 1 a proper dominant morphism denote their function fields by k x and k y respectively suppose that the algebraic closure of k y in k x has separable degree n and that formula 2 is unibranch then the fiber formula 3 has at most n connected components in particular if f is birational then the fibers of unibranch points are connected in ega the theorem is obtained as a corollary of zariski s main theorem

the raschig hooker process replaced the classical dow and bayer process for phenol production which used non recyclable sodium hydroxide to form sodium chloride to neutralize chlorine ions the raschig hooker process allows for the chlorine ion to be regenerated as hydrogen chloride the hydrogen chloride can then be recycled in the first step of the reaction the main steps in this process are the production of chlorobenzene from benzene hydrochloric acid and oxygen and the subsequent hydrolysis of chlorobenzene to phenol the first step uses either a copper or iron chloride catalyst and exposes the materials to air at 250 in the second step the resulting chlorobenzene is introduced to steam at 450 over a silicon catalyst that hydrolyses the chlorobenzene giving phenol and hydrogen chloride that can then be recycled back to the first step due to the two step nature the raschig hooker process can be used to produce either chlorobenzene or phenol the ability to recycle the hydrogen chloride made the raschig hooker process preferable to the dow and bayer process the reaction however takes place at very high temperatures in a very acidic environment with hydrogen chloride vapor and therefore the industrial setting must use

these five initial axioms called postulates by the ancient greeks are not sufficient to establish euclidean geometry many mathematicians have produced complete sets of axioms which do establish euclidean geometry one of the most notable of these is due to hilbert who created a system in the same style as euclid unfortunately hilbert s system requires 21 axioms other systems have used fewer but different axioms the most appealing of these from the viewpoint of having the fewest axioms is due to g d birkhoff 1932 which has only four axioms these four are the unique line assumption which was called the point line postulate by birkhoff the number line assumption the protractor postulate to permit the measurement of angles and an axiom that is equivalent to playfair s axiom or the parallel postulate for pedagogical reasons a short list of axioms is not desirable and starting with the new math curricula of the 1960s the number of axioms found in high school level textbooks has increased to levels that even exceed hilbert s system

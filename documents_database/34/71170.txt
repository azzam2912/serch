laser diodes can directly convert electrical energy into light driven by voltage the doped p n transition allows for recombination of an electron with a hole due to the drop of the electron from a higher energy level to a lower one radiation in the form of an emitted photon is generated this is spontaneous emission stimulated emission can be produced when the process is continued and further generate light with the same phase coherence and wavelength the choice of the semiconductor material determines the wavelength of the emitted beam which in today s laser diodes range from infra red to the uv spectrum laser diodes are the most common type of lasers produced with a wide range of uses that include fiber optic communications barcode readers laser pointers cd dvd blu ray disc reading recording laser printing laser scanning and light beam illumination with the use of a phosphor like that found on white leds laser diodes can be used for general illumination a laser diode is electrically a pin diode the active region of the laser diode is in the intrinsic i region and the carriers electrons and holes are pumped into that region from the n and

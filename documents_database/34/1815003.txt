however it is usually performed for character development rather than for the specific work of the intramuscular system required in football the role of strength preparation is crucial not only for increasing muscular strength which by itself provides an advantage but also for developing the specific training effects of strength exercises from the adaptation of the neuromuscular system to the stress of high eccentric and explosive demands required in football more specific and intense exercises are needed over of the general exercises commonly used to produce football strength such as jump training and olympic style lifts if strength exercises are not used effectively there will be a disparity between the functional levels of the skeletal muscle system and the capabilities of the neuromuscular system specialized strength work produces a strong training effect on the intramuscular system specialized exercises are used to develop the physical and psychological qualities that apply directly to football for example using his hip flexors a player can pull his leg from behind his body to underneath his hips forcefully duplicating the knee drive action used in running and sprinting by varying the repetitions and speed of execution the exercises can either be explosive high intensity allow

originally invented as a means of making steam engines more efficient the compounding of engines by use of several stages has also been used on internal combustion engines and continues to have niche markets there the stages of a compound engine may be either of differing or of similar technologies for example these examples and compound turbines are the main but not the only uses of compounding in engines see below a compound engine uses several stages to produce its output not all engines that use multiple stages are called compound engines in particular if an engine uses a later stage purely to extract energy from the exhaust for some other purpose and notably for turbo charging is not called a compound engine similarly proposed engines that use a free piston engine to drive a turbine would not be called compound engines as only the second stage produces output power however if a turbo compound engine is also supercharged by feeding some of the shaft power back to the supercharger as in some aircraft engines it is still a compound engine usage of the terms supercharged and turbosupercharged has varied with time for example the makers of the wright r

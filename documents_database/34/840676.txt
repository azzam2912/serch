the aim is to make the service uneconomical and thereby justify its closure or withdrawal it is most widely used in the case of government regulated services where a company needs permission from local government or central government to withdraw a service the classic examples of closure by stealth involve uk railway services these are often regulated at some level by local or national government and the only way the owner can withdraw such a service is by demonstrating that the local population no longer needs that service some of the uk rail closures made under the beeching axe while british rail were operating services were justified at the time by deliberately not including future efficiencies and bringing forward many years of future costs into a short time frame to show by accounting that the route was not sustainable by degrading the quality of the service for example by scheduling trains to run at inconvenient times or frequencies known as parliamentary train services or by raising fares transport operators can force passengers to take other modes of transport justifying the view of the service owner that the service is no longer required a kind of self fulfilling prophecy bt group

igfs are part of a complex system that cells use to communicate with their physiologic environment this complex system often referred to as the igf axis consists of two cell surface receptors igf1r and igf2r two ligands insulin like growth factor 1 igf 1 and insulin like growth factor 2 igf 2 a family of seven high affinity igf binding proteins igfbp1 to igfbp7 as well as associated igfbp degrading enzymes referred to collectively as proteases the igf axis is also commonly referred to as the growth hormone igf 1 axis insulin like growth factor 1 igf 1 or sometimes with a roman numeral as igf i is mainly secreted by the liver as a result of stimulation by growth hormone gh igf 1 is important for both the regulation of normal physiology as well as a number of pathological states including cancer the igf axis has been shown to play roles in the promotion of cell proliferation and the inhibition of cell death apoptosis insulin like growth factor 2 igf 2 or sometimes as igf ii is thought to be a primary growth factor required for early development while igf 1 expression is required for achieving maximal growth gene

one net was designed for low cost low power battery operated control networks for applications such as home automation security monitoring device control and sensor networks one net is not tied to any proprietary hardware or software and can be implemented with a variety of low cost off the shelf radio transceivers and micro controllers from a number of different manufacturers one net uses uhf ism radio transceivers and currently operates in the 868 mhz and 915 mhz frequencies with 25 channels available for use in the united states the one net standard allows for implementation on other frequencies and some work is being done to implement it in the 433 mhz and 2 4 ghz frequency ranges one net utilizes wideband fsk frequency shift keying to encode data for transmission one net features a dynamic data rate protocol with a base data rate of 38 4 kbit s the specification allows per node dynamic data rate configuration for data rates up to 230 kbit s one net supports star peer to peer and multi hop topology star network topology can be used to lower complexity and cost of peripherals and also simplifies encryption key management in peer to peer

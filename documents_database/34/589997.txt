located on the itbox and other terminals the game was developed by big fizz games similar to other word games such as scrabble boggle and bookworm the object of the game is to create valid words from a randomised selection of letter tiles arranged in a 13x9 matrix each word scores points according to the letters used therein sum of all letters multiplied by the total number of letters in the word points from all words entered are accumulated hence the word lava would score the hierarchy of letters is similar to that of scrabble q and z are the highest scoring tiles each 10 followed by x and j each 8 and so on the most notable variance is that here l is worth five as opposed to just one in scrabble the player starts with two minutes to find as many words as he can if he manages to use q z x or j in any word he is awarded a further 10 seconds after each successful entry the letters used are discarded with the matrix replacing those letters used with surrounding tiles from above and to the left a void is thus formed to the top

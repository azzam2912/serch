it was discovered by english astronomer william herschel in february 1784 with an apparent magnitude of 7 and spanning 17 arc minutes across the sky it is separated from the ngc 1807 cluster by just a few degrees indeed the two may actually be parts of a single extended cluster the ngc 1817 cluster is around the same age as the hyades or perhaps a little younger at 0 8 1 2 billion years the turnoff point for this cluster where stars above a certain mass are evolving through the red giant stage is twice the mass of the sun the cluster is situated in the opposite side of the sky from the galactic core at a separation of from the core and is around away from the galactic plane measurements of the proper motion of 810 stars within a 1 5 region centered on the cluster suggest that it has at least 169 members of these there is a total of 26 variable stars including three candidate gamma doradus variable stars and sixteen delta scuti variables this unusually high proportion of delta scuti variables is likely the result of the turnoff point being located within the instability strip

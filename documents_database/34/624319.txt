as the name suggests the effect of the explosive charge is to deform a metal plate into a slug or rod shape and accelerate it toward a target they were first developed as oil well perforators by american oil companies in the 1930s and were deployed as weapons in world war ii a conventional shaped charge generally has a conical metal liner that projects a hypervelocity jet of metal able to penetrate steel armour to great depths in travel over some distance the jet breaks up along its length into particles that drift out of alignment greatly diminishing its effectiveness at a distance an efp on the other hand has a liner face in the shape of a shallow dish the force of the blast moulds the liner into any of a number of shapes depending on the shape of the plate and how the explosive is detonated some sophisticated efp warheads have multiple detonators that can be fired in different arrangements causing different types of waveform in the explosive resulting in either a long rod penetrator an aerodynamic slug projectile or multiple high velocity fragments a less sophisticated approach for changing the formation of an efp is the use

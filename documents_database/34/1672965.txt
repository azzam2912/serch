in its first embodiment koichi tanaka used a cobalt glycerol liquid matrix and subsequent applications included a graphite glycerol liquid matrix as well as a solid surface of porous silicon at present laser desorption ionization methods using other inorganic matrices such as nanomaterials are often regarded as saldi variants as an example silicon nanowires as well as titania nanotube arrays nta have been used as substrates to detect small molecules saldi is used to detect proteins and protein protein complexes a related method named ambient saldi which is a combination of conventional saldi with ambient mass spectrometry incorporating the direct analysis real time dart ion source has also been demonstrated saldi is considered one of the most important techniques in ms and has many applications koichi tanaka performed the first successful saldi experiments on proteins subsequently sunner and chen used graphite particles of 2 150 m in size as a substrate and solutions of analytes in glycerol they were able to analyze low molecular weight analytes peptides and small proteins by soft ionization technique then they developed an approach called saldi ms where a thin layer of activated carbon particles fixed on aluminum support in which the surface and the

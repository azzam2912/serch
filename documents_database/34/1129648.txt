cyp2j2 is a member of the cytochrome p450 superfamily of enzymes the enzymes are oxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics as well as in the synthesis of cholesterol steroids and other lipids the cyp2j2 contains the following domains hydrophobic binding domains f g loop containing non conservative mutations primary membrane binding motif the protein also contains an n terminal anchor the f g loop mediates the binding and passage of substrates and its hydrophobic region containing residues trp 235 phe 239 and ille 236 allows the enzyme to interact with cellular membranes mutations to hydrophilic residues in the f g loop alter the binding mechanism by changing insertion depth of the enzyme into the membrane cyp2j2 is expressed predominately in the heart and to a lesser extent in other tissues such as the liver gastrointestinal tract pancreas lung and central nervous system cyp2j2 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is thought to be a prominent enzyme responsible for metabolizing endogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids to signaling molecules it metabolizes arachidonic acid to the following eicosatrienoic acid epoxides termed eets 5 6 epoxy 8z 11z 14z eet 8 9 epoxy 8z 11z 14z eet

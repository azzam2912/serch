the various hypothetical multiverse loop quantum gravity universe design models could have various lorentz invariance results because loop quantum gravity models universes space gravity theories are contenders to build and answer unification theory the lorentz invariance helps grade the spread of universal features throughout a proposed multiverse in time the grand unification epoch is the era in time in the chronology of the universe where no elementary particles existed and the three gauge interactions of the standard model which define the electromagnetic weak and strong interactions or forces are merged into one single force convention says that 3 minutes after the big bang protons and neutrons began to come together to form the nuclei of simple elements whereas loop quantum gravity theories places the origin and the age of elementary particles and the age of lorentz invariance beyond 13 799 0 021 billion years ago the permanence of our lorentz invariance constants are based on elementary particles and their features there are eons of time before the big bang to build the universe from black holes and older multiverses there is a selective process that creates features in elementary particles like accept store and give energy in the books of

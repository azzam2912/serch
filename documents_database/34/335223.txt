they are remarkable for their intelligent hunting behaviour which suggests that they are capable of learning and problem solving traits normally attributed to much larger animals the genus was established in 1878 by german arachnologist friedrich karsch the fringed jumping spider portia fimbriata is the type species molecular phylogeny a technique that compares the dna of organisms to construct the tree of life indicates that portia is a member of a basal clade i e quite similar to the ancestors of all jumping spiders and that the spartaeus phaeacius and holcolaetis genera are its closest relatives wanless divided the genus portia into two species groups the schultzi group in which males palps have a fixed tibial apophysis and the kenti group in which the apophysis of each palp in the males has a joint separated by a membrane the schultzi group includes p schultzi p africana p fimbriata and p labiata at least some species of portia are in the state of reproductive isolation in a laboratory male p africana copulated with female p labiata but no eggs were laid during all cases the female p labiata twisted and lunged in an attempt to bite some specimens found trapped in

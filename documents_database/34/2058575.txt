this symmetry has several equivalent characterizations which lend to the analysis of such algebras many familiar varieties of algebras such as the variety of groups consist of congruence permutable algebras but some like the variety of lattices have members which are not congruence permutable given an algebra formula 1 a pair of congruences formula 2 are said to permute when formula 3 an algebra formula 1 is called congruence permutable when each pair of congruences of formula 1 permute a variety of algebras formula 6 is referred to as congruence permutable when every algebra in formula 6 is congruence permutable in 1954 maltsev give two other conditions which are equivalent to the one given above defining a congruence permutable variety of algebras this initiated the study of congruence permutable varieties suppose that formula 6 is a variety of algebras the following are equivalent such a term is called a maltsev term and congruence permutable varieties are also known as maltsev varieties in his honor most classical varieties in abstract algebra such as groups rings and lie algebras are congruence permutable any variety that contains a group operation is congruence permutable and the maltcev term is formula 9 viewed as a

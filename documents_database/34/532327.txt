homonuclear molecules may consist of various numbers of atoms depending on the element s properties some elements form molecules of more than one size the most familiar homonuclear molecules are diatomic meaning they consist of two atoms though not all diatomic molecules are homonuclear homonuclear diatomic molecules include hydrogen h oxygen o nitrogen n and all of the halogens ozone o is a common triatomic homonuclear molecule homonuclear tetratomic molecules include arsenic as and phosphorus p allotropes are different chemical forms of the same element not containing any other element in that sense allotropes are all homonuclear many elements have multiple allotropic forms in addition to the most common form of gaseous oxygen o and ozone there are other allotropes of oxygen sulfur forms several allotropes containing different numbers of sulfur atoms including diatomic triatomic hexatomic and octatomic s s s s forms though the first three are rare the element carbon is known to have a number of homonuclear molecules including diamond and graphite

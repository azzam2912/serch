two big thumbs up gamezebo wrote twingo is an experience which is simple yet challenging and very accommodating and full of charm the happy natsu and surly fuyo are hard to dislike with their different animations and demeanors but don t go so overboard with it as to be thought of as cutesy which is a fine and difficult line to walk 148apps said the only real issue i have with twingo is that the entire first world is just far too easy appspy wrote swiping puzzle fun yes we ve seen this concept before but twingo pulls it off with great presentation and a truck full of content pocketgameruk said a smartly designed surprisingly taxing puzzler that makes the most of its elegantly simple core appsmile wrote despite an all too easy first set of puzzles and the absence of move counters twingo more than makes up for its shortcomings with clever designs and the elemental make ups of the twins playing an important role

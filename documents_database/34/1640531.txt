if loading on a particular bone increases the bone will remodel itself over time to become stronger to resist that sort of loading the internal architecture of the trabeculae undergoes adaptive changes followed by secondary changes to the external cortical portion of the bone perhaps becoming thicker as a result the inverse is true as well if the loading on a bone decreases the bone will become less dense and weaker due to the lack of the stimulus required for continued remodeling this reduction in bone density osteopenia is known as stress shielding and can occur as a result of a hip replacement or other prosthesis the normal stress on a bone is shielded from that bone by being placed on a prosthetic implant the remodeling of bone in response to loading is achieved via mechanotransduction a process through which forces or other mechanical signals are converted to biochemical signals in cellular signaling mechanotransduction leading to bone remodeling involve the steps of mechanocoupling biochemical coupling signal transmission and cell response the specific effects on bone structure depends on the duration magnitude and rate of loading and it has been found that only cyclic loading can induce bone formation when loaded

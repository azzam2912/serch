it is related to the fair queuing principle which groups packets into classes and shares the service capacity between them gps shares this capacity according to some fixed weights in process scheduling gps is an idealized scheduling algorithm that achieves perfect fairness all practical schedulers approximate gps and use it as a reference to measure fairness generalized processor sharing assumes that traffic is fluid infinitesimal packet sizes and can be arbitrarily split there are several service disciplines which track the performance of gps quite closely such as weighted fair queuing wfq also known as packet by packet generalized processor sharing pgps in a network such as the internet different application types require different levels of performance for example email is a genuinely store and forward kind of application but videoconferencing isn t since it requires low latency when packets are queued up on one end of a congested link the node usually has some freedom in deciding the order in which it should send the queued packets one example ordering is simply first come first served which works fine if the sizes of the queues are small but can result in problems if there are latency sensitive packets being blocked

a bright red or orange solid it is used as pigment in the manufacture of batteries lead glass and rustproof primer paints it is an example of a mixed valence compound being composed of both pb ii and pb iv lead ii iv oxide has a tetragonal crystal structure at room temperature which then transforms to an orthorhombic pearson symbol op28 space group pbam no 55 form at temperature this phase transition only changes the symmetry of the crystal and slightly modifies the interatomic distances and angles lead ii iv oxide is prepared by calcination of lead ii oxide pbo also called litharge in air at about 450 480 c the resulting material is contaminated with pbo if a pure compound is desired pbo can be removed by a potassium hydroxide solution another method of preparation relies on annealing of lead ii carbonate cerussite in air yet another method is oxidative annealing of white lead in solution lead ii iv oxide can be prepared by reaction of potassium plumbate with lead ii acetate yielding yellow insoluble lead ii iv oxide monohydrate pbo ho which can be turned into the anhydrous form by gentle heating natural minium is uncommon forming only

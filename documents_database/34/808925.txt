these bacteria get their energy by the oxidation of inorganic nitrogen compounds types include ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob many species of nitrifying bacteria have complex internal membrane systems that are the location for key enzymes in nitrification ammonia monooxygenase which oxidizes ammonia to hydroxylamine hydroxylamine oxidoreductase which oxidizes hydroxylamine to nitric oxide which is oxidized to nitrite by a currently unidentified enzyme and nitrite oxidoreductase which oxidizes nitrite to nitrate nitrifying bacteria are a narrow taxonomic group in the environment and are found in highest numbers where considerable amounts of ammonia are present areas with extensive protein decomposition and sewage treatment plants nitrifying bacteria thrive in lakes and rivers streams with high inputs and outputs of sewage and wastewater and freshwater because of the high ammonia content nitrification in nature is a two step oxidation process of ammonium nh or ammonia nh to nitrate no catalyzed by two ubiquitous bacterial groups the first reaction is oxidation of ammonium to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob represented by the nitrosomonas genus the second reaction is oxidation of nitrite no to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob represented by the nitrobacter genus ammonia oxidation in autotrophic nitrification

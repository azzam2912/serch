the original motivation for master detail was that such a view table on old 1980s 80 character wide displays could only comfortably show about four columns on the screen at once while a typical data entity will have some twenty fields the solution is that the detail shows all twenty fields and the master shows only the commonly recognised three to five that will fit on the screen in one row without scrolling a master area can be a form list or tree of items and a detail area can be a form list or tree of items typically placed either below or next to the master area selecting an item from the master list causes the details of that item to be populated in the detail area a master detail relationship is a one to many type relationship examples of a master detail relationship are a set of purchase orders and a set of line items belonging to each purchase order an expense report with a set of expense line items or a department with a list of employees belonging to it an application can use this master detail relationship to enable users to navigate through the purchase order

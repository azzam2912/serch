iupac recommend to further simplified chain growth polymerization to chain polymerization it is a kind polymerization where an active center free radical or ion is formed and a plurality of monomers can be polymerized together in a short period of time to form a macromolecule having a large molecular weight in addition to the regenerated active sites of each monomer unit polymer growth will only occur at one or possibly more endpoint many common polymers can be obtained by chain polymerization such as polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polyvinyl chloride pvc polymethyl methacrylate polyacrylonitrile polyvinyl acetate typically chain growth polymerization can be understood with the chemical equation in this equation p is the polymer while x represents degree of polymerization means active center of chain growth polymerization m is the monomer which will react with active center l is a low molar mass by product obtained during chain propagation usually for chain growth polymerization there is no by product formed however there are still some exceptions for example amino acid n carboxy anhydrides polymerizing to oxazolidine 2 5 diones typically chain polymerization must contain chain initiation and chain propagation chain transfer and chain termination do not always happened in a chain

this effect is mainly caused by the surrounding ligands that are complexed to the metal and it is the ligands that are involved in the reduction chemistry instead of the metal due to electronic destabilization by being significantly distanced from the metal sterically induced reductions commonly involve metals found in the lanthanoid and actinoid series divalents lanthanides are extremely reducing can reduce alkali cations compounds of these divalent lanthanides smi is a common reducing agent that is used in a variety of synthetic applications mainly because all other divalent lanthanides are unstable complexes of sm ii have also been investigated and used in similar applications however even though sm ii complexes and compounds have had tremendous success when used in conjunction with a variety of substrates there have been instances where chemistry of certain materials cannot be performed due to unclean reactions in which products are not easily isolated from reaction mixtures when sm ii compounds are used to perform the desired reduction in these cases adjusting the size of the metal which is commonly and easily done for the trivalent lanthanide compounds may fine tune the nature of a specific reaction which should produce desired and clean products one

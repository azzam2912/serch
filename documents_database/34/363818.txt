thus it experiences seasons of spring summer autumn and winter much like earth and its day is about the same length its year is almost twice as long as earth s and its orbital eccentricity is considerably larger which means among other things that the lengths of various martian seasons differ considerably and sundial time can diverge from clock time more than on earth the length of a martian day is close to that of an earth day leading to the use of analogous time units the average length of a martian sidereal day is 88 642 663 seconds based on si units and the length of its solar day is 88 775 244147 seconds the corresponding values for earth are currently and respectively this yields a conversion factor of 1 02749125170 days sol thus mars s solar day is only about 2 7 longer than earth s the term sol is used by planetary scientists to refer to the duration of a solar day on mars the term was adopted during the viking project in order to avoid confusion with an earth day by inference mars solar hour is 1 24th of a sol and a solar minute 1

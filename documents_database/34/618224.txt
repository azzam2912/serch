the action of the itb and its associated muscles is to extend abduct and laterally rotate the hip in addition the itb contributes to lateral knee stabilization during knee extension the itb moves anterior to the lateral condyle of the femur while 30 degrees knee flexion the itb moves posterior to the lateral condyle however it has been suggested that this is only an illusion due to the changing tension in the anterior and posterior fibers during movement it originates at the anterolateral iliac tubercle portion of the external lip of the iliac crest and inserts at the lateral condyle of the tibia at gerdy s tubercle the figure shows only the proximal part of the iliotibial tract the part of the iliotibial band which lies beneath the tensor fasciae latae is prolonged upward to join the lateral part of the capsule of the hip joint the tensor fasciae latae effectively tightens the iliotibial band around the area of the knee this allows for bracing of the knee especially in lifting the opposite foot the gluteus maximus muscle and the tensor fasciae latae insert upon the tract the it band stabilizes the knee both in extension and in partial flexion

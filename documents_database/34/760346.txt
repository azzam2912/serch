most notably bt toxins are insecticidal to the larvae of moths and butterflies beetles cotton bollworms and ghtu flies but are harmless to other forms of life the gene coding for bt toxin has been inserted into cotton as a transgene causing it to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues in many regions the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae which are killed by the bt protein in the genetically modified cotton they eat this eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance this spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests such as plant bugs stink bugs and aphids depending on circumstances it may be desirable to use insecticides in prevention a 2006 study done by cornell researchers the center for chinese agricultural policy and the chinese academy of science on bt cotton farming in china found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non bt cotton and causing less

mcneill hvdc back to back station is the most northerly of a series of hvdc interconnectors between the unsynchronised eastern and western ac systems of the united states and canada the station which was built by gec alstom can transfer a maximum power of 150 mw at a dc voltage of 42 kv the station is unusual in many respects and contained several firsts for hvdc most notably the mcneill station was the first hvdc installation to dispense with the dc smoothing reactor a component which most engineers consider as an absolute must at hvdc plants even today only a small number of back to back hvdc stations and no point to point transmission schemes have been built without dc smoothing reactors the mcneill station was also notable for operating with an exceptionally low short circuit ratio the short circuit ratio scr is a measure of how strong or weak the connected ac system is most hvdc schemes using line commutated converters operate with a scr of at least 3 but the mcneill scheme was designed to operate with an effective short circuit ratio escr a measure which subtracts the harmonic filters from the evaluation of short circuit ratio and

it is also occasionally isolated from immunocompetent individuals it is a dimorphic yeast of the genus candida very closely related to candida albicans but forming a distinct phylogenetic cluster in dna fingerprinting it is most commonly isolated from oral cavities and is also occasionally found in other anatomical sites candida dubliniensis is cosmopolitan found around the world and has been described as a separate species in 1995 retrospective studies have shown that previously it had been commonly identified as candida albicans with which c dubliniensis is closely related and shares a number of characteristics one test for distinguishing c dubliniensis from c albicans is laboratory culture of the organism at 42 c most c albicans strains grow at this temperature whereas most c dubliniensis isolates do not there are also significant differences in the conditions that lead to the formation of chlamydospores between c albicans and c dubliniensis although they are otherwise phenotypically very similar a european study of 2 589 isolates that had originally been identified as c albicans revealed that 52 of them 2 0 were c dubliniensis most of these isolates were from oral or faecal specimens from hiv positive patients though one vaginal and two oral

it is sometimes feebly ribbed smoothish with a slightly constricted suture sculpture longitudinals above the middle of each whorl is a row of tubercles which stand out on the upper whorls rather sharp and rounded but on the lower whorls are elongated into slight oblique ribs which tend to become obsolete on the body whorl and do not extend to the base they are parted by shallow rounded furrows which are a good deal broader than the ribs there are about thirteen of these on each whorl they do not extend in the least to the sinus area above the tubercles the surface is very closely scored with coarse lines of growth spirals the line of the tubercles forms a rather acute carination of which there is hardly a trace in the curve of the whorls themselves the whole surface is covered with harsh unequal irregular flatly rounded threads which are cut into small coarse granulations by the lines of growth this sculpture is most developed on the base and aperture less so in the sinus area least so of all on the rib area the colour of the shell is buff below the yellow epidermis which is coarse and

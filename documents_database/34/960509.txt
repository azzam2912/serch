the instrument measures parts per billion levels of hydrogen sulfide and to a lesser extent methyl mercaptan two gases which were previously shown to be associated with bad breath using gas chromatograph by dr joseph tonzetich in the late 1960s the halimeter is manufactured by interscan corp in california and based on their earlier model 1170 portable sulfide monitor this was the model used in the two original studies these studies conducted for the first time by dr mel rosenberg showed a significant correlation between monitor levels and oral malodor scores the small size simplicity of use and price relative to gas chromatograph of the halimeter made it popular among dentists seeking to diagnose and treat bad breath as well as scientific researchers much of the published research on bad breath over the past dozen years has employed this instrument the electrochemical sensor is sensitive to alcohol vapors and requires recalibration over time the halimeter has been the only vsc monitor for the diagnosis of halitosis for years but now that its patent has expired it faces competition from other sulfur monitors recently introduced into the marketplace more recently the portable gas chromatograph oralchroma has been recommended in the diagnosis

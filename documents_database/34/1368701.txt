the ascending chain condition on principal ideals abbreviated to accp is satisfied if there is no infinite strictly ascending chain of principal ideals of the given type left right two sided in the ring or said another way every ascending chain is eventually constant the counterpart descending chain condition may also be applied to these posets however there is currently no need for the terminology dccp since such rings are already called left or right perfect rings see noncommutative ring section below noetherian rings e g principal ideal domains are typical examples but some important non noetherian rings also satisfy accp notably unique factorization domains and left or right perfect rings it is well known that a nonzero nonunit in a noetherian integral domain factors into irreducibles the proof of this relies on only accp not acc so in any integral domain with accp an irreducible factorization exists in other words any integral domains with accp are atomic but the converse is false as shown in such a factorization may not be unique the usual way to establish uniqueness of factorizations uses euclid s lemma which requires factors to be prime rather than just irreducible indeed one has the following

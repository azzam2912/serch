instead of perpetuating marsaglia s tradition of xorshift as a basic operation xoroshiro128 uses a shift rotate based linear transformation designed by sebastiano vigna in collaboration with david blackman the result is a significant improvement in speed well below a nanosecond per integer and a significant improvement in statistical quality the authors of xoroshiro128 acknowledge that it does not pass all statistical tests stating these claims about not passing tests can be confirmed by running practrand on the input resulting in output like that shown below acknowledging the weak low order bit the authors go on to say we suggest to use a sign test to extract a random boolean value thus programmers should prefer the highest bits e g making a heads tails by writing codice 1 rather than codice 2 it must be noted though that the same test is failed by the mersenne twister well etc so the issue is mainly of academic concern as stated in the comments the generator fails a hamming weight dependency test developed by blackman and vigna after 8 tb of data as a comparison for some choice of parameters the mersenne twister at 607 bits fails the same test after less

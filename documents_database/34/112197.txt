first described by e s davenport and edgar bain it is one of the products that may form when austenite the face centered cubic crystal structure of iron is cooled past a temperature where it no longer is thermodynamically stable with respect to ferrite cementite or ferrite and cementite davenport and bain originally described the microstructure as being similar in appearance to tempered martensite a fine non lamellar structure bainite commonly consists of cementite and dislocation rich ferrite the large density of dislocations in the ferrite present in bainite and the fine size of the bainite platelets makes this ferrite harder than it normally would be the temperature range for transformation of austenite to bainite 125 550 c is between those for pearlite and martensite in fact there is no fundamental lower limit to the bainite start temperature when formed during continuous cooling the cooling rate to form bainite is more rapid than that required to form pearlite but less rapid than is required to form martensite in steels of the same composition most alloying elements will retard the formation of bainite though carbon is the most effective in doing so aluminium or cobalt are exceptions in that they can

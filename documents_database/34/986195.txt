originally named energetech it will be renamed oceanlinx in 2007 the main technology is based on wave energy converter wec which is a device that uses wave energy and converts it into electrical energy the wec operating principle are numerous but oceanlinx technology focuses on the oscillating water column principle oceanlinx company was created in australia and the technology has been developed over the past twenty years in 2014 oceanlinx entered receivership before its technology intellectual property brand and trademark were sold to wave power renewables limited in hong kong since then wave power renewables limited has been developing the technology the developed waver energy conversion technology uses a bi directional airflow air turbine turbine installed on top of an oscillating water column this turbine concept and others were developed specifically by oceanlinx to accommodate waver energy conversion technology the turbine and generator are the only moving part and sit above the water the advantage is that fewer the moving parts the better and it means that the turbine is not in direct contact with the sea water oscillating water columns owcs are simple constructions that act like a piston and cylinder as waves rise within the owc it replicates

it has the molecular formula chno and is a colorless solid medicinally safingol has demonstrated promising anticancer potential as a modulator of multi drug resistance and as an inducer of necrosis the administration of safingol alone has not been shown to exert a significant effect on tumor cell growth however preclinical and clinical studies have shown that combining safingol with conventional chemotherapy agents such as fenretinide vinblastine irinotecan and mitomycin c can dramatically potentiate their antitumor effects currently in phase i clinical trials it is believed to be safe to co administer with cisplatin the underlying mechanism by which safingol induces cell death is poorly understood it is believed to exert a variety of inhibitory effects resulting in a series of cascades that result in accidental necrotic cell death brought about by reactive oxygen species ros and mediated by autophagy increased autophagic activity has been associated with increased cellular death although it is unclear if there is any causative relationship between the two because autophagy normally plays a pro survival role by impeding apoptosis it is curious that it may play a role in cell death following safingol exposure safingol competitively competes with phorbol dibutyrate at regulatory domains of the

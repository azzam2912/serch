it is a generalization of the usual a gaussian mixture model gmm when the marginal distributions are restricted to be gaussian the model reduces to a gmm to begin the multivariate gaussian copula is defined by the following probability function formula 1 whose density is given by where then with the gaussianlization of original data on each dimension a gcmm for the joint distribution of a random vector formula 4 can be defined as follows formula 5 where its density is given by the density above is defined conditioned on the cumulative probability values and gaussianized random variables which are both determined by the marginal distributions the marginal distribution on each dimension for each component can be estimated via nonparametric methods such as kernel smoothing bowman 1998 1 a gcmm is defined based on the separation of the mixture of copulas and marginal distributions which may potentially lead to different behavior from gmm to understand the properties of gcmm its likelihood function is studied so that appropriate estimation algorithms can be designed the major properties of gcmm are discussed below 1 a gcmm has a bounded likelihood function value on bounded domains and tractable derivatives conditioned on the estimated marginal

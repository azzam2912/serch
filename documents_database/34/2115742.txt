this enables the solution to break down any biological contaminants and biofilms that coat or permeate within contacts after a long period of use hydrogen peroxide or is always used alongside a neutralizing product such as a neutralizer saline or neutralizer tablets or method such as a special lens case with a catalytic disc depending on whether it s an oxidative system or catalyst system the intention is to prevent the hydrogen peroxide from contact with the eye which could damage the corneal cells in the epithelium while this would not result in permanent damage it can cause an intense burn that can linger even after an eye rinse burned cells heal very quickly once the natural tear film is restored in order to prevent this damage the solution must be stabilized before the contacts are placed into the individual s eyes to neutralize and stabilize the solution the contacts are placed into a special container with a platinum coated disk whereas disinfection and neutralization occurs simultaneously the older defunct 2 step systems required a soak in peroxide for a specified time then replaced with the neutralization saline and soaked again for another specified period timing in 2 step systems

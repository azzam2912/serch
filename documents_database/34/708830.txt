it was developed by hans ledwinka and paul jaray the zeppelin aerodynamic engineer launched in 1934 the tatra 77 is a coach built automobile constructed on a platform chassis with a pressed box section steel backbone rather than tatra s trademark tubular chassis and is powered by a rear mounted 2 97 litre air cooled v8 engine in later series increased to a 3 4 litre engine it possessed advanced engineering features such as overhead valves hemispherical combustion chambers a dry sump fully independent suspension rear swing axles and extensive use of lightweight magnesium alloy for the engine transmission suspension and body the average drag coefficient of a 1 5 model of tatra 77 was recorded as 0 2455 the later model t77a has a top speed of over due to its advanced aerodynamic design which delivers an exceptionally low drag coefficient of 0 212 although some sources claim that this is the coefficient of a 1 5 scale model not of the car itself unfortunately the handling of the car was not very good and more high ranking german officers were killed in crashes in the tatra 77 and tatra 87 than in active combat the tatra company began

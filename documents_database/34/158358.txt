each animated piece either character or background is deformable made of a malleable substance usually plasticine clay traditional animation from cel animation to stop motion is produced by recording each frame or still picture on film or digital media and then playing the recorded frames back in rapid succession before the viewer these and other moving images from zoetrope to films and video games create the illusion of motion by playing back at over ten to twelve frames per second the techniques involved in creating computer generated imagery are conversely generally removed from a frame by frame process each object or character is sculpted from clay or other such similarly pliable material as plasticine usually around a wire skeleton called an armature and then arranged on the set where it is photographed once before being slightly moved by hand to prepare it for the next shot and so on until the animator has achieved the desired amount of film upon playback the mind of the viewer perceives the series of slightly changing rapidly succeeding images as motion a consistent shooting environment is needed to maintain the illusion of continuity objects must be consistently placed and lit and work must proceed

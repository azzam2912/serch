it is a facultative anaerobic bacterium capable of surviving in the presence or absence of oxygen it can grow and reproduce inside the host s cells and is one of the most virulent foodborne pathogens with 20 to 30 of foodborne listeriosis infections in high risk individuals may be fatal responsible for an estimated 1 600 illnesses and 260 deaths in the united states annually listeriosis ranks third in total number of deaths among foodborne bacterial pathogens with fatality rates exceeding even salmonella spp and clostridium botulinum in the european union listeriosis follows an upward trend that began in 2008 causing 2 161 confirmed cases and 210 reported deaths in 2014 16 more than in 2013 listeriosis mortality rates are also higher in the eu than for other foodborne pathogens listeria monocytogenes is a gram positive bacterium in the division firmicutes named after joseph lister its ability to grow at temperatures as low as 0 c permits multiplication at typical refrigeration temperatures greatly increasing its ability to evade control in human foodstuffs motile via flagella at 30 c and below but usually not at 37 c l monocytogenes can instead move within eukaryotic cells by explosive polymerization of actin filaments

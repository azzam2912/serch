it is a semiconductor in pure form it has the anti bixbyite structure zinc nitride can be obtained by thermally decomposing zincamide zinc diamine in an anaerobic environment at temperatures in excess of 200 c the by product of the reaction is ammonia 3zn nh znn 4nh it can also be formed by heating zinc to 600 c in a current of ammonia the by product is hydrogen gas 3zn 2nh znn 3h the decomposition of zinc nitride into the elements at the same temperature is a competing reaction at 700 c zinc nitride decomposes it has also been made by producing an electric discharge between zinc electrodes in a nitrogen atmosphere thin films have been produced by chemical vapour deposition of bis bis trimethylsilyl amido zinc with ammonia gas onto silica or zno coated alumina at 275 to 410 c the crystal structure is anti isomorphous with manganese iii oxide bixbyite the heat of formation is c per mol it is a semiconductor with a reported bandgap of c 3 2ev however a thin zinc nitride film prepared by electrolysis of molten salt mixture containing lin with a zinc electrode showed a band gap of 1 01 ev zinc

equivalently a path with at least two vertices is connected and has two terminal vertices vertices that have degree 1 while all others if any have degree 2 paths are often important in their role as subgraphs of other graphs in which case they are called paths in that graph a path is a particularly simple example of a tree and in fact the paths are exactly the trees in which no vertex has degree 3 or more a disjoint union of paths is called a linear forest paths are fundamental concepts of graph theory described in the introductory sections of most graph theory texts see for example bondy and murty 1976 gibbons 1985 or diestel 2005 in algebra path graphs appear as the dynkin diagrams of type a as such they classify the root system of type a and the weyl group of type a which is the symmetric group

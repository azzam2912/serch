a tamis has a cylindrical edge made of metal or wood that supports a disc of fine metal nylon or horsehair mesh to use one the cook places the tamis above a bowl and adds the ingredient to be strained in the center of the mesh the food is then pushed through using a scraper or pestle tamises have been in use since the middle ages because the tamis mesh is flat downward pressure can be applied with little effort simply by scraping with a horizontal motion a tamis should be used with the inner hoop first because it holds more and second so that the bowl below will rest on the hoop rather than the mesh tamises sift and grate ingredients finer than any other utensil and the texture of the strained material is evenly consistent tamises range in size from and the mesh is available in different gauges the nylon mesh is more resilient than wire and keeps its shape better it is the best preferably medium coarse mesh to use for fruit pur es which are liable to become discolored and tainted by wire a wire mesh is sharper and stronger than nylon but it will rust

most civil engineers practice in specialized subsets of civil engineering such as geotechnical engineering structural engineering transportation engineering hydraulic engineering environmental engineering project and construction management and land surveying the trend to implement software programs into the civil engineering industry began as educational concerns for the future as civil engineering prepared to enter the twenty first century today these concerns and trends are centered on the continuing education unit which have become required as part of maintaining the professional license as a result of the expanding use and demand for these software programs there was less of a necessity for occupations such as draftsman because the engineer began to prepare and input the design parameters into the program thus eliminating the need for manual drafting land surveying a specialized subset of civil engineering relies heavily on the computerization of the industry university textbooks have already since begun to include software applications for students to gain experience with some kind of software interface another specific subset infrastructure design relies heavily on estimates of load pressure drainage and flow some software houses have attempted to provide design software catering for the variety of infrastructure design fields in an integrated manner however general

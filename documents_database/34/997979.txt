the saccharopine dehydrogenase enzyme can be classified under and it has an important function in lysine metabolism and catalyses a reaction in the alpha aminoadipic acid pathway this pathway is unique to fungal organisms therefore this molecule could be useful in the search for new antibiotics this protein family also includes saccharopine dehydrogenase and homospermidine synthase it is found in prokaryotes eukaryotes and archaea simplistically sdh uses nad as an oxidant to catalyse the reversible pyridine nucleotide dependent oxidative deamination of the substrate saccharopine in order to form the products lysine and alpha ketoglutarate this can be described by the following equation saccharopine lysine alpha ketoglutarate saccharopine dehydrogenase ec catalyses the condensation to of l alpha aminoadipate delta semialdehyde aasa with l glutamate to give an imine which is reduced by nadph to give saccharopine in some organisms this enzyme is found as a bifunctional polypeptide with lysine ketoglutarate reductase pf homospermidine synthase proteins ec homospermidine synthase hss catalyses the synthesis of the polyamine homospermidine from 2 mol putrescine in an nad dependent reaction there appears to be two protein domains of similar size one domain is a rossmann fold that binds nad nadh and the other is relatively similar

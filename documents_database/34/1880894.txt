kaic encodes for the kaic protein which interacts with the kaia and kaib proteins in a post translational oscillator pto the pto is cyanobacteria master clock that is controlled by sequences of phosphorylation of kaic protein regulation of kaiabc expression and kaiabc phosphorylation is essential for cyanobacteria circadian rhythmicity and is particularly important for regulating cyanobacteria processes such as nitrogen fixation photosynthesis and cell division studies have shown similarities to drosophila neurospora and mammalian clock models in that the kaiabc regulation of the cyanobacteria slave circadian clock is also based on a transcription translation feedback loop ttfl kaic protein has both auto kinase and auto phosphatase activity and acts as the circadian regulator in both the pto and the ttfl kaic has been found to not only suppress kaibc when overexpressed but also suppress circadian expression of all genes in the cyanobacterial genome though the kaiabc gene cluster has been found to exist only in cyanobacteria evolutionarily kaic contains homologs that occur in archaea and proteobacteria it is the oldest circadian gene that has been discovered in prokaryotes kaic has a double domain structure and sequence that classifies it as part of the reca gene family of atp dependent recombinases

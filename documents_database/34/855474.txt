the t 8 16 translocation in amol is associated with hemophagocytosis secondary leukaemia which may include aml m5 has been associated with exposure to epipodophyllotoxins such as etoposide in order to fulfill world health organization who criteria for aml 5 a patient must have greater than 20 blasts in the bone marrow and of these greater than 80 must be of the monocytic lineage a further subclassification m5a versus m5b is made depending on whether the monocytic cells are predominantly monoblasts 80 acute monoblastic leukemia or a mixture of monoblasts and promonocytes nucleus delicate lacy chromatin and abundant often basophilic cytoplasm these cells may also have pseudopods by contrast promonocytes have a more convoluted nucleus and their cytoplasm may contain metachromatic granules monoblasts are typically mpo negative and promonocytes are mpo variable both monoblasts and promonocytes stain positive for non specific esterase nse however nse may often be negative immunophenotypically m5 aml variably express myeloid cd13 cd33 and monocytic cd11b cd11c markers cells may aberrantly express b cell marker cd20 and the nk marker cd56 monoblasts may be positive for cd34 aml m5 is treated with intensive chemotherapy such as anthracyclines or with bone marrow transplantation

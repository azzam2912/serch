they are usually induced from ca signaling although recent research has questioned the role of ca in gliotransmitters and may require a revision of the relevance of gliotransmitters in neuronal signalling in general while gliotransmitters can be released from any glial cell including oligodendrocytes astrocytes and microglia they are primarily released from astrocytes astrocytes rely on gap junctions for coupling and are star like in shape which allows them to come into contact with many other synapses in various regions of the brain their structure also makes them capable of bidirectional signaling it is estimated that astrocytes can make contact with over 100 000 synapses allowing them to play an essential role in synaptic transmission while gliotransmission primarily occurs between astrocytes and neurons gliotransmission is not limited to these two cell types besides the central nervous system gliotransmission also occurs among motor nerve terminals and schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system another occurrence of gliotransmission takes place between glial cells in the retina called m ller cells and retinal neurons the word glia illustrates the original belief among scientists that these cells play a passive role in neural signaling being responsible only for neuronal structure and support within the

also that the information should be limited to the serviced contract technical contract and the sla only no other document or medium should be made available to the service consumers other than the service contract that contains additional service related information a service contract that contains details about what it encapsulates e g the logic implementation and the technology used to build the service may end up being used in a particular manner by providing the service consumer more knowledge about the working of the service in the case of service orientation more knowledge is not necessarily better there is a chance that additional information could impede the reusability of the service as the service consumer designer may streamline his design based on this knowledge however doing so would affect the evolution of the service contract as now the service consumer is indirectly coupled to the service implementation which may need to be replaced in the future this increases the consumer to contract type of coupling which is a positive type of coupling however having too much dependence can negatively impact the evolution of both the service provider and the service consumer information hiding remains one of the key principles

both individuals love playing music and draw inspiration from the 70 s era which got them together virtually to form a band called spiral shades their biggest influences are bands like black sabbath pentagram band opeth the obsessed electric wizard the band was formed by khushal bhadra when one fine day looking for someone with similar musical taste he stumbled upon filip petersen s youtube channel where he used to record guitar covers of rare underground bands this immediately sparked some conversation between the two and the love for this genre of music this led to further discussions and creation of their debut demo titled hypnosis sessions since the two of them were thousands of miles away from each other it took some time to get used to creating music online they faced issues recording the drums eventually it had to be programmed because it was a difficult task to arrange for a drummer recording remotely with little to no knowledge about releasing music and several budget constraints they somehow managed to release their demo online through bandcamp itunes soundcloud facebook etc their demo hypnosis sessions released on 15 august 2013 was well received by the underground doom metal community

the score includes nine variables as effective predictors for 90 day mortality after a discharge from a cirrhosis related admission the variables include all model for end stage liver disease meld s components as well as sodium albumin total cholesterol white blood cell count age and length of stay meld plus was created as a result of a collaboration between massachusetts general hospital and ibm the development of meld plus was based on using unbiased approach toward discovery of biomarkers in this approach a feature selection machine learning algorithm observes a large collection of health records and identifies a small set of variables that could serve as the most efficient predictors for a given medical outcome an example for a notable feature selection method is lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator because total cholesterol and hospital length of stay are typically not uniform factors across different hospitals and may vary in different countries an additional model that included only 7 of the 9 variables was evaluated this yielded a performance close to the one of using all 9 variables and resulted in the following associations with increased mortality inr creatinine total bilirubin sodium wbc albumin and age a calculator

that can be caused by monopoly pricing in the case of artificial scarcity an externality a tax or subsidy or a binding price ceiling or price floor such as a minimum wage assume a market for nails where the cost of each nail is 0 10 demand decreases linearly there is a high demand for free nails and zero demand for nails at a price per nail of 1 10 or higher the price of 0 10 per nail represents the point of economic equilibrium in a competitive market if market conditions are perfect competition producers would charge a price of 0 10 and every customer whose marginal benefit exceeds 0 10 would buy a nail a monopoly producer of this product would typically charge whatever price will yield the greatest profit for themselves regardless of lost efficiency for the economy as a whole in this example the monopoly producer charges 0 60 per nail thus excluding every customer from the market with a marginal benefit less than 0 60 the deadweight loss due to monopoly pricing would then be the economic benefit foregone by customer with a marginal benefit of between 0 10 and 0 60 per nail the

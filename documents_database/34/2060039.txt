henry wolf probably built it sometime before 1863 on a section of greencastle road that no longer exists there are parke county records showing that in 1863 j j daniels was paid 40 to repair the greencastle road covered bridge and that later that year he was also contracted to dismantle the bridge after dismantling the bridge the pieces were piled nearby with the intension of rebuilding the bridge at another location in 1865 the county commissioners considered a location 300 yards upstream in line with a certain dead oak tree to be a fitting location to move the bridge to however dan chamberlain s research would indicate that the bridge was never moved and relocated to this spot and that it probably went on to rot where it had been piled by daniels another theory though by juliet snowden is that the actual bridge referred to is the bridge on the rockville greencastle road now call the new discovery road and that daniels used the parts from the bridge to build the crooks covered bridge in 1867

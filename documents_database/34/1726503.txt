these biomolecules are mostly metabolites generated by microorganisms grown on a solid support selected for this purpose this technology for the culture of microorganisms is an alternative to liquid or submerged fermentation used predominantly for industrial purposes this process consists of depositing a solid culture substrate such as rice or wheat bran on flatbeds after seeding it with microorganisms the substrate is then left in a temperature controlled room for several days liquid state fermentation is performed in tanks which can reach at an industrial scale liquid culture is ideal for the growing of unicellular organisms such as bacteria or yeasts to achieve liquid aerobic fermentation it is necessary to constantly supply the microorganism with oxygen which is generally done via stirring the fermentation media accurately managing the synthesis of the desired metabolites requires regulating temperature soluble oxygen ionic strength and ph and control nutrients applying this growing technique to filamentous fungi leads to difficulties the fungus develops in its vegetative form generating hyphae or multicellular ramous filaments while a septum separates the cells as this mycelium develops in a liquid environment it generates abundant viscosity in the growing medium reducing oxygen solubility while stirring disrupts the cell network increasing

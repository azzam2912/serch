since baekje was established by immigrants from goguryeo it is presumed that they spoke the goguryeo buyeo language and several attested words support this idea it is sometimes asserted that two languages were spoken in baekje one koguryoic baekje or han baekje branch and one japonic branch with the commoners speaking the japonic branch while the upper classes speaking the koguryoic branch or sillan or another han branch however there is no lexical evidence for this claim which is based solely on a passage in the zhou shu that mentions that the king of baekje had a title that was different from the name given to him by the people possibly simply an honorific in contrast the liang shu and the nan shi only state that the language of baekje was similar to that of goguryeo while the hou han shu and the san kuo chih describe how the people of the provinces of samhan proto three kingdoms spoke different languages according to kono rokuro 1987 and juha janhunen 2010 baekje was predominantly japonic speaking until it was conquered by proto koreans similarly alexander vovin suggests that japonic languages were spoken in large parts of the southern korean peninsula before

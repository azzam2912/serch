superoxide is a reactive oxygen species that is produced in large amounts during photosynthesis and aerobic cellular respiration the equation for the disproportionation of superoxide is shown below formula 1 ni sod was first isolated in 1996 from streptomyces bacteria and is primarily found in prokaryotic organisms it has since been observed in cyanobacteria and a number of other aquatic microbes ni sod is homohexameric meaning that it has six identical subunits each subunit has a single nickel containing active site the disproportionation mechanism involves a reduction oxidation cycle where a single electron transfer is catalyzed by the ni ni redox couple ni sod catalyzes close to the barrier of diffusion ni sod is a globular protein and is shaped like a hollow sphere it is homohexameric meaning that it is made up of six identical subunits each subunit is a bundle of four right handed helixes and has a molecular mass of 13 4 kda 117 amino acids the subunits align to give ni sod a three fold axis of symmetry there are six nickel cofactors in total one for each subunit the subunits also have a hydrophobic core which helps drive protein folding the core is made up

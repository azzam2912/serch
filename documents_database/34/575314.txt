this article however looks at the overall design closure process which takes a chip from its initial design state to the final form in which all of its design constraints are met every chip starts off as someone s idea of a good thing if we can make a part that performs function x we will all be rich once the concept is established someone from marketing says to make this chip profitably it must cost c and run at frequency f someone from manufacturing says to meet this chip s targets it must have a yield of y someone from packaging says it must fit in the p package and dissipate no more than w watts eventually the team generates an extensive list of all the constraints and objectives they must meet to manufacture a product that can be sold profitably the management then forms a design team which consists of chip architects logic designers functional verification engineers physical designers and timing engineers and assigns them to create a chip to the specifications the distinction between constraints and objectives is straightforward a constraint is a design target that must be met for the design to be successful for example

this helps to ensure that the runways etc are not subjected to excessive wear and tear thus prolonging their usable life and promoting safe aircraft operations the pcn is expressed as a five part code separated by forward slashes describing the piece of pavement concerned the first part is the pcn numerical value indicating the load carrying capacity of the pavement this is always reported as a whole number rounded from the determined capacity the value is calculated based on a number of factors such as aircraft geometry and a pavement s traffic patterns and is not necessarily the direct bearing strength of the pavement the second part is a letter either an r or an f depending on whether the pavement itself is of a rigid most typically concrete or a flexible most typically asphalt design the third part is another letter from a to d expressing the strength of what is underneath the pavement section known as the subgrade so a subgrade of a would be very strong like concrete stabilised clay a subgrade of d would be very weak like uncompacted soil the flexible pavements have four subgrade categories the rigid pavements have four subgrade categories the

the computer graphics generated by the technique can help scientists visualize changes in velocity fields this technique uses a hybrid lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field it is a special case of a line integral convolution the method consists of using nearest neighbour interpolation followed by an error correction mechanism the lagrangian specification is used during the integration to update the particle positions the property of interest is advected in the eulerian frame of reference it was originally designed by bruno jobard and others for steady flows but was extended to unsteady flows the main idea is to create a white noise texture of the desired resolution which is used as a base on top of which the vector field can be applied that means for every particle looking backward in the vector field to find out the new value for the cell it is contained in then looking forward to calculate the new position of the particle in the cell in its application the lagrangian eulerian method can be accelerated using the gpus used in common chipsets present in nvidia and ati radeon graphics cards

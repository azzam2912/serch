for example for an object resting on a horizontal surface e g a table the support polygon is the convex hull of its footprint on the table the support polygon succinctly represents the conditions necessary for an object to be at equilibrium under gravity that is if the object s center of mass lies over the support polygon then there exist a set of forces over the region of contact that exactly counteracts the forces of gravity note that this is a necessary condition for stability but not a sufficient one let the object be in contact at a finite number of points formula 1 at each point formula 2 let formula 3 be the set of forces that can be applied on the object at that point here formula 3 is known as the friction cone and for the coulomb model of friction is actually a cone with apex at the origin extending to infinity in the normal direction of the contact let formula 5 be the unspecified forces at the contact points to balance the object in static equilibrium the following newton euler equations must be met on formula 5 where formula 11 is the force of gravity

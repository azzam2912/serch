this species plays an important role in the atmosphere and as a reactive oxygen species in cell biology the molecule has a bent structure the superoxide anion and the hydroperoxyl radical exist in equilibrium in aqueous solution the p k of ho is 4 88 therefore about 0 3 of any superoxide present in the cytosol of a typical cell is in the protonated form it oxidizes nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide together with its conjugate base superoxide hydroperoxyl is an important reactive oxygen species unlike which has reducing properties ho can act as an oxidant in a number of biologically important reactions such as the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from tocopherol and polyunstaturated fatty acids in the lipid bilayer as such it may be an important initiator of lipid peroxidation gaseous hydroperoxyl is involved in reaction cycles that destroy stratospheric ozone it is also present in the troposphere where it is essentially a byproduct of the oxidation of carbon monoxide and of hydrocarbons by the hydroxyl radical because dielectric constant has a strong effect on p k and the dielectric constant of air is quite low superoxide produced photochemically in the atmosphere is almost exclusively present as ho as

the dragonflies and damselflies are the only living members of this group which was far more diverse in the late paleozoic and contained gigantic species including the griffinflies colloquially called giant dragonflies although they were not dragonflies in the strict sense of the order protodonata this lineage dates back at least to the bashkirian not quite 320 million years ago there is little consensus about the relationships of the odonatoptera what is certain is that they are a clade of winged insects that stands outside the neoptera but various authors analyses have yielded any one of three mutually exclusive phylogenies or some variant thereof the least problematic in a taxonomic sense view is that the odonatoptera are the sister taxon of the ephemeropteroidea the mayfly lineage and that the palaeodictyopteroidea are either their sister taxon or a basal assemblage all within a monophyletic palaeoptera but few recent analyses have supported this rather it seems more and more likely that the odonatoptera are the sister taxon of the neoptera making the palaeoptera paraphyletic the third view places the mayfly lineage as sister taxon of the neopterans with the odonatoptera as most primitive winged insects it has seen little support in recent

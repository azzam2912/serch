in other words the output of c3 superclass linearization is a deterministic method resolution order mro c3 superclass linearization results in three important properties it was first published at the 1996 oopsla conference in a paper entitled a monotonic superclass linearization for dylan it was adapted to the open dylan implementation in january 2012 following an enhancement proposal it has been chosen as the default algorithm for method resolution in python 2 3 and newer raku parrot solidity and pgf tikz s object oriented programming module it is also available as an alternative non default mro in the core of perl 5 starting with version 5 10 0 an extension implementation for earlier versions of perl 5 named codice 1 exists on cpan python s guido van rossum summarizes c3 superclass linearization thusly the c3 superclass linearization of a class is the sum of the class plus a unique merge of the linearizations of its parents and a list of the parents itself the list of parents as the last argument to the merge process preserves the local precedence order of direct parent classes the merge of parents linearizations and parents list is done by selecting the first head of

the spire is acute with 2 whorls in the protoconch folloowed by seven subsequent whorls the 2 earlier whorls show well marked transverse ribs but little or no spiral sculpture the spirals on the later whorls are stronger consisting of primaries with alternating finer secondary threads in pairs transverse ribs stronger and more numerous on the later whorls 25 on the last and more sharply defined the intersecting ribs and spirals form a beautiful cancellation ornamenting the whorls up to the margin of the groove where the ribs end abruptly in the groove lines of growth and fine subequal spirals form the only sculpture the upper margin of the groove is marked by a sharp carination sloping steeply to the suture the aperture is narrow with a smooth callus the whorls of the protoconch are probably 3 in the adult those of the spire 10 the protoconch is smooth highly polished and somewhat papillate the initial whorl for the most part submerged the succeeding volution rather low and broadly inflated the final whorl of the protoconch flattened laterally and relatively high the line of demarcation between the spire and the protoconch is initiated by a protractive thickening of the shell

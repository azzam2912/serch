rostrally the midbrain adjoins the diencephalon thalamus hypothalamus etc while caudally it adjoins the hindbrain pons medulla and cerebellum in the rostral direction the midbrain noticeably splays laterally sectioning of the midbrain is usually performed axially at one of two levels that of the superior colliculi or that of the inferior colliculi one common technique for remembering the structures of the midbrain involves visualizing these cross sections especially at the level of the superior colliculi as the upside down face of a bear with the cerebral peduncles forming the ears the cerebral aqueduct the mouth and the tectum the chin prominent features of the tegmentum form the eyes and certain sculptural shadows of the face the tectum latin for roof is the dorsal side of the midbrain it is involved in certain reflexes in response to visual or auditory stimuli the reticulospinal tract which exerts some control over alertness takes input from the tectum and travels both rostrally and caudally from it the corpora quadrigemina are four mounds called colliculi in two pairs a superior and an inferior pair on the surface of the tectum the superior colliculi process some visual information aid the decussation of several fibres of the

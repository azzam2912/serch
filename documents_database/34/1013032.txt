the method was proposed in 1995 and experimentally demonstrated in 2007 it is the second concept to overcome the diffraction barrier in far field optical microscopy published by stefan hell using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds a resolution of up to 7 8 nm was achieved in 2009 this is far below the diffraction limit 200 nm in gsd microscopy fluorescent markers are used in one condition the marker can freely be excited from ground state and returns spontaneously via emission of a fluorescence photon however if light of appropriate wavelength is additionally applied the dye can be excited to a long lived dark state i e a state where no fluorescence occurs as long as the molecule is in the long lived dark state e g a triplet state it cannot be excited from the ground state switching between these two states bright and dark by applying light fulfills all preconditions for the resolft concept and subwavelength scale imaging and therefore images with very high resolution can be obtained for successful implementation gsd microscopy requires either special fluorophores with high triplet yield or removal of oxygen by use of various mounting media such as mowiol or vectashield the implementation

mariner 9 was launched toward mars on may 30 1971 from cape canaveral air force station and reached the planet on november 14 of the same year becoming the first spacecraft to orbit another planet only narrowly beating the soviets mars 2 and mars 3 which both arrived within a month after months of dust storms it managed to send back clear pictures of the surface mariner 9 returned 7329 images over the course of its mission which concluded in october 1972 mariner 9 was designed to continue the atmospheric studies begun by mariner 6 and 7 and to map over 70 of the martian surface from the lowest altitude and at the highest resolutions from 1 kilometer per pixel to 100 meters per pixel of any mars mission up to that point an infrared radiometer was included to detect heat sources in search of evidence of volcanic activity it was to study temporal changes in the martian atmosphere and surface mars two moons were also to be analyzed mariner 9 more than met its objectives under original plans a dual mission was to be flown like mariners 6 7 however the launch failure of mariner 8 ruined this scheme

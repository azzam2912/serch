the number of tires required for aircraft increases with the weight of the aircraft as the weight of the airplane needs to be distributed more evenly aircraft tire tread patterns are designed to facilitate stability in high crosswind conditions to channel water away to prevent hydroplaning and for braking effect aircraft tires also include fusible plugs which are assembled on the inside of the wheels designed to melt at a certain temperature tires often overheat if maximum braking is applied during an aborted takeoff or an emergency landing the fuses provide a safer failure mode that prevents tire explosions by deflating in a controlled manner thus minimizing damage to aircraft and objects in the surrounding environment each of the twelve boeing 777 300er main tires is inflated to weighs has a diameter of and is changed every 300 cycles while the brakes are changed every 2000 cycles each tire is worth about 5 000 aircraft tires generally operate at high pressures up to for airliners and even higher for business jets the main landing gear on the concorde was typically inflated to whilst its tail bumber gear tyres were as high as the high pressure and weight load on the

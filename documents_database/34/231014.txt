the name is derived from a mistake made by the compositors in the ten commandments the word not in the sentence thou shalt not commit adultery was omitted thus changing the sentence into thou shalt commit adultery this blunder was spread in a number of copies about a year later the publishers of the wicked bible were called to the star chamber and fined and deprived of their printing license the fact that this edition of the bible contained such a flagrant mistake outraged charles i and george abbot the archbishop of canterbury the majority of the wicked bible s copies were immediately cancelled and burned and the number of extant copies remaining today which are considered highly valuable by collectors is thought to be relatively low one copy is in the collection of rare books in the new york public library and is very rarely made accessible another can be seen in the dunham bible museum in houston texas us the british library in london had a copy on display opened to the misprinted commandment in a free exhibition until september 2009 the wicked bible also appeared on display for a limited time at the ink and blood exhibit

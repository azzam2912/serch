they typically have prominent oral cilia in the form of a series of polykinetids called the adoral zone of membranelles beginning anterior to the oral cavity and running down to the left side of the mouth there may also be one or two paroral membranes on its right side the body cilia are fused to form polykinetids called cirri in some and are sparse to absent in others forms with cirri are common throughout soil freshwater and marine environments individuals tend to be flattened with cirri confined to the ventral surface these are variously used for crawling over objects acting as feet swimming or assisting in food capture they are generally divided into hypotrichs and stichotrichs but were originally all considered hypotrichs forms with sparse or absent body cilia tend to be smaller and are mostly marine but a few are common in freshwater again they are generally divided into oligotrichs and choreotrichs but were originally all considered oligotrichs the latter group includes the tintinnids which produce loricae or shells and are the predominant fossil ciliates as first defined by b tschli in 1889 the spirotrichs were one of two orders together with the now abandoned holotrichs and included all

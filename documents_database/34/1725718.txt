this concept makes it similar to the role that the nanofactory would play because it is considered to be a factory that operates on that same scale model the closest thing that nature has to a nanofoundry is the simple biological cell in silico biology attempts to duplicate nature by creating a virtual cell with the complete cycle of metabolism the idea of creating an artificial cell along with working nanofoundries is highlighted in the phenomena of bioconvergence which may advance us from the information age to the nanotechnology age nanofoundries and artificial cells are creating a world where health care the very definition of medicine along with life itself is entering a state of transition this phenomenon is directly in parallel with changes in the procedures used in agriculture managing our bioresources ultimately leading up to the de facto equivalent of bio engineering entire ecosystems from scratch on a larger scale materials that appear to be smooth still have an abrasive appearance to them using the nanoscale however atoms rub off one a time this creates new challenges for researchers who build their devices that are only 10 atoms wide one of the first nanofoundries has been set up

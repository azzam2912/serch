the understeer is measured in units of degrees of additional yaw per g of lateral acceleration hence the total understeer is 11 0 deg g minus 6 9 deg g or 4 1 deg g negative values are oversteering positive values are understeering for that axle if the understeer contribution of the rear axle is greater than that of the front axle you get negative understeer which is known as oversteer the analysis is only applicable while the parameters remain constant and thus only up to about 0 4 g load transfer effect and cornering stiffness of tire as load transfers across the vehicle the tire s ability to provide cornering force for a given slip angle changes the latter is known as the cornering stiffness of the tire see also tire load sensitivity aligning torque the tire does not just generate a lateral force it generates a torque as well this tends to rotate the vehicle as a whole roll camber as the vehicle rolls the kinematics of the suspension provide a change in the camber of the tire this generates a force known as camber thrust roll steer as the vehicle rolls the kinematics of the suspension provide

it is the third planet claimed in the system and assuming a six planet model the fifth in order from the star though not confirmed to be a terrestrial planet and significantly more massive than earth at 6 98 earth masses the super earth is the first exoplanet of terrestrial mass proposed to orbit within the habitable zone of its parent star assuming its existence computer climate simulations have confirmed the possibility of the existence of surface water and these factors combine to a relatively high measure of planetary habitability a team of astronomers led by st phane udry of the geneva observatory used the harps instrument on the european southern observatory 3 6 meter telescope in la silla chile to discover the planet in 2007 udry s team employed the radial velocity technique in which the mass of a planet is determined based on the small perturbations it induces in its parent star s orbit via gravity in september 2012 roman baluev filtered out the red noise from the keck data and concluded that this planet s existence is probable only to 2 2 standard deviations that same year however a team from the usno confirmed the existence of

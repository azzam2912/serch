it is a simple check to see if the produced material is rational that the material s creator was thinking rationally applying sanity the point of a sanity test is to rule out certain classes of obviously false results not to catch every possible error a rule of thumb may be checked to perform the test the advantage of a sanity test over performing a complete or rigorous test is speed in arithmetic for example when multiplying by 9 using the divisibility rule for 9 to verify that the sum of digits of the result is divisible by 9 is a sanity test it will not catch every multiplication error however it s a quick and simple method to discover many possible errors in computer science a sanity test is a very brief run through of the functionality of a computer program system calculation or other analysis to assure that part of the system or methodology works roughly as expected this is often prior to a more exhaustive round of testing a sanity test can refer to various orders of magnitude and other simple rule of thumb devices applied to cross check mathematical calculations for example in software development the

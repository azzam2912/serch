changing from schwarzschild to lema tre coordinates removes the coordinate singularity at the schwarzschild radius the original schwarzschild coordinate expression of the schwarzschild metric in natural units is given as where this metric has a coordinate singularity at the schwarzschild radius formula 8 georges lema tre was the first to show that this is not a real physical singularity but simply a manifestation of the fact that the static schwarzschild coordinates cannot be realized with material bodies inside the schwarzschild radius indeed inside the schwarzschild radius everything falls towards the centre and it is impossible for a physical body to keep a constant radius a transformation of the schwarzschild coordinate system from formula 9 to the new coordinates formula 10 the numerator and denominator are switched inside the square roots leads to the lema tre coordinate expression of the metric where the trajectories with constant are timelike geodesics with the proper time along these geodesics they represent the motion of freely falling particles which start out with zero velocity at infinity at any point their speed is just equal to the escape velocity from that point in lema tre coordinates there is no singularity at the schwarzschild radius which instead

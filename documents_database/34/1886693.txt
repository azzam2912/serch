they are used to interconnect components on printed circuits and integrated circuits working at microwave frequencies because the planar type fits in well with the manufacturing methods for these components transmission lines are more than simply interconnections with simple interconnections the propagation of the electromagnetic wave along the wire is fast enough to be considered instantaneous and the voltages at each end of the wire can be considered identical if the wire is longer than a large fraction of a wavelength one tenth is often used as a rule of thumb these assumptions are no longer true and transmission line theory must be used instead with transmission lines the geometry of the line is precisely controlled in most cases the cross section is kept constant along the length so that its electrical behaviour is highly predictable at lower frequencies these considerations are only necessary for the cables connecting different pieces of equipment but at microwave frequencies the distance at which transmission line theory becomes necessary is measured in millimetres hence transmission lines are needed within circuits the earliest type of planar transmission line was conceived during world war ii by robert m barrett it is known as stripline and is

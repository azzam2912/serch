these rolls of material vary significantly in size and weight ranging from wide and weighing as much as several tons the converting industry takes these continuous rolls of thin flat materials known as webs threads them through processing machines such as printing presses laminating coating and slitting machines and converts or changes the web of material into an intermediate form or final product for example a converter s equipment might take a web of plastic film cut it into lengths and fuse their edges thus converting it into plastic bags this activity is known as web processing typical converting processes are coating laminating and printing coating technologies can include hot melt coating gravure coating curtain coating and slot die coating the most common printing techniques are flexo printing and rotogravure gravure printing both print processes are suited to high speed roll to roll processing many converting companies will process large diameter wide rolls of material as this increases the converting efficiency by minimising changes on completion of the converting process the rolls may be cut into smaller rolls on a slitting machine these rolls are then a convenient size for handling on packaging and other machines alternatively the rolls may

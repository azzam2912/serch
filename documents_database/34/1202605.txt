this deep red liquid is immiscible with water but soluble in organic solvents it readily polymerizes at room temperature to form a hard black solid cs was discovered by b la lengyel who assigned it an unsymmetrical structure later infrared and raman spectroscopy showed that the structure is symmetrical with a d point group symmetry i e s c c c s this compound is analogous to carbon suboxide whose structure is o c c c o lengyel first synthesized this compound by passing carbon disulfide cs vapor through an electric arc with carbon electrodes this treatment produced a black solution that after filtration and evaporation gave a cherry red liquid he determined the molecular mass by cryoscopy later preparations of cs include thermolysis of a stream of cs in a quartz tube heated to 900 to 1100 c as well as flash vacuum pyrolysis fvp of 1 2 dithiole 3 thiones among its few known reactions cs reacts with bromine to form the cyclic disulfide cs polymerizes under applied pressure to give a black semi conducting solid a similar pressure induced polymerization of cs also gives a black semiconducting polymer in addition reactions of cs can yield highly condensed

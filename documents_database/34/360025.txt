its thin wing and engine nacelles necessitated the use of tandem landing gear the first soviet aircraft to do so it was apparently canceled before the prototype made its first flight although sources disagree with this the il 30 was a follow on to the il 28 although design began on 21 june 1948 before the il 28 had flown it was designed to meet a requirement for a jet bomber that could carry to a range of with a maximum speed no less than the design took that of the il 28 as a starting point but had thin mid mounted swept wings with a 35 sweep angle chosen to allow the aircraft to reach its required speed it was intended to be powered by two new lyulka tr 3 axial flow turbojet engines with 45 1 kn 10 140 lbf thrust each in wing mounted nacelles both the fuselage and the nacelles were area ruled thin wings and the 2 anhedral necessary to cure the excessive lateral stability limited the amount of fuel that could be carried and tip tanks were required to meet the range requirement the slim engine nacelles did not allow the main landing gear

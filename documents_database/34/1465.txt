here two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere s center formally if formula 1 is continuous then there exists an formula 2 such that formula 3 the case formula 4 can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the earth s equator with the same temperature the same is true for any circle this assumes the temperature varies continuously the case formula 5 is often illustrated by saying that at any moment there is always a pair of antipodal points on the earth s surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures the borsuk ulam theorem has several equivalent statements in terms of odd functions recall that formula 6 is the n sphere and formula 7 is the n ball according to the first historical mention of the statement of the borsuk ulam theorem appears in the first proof was given by where the formulation of the problem was attributed to stanislaw ulam since then many alternative proofs have been found by various authors as collected by the following statements are equivalent to the borsuk ulam theorem a function formula 16 is

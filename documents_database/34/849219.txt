hvac airflow in spaces generally can be classified by two different types mixing or dilution and displacement mixing systems generally supply air such that the supply air mixes with the room air so that the mixed air is at the room design temperature and humidity in cooling mode the cool supply air typically around 55 f 13 c saturated at design conditions exits an outlet at high velocity the high velocity supply air stream causes turbulence causing the room air to mix with the supply air because the entire room is near fully mixed temperature variations are small while the contaminant concentration is fairly uniform throughout the entire room diffusers are normally used as the air outlets to create the high velocity supply air stream most often the air outlets and inlets are placed in the ceiling supply diffusers in the ceiling are fed by fan coil units in the ceiling void or by air handling units in a remote plant room the fan coil or handling unit take in return air from the ceiling void and mix this with fresh air and cool or heat it as required to achieve the room design conditions this arrangement is known as

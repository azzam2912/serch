in the case of projective space the tautological bundle is known as the tautological line bundle the tautological bundle is also called the universal bundle since any vector bundle over a compact space is a pullback of the tautological bundle this is to say a grassmannian is a classifying space for vector bundles because of this the tautological bundle is important in the study of characteristic classes tautological bundles are constructed both in algebraic topology and in algebraic geometry in algebraic geometry the tautological line bundle as invertible sheaf is the dual of the hyperplane bundle or serre s twisting sheaf formula 2 the hyperplane bundle is the line bundle corresponding to the hyperplane divisor p in p the tautological line bundle and the hyperplane bundle are exactly the two generators of the picard group of the projective space in michael atiyah s k theory the tautological line bundle over a complex projective space is called the standard line bundle the sphere bundle of the standard bundle is usually called the hopf bundle cf bott generator more generally there are also tautological bundles on a projective bundle of a vector bundle as well as a grassmann bundle the older term

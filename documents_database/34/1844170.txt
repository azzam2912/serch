it was created due to formation of a new continental margin in the mesozoic followed by tectonic uplifting of the divide and then scarp retreat the escarpment is estimated to be approximately in length from north to south the great escarpment formed about 80 million years ago due to scarp retreat from a new continental edge formed by rifting this was similar to the model in the western rift of east africa the great divide is an upwarp that lies tens or hundreds of kilometers from the chasmic fault of the continental margin creating a drainage divide the sequence of formation appears to have started with erosion of the plain and formation of a river pattern the traces of these rivers can still be seen there were then widespread flows of basalt after which the great divide lifted and finally the great escarpment formed through scarp retreat the great escarpment rises to several hundred meters to the east the coastal zone is relatively flat with fast erosional process rate and few landscape palaeoforms to the west there are many palaeoforms and process rates are slow the escarpment forms a series of bluffs along the eastern edge of plateau that stretches

this can cause different populations of the same organism to display similar phenotypes regardless of their underlying genetics and differences in their environments to illustrate a common example known as countergradient growth rate consider two populations the two populations live in different environments that affect growth differently due to many ecological factors such as the temperature and available food one population is genetically predisposed to have an increased growth rate but inhabits an environment that reduces growth rate such as a cool environment and thereby limits the opportunities to take full advantage of any genetic predisposition the second population is genetically predisposed to have a decreased growth rate but inhabits an environment that supports an increased growth rate such as a warm environment and allows members of the population to grow faster despite their genetic disadvantage since the genetic influence directly counteracts the environmental influence in each population both populations will have a similar intermediate growth rate countergradient variation can reduce apparent variability by creating similar phenotypes but it is still possible for the two populations to show phenotypic diversity if either the genetic gradient or the environmental gradient has a stronger influence many examples of countergradient variation have been

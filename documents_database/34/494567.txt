a trembling hand perfect equilibrium is an equilibrium that takes the possibility of off the equilibrium play into account by assuming that the players through a slip of the hand or tremble may choose unintended strategies albeit with negligible probability first define a perturbed game a perturbed game is a copy of a base game with the restriction that only totally mixed strategies are allowed to be played a totally mixed strategy is a mixed strategy where every pure strategy is played with non zero probability this is the trembling hands of the players they sometimes play a different strategy other than the one they intended to play then define a strategy set s in a base game as being trembling hand perfect if there is a sequence of perturbed games that converge to the base game in which there is a series of nash equilibria that converge to s note all completely mixed nash equilibria are perfect note2 the mixed strategy extension of any finite normal form game has at least one perfect equilibrium the game represented in the following normal form matrix has two pure strategy nash equilibria namely formula 1 and formula 2 however only formula 3

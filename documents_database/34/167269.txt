it contains the functional group r so where r is an organic group sulfonates are the conjugate base of sulfonic acids sulfonates are generally stable in water non oxidizing and colorless many useful compounds and even some biochemicals feature sulfonates anions with the general formula rso are called sulfonates they are the conjugate bases of sulfonic acids with formula rsooh as sulfonic acids tend to be strong acids the corresponding sulfonates are weak bases due to the stability of sulfonate anions the cations of sulfonate salts such as scandium triflate have application as lewis acids a classic organic reaction for the preparation of sulfonates is that of alkyl halides with sulfites such as sodium sulfite first described by adolph strecker in 1868 strecker sulfite alkylation the general reaction is iodide is used as a catalyst esters with the general formula rsoor are called sulfonic esters individual members of the category are named analogously to how ordinary carboxyl esters are named for example if the r group is a methyl group and the r group is a trifluoromethyl group the resulting compound is methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate sulfonic esters are used as reagents in organic synthesis chiefly because the rso group is a

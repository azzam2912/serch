pure diethanolamine is a white solid at room temperature but its tendencies to absorb water and to supercool mean it is often encountered as a colorless viscous liquid diethanolamine is polyfunctional being a secondary amine and a diol like other organic amines diethanolamine acts as a weak base reflecting the hydrophilic character of the secondary amine and hydroxyl groups dea is soluble in water amides prepared from dea are often also hydrophilic in 2013 the chemical was classified by the international agency for research on cancer as possibly carcinogenic to humans group 2b the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia first produces ethanolamine which reacts with a second and third equivalent of ethylene oxide to give dea and triethanolamine about 300m kg are produced annually in this way the ratio of the products can be controlled by changing the stoichiometry of the reactants dea is used as a surfactant and a corrosion inhibitor it is used to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from natural gas in oil refineries a dea in water solution is commonly used to remove hydrogen sulfide from sour gas it has an advantage over a similar amine ethanolamine in that a higher concentration may

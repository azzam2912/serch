they typically consist of aliphatic acyl groups of low to medium chain lengths esterified to the hydroxyl groups of glucose or sucrose presence of such acyl groups gives these compounds hydrophobic properties this group of compounds has been extensively studied in tomato and related species in which these compounds are produced and secreted in sporadical amounts from trichomes on the plant leaf and stem surface production of copious quantities of these acylsugars give a sticky feel to the plant tissue in particular this flower has shown to distract herbivorous insect pests against thrips damage it is believed that acylsugars provide physical and or chemical defense to the plant acylsugars are nonvolatile and viscous polyesters that consist of acyl chains on sucrose or glucose backbones these attached acid chains may vary in length from short to medium which affects the phenotypic characteristics of the plant other factors that may affect plant phenotype includes the presence of either glucose or sucrose the number of acyl chains as well as the total amounts of acyl sugars acylsugars are produced in the secretory glandular trichomes of various plants specifically those that belong to the family solanaceae these compounds are identified to be responsible for

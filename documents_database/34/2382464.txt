it is a proactive protocol based on distance vectors and operates on ieee 802 15 4 optimized for multi hop and many to one communication but also supports one to one messages this protocol is specified in with special applications in rfcs rpl can support a wide variety of link layers including those with limitations with potential losses or that are used in devices with limited resources this protocol can quickly create network routes share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efficient way rpl creates a topology similar to a tree dag or directed acyclic graph each node within the network has an assigned rank rank which increases as the teams move away from the root node dodag the nodes resend packets using the lowest range as the route selection criteria three control messages are defined in icmpv6 via the implementation of the rpl protocol occurs in wireless sensors and networks the most used operating system for its implementation is contiki which is a small open source operating system developed for use in a number of small systems ranging from 8 bit computers to integrated systems on microcontrollers including sensor network nodes the rpl protocol is implemented in

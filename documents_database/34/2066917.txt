robert lock is leading the concept studies for the 2022 orbiter concern in nasa is that the currently used relay satellites 2001 mars odyssey and mars reconnaissance orbiter may stop functioning resulting in the need to press the maven science orbiter into use as a backup telecommunications relay since the highly elliptical orbit of maven limits its usefulness as a relay for surface operations nasa will lower its orbit from to between altitude where it can serve as a relay while continuing its science mission another suggested feature under study is the sample rendezvous capture and return capability the samples cached by the mars 2020 rover would be placed in mars orbit by a future mars ascent vehicle from there the orbiter would rendezvous transfer the samples into a capsule and send it back to earth the proposed orbiter would be propelled with two solar electric ion thrusters one engine would be active while the other one would be a spare electrical power to the engines would be provided by advanced solar arrays that generate 20 kw an ion engine would give the spacecraft significant orbital flexibility for long term support of future missions opportunistic flybys of phobos and deimos

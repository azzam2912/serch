however several phacopids have very few lenses such as the species of the genera cryphops denckmannites dienstina eucryphops nephranops and plagiolaria or lack eyes altogether like afrops dianops ductina and trimerocephalus the natural fracture lines sutures of the head run along the top edges of the compound eye from the back of the eye these cut to the side of the head proparian and not to the back in front of the eye the right and left facial sutures connect in front of the inflated glabella and consequently the free cheeks or librigenae are yoked as a single piece in some of the eyeless genera ductina the suture coincides with the marginal suture and thus appears to be absent the part of the skeleton that is tucked under the doublure has no sutures crossing it to form a rostral plate the thorax has 11 rarely 10 segments the side lobes or pleurae are furrowed and the articulating facets distinct the tailshield or pygidium is always smaller than the headshield or cephalon a situation called micropygous in the phacopidae a merger of the anterior and the two pairs of neighbouring lobes of the glabella forms a frontal lobe that expands forward

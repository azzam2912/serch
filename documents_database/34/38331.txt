the resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity in other words it exhibits photoconductivity a photoresistor can be applied in light sensitive detector circuits and light activated and dark activated switching circuits a photoresistor is made of a high resistance semiconductor in the dark a photoresistor can have a resistance as high as several megaohms m while in the light a photoresistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms if incident light on a photoresistor exceeds a certain frequency photons absorbed by the semiconductor give bound electrons enough energy to jump into the conduction band the resulting free electrons and their hole partners conduct electricity thereby lowering resistance the resistance range and sensitivity of a photoresistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices moreover unique photoresistors may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands a photoelectric device can be either intrinsic or extrinsic an intrinsic semiconductor has its own charge carriers and is not an efficient semiconductor for example silicon in intrinsic devices the only available electrons are in the valence band and hence the photon must have enough energy to excite the electron across the entire bandgap extrinsic devices have impurities

it is the only type of transmitting antenna that can radiate practical amounts of power in the frequency range of 3 hz to 3 khz commonly called elf waves a ground dipole consists of two ground electrodes buried in the earth separated by tens to hundreds of kilometers linked by overhead transmission lines to a power plant transmitter located between them alternating current electricity flows in a giant loop between the electrodes through the ground radiating elf waves so the ground is part of the antenna to be most effective ground dipoles must be located over certain types of underground rock formations the idea was proposed by u s dept of defense physicist nicholas christofilos in 1959 although small ground dipoles have been used for years as sensors in geological and geophysical research their only use as antennas has been in a few military elf transmitter facilities to communicate with submerged submarines besides small research and experimental antennas four full scale ground dipole installations are known to have been constructed two by the u s navy at republic michigan and clam lake wisconsin one by the russian navy on the kola peninsula near murmansk russia and one in india at

the technology was first used by kamrul of velocity in combination with the engine control unit ecu and various sensors the engine blips the throttle for the driver during both downshifts and upshifts to allow for better and smoother shifting and improved handling when a car with a manual transmission is in motion with the clutch engaged there is a mechanical connection between the engine and wheels which keep them in sync with each other when shifting however depressing the clutch is required this breaks the mechanical connection between the engine and wheels and the engine speed is no longer linked to that of the wheels when upshifting this is usually not a problem as the tendency of the engine to reduce speed itself without gas will slow it to loosely match the lower speed of the higher gear however when downshifting the engine needs to speed up to come to speed with the wheels if the accelerator is not blipped or briefly and quickly pressed to speed up the disengaged engine the engine will have to take power from the wheels and momentum of the car to come to speed which is often accompanied by a sudden deceleration of

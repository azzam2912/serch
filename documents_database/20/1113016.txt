it is encoded in humans by the vegfc gene which is located on chromosome 4q34 the main function of vegf c is in lymphangiogenesis where it acts on lymphatic endothelial cells lecs primarily via its receptor vegfr 3 promoting survival growth and migration it was discovered in 1996 as a ligand for the orphan receptor vegfr 3 soon thereafter it was shown to be a specific growth factor for lymphatic vessels in a variety of models however in addition to its effect on lymphatic vessels it can also promote the growth of blood vessels and regulate their permeability the effect on blood vessels can be mediated via its primary receptor vegfr 3 or its secondary receptor vegfr 2 apart from vascular targets vegf c is also important for neural development and blood pressure regulation it has been suggested that vegfc is a morphogen but not a chemotactic factor for lymphatic endothelial cell precursors it has been suggested that vegfc can form turing patterns to regulate lymphangiogenesis in the zebrafish embryo by interacting with collagen i and mmp2 vegf c is a dimeric secreted protein which undergoes a complex proteolytic maturation resulting in multiple processed forms after translation vegf c consists

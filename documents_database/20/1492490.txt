once a newer bond is issued this liquidity premium will generally decrease or disappear for example the 30 year us treasury bond generally trades at a premium relative to the 29 year bond even though these are otherwise quite similar once a few months pass so the 30 year has aged to a 29 year and the 29 year has aged to a 29 year say and a new 30 year is issued the old bonds are now both off the run and the liquidity premium will in general decrease thus if one had sold the 30 year short bought the 29 year and waits a few months one profits from the change in the liquidity premium this is when a trader notices a difference in the price of a futures contract for delivery in the future and the underlying asset purchased immediately for example if gold is trading at 1000 oz and there is a futures contract for 1200 oz the trader would long buy the gold and short sell the futures contract they would make money as the prices converged together and the profit would be 200 dollars in this example as the gold price equaled the futures

it is identical to a tukey mean difference plot the name by which it is known in other fields but was popularised in medical statistics by j martin bland and douglas g altman bland and altman make the point that any two methods that are designed to measure the same parameter or property should have good correlation when a set of samples are chosen such that the property to be determined varies considerably a high correlation for any two methods designed to measure the same property could thus in itself just be a sign that one has chosen a widespread sample a high correlation does not necessarily imply that there is good agreement between the two methods consider a set of formula 1 samples for example objects of unknown volume both assays for example different methods of volume measurement are performed on each sample resulting in formula 2 data points each of the formula 1 samples is then represented on the graph by assigning the mean of the two measurements as the formula 4 value and the difference between the two values as the formula 5 value the cartesian coordinates of a given sample formula 6 with values of formula

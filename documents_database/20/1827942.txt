it was tasked with countering supersonic bomber aircraft launching stand off missiles and thus had to have very long range and high speed capabilities the final design was expected to fly at with a maximum range of over development started as green sparkler sometime in the early 1950s green sparkler featured active radar homing but it was quickly decided this was beyond the state of the art replacing the active homing with semi active radar homing produced blue envoy the designs were otherwise similar and similar to the us cim 10 bomarc as well test launches of sub scale models were carried out successfully and development of the new ramjet engines and seeker electronics was well advanced when the project was cancelled in april 1957 as part of the 1957 defence white paper its cancellation made blue envoy possibly the most enigmatic project in the field of 1950s united kingdom weapons development an impromptu meeting between the contractors led to a proposal to use the guidance system and ramjets to upgrade the bloodhound mk i missile design this private proposal was accepted and became bloodhound mk ii which increased range to and offered much greater performance against low level targets

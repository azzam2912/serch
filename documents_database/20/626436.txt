perlecan is synthesized by both vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and deposited in the extracellular matrix perlecan is highly conserved across species and the available data indicate that it has evolved from ancient ancestors by gene duplication and exon shuffling perlecan consists of a core protein of molecular weight 470 kda to which three long chains each approximately 70 100 kda of glycosaminoglycans often heparan sulfate hs but can be chondroitin sulfate cs are attached the core protein consists of five distinct structural domains the n terminal domain i aa 1 195 contains attachment sites for hs chains although hs chains are not required for correct folding and secretion of the protein lack of hs or decreased sulfation can decrease perlecan s ability to interact with matrix proteins removal of hs chains may affect matrix organization and endothelial barrier function domain ii comprises four repeats homologous to the ligand binding portion of the ldl receptor with six conserved cysteine residues and a pentapeptide dgsde which mediates ligand binding by the ldl receptor domain iii has homology to the domain iva and ivb of laminin domain iv consists of a series of ig modules the c terminal domain v which

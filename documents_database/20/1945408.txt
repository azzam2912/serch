he also made significant contributions in field theory and particle physics samuel graduated from princeton university with a bachelor of arts in mathematics in 1975 and in 1979 he graduated from the uc berkeley with a doctor of philosophy in physics he was formerly a member of the institute for advanced study at princeton a professor of physics at columbia university and a professor of physics at city college of new york in early work samuel used particle field theory methods to obtain results in statistical mechanics in particular samuel uncovered a particularly simple way to solve the two dimensional ising model it was shown to be equivalent to a non interacting field theory of fermionic like particles this allowed a rapid computation of the partition function and correlation functions samuel went on to treat certain interacting statistical mechanics systems using perturbative field theory in 1985 samuel and co worker k j m moriarty were among the first to obtain a reasonably accurate computation of the hadron mass spectrum using computer simulations of lattice quantum chromodynamics qcd they overcame the difficulties that other theorists were encountering at the time by making an approximation they replaced the spin 1 2 fermionic

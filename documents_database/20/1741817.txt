locata has invented a local positioning system that can either replace or augment global positioning system gps signals when they are blocked jammed or unreliable government commercial and other organizations use locata to determine accurate positioning as a local backup to gps david small and nunzio gambale started work on the initial locata concepts in 1994 and founded locata as a company in 1997 as of december 2013 the company has been granted 122 patents around their positioning technology a locatanet is a ground based local positioning system that provides positioning information which is indistinguishable from gps to an appropriately configured receiver the locatanet achieves this without the satellites atomic clocks or ground support structure required by traditional gps satellite based systems to create a locatanet locatalite radio transceivers are deployed around a defined area these devices collectively function like a grounded version of a gps satellite constellation transmitting radiolocation signals that locata receivers use to generate a positioning solution outputting latitude longitude and altitude using trilateration in the same way as a traditional gps receiver locatalites can be designed to transmit at any practical frequency or power level the first commercially deployed designs operate in the same ism band

the pos is relevant for games in which there is some objective authority that can influence the players a bit and maybe help them converge to a good nash equilibrium when measuring how efficient a nash equilibrium is in a specific game we often time also talk about the price of anarchy poa another way of expressing pos is in the following prisoner s dilemma game since there is a single equilibrium b r we have pos poa 1 2 on this example which is a version of the battle of sexes game there are two equilibrium points t l and b r with values 3 and 15 respectively the optimal value is 15 thus pos 1 while poa 1 5 the price of stability was first studied by a schulzan and n moses and was so called in the studies of e anshelevich they showed that a pure strategy nash equilibrium always exists and the price of stability of this game is at most the nth harmonic number in directed graphs for undirected graphs anshelevich and others presented a tight bound on the price of stability of 4 3 for a single source and two players case jian li

it can be viewed as a benzyl group substituted for the methyl group of alanine or a phenyl group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine this essential amino acid is classified as neutral and nonpolar because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain the isomer is used to biochemically form proteins coded for by dna phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine norepinephrine noradrenaline and epinephrine adrenaline and the skin pigment melanin it is encoded by the codons uuu and uuc phenylalanine is found naturally in the breast milk of mammals it is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement for its reputed analgesic and antidepressant effects it is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenethylamine a commonly used dietary supplement as an essential amino acid phenylalanine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals who must ingest phenylalanine or phenylalanine containing proteins the first description of phenylalanine was made in 1879 when schulze and barbieri identified a compound with the empirical formula chno in yellow lupine lupinus luteus seedlings in 1882 erlenmeyer and lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from phenylacetaldehyde hydrogen

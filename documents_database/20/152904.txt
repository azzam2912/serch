the map d q is a bijection from the set of all square free integers d 0 1 to the set of all quadratic fields if d 0 the corresponding quadratic field is called a real quadratic field and for d real numbers quadratic fields have been studied in great depth initially as part of the theory of binary quadratic forms there remain some unsolved problems the class number problem is particularly important for a nonzero square free integer d the discriminant of the quadratic field k q is d if d is congruent to 1 modulo 4 and otherwise 4 d for example if d is 1 then k is the field of gaussian rationals and the discriminant is 4 the reason for such a distinction is that the ring of integers of k is generated by 1 in the first case but by in the second case the set of discriminants of quadratic fields is exactly the set of fundamental discriminants any prime number p gives rise to an ideal po in the ring of integers o of a quadratic field k in line with general theory of splitting of prime ideals in galois extensions this may be

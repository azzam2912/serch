it is faintly visible to the naked eye at an apparent visual magnitude of 5 6 based upon an annual parallax shift of 4 24 mas 3 equulei is roughly distant from earth give or take an 80 light year margin of error at that distance the apparent brightness of the star is diminished by 0 15 in visual magnitude because of extinction from interstellar gas and dust 3 equuleui has been referred to in some sources as zeta equuleui although it was not given that designation by bayer 3 equulei is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of k5 iii the measured angular diameter of this star after correction for limb darkening is at the estimated distance of delta ophiuchi this yields a physical size of about 63 times the radius of the sun it is radiating an estimated 949 times the luminosity of the sun from this expanded outer envelope at an effective temperature of 3 893 k at this heat it shines with the orange hued glow of a k type star end align

they can form lipid bilayers because of their amphiphilic characteristic the structure of the phospholipid molecule generally consists of two hydrophobic fatty acid tails and a hydrophilic head consisting of a phosphate group the two components are usually joined together by a glycerol molecule the phosphate groups can be modified with simple organic molecules such as choline ethanolamine or serine the first phospholipid identified in 1847 as such in biological tissues was lecithin or phosphatidylcholine in the egg yolk of chickens by the french chemist and pharmacist theodore nicolas gobley biological membranes in eukaryotes also contain another class of lipid sterol interspersed among the phospholipids and together they provide membrane fluidity and mechanical strength purified phospholipids are produced commercially and have found applications in nanotechnology and materials science an amphiphile from the greek amphis both and philia love friendship also termed amphipathic is a term describing a chemical compound possessing both hydrophilic water loving polar and lipophilic fat loving non polar properties the phospholipid head usually contains a negatively charged phosphate group and glycerol it is hydrophilic the phospholipid tails usually consist of 2 long fatty acid chains they are hydrophobic and avoid interactions with water when placed in aqueous

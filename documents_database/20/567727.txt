the majority of ald reactions use two chemicals called precursors these precursors react with the surface of a material one at a time in a sequential self limiting manner through the repeated exposure to separate precursors a thin film is slowly deposited ald is a key process in the fabrication of semiconductor devices and part of the set of tools available for the synthesis of nanomaterials during atomic layer deposition a film is grown on a substrate by exposing its surface to alternate gaseous species typically referred to as precursors in contrast to chemical vapor deposition the precursors are never present simultaneously in the reactor but they are inserted as a series of sequential non overlapping pulses in each of these pulses the precursor molecules react with the surface in a self limiting way so that the reaction terminates once all the reactive sites on the surface are consumed consequently the maximum amount of material deposited on the surface after a single exposure to all of the precursors a so called ald cycle is determined by the nature of the precursor surface interaction by varying the number of cycles it is possible to grow materials uniformly and with high precision

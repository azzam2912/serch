l austin argued against a positivist philosophical claim that the utterances always describe or constate something and are thus always true or false after mentioning several examples of sentences which are not so used and not truth evaluable among them nonsensical sentences interrogatives directives and ethical propositions he introduces performative sentences or illocutionary act as another instance in order to define performatives austin refers to those sentences which conform to the old prejudice in that they are used to describe or constate something and which thus are true or false and he calls such sentences constatives in contrast to them austin defines performatives as follows for example when paul says i promise to do the dishes in an appropriate context then he thereby does not just say something and in particular he does not describe what he is doing rather in making the utterance he performs the promise since promising is an illocutionary act the utterance is thus a performative utterance if peter utters the sentence without the intention to keep the promise or if eventually he does not keep it then although something is not in order with the utterance the problem is not that the sentence is false

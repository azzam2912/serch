published in 1965 it develops a theory of political science and economics of concentrated benefits versus diffuse costs its central argument is that concentrated minor interests will be overrepresented and diffuse majority interests trumped due to a free rider problem that is stronger when a group becomes larger the book challenged accepted wisdom in olson s day that the book argues instead that individuals in any group attempting collective action will have incentives to free ride on the efforts of others if the group is working to provide public goods individuals will not free ride in groups that provide benefits only to active participants pure public goods are goods that are non excludable i e one person cannot reasonably prevent another from consuming the good and non rivalrous one person s consumption of the good does not affect another s nor vice versa hence without selective incentives to motivate participation collective action is unlikely to occur even when large groups of people with common interests exist the book noted that large groups will face relatively high costs when attempting to organize for collective action while small groups will face relatively low costs and individuals in large groups will gain less

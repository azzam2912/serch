it is often said that the turbulence can be extreme enough inside a cumulonimbus to tear an aircraft into pieces however this kind of accident is relatively rare moreover the turbulence under a thunderstorm can be non existent and is usually no more than moderate actually most thunderstorm related crashes occur due to a stall close to the ground when the pilot gets caught by surprise by a thunderstorm induced wind shift moreover aircraft damage caused by thunderstorms is rarely in the form of structural failure due to turbulence but is typically less severe and the consequence of secondary effects of thunderstorms e g denting by hail or paint removal by high speed flight in torrential rain thus cumulonimbus are known to be extremely dangerous to air traffic and it is recommended to avoid them as much as possible cumulonimbus can be extremely insidious and an inattentive pilot can end up in a very dangerous situation while flying in apparently very calm air while there is a gradation with respect to thunderstorm severity there is little quantitative difference between a significant shower generated by a cumulus congestus and a small thunderstorm with a few thunderclaps associated with a small cumulonimbus

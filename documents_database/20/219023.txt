for a ship surrender is dated from the time the ensign is struck colours a national flag or a battle ensign the colours are hauled down as a token of submission international law absolutely requires a ship of war to fly its ensign at the commencement of any hostile acts i e before firing on the enemy during battle there is no purpose in striking the colours other than to indicate surrender it was and is an offense to continue to fight after striking one s colours and an offense to continue to fire on an enemy after she has struck her colours unless she indicates by some other action such as continuing to fire or seeking to escape that she has not truly surrendered for this reason striking the colours is conclusive evidence of a surrender having taken place in the case of a warship but not in the case of a merchant ship what would be perfidy in the case of a warship is not in the case of a merchant ship a merchant ship may strike its colours as a ruse de guerre in an attempt to escape capture since it does not engage the enemy in

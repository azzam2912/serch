it is usually accompanied by an indication of the static test pressure that a sample of newly manufactured watches were exposed to in a leakage test the test pressure can be indicated either directly in units of pressure such as bar atmospheres or more commonly as an equivalent water depth in metres in the united states sometimes also in feet an indication of the test pressure in terms of water depth does not mean a water resistant watch was designed for repeated long term use in such water depths for example a watch marked 30 metres water resistant cannot be expected to withstand activity for longer time periods in a swimming pool let alone continue to function at 30 metres under water this is because the test is conducted only once using static pressure on a sample of newly manufactured watches as only a small sample is tested there is likelihood that any individual watch is not water resistant to the certified depth or even at all the test for qualifying a diving watch for repeated usage in a given depth includes safety margins to take factors into account like aging of the seals the properties of water and seawater

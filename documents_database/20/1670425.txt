since the most important change in an organism through time is the chemical reactions that result in a single cell developing into a multicellular organism whatever controls these chemical reactions that regulate cell growth development and death is believed to control aging the theory argues that these cellular changes are directed by reproductive hormones of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis hpg axis receptors for reproductive hormones such as estrogens progestogens androgens and gonadotropins have been found to be present in all tissues of the body thus hpg axis hormones normally promote growth and development of the organism early in life in order to achieve reproduction hormones levels then begin to change in men around age 30 and more abruptly in women when they reach menopause around age 50 when the hpg axis becomes unbalanced cellular growth and development is dysregulated and cell death and dysfunction can occur both of which can initiate senescence the accumulated damage to cells tissues and organs that occurs with the passage of time and that is associated with functional loss during aging evidence supporting this theory comes from disease studies showing that women who reach menopause later have less heart disease and stroke less dementia

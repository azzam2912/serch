this effect was first identified in the intensity of cosmic rays by arthur compton and ivan a getting in 1935 gleeson and axford provide a full derivation of the equations relevant to this effect the original application of the compton getting effect predicted that the intensity of cosmic rays should be higher coming from the direction in which earth is moving for the case of cosmic rays the compton getting effect only applies to those that are unaffected by the solar wind such as extremely high energy rays it has been calculated that the speed of the earth within the galaxy would result in a difference between the strongest and weakest cosmic ray intensities of about 0 1 forman 1970 derives the compton getting effect anisotropy from the lorentz invariance of the phase space distribution function ipavich 1974 furthers this general derivation to derive count rates with respect to the flow vector this compton getting effect is apparent in plasma data in earth s magnetotail the compton getting effect has also been utilized for analyzing energetic neutral atom ena data returned by the cassini huygens spacecraft at saturn

poractant alfa is an extract of natural porcine lung surfactant as with other surfactants marked improvement on oxygenation may occur within minutes of the administration of poractant alfa the new generic form of surfactant is sls sheep lung surfactant developed in persisgen co and commercialized by arnagen pharmad it has fully comparable quality profile with curosurf each milliliter of poractant alfa contains 80 mg of surfactant extract that includes 76 mg of phospholipids and 1 mg of protein of which 0 2 mg is surfactant protein b sp b depending on local country registration curosurf is available in 1 5ml vials 3 0ml vials and or twin packs containing two 1 5ml vials the amount of phospholipids is calculated from the content of phosphorus and contains 55 mg of phosphotidylcholine of which 30 mg is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine transient episodes of bradycardia decreased oxygen saturation hypotension or endotracheal tube blockage may occur endogenous pulmonary surfactant reduces surface tension at the air liquid interface of the alveoli during mechanical ventilation and stabilizes the alveoli against collapse at resting transpulmonary pressures a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant in preterm infants results in respiratory distress syndrome poractant alfa compensates for the surfactant deficiency and restores surface

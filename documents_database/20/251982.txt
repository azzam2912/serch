they act directly or indirectly to transmit signals from the photoreceptors to the ganglion cells bipolar cells are so named as they have a central body from which two sets of processes arise they can synapse with either rods or cones rod cone mixed input bcs have been found in teleost fish but not mammals and they also accept synapses from horizontal cells the bipolar cells then transmit the signals from the photoreceptors or the horizontal cells and pass it on to the ganglion cells directly or indirectly via amacrine cells unlike most neurons bipolar cells communicate via graded potentials rather than action potentials bipolar cells receive synaptic input from either rods or cones or both rods and cones though they are generally designated rod bipolar or cone bipolar cells there are roughly 10 distinct forms of cone bipolar cells however only one rod bipolar cell due to the rod receptor arriving later in the evolutionary history than the cone receptor in the dark a photoreceptor rod cone cell will release glutamate which inhibits hyperpolarizes the on bipolar cells and excites depolarizes the off bipolar cells in light however light strikes the photoreceptor which causes the photoreceptor to be inhibited

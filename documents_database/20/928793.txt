it was one of a number of criticality devices within technical area 18 ta 18 specifically it was used to produce bursts of neutrons and gamma rays for irradiating test samples and inspired development of godiva like reactors the radiation source within the godiva device was a fissile metallic mass usually highly enriched u about in diameter this was located at the top of a high metal tower the burst of radiation was produced when a piston of fissile material was quickly inserted and extracted from a cavity within the larger fissile mass during the time these two masses were combined they formed a critical mass and a nuclear chain reaction was briefly sustained godiva s design was inspired by a self terminating property discovered when incorrectly experimenting with the jemima device in 1952 jemima operated by remotely lifting one stack of enriched uranium 235 disks up towards another fixed stack on 18 april 1952 due to a miscalculation jemima was assembled with too many disks this caused an excursion of 1 5 x 10 fissions an automatic scram but no damage on 3 february 1954 and 12 february 1957 accidental criticality excursions occurred causing damage to the device but

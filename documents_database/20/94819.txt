as the name implies at the core of an agroecosystem lies the human activity of agriculture however an agroecosystem is not restricted to the immediate site of agricultural activity e g the farm but rather includes the region that is impacted by this activity usually by changes to the complexity of species assemblages and energy flows as well as to the net nutrient balance traditionally an agroecosystem particularly one managed intensively is characterized as having a simpler species composition and simpler energy and nutrient flows than natural ecosystem likewise agroecosystems are often associated with elevated nutrient input much of which exits the farm leading to eutrophication of connected ecosystems not directly engaged in agriculture some major organizations are hailing farming within agro ecosystems as the way forward for mainstream agriculture current farming methods have resulted in over stretched water resources high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility according to a report by the international water management institute and the united nations environment programme there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices therefore how critical water land and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered the report suggested assigning value to ecosystems recognizing

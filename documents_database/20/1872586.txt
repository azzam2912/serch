the method was published by avram sidi the method is a generalization of the secant method like the secant method it is an iterative method which requires one evaluation of formula 2 in each iteration and no derivatives of formula 2 the method can converge much faster though with an order which approaches 2 provided that formula 2 satisfies the regularity conditions described below we call formula 5 the root of formula 2 that is formula 7 sidi s method is an iterative method which generates a sequence formula 8 of approximations of formula 5 starting with k 1 initial approximations formula 10 the approximation formula 11 is calculated in the first iteration the approximation formula 12 is calculated in the second iteration etc each iteration takes as input the last k 1 approximations and the value of formula 2 at those approximations hence the n th iteration takes as input the approximations formula 14 and the values formula 15 the number k must be 1 or larger k 1 2 3 it remains fixed during the execution of the algorithm in order to obtain the starting approximations formula 10 one could carry out a few initializing iterations with a

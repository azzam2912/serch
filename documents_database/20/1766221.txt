consequently the collective genomes of the holobiont form a hologenome holobionts and hologenomes are structural entities that replace misnomers in the context of host microbiota symbioses such as superorganism i e an integrated social unit composed of conspecifics organ and metagenome variation in the hologenome may encode phenotypic plasticity of the holobiont and can be subject to evolutionary changes caused by selection and drift if portions of the hologenome are transmitted between generations with reasonable fidelity one of the important outcomes of recasting the individual as a holobiont subject to evolutionary forces is that genetic variation in the hologenome can be brought about by changes in the host genome and also by changes in the microbiome including new acquisitions of microbes horizontal gene transfers and changes in microbial abundance within hosts although there is a rich literature on binary host microbe symbioses the hologenome concept distinguishes itself by including the vast symbiotic complexity inherent in many multicellular hosts for recent literature on holobionts and hologenomes published in an open access platform see the following reference lynn margulis coined the term holobiont in her 1991 book symbiosis as a source of evolutionary innovation speciation and morphogenesis mit press though this was

this is a form of occlusion culling whereby a candidate set of potentially visible polygons are pre computed then indexed at run time in order to quickly obtain an estimate of the visible geometry the term pvs is sometimes used to refer to any occlusion culling algorithm since in effect this is what all occlusion algorithms compute although in almost all the literature it is used to refer specifically to occlusion culling algorithms that pre compute visible sets and associate these sets with regions in space in order to make this association the camera view space the set of points from which the camera can render an image is typically subdivided into usually convex regions and a pvs is computed for each region the benefit of offloading visibility as a pre process are the disadvantages are the primary problem in pvs computation then becomes compute the set of polygons that can be visible from anywhere inside each region of a set of polyhedral regions there are various classifications of pvs algorithms with respect to the type of visibility set they compute these overestimate visibility consistently such that no triangle that is visible may be omitted the net result is that

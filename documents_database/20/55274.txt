it is a type of metaplasia which includes all cell fate switches including the interconversion of stem cells current uses of transdifferentiation include disease modeling and drug discovery and in the future may include gene therapy and regenerative medicine the term transdifferentiation was originally coined by selman and kafatos in 1974 to describe a change in cell properties as cuticle producing cells became salt secreting cells in silk moths undergoing metamorphosis davis et al 1987 reported the first instance of transdifferentiation where a cell changed from one adult cell type to another forcing mouse embryonic fibroblasts to express myod was found to be sufficient to turn those cells into myoblasts there are no known instances where adult cells change directly from one lineage to another except turritopsis dohrnii and in the turritopsis nutricula a jellyfish that is theoretically immortal rather cells dedifferentiate and then redifferentiate into the cell type of interest in newts when the eye lens is removed pigmented epithelial cells de differentiate and then redifferentiate into the lens cells in the pancreas it has been demonstrated that alpha cells can spontaneously switch fate and transdifferentiate into beta cells in both healthy and diabetic human and mouse pancreatic islets

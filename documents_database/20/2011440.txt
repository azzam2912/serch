he attended the university of cambridge where he obtained a b a in mathematics 1971 and a ph d in theoretical physics in 1975 he worked as a postdoc and assistant professor from 1975 to 1980 at princeton university collins was part of the faculty of the illinois institute of technology from 1980 to 1990 from 1990 to the present he has been a faculty member in the department of physics at pennsylvania state university where he currently holds the position of distinguished professor he is a fellow of the american physical society and received the guggenheim fellowship in 1986 in 2009 he was awarded the sakurai prize along with r keith ellis and davison e soper john collins is known primarily for his foundational contributions to the development of perturbative quantum chromodynamics qcd especially the formulation and subsequent development of the qcd factorization theorems much of this work was done in collaboration with davison e soper and george sterman collins also contributed to the formulation of factorization proofs for exclusive processes and he provided a proof of factorization for hard high energy diffraction the collins mechanism was proposed to explain the existence of transverse spin dependence in hadron collisions

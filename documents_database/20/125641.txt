it was named by wagler in 1830 and frequently used in subsequent years often misspelled as euprepes a misspelling introduced by wiegmann in 1834 it was then subsumed under the large skink genus mabuya until mausfeld and others resurrected it for a group of mainly african skinks they split from mabuya the following year bauer argued that this assignment had been in error and that this group should be called trachylepis instead euprepis itself is a junior synonym of mabuya the identity of the type species the name bearing type which determines the application of a generic name of euprepis has been in some recent dispute in 1830 wagler included several species in euprepis lacerta punctata linnaeus 1758 lygosoma punctatum scincus multifasciatus kuhl 1820 scincus trilineatus schneider 1801 scincus quinquetaeniatus lichtenstein 1823 scincus agilis raddi 1823 mabuya agilis lacerta fasciata linnaeus 1758 lacerta quinquelineata linnaeus 1758 scincus tristatus daudin 1802 and scincus sloanei daudin 1802 but he did not select a type species subsequently fitzinger selected eumeces mabouia mabuya mabouya as the type species but his designation is invalid because wagler did not include this species in his original concept of the genus in 1957 loveridge selected scincus agilis mabuya

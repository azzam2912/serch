it was an adaptation of an opera by arthur benjamin and was directed by alan burke it was the first of several operas burke would direct the play went for one hour and burke only had nine hours of rehearsal burke later recalled in 1959 i was allowed to do my first opera the prima donna by arthur benjamin this was a live opera with the orchestra conducted by joe post who was head of abc music the rehearsal schedule was made out for me it allowed 3 calls of 3 hours each i went to see joe post to check this relatively short time allocation and he said isn t it enough time to tell them where to stand joe post was a radio person he hated television this opera was done in the days when we had the symphony orchestra in the studio one day joe post stopped the orchestra and called out mr burke those boys are taking close ups again i thought what can we do i said forgive me mr post the reason they are taking close ups is because i have plotted close ups for them then i gave him a five minute course

in this case we can say that an asymptotically flat spacetime is one in which the gravitational field as well as any matter or other fields which may be present become negligible in magnitude at large distances from some region in particular in an asymptotically flat vacuum solution the gravitational field curvature becomes negligible at large distances from the source of the field typically some isolated massive object such as a star the condition of asymptotic flatness is analogous to similar conditions in mathematics and in other physical theories such conditions say that some physical field or mathematical function is asymptotically vanishing in a suitable sense in general relativity an asymptotically flat vacuum solution models the exterior gravitational field of an isolated massive object therefore such a spacetime can be considered as an isolated system a system in which exterior influences can be neglected indeed physicists rarely imagine a universe containing a single star and nothing else when they construct an asymptotically flat model of a star rather they are interested in modeling the interior of the star together with an exterior region in which gravitational effects due to the presence of other objects can be neglected since typical distances

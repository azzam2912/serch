some possible unifying expressions are substitution instances of others if one expression is a substitution instance of another and not just a variable renaming then that other is called more general if the most general unifier is used in condensed detachment then the logical result is the most general conclusion that can be made in the given inference with the given second expression since any weaker inference you can get is a substitution instance of the most general one nothing less than the most general unifier is ever used in practice some logics such as classical propositional calculus have a set of defining axioms with the d completeness property if a set of axioms is d complete then any valid theorem of the system including all of its substitution instances up to variable renaming can be generated by condensed detachment alone for example if formula 18 is a theorem of a d complete system condensed detachment can prove not only that theorem but also its substitution instance formula 19 by using a longer proof note that d completeness is a property of an axiomatic basis for a system not an intrinsic property of a logic system itself j a kalman

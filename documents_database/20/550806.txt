it is a type of one factor short rate model as it describes interest rate movements as driven by only one source of market risk the model can be used in the valuation of interest rate derivatives and has also been adapted for credit markets it was introduced in 1977 by old ich va ek and can be also seen as a stochastic investment model the model specifies that the instantaneous interest rate follows the stochastic differential equation where w is a wiener process under the risk neutral framework modelling the random market risk factor in that it models the continuous inflow of randomness into the system the standard deviation parameter formula 2 determines the volatility of the interest rate and in a way characterizes the amplitude of the instantaneous randomness inflow the typical parameters formula 3 and formula 2 together with the initial condition formula 5 completely characterize the dynamics and can be quickly characterized as follows assuming formula 6 to be non negative the following derived quantity is also of interest formula 6 and formula 2 tend to oppose each other increasing formula 2 increases the amount of randomness entering the system but at the same time increasing

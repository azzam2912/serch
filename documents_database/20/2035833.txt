it ranges from 0 for trees to 1 for maximal planar graphs the meshedness coefficient is used to compare the general cycle structure of a connected planar graph to two extreme relevant references in one end there are trees planar graphs with no cycle the other extreme is represented by maximal planar graphs planar graphs with the highest possible number of edges and faces for a given number of vertices the normalized meshedness coefficient is the ratio of available face cycles to the maximum possible number of face cycles in the graph this ratio is 0 for a tree and 1 for any maximal planar graph more generally it can be shown using the euler characteristic that all n vertex planar graphs have at most 2 n 5 bounded faces not counting the one unbounded face and that if there are m edges then the number of bounded faces is m n 1 the same as the circuit rank of the graph therefore a normalized meshedness coefficient can be defined as the ratio of these two numbers it varies from 0 for trees to 1 for maximal planar graphs the meshedness coefficient can be used to estimate the redundancy of

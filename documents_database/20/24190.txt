it is the largest bacterium ever discovered as a rule in diameter but sometimes attaining cells of thiomargarita namibiensis are large enough to be visible to the naked eye although the species holds the record for the largest bacterium epulopiscium fishelsoni previously discovered in the gut of surgeonfish grows slightly longer but narrower thiomargarita means sulfur pearl this refers to the appearance of the cells they contain microscopic sulfur granules that scatter incident light lending the cell a pearly lustre like many coccoid bacteria such as streptococcus their cellular division tends to occur along a single axis causing their cells to form chains rather like strings of pearls the species name namibiensis means of namibia the species was discovered by heide n schulz and others in 1997 in the coastal seafloor sediments of walvis bay namibia schulz and her colleagues from the max planck institute for marine microbiology were on a russian research vessel the petr kottsov when the white color of this microbe caught their interest they were actually looking for other recently found sulfide eating marine bacteria thioploca and beggiatoa they ended up with an entire new discovery of a much larger cousin strain of the two other

the term was coined by arthur schuster in 1898 today the periodogram is a component of more sophisticated methods see spectral estimation it is the most common tool for examining the amplitude vs frequency characteristics of fir filters and window functions fft spectrum analyzers are also implemented as a time sequence of periodograms there are at least two different definitions in use today one of them involves time averaging and one does not time averaging is also the purview of other articles bartlett s method and welch s method this article is not about time averaging the definition of interest here is that the power spectral density of a continuous function formula 1 is the fourier transform of its auto correlation function see cross correlation theorem for sufficiently small values of parameter an arbitrarily accurate approximation for can be observed in the region formula 3 of the function which is precisely determined by the samples that span the non zero duration of see discrete time fourier transform and for sufficiently large values of parameter formula 5 can be evaluated at an arbitrarily close frequency by a summation of the form where is an integer the periodicity of formula 7 allows

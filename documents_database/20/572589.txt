in his earlier years the city had no artificial ice surfaces so his introduction to the game was through street hockey in 1983 tverdovsky began his interest in hockey at the city s only fully functioning skating arena though this was originally intended for figure skating low turnout compelled city officials to create a year round hockey school open tryouts were held and 7 year old tverdovsky finally had a chance to learn the sport but his inexperience with skating initially held him back he recalls i tried everything even holding my hands on the boards but the progress was slow the team coach identified the problem being weakness in his ankles and put him on a training regimen which included running on beach sand and stones barefoot in 1991 the system which froze the ice at his local arena became permanently broken and his amateur career in hockey was potentially over by this time he was one of the best players as well as the best skater on his team i was a defenseman all my career and i always loved rushes he says it didn t take a lot of stickhandling for me to score lots of goals

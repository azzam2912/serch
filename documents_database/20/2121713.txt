it is a division of a heterogeneous resource cake that satisfies the proportionality criterion namely that every partner feels that his allocated share is worth at least 1 n of the total two assumptions are usually made when proportionality is discussed for two people divide and choose is the classic solution one person divides the resource into what they believe are equal halves and the other person chooses the half they prefer the non atomicity assumption guarantees that the cutter can indeed cut the cake to two equal pieces the additivity assumption guarantees that both partners value their pieces as at least 1 2 there are many ways to extend this procedure to more than 2 people each way has its own advantages and disadvantages last diminisher is the earliest proportional division procedure developed for n people by induction it is possible to prove that each partner following the rules is guaranteed to get a value of 1 n regardless of what the other partners do this is a discrete procedure that can be played in turns in the worst case formula 1 actions are needed one action per player per turn however most of these actions can be done

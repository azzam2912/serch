this colourless sweet smelling liquid was once produced industrially in large quantities for use as a solvent it is regulated by the montreal protocol as an ozone depleting substance and its use is being rapidly phased out 1 1 1 trichloroethane was first reported by henri victor regnault in 1840 industrially it is usually produced in a two step process from vinyl chloride in the first step vinyl chloride reacts with hydrogen chloride at 20 50 c to produce 1 1 dichloroethane this reaction is catalyzed by a variety of lewis acids mainly aluminium chloride iron iii chloride or zinc chloride the 1 1 dichloroethane is then converted to 1 1 1 trichloroethane by reaction with chlorine under ultraviolet irradiation this reaction proceeds at 80 90 yield and the hydrogen chloride byproduct can be recycled to the first step in the process the major side product is the related compound 1 1 2 trichloroethane from which the 1 1 1 trichloroethane can be separated by distillation a somewhat smaller amount of 1 1 1 trichloroethane is produced from the reaction of 1 1 dichloroethene and hydrogen chloride in the presence of an iron iii chloride catalyst 1 1 1 trichloroethane

it was the first iteration of a new generation of horizontally split crankcase two strokes that also included the rd350 and culminated in the rd400 the engine platform also included the 250cc variants ds7 rd250 two earlier generations of sporting 250cc and larger displacement air cooled two strokes preceded the r5 dating back to 1959 yamaha began producing air cooled sport tuned 250cc twin cylinder roadsters in 1959 development led to increased capacity in 1965 to 305cc ym1 and in 1967 to 350cc yr1 these are the ancestral predecessors to the 1970 350cc r5 and represent two different generations of engine evolution and design the 1967 yr1 1968 yr2 and 1969 r3 yr3 directly preceded the r5 and were yamaha s first publicly available 350cc capacity air cooled two stroke twins the r5 was super ceded by the 1973 1975 rd350 and 1976 1979 rd400 several technical changes were made to the rd platform the most significant were the six speed transmission and reed valve induction though different in appearance the r5 basic architecture lived on in the rz350 american market and rd350lc euro market the main difference being the cylinders became water cooled the engine cases are similar enough

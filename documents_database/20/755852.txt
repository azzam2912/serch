in the scope of dls temporal fluctuations are usually analyzed by means of the intensity or photon auto correlation function also known as photon correlation spectroscopy or quasi elastic light scattering in the time domain analysis the autocorrelation function acf usually decays starting from zero delay time and faster dynamics due to smaller particles lead to faster decorrelation of scattered intensity trace it has been shown that the intensity acf is the fourier transformation of the power spectrum and therefore the dls measurements can be equally well performed in the spectral domain dls can also be used to probe the behavior of complex fluids such as concentrated polymer solutions a monochromatic light source usually a laser is shot through a polarizer and into a sample the scattered light then goes through a second polarizer where it is collected by a photomultiplier and the resulting image is projected onto a screen this is known as a speckle pattern figure 1 all of the molecules in the solution are being hit with the light and all of the molecules diffract the light in all directions the diffracted light from all of the molecules can either interfere constructively light regions or destructively dark

during this process known as the cell cycle a cell duplicates its contents and then divides in two the purpose of the cell cycle is to accurately duplicate each organism s dna and then divide the cell and its contents evenly between the two resulting cells in eukaryotes the cell cycle consists of four main stages g during which a cell is metabolically active and continuously grows s phase during which dna replication takes place g during which cell growth continues and the cell synthesizes various proteins in preparation for division and the m mitosis phase during which the duplicated chromosomes known as the sister chromatids separate into two daughter nuclei and the cell divides into two daughter cells each with a full copy of dna compared to the eukaryotic cell cycle the prokaryotic cell cycle known as binary fission is relatively simple and quick the chromosome replicates from the origin of replication a new membrane is assembled and the cell wall forms a septum which divides the cell into two as the eukaryotic cell cycle is a complex process eukaryotes have evolved a network of regulatory proteins known as the cell cycle control system which monitors and dictates the

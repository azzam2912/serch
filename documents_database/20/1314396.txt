in physical terms the closure temperature is the temperature at which a system has cooled so that there is no longer any significant diffusion of the parent or daughter isotopes out of the system and into the external environment the concept s initial mathematical formulation was presented in a seminal paper by martin h dodson closure temperature in cooling geochronological and petrological systems in the journal contributions to mineralogy and petrology 1973 with refinements to a usable experimental formulation by other scientists in later years this temperature varies broadly among different minerals and also differs depending on the parent and daughter atoms being considered it is specific to a particular material and isotopic system the closure temperature of a system can be experimentally determined in the lab by artificially resetting sample minerals using a high temperature furnace as the mineral cools the crystal structure begins to form and diffusion of isotopes slows at a certain temperature the crystal structure has formed sufficiently to prevent diffusion of isotopes this temperature is what is known as blocking temperature and represents the temperature below which the mineral is a closed system to measurable diffusion of isotopes the age that can be calculated by

this notion was introduced by l ya kulikov for p groups and by l szl fuchs in general in an attempt to formulate classification theory of infinite abelian groups that goes beyond the pr fer theorems it helps to reduce the classification problem to classification of possible extensions between two well understood classes of abelian groups direct sums of cyclic groups and divisible groups a subgroup of an abelian group is called p basic for a fixed prime number if the following conditions hold conditions 1 3 imply that the subgroup is hausdorff in the p adic topology of which moreover coincides with the topology induced from and that is dense in picking a generator in each cyclic direct summand of creates a p basis of b which is analogous to a basis of a vector space or a free abelian group every abelian group contains p basic subgroups for each and any 2 p basic subgroups of are isomorphic abelian groups that contain a unique p basic subgroup have been completely characterized for the case of p groups they are either divisible or bounded i e have bounded exponent in general the isomorphism class of the quotient by a

current division refers to the splitting of current between the branches of the divider the currents in the various branches of such a circuit will always divide in such a way as to minimize the total energy expended the formula describing a current divider is similar in form to that for the voltage divider however the ratio describing current division places the impedance of the considered branches in the denominator unlike voltage division where the considered impedance is in the numerator this is because in current dividers total energy expended is minimized resulting in currents that go through paths of least impedance hence the inverse relationship with impedance comparatively voltage divider is used to satisfy kirchhoff s voltage law the voltage around a loop must sum up to zero so the voltage drops must be divided evenly in a direct relationship with the impedance to be specific if two or more impedances are in parallel the current that enters the combination will be split between them in inverse proportion to their impedances according to ohm s law it also follows that if the impedances have the same value the current is split equally a general formula for the current i

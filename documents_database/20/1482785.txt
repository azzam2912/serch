it is the only hvdc system not used for power transmission in the winter of 1998 qu bec s power lines were toppled by icing sometimes up to 75 mm to prevent such a damage a de icing system was developed the levis de icer can use a maximum power of 250 mw its operation voltage is 17 4 kv it can be used on multiple 735 kv ac power lines when there is no icing the l vis de icer installed at hydro qu bec s l vis substation operates as static var compensator improving the stability of the ac lines because of what happened in quebec in the winter of 1998 hydro quebec transenergie created a de icing machine to insure that another event like this wouldn t happen again the de icer is a machine that runs a high direct current dc into a selected transmission line in order to melt the ice on it however because the operation in this mode may be very infrequent when the installation is not being used as a de icer it is used as a static var compensator svc for short by using the hvdc valves as a thyristor controlled

this inhomogeneous field causes spatial variations in spin flip angles which in turn causes errors and degrades the receiver s sensitivity rf pulses can be designed to create low variation flip angles or uniform magnetization inversion across a sample even in the presence of inhomogeneities such as b1 variation and off resonance in traditional mri rf excitation an rf pulse b is applied with a frequency that is resonant with the nutation frequency of the spins of interest in the frame rotating at the larmor frequency the effective field experienced by the spins is in the transverse plane observing the spins in this frame shows spins precessing about b at a frequency proportional to formula 1 if the rf pulse is applied for a time shorter than the period of this precession one can engineer the flip angle the angle with z axis by turning the pulse on and off at the appropriate time in rf excitation analysis the effective field is derived in the rotating frame of reference which depends on the radial frequency of the radio frequency b field b in the laboratory frame is written as formula 2 where b is the background magnetic field which points

it is one of two phyla of archaea the other being crenarchaeota euryarchaeota are highly diverse and include methanogens which produce methane and are often found in intestines halobacteria which survive extreme concentrations of salt and some extremely thermophilic aerobes and anaerobes which generally live at temperatures between 41 and 122 c they are separated from the other archaeans based mainly on rrna sequences and their unique dna polymerase the euryarchaeota are diverse in appearance and metabolic properties the phylum contains organisms of a variety of shapes including both rods and cocci euryarchaeota may appear either gram positive or gram negative depending on whether pseudomurein is present in the cell wall euryarchaeota also demonstrate diverse lifestyles including methanogens halophiles sulfate reducers and extreme thermophiles in each others live in the ocean suspended with plankton and bacteria although these marine euryarchaeota are difficult to culture and study in a lab genomic sequencing suggests that they are motile heterotrophs though it was previously thought that euryarchaeota only lived in extreme environments in terms of temperature salt content and or ph a paper by korzhenkov et al published in january 2019 showed that euryarchaeota also live in moderate environments such as low temperature

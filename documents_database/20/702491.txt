lipid signaling is thought to be qualitatively different from other classical signaling paradigms such as monoamine neurotransmission because lipids can freely diffuse through membranes see osmosis one consequence of this is that lipid messengers cannot be stored in vesicles prior to release and so are often biosynthesized on demand at their intended site of action as such many lipid signaling molecules cannot circulate freely in solution but rather exist bound to special carrier proteins in serum ceramide cer can be generated by the breakdown of sphingomyelin sm by sphingomyelinases smases which are enzymes that hydrolyze the phosphocholine group from the sphingosine backbone alternatively this sphingosine derived lipid sphingolipid can be synthesized from scratch de novo by the enzymes serine palmitoyl transferase spt and ceramide synthase in organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum er and possibly in the mitochondria associated membranes mams and the perinuclear membranes being located in the metabolic hub ceramide leads to the formation of other sphingolipids with the c1 hydroxyl oh group as the major site of modification a sugar can be attached to ceramide glycosylation through the action of the enzymes glucosyl or galactosyl ceramide synthases ceramide can also be broken down by enzymes called ceramidases

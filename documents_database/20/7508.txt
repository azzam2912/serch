broca s area and wernicke s area refers to the areas of the brain which serve a particular function for speech processing and production new medical imaging techniques such as pet and fmri have allowed researchers to generate pictures showing which areas of a living brain are active at a given time in the past research was primarily based on observations of loss of ability resulting from damage to the cerebral cortex indeed medical imaging has represented a radical step forward for research on speech processing since then a whole series of relatively large areas of the brain have been found to be involved in speech processing in more recent research subcortical regions those lying below the cerebral cortex such as the putamen and the caudate nucleus as well as the pre motor areas ba 6 have received increased attention it is now generally assumed that the following structures of the cerebral cortex near the primary and secondary auditory cortices play a fundamental role in speech processing the left hemisphere is usually dominant in right handed people although bilateral activations are not uncommon in the area of syntactic processing it is now accepted that the right hemisphere plays an important

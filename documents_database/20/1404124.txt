the genus is unusual among plants in that it includes species with both c and c photosynthetic pathways and ongoing research is investigating these taxa as a case study in how carbon concentrating mechanisms for photosynthesis evolve in land plants most of the species of alloteropsis use variants of the c photosynthetic pathway but a semialata ssp eckloniana uses the c photosynthetic pathway phylogenetic reconstructions of the evolutionary relationships between these species have led to two hypotheses about how photosynthetic pathways have evolved within the group first c photosynthesis evolved in three lineages within this group leading to independently derived realisations of this pathway the hypothesis of multiple c origins secondly that there was a single origin of c photosynthesis within the genus and the c taxon a s ecklonia was subsequently derived from a c ancestor the reversion hypothesis since c photosynthesis is a complex trait its evolution followed by a reversion to the ancestral type of c photosynthesis would represent an exception to dollo s law the reversion hypothesis is the most parsimonious explanation of phylogenetic relationships within alloteropsis however direct evidence for the hypothesis in the form of c genes or pseudogenes in the c taxon is

founded by british exomoonologist david kipping and affiliated with the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics hek submitted its first paper on june 30 2011 hek has since submitted five more papers finding some evidence for an exomoon around a planet orbiting kepler 1625b in july 2017 hek searches for exomoons in two ways radial velocity variation and transit timing variation both of which are based on alterations to the basic signal produced by the planet for moons detected the first way the sinusoidal changes in the wavelength of the light of the host star created by the planet may themselves be modulated slightly by a moon of the planet in the second method the interval at which a planet transits its host star may be made slightly shorter or longer under the gravitational influence of a moon revealing its existence in its first paper the hunt for exomoons with kepler selected several kepler planet candidates as search targets based on the probability and detectability of potential moons around the planets a second paper published in early 2013 covering the properties of seven of the planet candidates revealed no moons but allowed the astronomers to constrain the moon to planet mass

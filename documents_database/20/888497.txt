depending on the specific design they are used for a variety of applications such as oil spill response as a part of oily water treatment systems removing oil from machine tool coolant and aqueous parts washers and collecting fats oils and greases in wastewater treatment in food manufacturing industries oil skimmers were used to great effect to assist in the remediation of the exxon valdez spill in 1989 oil skimmers are different from swimming pool sanitation skimmers that are designed for a related but different purpose there are many different types of oil skimmer each type has different design features and therefore results in different applications and use it is important to understand the design features before employing a particular skimmer type some factors to consider are the use of skimmers in industrial applications is often required to remove oils grease and fats prior to further treatment for environmental discharge compliance by removing the top layer of oils water stagnation smell and unsightly surface scum can be reduced placed before an oily water treatment system an oil skimmer may give greater overall oil separation efficiency for improved discharge wastewater quality all oil skimmers will pick up a percentage of water

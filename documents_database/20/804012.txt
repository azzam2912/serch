reproductive synchrony sometimes termed ovulatory synchrony may manifest itself as breeding seasonality where females undergo regular menstruation menstrual synchrony is another possible term reproduction is said to be synchronised when fertile matings across a population are temporally clustered resulting in multiple conceptions and consequent births within a restricted time window in marine and other aquatic contexts the phenomenon may be referred to as mass spawning mass spawning has been observed and recorded in a large number of phyla including in coral communities within the great barrier reef in primates reproductive synchrony usually takes the form of conception and birth seasonality the regulatory clock in this case is the sun s position in relation to the tilt of the earth in nocturnal or partly nocturnal primates for example owl monkeys the periodicity of the moon may also come into play synchrony in general is for primates an important variable determining the extent of paternity skew defined as the extent to which fertile matings can be monopolised by a fraction of the population of males the greater the precision of female reproductive synchrony the greater the number of ovulating females who must be guarded simultaneously the harder it is for any dominant

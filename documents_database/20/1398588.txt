because natural lands such as rainforests and grasslands store carbon in their soil and biomass as plants grow each year clearance of wilderness for new farms translates to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to this change in the carbon stock of the soil and the biomass indirect land use change has consequences in the greenhouse gas ghg balance of a biofuel other authors have also argued that indirect land use changes produce other significant social and environmental impacts affecting biodiversity water quality food prices and supply land tenure worker migration and community and cultural stability the estimates of carbon intensity for a given biofuel depend on the assumptions regarding several variables as of 2008 multiple full life cycle studies had found that corn ethanol cellulosic ethanol and brazilian sugarcane ethanol produce lower greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline none of these studies however considered the effects of indirect land use changes and though land use impacts were acknowledged estimation was considered too complex and difficult to model a controversial paper published in february 2008 in sciencexpress by a team led by searchinger from princeton university concluded that such effects offset the positive direct effects of both corn and

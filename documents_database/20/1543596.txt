it was introduced by robert bouc and extended by yi kwei wen who demonstrated its versatility by producing a variety of hysteretic patterns this model is able to capture in analytical form a range of hysteretic cycle shapes matching the behaviour of a wide class of hysteretical systems due to its versatility and mathematical tractability the bouc wen model has gained popularity it has been extended and applied to a wide variety of engineering problems including multi degree of freedom mdof systems buildings frames bidirectional and torsional response of hysteretic systems two and three dimensional continua soil liquefaction and base isolation systems the bouc wen model its variants and extensions have been used in structural control in particular in the modeling of behaviour of magneto rheological dampers base isolation devices for buildings and other kinds of damping devices it has also been used in the modelling and analysis of structures built of reinforced concrete steel masonry and timber consider the equation of motion of a single degree of freedom sdof system here formula 1 represents the mass formula 2 is the displacement formula 3 the linear viscous damping coefficient formula 4 the restoring force and formula 5 the excitation force

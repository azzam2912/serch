kaani tribals dwelling in the rainforests of the western ghats kerala india claim that there are two distinct varieties of elephants in the peppara forest range one the common indian elephants elephas maximus indicus and the other a dwarf variety which they call kallana the name kallana comes from the words kallu which means stones or boulders and aana which means elephant the tribals gave the creatures this name because they see the smaller elephant more often in the higher altitudes where the terrain is rocky some tribals also call the delicate creatures thumbiana thumbi means dragonfly for the speed with which the pachyderms run through trees and rocks when disturbed according to the kani tribals the pygmy elephants feed on grass bamboo leaves tubers and the barks of smaller trees like all elephants they enjoy bathing in rivers and they too have dust baths unlike larger elephants however they seem able to negotiate steep rocky inclines the existence of a pygmy variety of elephant in india is yet to be scientifically ascertained if the claims of kani tribals are believed there are ample reasons to believe that the kallana they describe is a different namely pygmy variety of elephant

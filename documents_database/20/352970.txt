their characteristic feature is the small number of testes one to four the unilateral genital pores and large external seminal vesicle allow for easy recognition most species are small transparent and easy to study the family contains over 90 genera with over 900 species having as their definitive host birds c 700 species or mammals about 250 species most reside in the intestines of their definitive hosts the majority of species with known lifecycles have arthropods as intermediate hosts the family hymenolepididae has only two species which infects humans the disease hymenolepiasis is caused by hymenolepis nana and h diminuta which are sometimes classified in the genus rodentolepis most cases of hymenolepiasis are caused by h nana it occurs worldwide but in temperate climates children and people living in institutions are more likely to be infected a morphologically identical variety of h nana h nana var fraterna infects rodents but the human strain of h nana is essentially non infective to rodents unlike most tapeworms including h diminuta h nana can complete its lifecycle without an intermediate host pathological effects of infection are rare and occur in massive infections through autoinfection where the parasite is able to complete its lifecycle

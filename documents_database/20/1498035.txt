the effect is caused by the precession of the magnetic or electric dipole of the gas molecules between collisions the resulting rotation of the molecule averages out the nonspherical part of the collision cross section if the field is large enough that the precession time is short compared to the time between collisions this requires a very dilute gas the change in the collision cross section in turn can be measured as a change in the transport properties the magnetic field dependence of the transport properties can also include a transverse component for example a heat flow perpendicular to both temperature gradient and magnetic field this is the molecular analogue of the hall effect and righi leduc effect for electrons a key difference is that the gas molecules are neutral unlike the electrons so the magnetic field exerts no lorentz force an analogous magnetotransverse heat conductivity has been discovered for photons and phonons the senftleben beenakker effect owes its name to the physicists hermann senftleben m nster university germany and jan j m beenakker leiden university the netherlands who discovered it respectively for paramagnetic gases such as no and o and diamagnetic gases such as n and co the change

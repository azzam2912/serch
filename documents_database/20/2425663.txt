gwinn was the first woman to join the physics faculty at ucsb gwinn s research team explores topics at the intersection of nanoscience biology and optics she is particularly well known for her work on silver nanoclusters and bimolecular stabilized derivatives thereof gwinn is a prominent advocate for boosting diverse representation in the field of physics she has been an advocate for increasing accessibility to stem careers more generally through mentorship opportunities for public school students in the united states at the elementary and high school levels gwinn received her b a from swarthmore 1982 she went on to receive her ph d in physics harvard university in 1987 with robert westervelt where her thesis was on quasiperiodicity and frequency locking in electrical conduction in germanium her graduate studies were distinguished by her investigations of electronic transport in germanium she then continued to execute studies in the areas of experimental condensed matter physics however switched focus and expanded in diversity with respect to her choice of experimental system her post graduate research topics included contributions to the study of complex heterostructures and interfaces with a focus on the study of 2d electron gases around 2008 gwinn switched the focus of

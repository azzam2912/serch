extended it and defined the kodaira dimension for higher dimensional varieties under the name of canonical dimension and later named it after kunihiko kodaira in the canonical bundle of a smooth algebraic variety x of dimension n over a field is the line bundle of n forms which is the n th exterior power of the cotangent bundle of x for an integer d the d th tensor power of k is again a line bundle for d 0 the vector space of global sections h x k has the remarkable property that it is a birational invariant of smooth projective varieties x that is this vector space is canonically identified with the corresponding space for any smooth projective variety which is isomorphic to x outside lower dimensional subsets for d 0 the d th plurigenus of x is defined as the dimension of the vector space of global sections of k the plurigenera are important birational invariants of an algebraic variety in particular the simplest way to prove that a variety is not rational that is not birational to projective space is to show that some plurigenus p with d 0 is not zero if the space of sections

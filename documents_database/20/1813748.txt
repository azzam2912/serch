algorithms like md5 sha 1 and sha 2 that are based on the merkle damg rd construction are susceptible to this kind of attack the sha 3 algorithm is not susceptible when a merkle damg rd based hash is misused as a message authentication code with construction h secret message and message and the length of secret is known a length extension attack allows anyone to include extra information at the end of the message and produce a valid hash without knowing the secret note that since hmac doesn t use this construction hmac hashes are not prone to length extension attacks the vulnerable hashing functions work by taking the input message and using it to transform an internal state after all of the input has been processed the hash digest is generated by outputting the internal state of the function it is possible to reconstruct the internal state from the hash digest which can then be used to process the new data in this way one may extend the message and compute the hash that is a valid signature for the new message a server for delivering waffles of a specified type to a specific user at a location

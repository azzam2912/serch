for example in the english league cup the final is played on a weekend usually in february or march as such because only two teams are in that final the rest of the league fixtures usually continue as normal with only the games involving the two finalists being postponed early rounds of competitions usually include most teams from the league and no league matches are played but as the competitions progress and fewer teams are involved league games will take place under the assumption that neither team remains involved in that competition involvement in other domestic and non domestic competitions can also require league games to be postponed meaning that a team could have played two or three games fewer than those around them especially if the teams around them have been eliminated from the domestic competitions in early rounds or are not involved in the non domestic competitions postponements can also occur for other reasons such as a frozen or waterlogged playing surface these postponements are often made only a short time before the game begins and too late for alternative arrangements to be made if such arrangements are even possible a game which is abandoned part way through

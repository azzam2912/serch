sweat glands are a type of exocrine gland which are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct there are two main types of sweat glands that differ in their structure function secretory product mechanism of excretion anatomic distribution and distribution across species ceruminous glands which produce ear wax mammary glands which produce milk and ciliary glands in the eyelids are modified apocrine sweat glands generally sweat glands consist of a secretory unit consisting of a base rolled into a glomerulum and a duct that carries the sweat away the secretory coil or base is set deep in the lower dermis and hypodermis and the entire gland is surrounded by adipose tissue in both sweat gland types the secretory coils are surrounded by contractile myoepithelial cells that function to facilitate excretion of secretory product the secretory activities of the gland cells and the contractions of myoepithelial cells are controlled by both the autonomic nervous system and by the circulating hormones the distal or apical part of the duct that opens to the skin s surface is known as the acrosyringium each sweat gland receives several nerve fibers that branch out into bands of

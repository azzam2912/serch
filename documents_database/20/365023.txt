palladium is often used as a catalyst in the reduction of alkenes and alkynes with hydrogen this process involves the formation of a palladium carbon covalent bond palladium is also prominent in carbon carbon coupling reactions as demonstrated in tandem reactions unlike ni ii but similar to pt ii pd ii halides form a variety of alkene complexes the premier example is dichloro 1 5 cyclooctadiene palladium in this complex the diene is easily displaced which makes it a favored precursor to catalysts in the industrially important wacker process ethylene is converted to acetaldehyde via nucleophilic attack of hydroxide on a pd ii ethylene intermediate followed by formation of a vinyl alcohol complex fullerene ligands also bind with palladium ii palladium ii acetate and related compounds are common reagents because the carboxylates are good leaving groups with basic properties for example palladium trifluoroacetate has been demonstrated to be effective in aromatic decarboxylation the iconic complex in this series is allylpalladium chloride dimer apc allyl compounds with suitable leaving groups react with palladium ii salts to pi allyl complexes having hapticity 3 these intermediates too react with nucleophiles for example carbanions derived from malonates or with amines in allylic amination as

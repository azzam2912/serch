in the simpler versions of this instrument the impedance was measured internally and converted for display to the corresponding capacitance or inductance value readings should be reasonably accurate if the capacitor or inductor device under test does not have a significant resistive component of impedance more advanced designs measure true inductance or capacitance as well as the equivalent series resistance of capacitors and the q factor of inductive components usually the device under test dut is subjected to an ac voltage source the meter measures the voltage across and the current through the dut from the ratio of these the meter can determine the magnitude of the impedance the phase angle between the voltage and current is also measured in more advanced instruments in combination with the impedance the equivalent capacitance or inductance and resistance of the dut can be calculated and displayed the meter must assume either a parallel or a series model for these two elements an ideal capacitor has no characteristics other than capacitance but there are no physical ideal capacitors all real capacitors have a little inductance a little resistance and some defects causing inefficiency these can be seen as inductance or resistance in series with

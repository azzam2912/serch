it came into use beginning in 1999 gradually supplanting fast ethernet in wired local networks as a result of being considerably faster the cables and equipment are very similar to previous standards and have been very common and economical since 2010 half duplex gigabit links connected through repeater hubs were part of the ieee specification but the specification is not updated anymore and full duplex operation with switches is used exclusively ethernet was the result of research conducted at xerox parc in the early 1970s and later evolved into a widely implemented physical and link layer protocol fast ethernet increased the speed from 10 to 100 megabits per second mbit s gigabit ethernet was the next iteration increasing the speed to 1000 mbit s the initial standard for gigabit ethernet was produced by the ieee in june 1998 as ieee 802 3z and required optical fiber 802 3z is commonly referred to as 1000base x where x refers to either cx sx lx or non standard zx for the history behind the x see fast ethernet ieee 802 3ab ratified in 1999 defines gigabit ethernet transmission over unshielded twisted pair utp category 5 5e or 6 cabling and became known

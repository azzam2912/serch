it centres on the working lives of the pathologists and attendant staff who work in the department much of the humour of the show springs from the characters varying views on death and their contrasting beliefs about the relative importance of their work the show often derives humour from the fact that the characters are not primarily forensic pathologists davison s character anthony webster is frequently at pains to explain that he is a histopathologist for example their case load therefore infrequently verges into the more exciting area of crime related death nevertheless one of the running gags of the programme was that the character originally played by tracy ann oberman the anatomical pathologist ruth anderson was secondarily credentialled as a forensic pathologist but had so rarely used these skills that her deductive reasoning skills were faulty two other major themes can be seen throughout the history of the programme one is the desire especially on the part of donaldson and webster to educate the public about pathology various schemes notably including the first radio broadcast of an autopsy are hatched to accomplish this goal another predominant theme is the effect of a career in pathology on the personal lives

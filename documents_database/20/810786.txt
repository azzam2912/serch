this is done by replacing the crankshaft with one where the crank pin is moved farther away from the center of the axis of rotation of the crankshaft while this increases displacement and torque it can potentially lower the limit to which the motor can rev safely compared to the stock configuration two key characteristics differentiate stroker kits from oem rotating assemblies first and most important the crankshaft s rod journals are physically farther from the main journals than on the original equipment a given extension in the distance between the rod and main journals results in twice that distance in increase of piston travel for example in a chrysler la 1971 1992 360 cubic inch 5 9 l v8 the rod journal centerline is 1 79 in 4 55 cm from the main journal centerline the piston travels 3 58 in 9 1 cm in this configuration when this engine is modified with a 402 cubic inch 6 6 l stroker kit the distance between the main journal centerline and the rod journal centerline is increased to 2 00 in 5 08 cm which results in the piston travelling 4 00 in 10 16 cm so the modified crankshaft

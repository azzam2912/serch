surprisal analysis is capable of relating the underlying microscopic properties to the macroscopic bulk properties of a system it has already been applied to a spectrum of disciplines including engineering physics chemistry and biomedical engineering recently it has been extended to characterize the state of living cells specifically monitoring and characterizing biological processes in real time using transcriptional data surprisal analysis was formulated at the hebrew university of jerusalem as a joint effort between raphael david levine richard barry bernstein and avinoam ben shaul in 1972 levine and colleagues had recognized a need to better understand the dynamics of non equilibrium systems particularly of small systems that are not seemingly applicable to thermodynamic reasoning alhassid and levine first applied surprisal analysis in nuclear physics to characterize the distribution of products in heavy ion reactions since its formulation surprisal analysis has become a critical tool for the analysis of reaction dynamics and is an official iupac term maximum entropy methods are at the core of a new view of scientific inference allowing analysis and interpretation of large and sometimes noisy data surprisal analysis extends principles of maximal entropy and of thermodynamics where both equilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are assumed to

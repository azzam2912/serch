during the recycling process steel and tire cord fluff are removed leaving tire rubber with a granular consistency continued processing with a granulator or cracker mill possibly with the aid of cryogenics or by mechanical means reduces the size of the particles further the particles are sized and classified based on various criteria including color black only or black and white the granulate is sized by passing through a screen the size based on a dimension 1 4 inch or mesh holes per inch 10 20 etc crumb rubber is often used in artificial turf as cushioning the first synthetic grass was placed over concrete in 1964 and became known as chem grass it was later named astroturf when it was installed in the houston astrodome in 1966 athletes did not like playing on these fields because it was dangerous a new artificial turf system was developed in the early 2000s based on crumb rubber the black crumbs are small pieces of styrene butadiene rubber made from grinding up old vehicle tires the tire crumbs are poured in between the artificial grass blades giving the artificial fields more cushion and support this reduced major injuries compared to astroturf rubberized asphalt

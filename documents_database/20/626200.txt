the genus has been placed within the subclass phyllocarida in the class malacostraca that includes shrimps and lobsters canadaspis had claws on the end of its frontal appendages which may have been used to stir up sediment or to scrape off the top layer which may have been a nutritious layer of microbes large particles it stirred up would have been captured by spines on the inside of its legs these spines would have directed the food particles to the organism s mouth where it used its mandibles to grind larger particles its antennae served a sensory function spines on its head probably served to protect its vulnerable eyes from predators its limbs probably moved in sequence to produce a rippling motion although canadaspis probably did not swim this could have helped propel the organism from under soft sediments the appendages also produced currents which would have helped with feeding and respiration canadaspis is very closely related to the similar organism perspicaris differing only in morphological detail three alternatives exist for canadaspis s classification they concern its relationship to the crustacea it was originally thought that it falls within that clade but this no longer appears to be the case

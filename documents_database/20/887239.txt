in alex george s 1996 arrangement this species was recognised as quite distinctive being unusual in its long unserrated leaves its rigid awl shaped floral leaves and its round follicles with no obvious relatives the species was placed alone in a new series named dryandra ser subulatae since 1998 austin mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for the subtribe banksiinae his analyses have provided compelling evidence of the paraphyly of banksia with respect to dryandra that is it seems that dryandra arose from within the ranks of banksia early in 2007 mast and kevin thiele initiated a rearrangement of banksia by sinking dryandra into it dryandra subulata thus became banksia subulata mast s analyses placed b subulata not with the other dryandra species sampled but rather within a small clade of banksia species with independently reduced inflorescence axes for this reason b subulata was placed incertae sedis in b subg banksia rather than in b ser dryandra with the other dryandra species the transfer of dryandra into banksia necessitated the setting aside of george s infrageneric arrangement of dryandra thus d ser subulatae is no longer current mast and thiele have foreshadowed publishing

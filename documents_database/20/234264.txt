the entries consist of characters the traces of the matrices representing group elements of the column s class in the given row s group representation in chemistry crystallography and spectroscopy character tables of point groups are used to classify e g molecular vibrations according to their symmetry and to predict whether a transition between two states is forbidden for symmetry reasons the irreducible complex characters of a finite group form a character table which encodes much useful information about the group g in a compact form each row is labelled by an irreducible character and the entries in the row are the values of that character on any representative of the respective conjugacy class of g because characters are class functions the columns are labelled by representatives of the conjugacy classes of g it is customary to label the first row by the trivial character and the first column by the conjugacy class of the identity the entries of the first column are the values of the irreducible characters at the identity the degrees of the irreducible characters characters of degree 1 are known as linear characters here is the character table of c the cyclic group with three elements

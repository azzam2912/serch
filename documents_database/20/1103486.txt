the role of pitp in polyphosphoinositide synthesis may also explain its involvement in intracellular vesicular traffic along with the structurally unrelated sec14p family found in this family can bind exchange one molecule of phosphatidylinositol pi or phosphatidylcholine pc and thus aids their transfer between different membrane compartments there are three sub families all share an n terminal pitp like domain whose sequence is highly conserved it is described as consisting of three regions the n terminal region is thought to bind the lipid and contains two helices and an eight stranded mostly antiparallel beta sheet an intervening loop region which is thought to play a role in protein protein interactions separates this from the c terminal region which exhibits the greatest sequence variation and may be involved in membrane binding this motif marks pitp as part of the larger srpbcc start rhoalphac pitp bet v1 coxg calc domain superfamily pitp alpha uniprot has a 16 fold greater affinity for pi than pc together with pitp beta uniprot it is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues the family of human phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins has several members

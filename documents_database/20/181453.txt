lep collided electrons with positrons at energies that reached 209 gev it was a circular collider with a circumference of 27 kilometres built in a tunnel roughly 100 m 300 ft underground and passing through switzerland and france lep was used from 1989 until 2000 around 2001 it was dismantled to make way for the large hadron collider which re used the lep tunnel to date lep is the most powerful accelerator of leptons ever built lep was a circular lepton collider the most powerful such ever built for context modern colliders can be generally categorized based on their shape circular or linear and on what types of particles they accelerate and collide leptons or hadrons leptons are point particles and are relatively light because they are point particles their collisions are clean and amenable to precise measurements however because they are light the collisions cannot reach the same energy that can be achieved with heavier particles hadrons are composite particles composed of quarks and are relatively heavy protons for example have a mass 2000 times greater than electrons because of their higher mass they can be accelerated to much higher energies which is the key to directly observing new

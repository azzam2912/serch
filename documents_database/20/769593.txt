they offer relatively good acceleration for their size and weight are able to negotiate rough terrain outside the airport area carry large capacities of water and fire fighting foam are fitted with powerful high capacity pumps and water foam cannons and are capable of delivering firefighting media over long distances they can be mounted on 4x4 6x6 or even 8x8 wheeled chassis in order to decrease their turning radius the 8x8 wheeled unit may have all four front wheels steerable newer airport crash tenders also incorporate twin agent nozzles injection systems to inject a stream of purple k dry chemical into the afff firefighting foam stream knocking down the fire faster some also have halotron tanks with handlines for situations that require a clean agent to be utilized these features give the airport crash tenders a capability to reach an airplane rapidly and rapidly put out large fires with jet fuel involved some tenders have an elevated extended extinguishing arm giving a possibility to raise a water foam cannon into the height of approximately 10 to 20 meters that can puncture through superficial structures of an aeroplane to fight a fire inside the fuselage some arms have a reinforced nozzle

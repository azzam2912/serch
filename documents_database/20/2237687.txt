the cip kip family is made up of three proteins p21 p27 p57 these proteins share sequence homology at the n terminal domain which allows them to bind to both the cyclin and cdk their activity primarily involves the binding and inhibition of g1 s and s cdks however they have also been shown to play an important role in activating the g1 cdks cdk4 and cdk6 in addition more recent work has shown that cip kip family members have a number of cdk independent roles involving regulation of transcription apoptosis and the cytoskeleton cip kip family proteins bind a wide range of g1 s and s phase cyclin cdk complexes including cyclin d cdk4 6 and cyclin e a cdk2 complexes traditionally it was assumed that cip kip proteins played a role in inhibiting all of these complexes however it was later discovered that cip kip proteins while inhibiting cdk2 activity may also activate cyclin d cdk4 6 activity by facilitating stable binding between cyclin d and cdk4 6 the crystal structure of p27 in a complex with cyclina cdk2 was published in 1996 the structure shows that p27 interacts with both cyclin a and cdk2 in addition p27

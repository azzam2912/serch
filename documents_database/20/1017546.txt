this is partly due to the extra velocity and propellant required to launch into orbit against the direction of the earth s rotation most commercial earth observing satellites use retrograde sun synchronous orbits to ensure that observations are performed at the same local time each pass of any given location while almost all communication satellites use prograde orbits israel has successfully launched seven ofeq satellites in retrograde orbit aboard a shavit launcher these reconnaissance satellites complete one earth orbit every 90 minutes and initially make about six daylight passes per day over israel and the surrounding countries though this optimal sun synchronized orbit degrades after several months they were launched in retrograde orbit so that launch debris would land in the mediterranean sea and not over populated neighboring countries on an eastward flight path the united states launched two future imagery architecture fia radar satellites into 122 inclined retrograde orbits in 2010 and 2012 the use of a retrograde orbit suggest that these satellites employ sar techniques earth observing satellites may also be launched into a sun synchronous orbit which is slightly retrograde this is typically done in order to keep a constant surface illumination angle which is useful for

it involves utilizing ultrasound and ultrasonic acoustic waves of frequencies between 1 mhz and 100 mhz to determine the acoustic radiation resulted from interactions of particles that experience nuclear spins as a result of magnetic and or electric fields the principles of nuclear acoustic resonance are often compared with nuclear magnetic resonance specifically its usage in conjunction with nuclear magnetic resonance systems for spectroscopy and related imaging methodologies due to this it is denoted that nuclear acoustic resonance can be used for the imaging of objects as well however for most cases nuclear acoustic resonance requires the presence of nuclear magnetic resonance to induce electron spins within specimens in order for the absorption of acoustic waves to occur research conducted through experimental and theoretical investigations relative to the absorption of acoustic radiation of different materials ranging from metals to subatomic particles have deducted that nuclear acoustic resonance has its specific usages in other fields other than imaging experimental observations of nuclear acoustic resonance was first obtained in 1963 by alers and fleury in solid aluminum nuclear acoustic resonance was first discussed in 1952 when semen altshuler proposed that the acoustic coupling to nuclear spins should be visible this was also

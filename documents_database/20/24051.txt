there exist both real analytic functions and complex analytic functions categories that are similar in some ways but different in others functions of each type are infinitely differentiable but complex analytic functions exhibit properties that do not hold generally for real analytic functions a function is analytic if and only if its taylor series about x converges to the function in some neighborhood for every x in its domain formally a function formula 1 is real analytic on an open set formula 2 in the real line if for any formula 3 one can write in which the coefficients formula 5 are real numbers and the series is convergent to formula 6 for formula 7 in a neighborhood of formula 8 alternatively an analytic function is an infinitely differentiable function such that the taylor series at any point formula 8 in its domain converges to formula 6 for formula 7 in a neighborhood of formula 8 pointwise the set of all real analytic functions on a given set formula 2 is often denoted by formula 15 a function formula 1 defined on some subset of the real line is said to be real analytic at a point formula 7 if

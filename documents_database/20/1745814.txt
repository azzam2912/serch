j walker that is it returns integer values according to some arbitrary probability distribution the algorithms typically use or preprocessing time after which random values can be drawn from the distribution in time internally the algorithm consults two tables a probability table and an alias table for to generate a random outcome a fair die is rolled to determine an index into the two tables based on the probability stored at that index a biased coin is then flipped and the outcome of the flip is used to choose between a result of and more concretely the algorithm operates as follows an alternative formulation of the probability table proposed by marsaglia et al as the square histogram method uses the condition in the third step where instead of computing the distribution may be padded with additional probabilities to increase to a convenient value such as a power of two to generate the table first initialize while doing this divide the table entries into three categories if the corresponding value will never be consulted and is unimportant but a value of is sensible as long as not all table entries are exactly full repeat the following steps each iteration moves at

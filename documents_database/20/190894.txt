the estimates generate a triangular array romberg s method is a newton cotes formula it evaluates the integrand at equally spaced points the integrand must have continuous derivatives though fairly good results may be obtained if only a few derivatives exist if it is possible to evaluate the integrand at unequally spaced points then other methods such as gaussian quadrature and clenshaw curtis quadrature are generally more accurate the method is named after werner romberg 1909 2003 who published the method in 1955 using the method can be inductively defined by or where formula 7 and formula 8 in big o notation the error for r n m is the zeroeth extrapolation r n 0 is equivalent to the trapezoidal rule with 2 1 points the first extrapolation r n 1 is equivalent to simpson s rule with 2 1 points the second extrapolation r n 2 is equivalent to boole s rule with 2 1 points further extrapolations differ from newton cotes formulas in particular further romberg extrapolations expand on boole s rule in very slight ways modifying weights into ratios similar as in boole s rule in contrast further newton cotes methods produce increasingly differing weights eventually leading

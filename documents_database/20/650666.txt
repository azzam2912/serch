in this pathway glucose is reduced to sorbitol which is subsequently oxidized to fructose it is also called the sorbitol aldose reductase pathway the pathway is implicated in diabetic complications especially in microvascular damage to the retina kidney and nerves sorbitol cannot cross cell membranes and when it accumulates it produces osmotic stresses on cells by drawing water into the insulin independent tissues cells use glucose for energy this normally occurs by phosphorylation via the enzyme hexokinase however if large amounts of glucose are present as in diabetes mellitus hexokinase becomes saturated and the excess glucose enters the polyol pathway when aldose reductase reduces it to sorbitol this reaction oxidizes nadph to nadp sorbitol dehydrogenase can then oxidize sorbitol to fructose which produces nadh from nad hexokinase can return the molecule to the glycolysis pathway by phosphorylating fructose to form fructose 6 phosphate however in uncontrolled diabetics that have high blood glucose more than the glycolysis pathway can handle the reaction s mass balance ultimately favors the production of sorbitol activation of the polyol pathway results in a decrease of reduced nadph and oxidized nad these are necessary cofactors in redox reactions throughout the body and under normal conditions they

the surface pressure is only 14 microbars 1 4 pa or 0 0105mmhg of the surface pressure on earth and it is composed of nitrogen similar to those of titan and earth it extends 800 kilometers above its surface recent observations have shown an increase in temperature nitrogen is the main gas in triton s atmosphere the two other known components are methane and carbon monoxide whose abundances are a few hundredths of a percent of that of the nitrogen carbon monoxide which was discovered only in 2010 by the ground based observations is slightly more abundant than methane the abundance of methane relative to nitrogen increased by four to five times since 1986 due to the seasonal warming observed on triton which passed its southern hemisphere solstice in 2001 other possible components of the triton s atmosphere include argon and neon because they were not detected in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum of triton obtained by voyager 2 in 1989 their abundances are unlikely to exceed a few percent in addition to the gases mentioned above the upper atmosphere contains significant amounts of both molecular and atomic hydrogen which is produced by the photolysis of methane this hydrogen

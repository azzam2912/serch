the curve shortening flow is an example of a geometric flow and is the one dimensional case of the mean curvature flow other names for the same process include the euclidean shortening flow geometric heat flow and arc length evolution as the points of any smooth simple closed curve move in this way the curve remains simple and smooth it loses area at a constant rate and its perimeter decreases as quickly as possible for any continuous curve evolution if the curve is non convex its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically until it becomes convex once convex the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape before collapsing to a single point of singularity if two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point the circle is the only simple closed curve that maintains its shape under the curve shortening flow but some curves that cross themselves or have infinite length keep their shape including the grim reaper curve an infinite curve that translates upwards and spirals that rotate while remaining the same size and shape an approximation to the curve shortening flow can be

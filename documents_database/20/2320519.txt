most of the members of this subgenus have a metallic appearance while some are non metallic there are over 630 species worldwide they are commonly found in the northern hemisphere and are found in abundance in north america members of this subgenus also have very diverse forms of social structure making them model organisms for studying the social behavior of bees members of lasioglossum dialictus are small about 3 4 8 1 mm in size and distinguished from other halictids by a strongly arched basal vein and weakened distal veins on the forewings distinguishing between some of the species in lasioglossum dialictus proves to be difficult due to their monotonous morphology and subtle differences some species have been named based on geographic distribution and ecological niche rather than using any distinguishing morphological features genetic barcoding has developed into a commonly used identification tool for taxonomists though lasioglossum dialictus lacks a distinct barcode gap in addition to this group s subtle morphological differences this causes identifications to be misleading or difficult to ascertain though solitary bees such as lasioglossum figueresi often live in proximity to each other unlike communal bees the nests of solitary bees are built by lone females the

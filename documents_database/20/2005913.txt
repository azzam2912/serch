it also covers control a purposeful choice of input sequences as a rule it runs under randomness uncertainty and incomplete knowledge a range of prescriptive theories have been proposed how to make optimal decisions under these conditions they optimise sequence of decision rules mappings of the available knowledge on possible actions this sequence is called strategy or policy among various theories bayesian dm is broadly accepted axiomatically based theory that solves the design of optimal decision strategy it describes random uncertain or incompletely known quantities as random variables i e by their joint probability expressing belief in their possible values the strategy that minimises expected loss or equivalently maximises expected reward expressing decision maker s goals is then taken as the optimal strategy while the probabilistic description of beliefs is uniquely and deductively driven by rules for joint probabilities the composition and decomposition of the loss function have no such universally applicable formal machinery fully probabilistic design of decision strategies or control fpd removes the mentioned drawback and expresses also the dm goals of by the ideal probability which assigns high small values to desired undesired behaviours of the closed dm loop formed by the influenced world part and by

the method has been developed to fulfil clinical demands of quick examinations with this method the observer can see if there is an increased respectively decreased mobility in a specific motion segment the ctr technique measures both segmental and total skin distractions it compares the degree of segmental flexion mobility by establishing a ratio between segmental and total skin distraction first the skin distraction in cm is measured using a special transparent measuring strip and a pen the absolute mobility then absolute values are calculated in a computer program ctr graph 5 2 relative values are shown in percent each person has totally 100 mobility in the area c7 t5 the relative values show how many percent of the total mobility that is related to in each motion segment after each measure a curve called the ctr profile is calculated norlander has created a classification system for relative segmental flexion mobility between c7 t5 three classes of flexion mobility were defined ordinary hypo and hypermobility ordinary mobility was based on relative flexion mobility between the lower and the upper quartile for each motion segment between c7 t5 hypomobility was based on relative flexion mobility below the lower quartile for each

peter hayden and was released in spring 2014 this is the third and final part of an album trilogy formed with the band s two earlier releases faster than speed 2010 and born a trip 2012 continuing the growth in track length archdimension now consists of only one track that spans over two hours on this release their sound and composition was considered somewhat unique to the genres they are considered to represent deeper analysis on the album was given by david bowes on rock a rolla issue 49 archdimension now is a triumph as wide as a galaxy a starfire of light and hallucinatory visions across a backdrop as dark as the void split across two hour long compositions there is a certain degree of effort involved in appreciating what s on offer but that s the point the massive scope allows for complete immersion for listeners to cocoon themselves in sheer walls of drone and fractured samples and for the pulsation and sonar synth to pierce the synapses with their sharp unforgiving presence this is less an album than a microcosm a dimension mapped on plastic and transmitted through light sound and grinning endless otherness disc one disc

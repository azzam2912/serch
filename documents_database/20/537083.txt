a biochemical understanding of these conditions has changed how they are classified four conditions types i ii iii and iv were historically labeled as mucolipidoses however type i sialidosis is now classified as a glycoproteinosis and type iv mucolipidosis type iv is now classified as a gangliosidosis the other two types are closely related mucolipidosis types ii and iii ml ii and ml iii result from a deficiency of the enzyme n acetylglucosamine 1 phosphotransferase which phosphorylates target carbohydrate residues on n linked glycoproteins without this phosphorylation the glycoproteins are not destined for lysosomes and they escape outside the cell the mucolipidoses are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner that is they occur only when a child inherits two copies of the defective gene one from each parent when both parents carry a defective gene each of their children faces a one in four chance of developing one of the mls at the same time each child also faces a one in two chance of inheriting only one copy of the defective gene people who have only one defective gene are known as carriers these individuals do not develop the disease but they can pass the defective gene on to

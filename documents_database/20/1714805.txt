it is closely related to applied geophysics or exploration geophysics methods used include seismic refraction and reflection gravity magnetic electric and electromagnetic methods many of these methods were developed for oil and mineral exploration but are now used for a great variety of applications including archaeology environmental science forensic science military intelligence geotechnical investigation treasure hunting and hydrogeology in addition to the practical applications near surface geophysics includes the study of biogeochemical cycles in studies of the solid earth the mean feature that distinguishes geophysics from geology is that it involves remote sensing various physical phenomena are used to probe below the surface where scientists cannot directly access the rock applied geophysics projects typically have the following elements data acquisition data reduction data processing modeling and geological interpretation this all requires various types of geophysical surveys the various geophysical surveys one can carry out are gravity magnetic seismic magneto telluric etc a geophysical survey is a set of measurements made with a geophysical instrument often a set of measurements are along a line or traverse many surveys have a set of parallel traverses and another set perpendicular to it to get good spatial coverage technologies used for geophysical surveys include

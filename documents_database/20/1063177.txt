specifically it looks for calcium deposits in the coronary arteries that can narrow arteries and increase the risk of heart attack this severity can be presented as agatston score or coronary artery calcium cac score the cac score is an independent marker of risk for cardiac events cardiac mortality and all cause mortality in addition it provides additional prognostic information to other cardiovascular risk markers a typical coronary ct calcium scan is done without the use of radiocontrast but it can possibly be done from contrast enhanced images as well such as in coronary ct angiography the well established indications for the use of the cac score include stratification of global cardiovascular risk for asymptomatic patients intermediate risk based on the framingham risk score class i low risk based on a family history of early cad class iia and low risk patients with diabetes class iia in symptomatic patients the pre test probability should always be given weight in the interpretation of the cac score as a filter or tool to indicate the best method to facilitate the diagnosis therefore the use of the cac score alone is limited in symptomatic patients in patients with diabetes the cac score helps

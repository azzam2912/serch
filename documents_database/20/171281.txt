the becquerel is defined as the number of radioactive transformations per second that occur in a particular radionuclide the older non si unit of activity is the curie ci which is transformations per second since the probability of radioactive decay for a given radionuclide is a fixed physical quantity with some slight exceptions see changing decay rates the number of decays that occur in a given time of a specific number of atoms of that radionuclide is also a fixed physical quantity if there are large enough numbers of atoms to ignore statistical fluctuations thus specific activity is defined as the activity per quantity of atoms of a particular radionuclide it is usually given in units of bq g but another commonly used unit of activity is the curie ci allowing the definition of specific activity in ci g the amount of specific activity should not be confused with level of exposure to ionizing radiation and thus the exposure or absorbed dose the absorbed dose is the quantity important in assessing the effects of ionizing radiation on humans radioactivity is expressed as the decay rate of a particular radionuclide with decay constant and the number of atoms n mass of

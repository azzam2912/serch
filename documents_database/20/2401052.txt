it allows size measurements to be taken from extremely small quantities of material nano grams and is particularly useful when sizing molecules which may vary in size depending on their environment e g protein molecules which may unfold or become denatured in unfavourable conditions mds is primarily used in protein analyses where size concentration and interactions are important measuring the size of a protein molecule is useful as an overall quality indicator since misfolding unfolding oligomerization aggregation or degradation can all affect size the literature specifically demonstrates the use of mds in sizing protein nanobody complexes monitoring the formation of synuclein amyloid fibrils and in observing protein assembly into oligomers mds can also be used to size membrane proteins as the use of a protein specific labelling and detection system allows other species present in the solution such as free lipid micelles or detergents to be ignored mds has been used to characterise interactions between biomolecules under native conditions and has been demonstrated to detect specific interactions within complex mixtures it has also been used in detecting and quantifying protein ligand interactions and protein lipid interactions the concentration of purified protein solutions in the laboratory is useful in determining yield

the experiment studied magnetic plasma confinement to support controlled nuclear fusion experiments specifically stx pioneered the possibility of forming a field reversed configuration frc by using a rotating magnetic field rmf frcs are of interest to the plasma physics community because of their confinement properties and their small size while most large fusion experiments in the world are tokamaks frcs are seen as a viable alternative because of their higher beta meaning the same power output could be produced from a smaller volume of plasma and their good plasma stability the stx was built in 1998 the stx was motivated by a discovery from an unrelated experiment a few years previously the large s experiment lsx had demonstrated the existence of a kinetically stabilized parameter regime which appeared advantageous for a fusion reactor however the lsx experiment formed frcs in a power hungry violent way called a theta pinch the us department of energy funded the translation confinement sustainment tcs program as a follow on to the lsx program but it had not yet begun when the stx started operation the purpose of tcs was to see whether rotating magnetic fields could sustain frcs born of the theta pinch method

it gives information on the ability of a particular board construction to resist crushing it provides some relationship with the peak top to bottom compression strength of empty singlewall regular slotted containers in laboratory conditions the edge crush resistance r expressed in kilonewtons per meter kn m is calculated by the equation formula 1 where formula 2 is the mean value of the maximum force and is measured in newtons more details are laid down in iso 3037 corrugated fiberboard can be evaluated by many material test methods including an edge crush test there have been efforts to estimate the compression strength of a box usually empty regular singlewall slotted containers top to bottom based on various board properties some have involved finite element analysis one of the commonly referenced empirical estimations was published by mckee in 1963 this used the board ect the md and cd flexural stiffness the box perimeter and the box depth simplifications have used a formula involving the board ect the board thickness and the box perimeter most estimations do not relate well to other box orientations box styles or to filled boxes in order to calculate the value of bct box compression test the

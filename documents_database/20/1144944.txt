the idea behind it is that streaming scheduler drops video frames when the transmission buffer is full because of insufficient bandwidth to reduce the transmitted bit rate the characteristics of the algorithm the ifd mechanism is divided on two parts the size of the ifd buffer should be big enough to hold a number of frames but minimum required is two frames one to hold the frame currently being sent indicated below as scheduledframe and one currently waiting to be sent indicated as waitingframe increasing the ifd buffer size could potentially permit a more elaborate prioritization however it can cause increased latency and memory usage the figure below depicts an example of the buffer filling the numbers represent the priority a packet here the video frames priority numbers are 10 and higher the packets with priority number 12 belong to the frame scheduled for sending and the packets with number 11 belong to the waiting frame on the figure a packet which belongs to the next frame is about to enter the buffer as can be seen it is possible to interleave video packets with non video packets audio or system with priority numbers 2 and 0 respectively when a

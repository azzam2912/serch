she was named as one of 2019 science forbes 30 under 30 for her work developing algorithms for classical computers to perform calculations that were previously deemed only possible with quantum computers research that began under the supervision of scott aaronson when tang was only a teenager tang skipped the fourth fifth and sixth grades in order to enroll at the university of texas at austin at the age of 14 tang s first experience of research involved working on in vivo imaging for biomedical research such as optical probes to view polarised macrophages during foreign body reactions bacterial infection fibrin deposition and real time detection of neutrophil responses in 2014 tang was awarded an davidson fellow honorable mention for her work on an optical imaging probe for real time detection of infection in 2017 she took a class on quantum information taught by scott aaronson who would soon become her dissertation adviser aaronson recognised tang as an unusually talented student and presented her with a range of research projects to choose from among them was the recommendation problem before tang s work the best known classical algorithms solving some linear algebra problems where exponentially slower under some assumptions than

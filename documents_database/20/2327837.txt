it is a pale yellow water soluble liquid the compound has a number of useful and unusual properties e g it causes a reversal of the hypnotic effect of morphine in mice and has a stimulating effect in humans it is a stable and comparably nontoxic precursor for the genotoxic mutagenic and potentially carcinogenic malondialdehyde the compound can be thought of as vinylogous dimethylformamide dmf and combines the functionalities of an unsaturated aldehyde and an enamine therefore 3 dimethylaminoacrolein and vinamidines derived therefrom composed of vinylogous amidines or vinamidinium salts substituted 1 5 diazapentadienes can be used as reactive molecular building blocks for the formation of nitrogen containing heterocycles such as pyridines pyrimidines pyrroles or pyrazoles 3 dimethylaminoacrolein is obtained by the addition of dimethylamine to the triple bond of propynal propargyl aldehyde via a reppe vinylation propynal is however an inappropriate starting material for industrial synthesis because of its tendency to explode vinyl ethers such as ethyl vinyl ether are more suited they react with phosgene and dimethylformamide which forms in situ the vilsmeier reagent in 68 yield to 3 ethoxypropenylidene dimethylammonium chloride an enol ether iminium salt in the weakly alkaline medium 3 dimethylaminoacrolein is formed therefrom which

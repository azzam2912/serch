even more concisely stated the line represents the integral along the horizontal axis of the piecewise continuous function represented by the sequence of bars the chart is named for the pareto principle which in turn derives its name from vilfredo pareto a noted italian economist the left vertical axis is the frequency of occurrence but it can alternatively represent cost or another important unit of measure the right vertical axis is the cumulative percentage of the total number of occurrences total cost or total of the particular unit of measure because the values are in decreasing order the cumulative function is a concave function to take the example below in order to lower the amount of late arrivals by 78 it is sufficient to solve the first three issues the purpose of the pareto chart is to highlight the most important among a typically large set of factors in quality control it often represents the most common sources of defects the highest occurring type of defect or the most frequent reasons for customer complaints and so on wilkinson 2006 devised an algorithm for producing statistically based acceptance limits similar to confidence intervals for each bar in the pareto chart these

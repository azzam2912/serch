mfsd2a is a membrane transport protein that is expressed in the endothelium of the blood brain barrier bbb and has an essential role in bbb formation and function genetic ablation of mfsd2a results in leaky bbb and increases central nervous system endothelial cell vesicular transcytosis without otherwise affecting tight junctions mfsd2a is an atypical slc thus a predicted slc transporter it clusters phylogenetically to amtf8 in addition to transport of other lysophosphatidylcholines across the bbb msfd2a is the primary mechanism for docosahexaenoic acid dha an omega 3 fatty acid uptake and transport into the brain it may also be responsible for uptake and transport of tunicamycin complete loss of mfsd2a in human leads to a recessive lethal microcephaly syndrome consisting of enlarged lateral ventricles and underdevelopment of the cerebellum and brainstem this is presumably due to loss of uptake of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids by the brain endothelial cells which utilize mfsd2a as a transporter for these fats serum from patients showed elevated levels of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids presumably due to the inability of vascular cells to uptake these lipids in the absence of protein function without the ability to uptake these fats into endothelial cells there is breakdown

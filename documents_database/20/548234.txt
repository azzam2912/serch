this article presents cryptographic aspects of the problem for discussion of different software packages and hardware devices devoted to this problem see disk encryption software and disk encryption hardware disk encryption methods aim to provide three distinct properties the first property requires defining an adversary from whom the data is being kept confidential the strongest adversaries studied in the field of disk encryption have these abilities a method provides good confidentiality if the only information such an adversary can determine over time is whether the data in a sector has or has not changed since the last time they looked the second property requires dividing the disk into several sectors usually 512 bytes bits long which are encrypted and decrypted independently of each other in turn if the data is to stay confidential the encryption method must be tweakable no two sectors should be processed in exactly the same way otherwise the adversary could decrypt any sector of the disk by copying it to an unused sector of the disk and requesting its decryption the third property is generally non controversial however it indirectly prohibits the use of stream ciphers since stream ciphers require for their security that the same

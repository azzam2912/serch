frequency ramping was the dominant force in commodity processor performance increases from the mid 1980s until roughly the end of 2004 the effect of processor frequency on computer speed can be seen by looking at the equation for computer program runtime where instructions per program is the total instructions being executed in a given program cycles per instruction is a program dependent architecture dependent average value and time per cycle is by definition the inverse of processor frequency an increase in frequency thus decreases runtime however power consumption in a chip is given by the equation where p is power consumption c is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle v is voltage and f is the processor frequency cycles per second increases in frequency thus increase the amount of power used in a processor increasing processor power consumption led ultimately to intel s may 2004 cancellation of its tejas and jayhawk processors which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm moore s law was still in effect when frequency scaling ended despite power issues transistor densities were still doubling every 18 to 24 months with the end of frequency scaling new

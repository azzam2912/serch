it is the most significant unintentional release of radioactivity into the environment the work of the scientific committee on problems of the environment scope suggests that the chernobyl incident cannot be directly compared to atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons through a single number with one being simply times larger than the other this is partly due to the fact that the isotopes released at chernobyl tended to be longer lived than those released by the detonation of atomic bombs the economic damage caused by the disaster is estimated at 235 billion according to a 2009 united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation unscear the chernobyl accident had by 2005 caused 61 200 man sv of radiation exposure to recovery workers and evacuees 125 000 man sv to the populace of ukraine belarus and russia and a dose to most of the more distant european countries amounting to 115 000 man sv the same report estimated a further 25 more exposure would be received from residual radiosotopes after 2005 the total global collective dose from chernobyl was earlier estimated by unscear in 1988 to be 600 000 man sv equivalent on average to 21 additional days of world

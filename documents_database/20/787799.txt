by providing very granular control of voltages and clock frequencies within the processor it enables software performance to be optimized for specific workloads while ensuring that power consumption remains below a particular value due to unspecified issues foxton was not included in the initial release of montecito according to sources inside intel it is under consideration for future itanium 2 processor versions foxton technology includes a highly advanced clock generation and distribution network with this technology the processor continuously measures total power draw processor loads voltage and clock distribution quality across the entire device and is able to produce extremely fine clock to voltage granularity under dynamic conditions as a result foxton enables a processor to override factory adjusted settings which are set at relatively high voltage levels at any given frequency to ensure stability against random voltage variances by dynamically controlling voltage and frequencies across the entire device foxton is able to optimize performance for specific workloads while ensuring that power consumption remains below specified thresholds foxton improves power efficiency at any given clock rate but that is not the primary reason it was developed itanium 2 processors implement a wide microarchitecture which has enormous computing capacity theoretically capable

it involves using computer aided design cad computer automated design cautod and computer aided engineering cae software to validate a design before committing to making a physical prototype this is done by creating usually 3d computer generated geometrical shapes parts and either combining them into an assembly and testing different mechanical motions fit and function the assembly or individual parts could be opened in cae software to simulate the behavior of the product in the real world the term virtual prototyping has also been established in the field of venture development this process has been developed by the digital consultancy candylabs and describes a method to test digital ventures or products through various channels on a website promoting a product that has not been built yet this method helps understanding market acceptance as well as anticipated marketing costs for the final product before an mvp is built the product design and development process used to rely primarily on engineers experience and judgment in producing an initial concept design a physical prototype was then constructed and tested in order to evaluate its performance without any way to evaluate its performance in advance the initial prototype was highly unlikely to meet expectations

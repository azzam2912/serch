it is an excellent thermal insulator and among the least dense solids known seagel was invented by robert morrison at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in 1992 seagel is made of agar a carbohydrate material that comes from kelp and red algae and has a density of 200 mg cm seagel can be made lighter than air using hydrogen causing it to float or hang in the air it insulates against temperature noise and electric current seagel is also completely biodegradable as it is made entirely of biological material and can even be eaten initially seagel starts out as a gelatin like mixture of agar and water after it is freeze dried to remove the water it is left as a honeycomb of dried agar filled with air with cell sizes two to three micrometers 2 3 m in diameter seagel can have many different uses laboratory scientists use seagel as targets for x ray laser experiments because it can be doped with other materials such as selenium in order to eliminate the volatile hydrodynamics that occur when a solid density target explodes before it reaches the density required for lasing scientists are trying to develop an x ray laser

this is called a mosaic karyotype because like tiles in mosaic floors or walls there is more than one type of cell the clinical manifestations are highly variable ranging from partial virilisation and ambiguous genitalia at birth to patients with completely male or female gonads most individuals with this karyotype have apparently normal male genitalia and a minority with female genitalia with a significant number of individuals showing genital abnormalities or intersex characteristics a significantly higher than normal number of other developmental abnormalities are also found in individuals with x0 xy mosaicism psychomotor development is normal although similar in some ways to true hermaphroditism the conditions can be distinguished histologically and by karyotyping the observable characteristics phenotype of this condition are highly variable ranging from gonadal dysgenesis in males to turner like females and phenotypically normal males the phenotypical expression may be ambiguous intersex or male or female depending on the extent of the mosaicism the most common presentation of 45 x 46 xy karyotype is phenotypically normal male next being genital ambiguity there is a range of chromosomal anomalies within 45 x 46 xy where the variations are very complex and the actual result in living individuals is often

it was proved in 1991 by the czech mathematician dana fra kov let x be a separable hilbert space and let bv 0 t x denote the normed vector space of all functions f 0 t x with finite total variation over the interval 0 t equipped with the total variation norm it is well known that bv 0 t x satisfies the compactness theorem known as helly s selection theorem given any sequence of functions f in bv 0 t x that is uniformly bounded in the total variation norm there exists a subsequence and a limit function f bv 0 t x such that f t converges weakly in x to f t for every t 0 t that is for every continuous linear functional x consider now the banach space reg 0 t x of all regulated functions f 0 t x equipped with the supremum norm helly s theorem does not hold for the space reg 0 t x a counterexample is given by the sequence one may ask however if a weaker selection theorem is true and the fra kov helly selection theorem is such a result as before let x be a separable hilbert

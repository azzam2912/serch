structurally similar to paraherquamides they are a small class compounds that contain a bicyclo 2 2 2 diazoctane ring system one of the major secondary metabolites in penicillium spores they are responsible for inflammatory response in lung cells originally isolated from pennicillum compactum in 1969 brevianamide a has shown insecticidal activity further studies showed that a minor secondary metabolite brevianamide b has an epimeric center at the spiro indoxyl quaternary center both were found to fluoresce under long wave ultraviolet radiation furthermore under irradaton brevianamide a has been shown to isomerize to brevianamide b while the biosynthesis has not been conclusively elucidated brevianamide a and b are constructed from tryptophan proline and an isoprene unit the total synthesis of several brevianamides have been reported for brevianamide b and for brevianamide e tests for antibiotic effectiveness against e coli a fecalis b subtilis s aureus and p aeruginosa were negative also no inhibitory action was shown against a niger a flavis p crustosum f graminearum f moniliforme alternara sp and cladosporium sp however some insecticidal activity has been shown in one study possibly showing some use as an insecticide for food crops in mammalian mice lung cell studies brevianamide a has

it is classed as a diarylamine and more specifically an arylaminopyridine its chemical name is 3 chloro n 3 chloro 2 6 dinitro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinamine the mode of action involves the compound being an extremely potent uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and also having high reactivity with thiols it is unique amongst uncouplers in displaying broad spectrum activity against fungi and also very low toxicity to mammals due to it being rapidly metabolised to a compound without uncoupling activity it was first described in 1992 and was developed by researchers at the japanese company ishihara sangyo kaisha fluazinam is a protectant fungicide but is neither systemic or curative it acts by inhibiting the germination of spores and the development of infection structures although it has activity against many fungi it is less potent against rusts and powdery mildew and as such has not been commercialised for use in cereal crops it is widely used to control late blight p infestans in potato due to its activity against the zoospores of the pathogen which makes it particularly effective at controlling infection of the potato tubers despite its common usage to control late blight there are no

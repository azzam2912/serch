a lustrous silvery gray tetravalent transition metal hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in many zirconium minerals its existence was predicted by dmitri mendeleev in 1869 though it was not identified until 1923 by coster and hevesy making it the last stable element to be discovered hafnium is named after hafnia the latin name for copenhagen where it was discovered hafnium is used in filaments and electrodes some semiconductor fabrication processes use its oxide for integrated circuits at 45 nm and smaller feature lengths some superalloys used for special applications contain hafnium in combination with niobium titanium or tungsten hafnium s large neutron capture cross section makes it a good material for neutron absorption in control rods in nuclear power plants but at the same time requires that it be removed from the neutron transparent corrosion resistant zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors hafnium is a shiny silvery ductile metal that is corrosion resistant and chemically similar to zirconium due to its having the same number of valence electrons being in the same group but also to relativistic effects the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction

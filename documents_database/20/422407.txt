it is a negative going deflection that peaks around 400 milliseconds post stimulus onset although it can extend from 250 500 ms and is typically maximal over centro parietal electrode sites the n400 is part of the normal brain response to words and other meaningful or potentially meaningful stimuli including visual and auditory words sign language signs pictures faces environmental sounds and smells the n400 was first discovered by marta kutas and steven hillyard in 1980 they conducted the first experiment looking at the response to unexpected words in read sentences expecting to elicit a p300 component the p300 had previously been shown to be elicited by unexpected stimuli kutas and hillyard therefore used sentences with anomalous endings i e i take coffee with cream and dog expecting to see a p300 to the unexpected sentence final words however instead of eliciting a large positivity these anomalous endings elicited a large negativity relative to the sentences with expected endings i e he returned the book to the library in the same paper they confirmed that the negativity was not just caused by any unexpected event at the end of a sentence since a semantically expected but physically unexpected word i

the relative stereochemistry was not elucidated in the original publication structural analysis using x rays or nmr was not available in these days in the absence of ammonia or ammonium salts a 4 oxotetrahydropyran is formed in contrast to the robinson synthesis it does not employ dialdehydes like succinaldehyde or glutaraldehyde but simpler aldehydes like benzaldehyde therefore the product of the reaction is not a bicyclic structure see tropinone and pseudopelletierine but a 4 piperidone the synthesis of tropinone can be seen as a variation of the petrenko kritschenko reaction in which the two aldehyde functions are covalently linked in a single molecule apart from the hantzsch synthesis the petrenko kritschenko reaction is one of the few examples in which a symmetric pyridine precursor can be obtained in a multicomponent ring condensation reaction followed by an oxidation the oxidation by chromium trioxide in acetic acid leads to a symmetrically substituted 4 pyridone decarboxylation yields the 3 5 unsubstituted derivative acetoacetate can be used instead of diethyl ketoglurate in the presence of indium salts the use of aniline has also been reported in the original publication the product of this reaction shows transoid configuration of the phenyl groups at c 2

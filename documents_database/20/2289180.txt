it therefore includes both the physiology of breath hold diving in humans and other air breathing animals and the range of physiological effects generally limited to human ambient pressure divers either freediving or using underwater breathing apparatus several factors influence the diver including immersion exposure to the water the limitations of breath hold endurance variations in ambient pressure the effects of breathing gases at raised ambient pressure effects caused by the use of breathing apparatus and sensory impairment all of these may affect diver performance and safety immersion affects fluid balance circulation and work of breathing exposure to cold water can result in the harmful cold shock response the helpful diving reflex and excessive loss of body heat breath hold duration is limited by oxygen reserves and the risk of hypoxic blackout which has a high associated risk of drowning large or sudden changes in ambient pressure have the potential for injury known as barotrauma breathing under pressure involves several effects metabolically inactive gases are absorbed by the tissues and may have narcotic or other undesirable effects and must be released slowly to avoid the formation of bubbles during decompression metabolically active gases have a greater effect in proportion to

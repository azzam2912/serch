in its most basic form tungsten carbide is a fine gray powder but it can be pressed and formed into shapes through a process called sintering for use in industrial machinery cutting tools abrasives armor piercing rounds other tools and instruments and jewelry tungsten carbide is approximately twice as stiff as steel with a young s modulus of approximately 530 700 gpa 77 000 to 102 000 ksi and is double the density of steel nearly midway between that of lead and gold it is comparable with corundum in hardness and can only be polished and finished with abrasives of superior hardness such as cubic boron nitride and diamond powder wheels and compounds historically referred to as wolfram wolf rahm wolframite ore discovered by peter woulfe was then later carburized and cemented with a binder creating a composite now called cemented tungsten carbide tungsten is swedish for heavy stone colloquially among workers in various industries such as machining and carpentry tungsten carbide is often simply called carbide despite the imprecision of the usage among the lay public the growing popularity of tungsten carbide rings has also led to consumers calling the material tungsten tungsten carbide is prepared by reaction of

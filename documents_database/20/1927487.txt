it is a metastable proton tautomer of acetylene which only persists as an adduct it is a colourless gas that phosphoresces in the far infrared range it is the simplest unsaturated carbene the systematic names ethene and dihydrido 1 h dicarbon c c valid iupac names are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures respectively in appropriate contexts methylidenecarbene can be viewed as ethene with two hydrogen atoms removed or as ethane with four hydrogens removed and as such ethen 1 ylidene or vinylidene or ethane 1 diylidene respectively may be used as a context specific systematic names according to substitutive nomenclature by default these names pay no regard to the radicality of the methylidenecarbene molecule in even more specific context these can also name the non radical singlet ground state whereas the diradical state is named ethene 1 1 diyl or ethane 1 1 diylylidene and the long lived tetraradical triplet state is named ethane 1 1 1 2 tetrayl ethenylidene without the 1 locant or vinylidene is used systematically to refer to the substituent group it is used non systematically to refer to substituent group ethene 1 1 diyl care should be taken to avoid confusing the

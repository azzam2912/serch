the first examples of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide are from the 19th century when carbon dioxide was reduced to carbon monoxide using a zinc cathode research in this field intensified in the 1980s following the oil embargoes of the 1970s electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide represents a possible means of producing chemicals or fuels converting carbon dioxide to organic feedstocks such as formic acid hcooh methanol choh ethylene ch methane ch and carbon monoxide co in 2018 researchers from the university of delaware reported a general techno economic analysis of co electrolysis technology in carbon fixation plants convert carbon dioxide into sugars from which many biosynthetic pathways originate the catalyst responsible for this conversion rubisco is the most common protein on earth some anaerobic organisms employ enzymes to convert co to carbon monoxide from which fatty acids can be made in industry a few products are made from co including urea salicylic acid methanol and certain inorganic and organic carbonates in the laboratory carbon dioxide is sometimes used to prepare carboxylic acids no electrochemical process involving co has been commercialized the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to co is usually described as the redox potential for this reaction is

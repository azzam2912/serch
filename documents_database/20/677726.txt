the type species nyasasaurus parringtoni was first described in 1956 in the doctoral thesis of english paleontologist alan j charig but it was not formally described until 2013 previously the oldest record of dinosaurs was from argentina and dated back to the late carnian stage about 231 4 million years ago nyasasaurus comes from a deposit that dates back to the anisian stage meaning that it predates other early dinosaurs by about 12 million years the type specimen nhmuk r6856 is a partial skeleton belonging to an individual estimated to have been two to three metres in length it consists of a right humerus three partial sacral vertebrae and three presacral vertebrae a second specimen sam pk k10654 consisting of three cervical vertebrae and two posterior presacral vertebrae is also known it was attributed to the same species as nhmuk r6856 because the dorsal or back vertebrae of the two specimens are nearly identical however the vertebral features that link nhmuk r6856 and sam pk k10654 including a connection between two bony projections called the hyposphene and hypantrum are also found in other triassic archosaurs since these characteristics are not unique to the two species they do not by themselves

one may switch the order of integration if the double integral yields a finite answer when the integrand is replaced by its absolute value as a consequence it allows the order of integrations to be changed in iterated integrals fubini s theorem implies that two iterated integrals are equal to the corresponding double integral across its integrands tonelli s theorem introduced by leonida tonelli in 1909 is similar but applies to a non negative measurable function rather than integrable over its domain the special case of fubini s theorem for continuous functions on a product of closed bounded subsets of real vector spaces was known to euler in the 18th century extended this to bounded measurable functions on a product of intervals conjectured that the theorem could be extended to functions that were integrable rather than bounded and this was proved by gave a variation of fubini s theorem that applies to non negative functions rather than integrable functions if x and y are measure spaces with measures there are several natural ways to define a product measure on their product the product x y of measure spaces in the sense of category theory has as its measurable sets the

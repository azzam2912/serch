particular instances of double negation translation include glivenko s translation for propositional logic and the g del gentzen translation and kuroda s translation for first order logic the easiest double negation translation to describe comes from glivenko s theorem proved by valery glivenko in 1929 it maps each classical formula to its double negation glivenko s theorem states glivenko s theorem implies the more general statement in particular a set of propositional formulas is intuitionistically consistent if and only if it is classically satisfiable the g del gentzen translation named after kurt g del and gerhard gentzen associates with each formula in a first order language another formula which is defined inductively this translation has the property that is classically equivalent to the fundamental soundness theorem avigad and feferman 1998 p 342 buss 1998 p 66 states here t consists of the double negation translations of the formulas in t a sentence may not imply its negative translation in intuitionistic first order logic troelstra and van dalen 1988 ch 2 sec 3 give a description due to leivant of formulas that do imply their g del gentzen translation there are several alternative definitions of the negative translation they are all

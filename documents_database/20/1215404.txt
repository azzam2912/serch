orthoferrites have an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group pbnm and most are weakly ferromagnetic at the n el temperature formula 1 the subsystem of iron ions orders into a slightly canted antiferromagnetic structure with antiferromagnetic moment g and a weak ferromagnetic moment f the rare earth ion subsystem acquires magnetization m due to an interaction with the iron subsystem the orthoferrites are particularly interesting because of the presence of an antisymmetric exchange interaction which involves the vector cross product of neighboring spins as opposed to the usual scalar product in the absence of this interaction the orthoferrites would be antiferromagnetic its presence leads to a small canting of the sublattices making the orthoferrites weak ferromagnets with formula 2 another interesting feature of these materials is the fact that some of them exhibit a transition as a function of temperature in which the direction of the antiferromagnetically ordered spins and consequently also of the net magnetization rotates by 90 the combination of high magnetic resonance frequencies with very large magnetooptical effects makes the orthoferrites interesting objects for study of laser induced dynamics orthoferrites are transparent and can modify the polarisation of a beam of light under the control of

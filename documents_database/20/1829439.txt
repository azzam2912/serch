modules can be deployed with heads of between 3 and 5 meters and maximum flow rates of 0 5 m s to generate up to 10 kw of energy the steffturbine has been developed by walter reist holding ag and is marketed as a complete system with generator and control electronics included the steffturbine is driven by the potential energy of the water it operates like an overshot water wheel it comprises a conveyor chain equipped with profiled paddles circulating around two wheels these wheels are arranged so that the flowing water drives the conveyor chain on an inclined plane different turbine inclinations are possible water is fed to the steffturbine through an inlet channel the inflow of water loads the paddles the power thus exerted onto the paddles causes the chain which is mounted to run on roller bearings to move in turn the circulating chain imparts a rotational motion to the drive wheels a generator is connected to the rotating drive wheels via an overdrive transmission the generator converts the rotational mechanical power into an electrical output the resultant electrical power is modulated by means of the electronic control system and adapted to the different operating modes the

at up to and weighing up to it is among the larger bony fishes southern bluefin tuna like other pelagic tuna species are part of a group of bony fishes that can maintain their body core temperature up to above the ambient temperature this advantage enables them to maintain high metabolic output for predation and migrating large distances the southern bluefin tuna is an opportunistic feeder preying on a wide variety of fish crustaceans cephalopods salps and other marine animals the southern bluefin tuna is a predatory organism with a high metabolic need these are pelagic animals but migrate vertically through the water column up to in depth they also migrate between tropical and cool temperate waters in the search for food the seasonal migrations are between waters off the coast of australia and the indian ocean although the preferred temperature range for southern bluefin tuna is from they can endure temperatures as low as at low depths and as high as when spawning this wide range of temperature and depth changes poses a challenge to the respiratory and circulatory systems of the southern bluefin tunas tunas swim continuously and at high speeds and therefore have a high demand for

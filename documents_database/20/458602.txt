the predicted double beta decay of gd has never been observed only a lower limit on its half life of more than 1 3 10 years has been set experimentally thirty radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being alpha decaying gd naturally occurring with a half life of 1 08 10 years and gd with a half life of 1 79 10 years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives less than 74 7 years the majority of these have half lives less than 24 6 seconds gadolinium isotopes have 10 metastable isomers with the most stable being gd t 110 seconds gd t 85 seconds and gd t 24 5 seconds the primary decay mode at atomic weights lower than the most abundant stable isotope gd is electron capture and the primary mode at higher atomic weights is beta decay the primary decay products for isotopes lighter than gd are isotopes of europium and the primary products of heavier isotopes are isotopes of terbium gadolinium 153 has a half life of 240 4 10 days and emits gamma radiation with strong peaks at 41 kev and 102 kev it is used as a gamma ray

it does not include particulate matter from other common sources such as vehicle exhaust or smokestacks fugitive dust particles are mainly minerals common to soil including silicon oxides aluminium calcium and iron about half of fugitive dust particles are larger than 10 microns in diameter and settle more quickly than the smaller particles the term is used to denote that the dust escapes into the atmosphere rather than being exhausted in a confined flow stream from a ducted emitter an exhaust pipe or chimney the u s environmental protection agency estimated that fugitive dust was responsible for 92 of the pm 10 emissions in the united states in 1995 fugitive dust results from dry conditions where there is insufficient moisture content in the ground to hold the soil together particulate matter pm then enters the atmosphere through the action of wind vehicular movement or other activities areas with dry or desert climates especially when combined with high winds have more severe problems of fugitive dust dry and disturbed surfaces can release wind borne fugitive dust for many months before there is sufficient rainfall to coagulate the soil surfaces susceptible to fugitive dust emissions are both natural and man made specific

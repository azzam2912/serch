by measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams a crystallographer can produce a three dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal from this electron density the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined as well as their chemical bonds their crystallographic disorder and various other information since many materials can form crystals such as salts metals minerals semiconductors as well as various inorganic organic and biological molecules x ray crystallography has been fundamental in the development of many scientific fields in its first decades of use this method determined the size of atoms the lengths and types of chemical bonds and the atomic scale differences among various materials especially minerals and alloys the method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules including vitamins drugs proteins and nucleic acids such as dna x ray crystallography is still the primary method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments x ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material shed light on chemical interactions and processes or serve as the basis for designing pharmaceuticals

blue ribbon panels generally have a degree of independence from political influence or other authority and such panels usually have no direct authority of their own their value comes from their ability to use their expertise to issue findings or recommendations which can then be used by those with decision making power to act a blue ribbon panel is often appointed by a government body or executive to report on a matter of controversy it might be composed of independent scientific experts or academics with no direct government ties to study a particular issue or question or it might be composed of citizens well known for their general intelligence experience and non partisan interests to study a matter of political reform the blue ribbon aspect comes from the presentation of the panel as the best and brightest for the task and the appointment of such a panel ad hoc is meant to signal its perspective as outsiders of the usual process for study and decisions the designation blue ribbon is often made by the appointing authority and may be disputed by others who might see the panel as less independent or as a way for an authority to dodge responsibility

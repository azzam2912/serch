fastar automatically reroutes circuits over a spare protection capacity when a fiber optic cable failure is detected hence increasing service availability and reducing the impact of the outages in the network similar in operation is real time restoration rtr developed and deployed by mci and used in the mci network to minimize the effects of a fiber cut it is a recovery technique used in computer networks and telecommunication networks such as mesh optical networks where the backup path the alternate path that affected traffic takes after a failure condition and backup channel are computed in real time after the occurrence of a failure this technique can be broadly classified into two centralized restoration and distributed restoration this technique utilizes a central controller which has access to complete up to date and accurate information about the network the available resources resources utilized the physical topology of the network the service demands etc when failure is detected in any part of the network through some failure detection identification and notification scheme the central controller calculates a new re route path around the failure based on the information in its database about the current state of the network after this new route

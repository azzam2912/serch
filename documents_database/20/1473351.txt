this occurs via the deposition of hemosiderin in neuronal tissue and is associated with neuronal loss gliosis and demyelination of neuronal cells this disease was first discovered in 1908 by r c hamill after performing an autopsy detection of this disease was largely post mortem until the advent of mri technology which made diagnosis far easier superficial siderosis is largely considered a rare disease with less than 270 total reported cases in scientific literature as of 2006 and affects people of a wide range of ages with men being approximately three times more frequently affected than women the number of reported cases of superficial siderosis has increased with advances in mri technology but it remains a rare disease superficial siderosis is characterized by many symptoms resulting from brain damage the most commonly described underlying cause of superficial siderosis is chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space of the brain which releases erythrocytes or blood cells into the cerebrospinal fluid the chronic bleeding can come from many sources such as from an arteriovenous malformation or cavernous malformation myxopapillary ependymoma of the spinal cord from chronic subdural hematoma from a ventricular shunt or from chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage chronic bleeding sources can also be

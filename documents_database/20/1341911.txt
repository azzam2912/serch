these tumors are typically a benign meaning they can grow but rarely transform into a malignancy even so local growth can affect adjacent tissues patients who have malignant gliomas of the optic nerve have rapidly progressive painful visual loss accompanied by signs of an optic neuropathy initial visual loss may be unilateral or bilateral chiasmal involvement but rapid progression to bilateral blindness and death are constant features depending on the initial location of the tumor visual loss may be accompanied by exophthalmos extraocular motility optic nerve melanocytoma does not usually produce symptoms or grow if they slowly grow optic nerve melanocytoma can produce afferent pupillary defects 30 subretinal fluid 10 and an enlarged blind spot 75 on fundoscopic exam the optic disc may be swollen atrophic or even normal central retinal vein occlusion may occur if the tumor is next to the optic nerve growth can compress the nerve and cause gradual loss of vision and unilateral proptosis dyschromatopsia may occur growth can also cause compressive vascular problems like central retinal vein occlusion lastly growth also causes the tumor to exceed its blood supply in these cases necrotic areas form inside the tumor necrosis can in turn cause intraocular and

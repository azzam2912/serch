it is very similar electrically to the octal base ef37a and the rimlock base ef40 unlike many pentodes it was designed specifically for audio applications low noise and low microphony being claimed advantages although a rubber mounted vibration resistant base was still recommended it has much higher stage gain than any triode which makes it susceptible to microphony the ef86 was used in many preamplifier designs during the last decades of vacuum tube hi fi development an industrial variant of the tube is known as 6267 in the former soviet union a variant was also produced as type 6zh32p russian 6 32 ef86s were being produced in russia in two versions under the electro harmonix brand and in the slovak republic as jj electronic formerly tesla 6 3 volt 200 ma indirectly heated a f miniature pentode with noval b9a base with an eia 9cq or 9bj basing diagram special precautions have been taken in the design to reduce the ef86 is much less noisy than other pentodes but slightly noisier than some triodes at about 2 v equivalent input noise to 10 khz although used in circuits such as tape recorder input stages and instrument amplifiers microphony can be

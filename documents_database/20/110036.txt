the concept of deconvolution is widely used in the techniques of signal processing and image processing because these techniques are in turn widely used in many scientific and engineering disciplines deconvolution finds many applications in general the objective of deconvolution is to find the solution of a convolution equation of the form usually h is some recorded signal and f is some signal that we wish to recover but has been convolved with some other signal g before we recorded it the function g might represent the transfer function of an instrument or a driving force that was applied to a physical system if we know g or at least know the form of g then we can perform deterministic deconvolution however if we do not know g in advance then we need to estimate it this is most often done using methods of statistical estimation in physical measurements the situation is usually closer to in this case is noise that has entered our recorded signal if we assume that a noisy signal or image is noiseless when we try to make a statistical estimate of g our estimate will be incorrect in turn our estimate of will also be

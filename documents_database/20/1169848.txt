single molecule real time sequencing utilizes a zero mode waveguide zmw a single dna polymerase enzyme is affixed at the bottom of a zmw with a single molecule of dna as a template the zmw is a structure that creates an illuminated observation volume that is small enough to observe only a single nucleotide of dna being incorporated by dna polymerase each of the four dna bases is attached to one of four different fluorescent dyes when a nucleotide is incorporated by the dna polymerase the fluorescent tag is cleaved off and diffuses out of the observation area of the zmw where its fluorescence is no longer observable a detector detects the fluorescent signal of the nucleotide incorporation and the base call is made according to the corresponding fluorescence of the dye the dna sequencing is done on a chip that contains many zmws inside each zmw a single active dna polymerase with a single molecule of single stranded dna template is immobilized to the bottom through which light can penetrate and create a visualization chamber that allows monitoring of the activity of the dna polymerase at a single molecule level the signal from a phospho linked nucleotide incorporated by

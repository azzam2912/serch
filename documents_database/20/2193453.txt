the primary is an extremely rare star on the wo oxygen sequence and the secondary a massive class o star wr 30a was discovered in a photographic survey in the constellation carina using the curtis schmidt telescope at the cerro tololo inter american observatory it was listed as ms4 out of nine new discoveries classified only as wr wr 30a was entered into the sixth catalogue of galactic wr stars at the last minute with the designation wr 29a and a spectral class of wr abs a review of wolf rayet stars in 1984 reported that wr 30a had a right ascension greater than wr 30 and should correctly be numbered 30a rather than 29a the name was corrected in the seventh edition of the catalogue still in 1984 wr 30a was studied spectroscopically and assigned a wc4 class another 1984 study noted dilution of some emission lines and suggested the presence of a binary companion of approximate spectral type o4 the wo spectral classification had already been defined but neither paper considered wr 30a to show sufficiently high excitation lines or strong oxygen lines to merit that classification a wo spectral class was eventually assigned with relatively weak o

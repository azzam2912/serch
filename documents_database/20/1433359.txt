children are much more infectious than adults and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until two weeks after infection the transmission of influenza can be modeled mathematically which helps predict how the virus will spread in a population influenza can be spread in three main ways the relative importance of these three modes of transmission is unclear and they may all contribute to the spread of the virus in the airborne route the droplets that are small enough for people to inhale are 0 5 to 5 m in diameter and inhaling just one droplet might be enough to cause an infection although a single sneeze releases up to 40 000 droplets most of these droplets are quite large and will quickly settle out of the air how long influenza survives in airborne droplets seems to be influenced by the levels of humidity and uv radiation with low humidity and a lack of sunlight in winter probably aiding its survival as the influenza virus can persist outside of the body it can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces such as banknotes doorknobs light switches and other household items the length of time the virus will persist on a

the data generated by fmrs usually shows spectra of resonances instead of a brain image as with mri the area under peaks in the spectrum represents relative concentrations of metabolites fmrs is based on the same principles as in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs however while conventional mrs records a single spectrum of metabolites from a region of interest a key interest of fmrs is to detect multiple spectra and study metabolite concentration dynamics during brain function therefore it is sometimes referred to as dynamic mrs event related mrs or time resolved mrs a novel variant of fmrs is functional diffusion weighted spectroscopy fdws which measures diffusion properties of brain metabolites upon brain activation unlike in vivo mrs which is intensively used in clinical settings fmrs is used primarily as a research tool both in a clinical context for example to study metabolite dynamics in patients suffering from epilepsy migraine and dyslexia and to study healthy brains fmrs can be used to study metabolism dynamics also in other parts of the body for example in muscles and heart however brain studies have been far more popular the main goals of fmrs studies are to contribute to the understanding of energy

assume that the plane is parametrised by polar coordinates the integer broom contains the origin and the points such that n is a non negative integer and the image on the right gives an illustration for and geometrically the space consists of a series of convergent sequences for a fixed n we have a sequence of points lying on circle with centre 0 0 and radius n that converges to the point n 0 we define a topology on x by means of a product topology the integer broom space is given by the polar coordinates let us write for simplicity the integer broom topology on x is the product topology induced by giving u the right order topology and v the subspace topology from r the integer broom space together with the integer broom topology is a compact topological space it is a so called kolmogorov space but it is neither a fr chet space nor a hausdorff space the space is path connected while neither locally connected nor arc connected

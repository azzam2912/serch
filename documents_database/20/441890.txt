these frogs are endemic to the islands of madagascar and mayotte the family mantellidae is composed of three extremely ecologically diverse groups of frogs divided into three subfamilies the mantellinae are typically terrestrial or semi aquatic frogs the laliostominae are terrestrial typically fairly large sized frogs and the boophinae are arboreal tree frogs apart from the genera assigned to the three subfamilies the placement of tsingymantis is still uncertain as of the 3rd of may 2016 212 species are recognized in this family dna barcoding research has shown however that more than 100 distinct genetic lineages remain taxonomically undescribed the mantellidae are madagascar s most diverse frog family it has been shown that there is a negative correlation between body size and species diversity in this family which is probably related to the lower dispersal potential of smaller animals this family is estimated to have colonized the island of madagascar 76 87 million years ago they are phylogenetically nested within asian frogs and therefore probably represent a dispersal event from asia two undescribed species of mantellid frogs are currently resident on the island of mayotte off madagascar s west coast these species belong to two genera that are otherwise exclusively

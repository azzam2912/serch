the invariants are rather complicated when written as polynomials in the coefficients of the ternary cubic and are given explicitly in the ring of covariants is given as follows the identity covariant u of a ternary cubic has degree 1 and order 3 the hessian h is a covariant of ternary cubics of degree 3 and order 3 there is a covariant g of ternary cubics of degree 8 and order 6 that vanishes on points x lying on the salmon conic of the polar of x with respect to the curve and its hessian curve the brioschi covariant j is the jacobian of u g and h of degree 12 order 9 the algebra of covariants of a ternary cubic is generated over the ring of invariants by u g h and j with a relation that the square of j is a polynomial in the other generators the clebsch transfer of the discriminant of a binary cubic is a contravariant f of ternary cubics of degree 4 and class 6 giving the dual cubic of a cubic curve the cayleyan p of a ternary cubic is a contravariant of degree 3 and class 3 the quippian q of

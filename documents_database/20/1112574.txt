more specifically it belongs to the family of the aminoacyl trna synthetases these latter enzymes link amino acids to their cognate transfer rnas trna in aminoacylation reactions that establish the connection between a specific amino acid and a nucleotide triplet anticodon embedded in the trna therefore they are the enzymes that translate the genetic code in vivo the 20 enzymes corresponding to the 20 natural amino acids are divided into two classes of 10 enzymes each this division is defined by the unique architectures associated with the catalytic domains and by signature sequences specific to each class as of late 2007 34 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes with pdb accession codes and the tyrosyl trna synthetases yars are either homodimers or monomers with a pseudo dimeric structure each subunit or pseudo subunit comprises an n terminal domain which has i about 230 amino acid residues ii the mononucleotide binding fold also known as rossmann fold of the class i aminoacyl trna synthetases iii an idiosynchratic insertion between the two halves of the fold known as connective peptide 1 or cp1 iv the two signature sequences high and kmsks of the class i aminoacyl trna synthetases the

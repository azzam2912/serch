equivalent over every completion of the field which may be real complex or p adic a related result is that a quadratic space over a number field is isotropic if and only if it is isotropic locally everywhere or equivalently that a quadratic form over a number field nontrivially represents zero if and only if this holds for all completions of the field the theorem was proved in the case of the field of rational numbers by hermann minkowski and generalized to number fields by helmut hasse the same statement holds even more generally for all global fields the importance of the hasse minkowski theorem lies in the novel paradigm it presented for answering arithmetical questions in order to determine whether an equation of a certain type has a solution in rational numbers it is sufficient to test whether it has solutions over complete fields of real and p adic numbers where analytic considerations such as newton s method and its p adic analogue hensel s lemma apply this is encapsulated in the idea of a local global principle which is one of the most fundamental techniques in arithmetic geometry the hasse minkowski theorem reduces the problem of classifying quadratic

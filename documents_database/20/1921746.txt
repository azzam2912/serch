h conway and r k guy in their 1995 book the book of numbers by definition the hyperharmonic numbers satisfy the recurrence relation in place of the recurrences there is a more effective formula to calculate these numbers the hyperharmonic numbers have a strong relation to combinatorics of permutations the generalization of the identity reads as where formula 9 is an r stirling number of the first kind the above expression with binomial coefficients easily gives that for all fixed order r 2 we have that is the quotient of the left and right hand side tends to 1 as n tends to infinity an immediate consequence is that when m r the generating function of the hyperharmonic numbers is the exponential generating function is much more harder to deduce one has that for all r 1 2 where f is a hypergeometric function the r 1 case for the harmonic numbers is a classical result the general one was proved in 2009 by i mez and a dil the next relation connects the hyperharmonic numbers to the hurwitz zeta function it is known that the harmonic numbers are never integers except the case n 1 the same question can

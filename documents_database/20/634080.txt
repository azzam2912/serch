a number of aridity indices have been proposed see below these indicators serve to identify locate or delimit regions that suffer from a deficit of available water a condition that can severely affect the effective use of the land for such activities as agriculture or stock farming at the turn of the 20th century wladimir k ppen and rudolf geiger developed the concept of a climate classification where arid regions were defined as those places where the annual rainfall accumulation in centimetres is less than formula 1 where where formula 5 is the mean annual temperature in celsius this was one of the first attempts at defining an aridity index one that reflects the effects of the thermal regime and the amount and distribution of precipitation in determining the native vegetation possible in an area it recognizes the significance of temperature in allowing colder places such as northern canada to be seen as humid with the same level of precipitation as some tropical deserts because of lower levels of potential evapotranspiration in colder places in the subtropics the allowance for the distribution of rainfall between warm and cold seasons recognizes that winter rainfall is more effective for plant growth that

there are two types type 1 which is a pentapeptide and type 2 with six amino acids they are regarded as a type of beta bulge and have the alternative name of type g1 beta bulge compared to other beta bulges beta bulge loops give rise to chain reversal such that they often occur at the loop ends of beta hairpins hairpins of this sort can be described as 3 5 for a type 1 bulge loop or 4 6 for type 2 two websites are available for finding and examining bulge loops in proteins motivated proteins and pdbemotif type i beta bulge loops have two characteristic inter main chain hydrogen bonds one is between the co of residue i and the nh of residue i 3 a turn the other is between the co of residue i 4 and the nh of residue i type 2 beta bulge loops have two characteristic inter main chain hydrogen bonds one is between the co of residue i and the nh of residue i 4 an turn the other is between the co of residue i 5 and the nh of residue i beta bulge loops often have an aspartate asparagine serine

this region is important for the regulation of translation of a transcript by differing mechanisms in viruses prokaryotes and eukaryotes while called untranslated the 5 utr or a portion of it is sometimes translated into a protein product this product can then regulate the translation of the main coding sequence of the mrna in many organisms however the 5 utr is completely untranslated instead forming complex secondary structure to regulate translation the 5 utr has been found to interact with proteins relating to metabolism and proteins translate sequences within the 5 utr in addition this region has been involved in transcription regulation such as the sex lethal gene in drosophila regulatory elements within 5 utrs have also been linked to mrna export the 5 utr begins at the transcription start site and ends one nucleotide nt before the initiation sequence usually aug of the coding region in prokaryotes the length of the 5 utr tends to be 3 10 nucleotides long while in eukaryotes it tends to be anywhere from 100 to several thousand nucleotides long for example the ste11 transcript in schizosaccharomyces pombe has a 2273 nucleotide 5 utr while the lac operon in escherichia coli only has 7

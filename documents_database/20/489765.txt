unlike a four stroke engine whose crankcase is closed except for its ventilation system a two stroke engine uses the crankcase as part of the induction tract and therefore oil must be mixed with gasoline to be distributed throughout the engine for lubrication the resultant mix is referred to as premix or petroil this oil is ultimately burned along with the fuel as a total loss oiling system this results in increased exhaust emissions sometimes with excess smoke and or a distinctive odor the oil base stock can be petroleum castor oil semi synthetic or synthetic oil and is mixed or metered by injection with petrol gasoline at a volumetric fuel to oil ratio ranging from 16 1 to as low as 100 1 to avoid the high emissions and oily deposits on spark plugs modern two strokes especially for small engines such as garden equipment and chainsaws may now demand a synthetic oil and can suffer from oiling problems otherwise engine original equipment manufacturers oems introduced pre injection systems sometimes known as auto lube to engines to operate from a 32 1 to 100 1 ratio oils must meet or exceed the following typical specifications tc w3tm nmma api

the planet was discovered in april 2001 and is the third planet in order of increasing distance from its star at the time of discovery gliese 876 was already known to host an extrasolar planet designated gliese 876 b on january 9 2001 it was announced that further analysis of the star s radial velocity had revealed the existence of a second planet in the system which was designated gliese 876 c the orbital period of gliese 876 c was found to be exactly half that of the outer planet which meant that the radial velocity signature of the second planet was initially interpreted as a higher eccentricity of the orbit of gliese 876 b gliese 876 c is in a 1 2 4 laplace resonance with the outer planets gliese 876 b and gliese 876 e for every orbit of planet e planet b completes two orbits and planet c completes four this leads to strong gravitational interactions between the planets causing the orbital elements to change rapidly as the orbits precess this is the second known example of a laplace resonance the first being jupiter s moons io europa and ganymede the orbital semimajor axis is only 0

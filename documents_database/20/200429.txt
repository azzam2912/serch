it is a ca atpase that transfers ca from the cytosol of the cell to the lumen of the sr at the expense of atp hydrolysis during muscle relaxation there are 3 major domains on the cytoplasmic face of serca the phosphorylation and nucleotide binding domains which form the catalytic site and the actuator domain which is involved in the transmission of major conformational changes it seems that in addition to the calcium transporting properties serca1 generates heat in some adipocytes and can improve cold tolerance in some wood frogs the rate at which serca moves ca across the sr membrane can be controlled by the regulatory protein phospholamban plb pln serca is not as active when plb is bound to it increased adrenergic stimulation reduces the association between serca and plb by the phosphorylation of plb by pka when plb is associated with serca the rate of ca movement is reduced upon dissociation of plb ca movement increases another protein calsequestrin binds calcium within the sr and helps to reduce the concentration of free calcium within the sr which assists serca so that it does not have to pump against such a high concentration gradient the sr has a

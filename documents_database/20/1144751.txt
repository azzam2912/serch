capz functions to cap actin filaments at barbed ends in muscle and other tissues capz can exist as 3 unique subunits dependent on alternative splicing mechanisms capz 1 is 31 4 kda and 277 amino acids in length capz 2 is 30 6 kda and 272 amino acids in length and capz 3 is 301 amino acids in length n terminal extension of 29 amino acids relative to the 2 subunit in contrast the 3 subunits arise from distinct genes capz is a heterodimer composed of an and subunit in muscle capping protein 1 subunit and 1 subunit are localized at the z disc and form capz capz interacts with actinin nebulette nebulin hsc70 at the z disc capzb is a member of the f actin capping protein family this gene encodes the beta subunit of the barbed end actin binding protein the protein regulates growth of the actin filament by capping the barbed end of growing actin filaments capz functions to cap actin filaments at barbed ends thus controlling the rate of g actin polymerization to f actin and corresponding filament length capz works in concert with tropomodulin which caps actin at pointed ends in muscle the interaction of

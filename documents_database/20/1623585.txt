in these instances the general equations for biochemical isotope kinetics gebik and the general equations for biochemical isotope fractionation gebif can be used the gebik and gebif equations are the most generalized approach to describe isotopic effects in any chemical catalytic reaction and biochemical reactions because they can describe isotopic effects in equilibrium reactions kinetic chemical reactions and kinetic biochemical reactions in the latter two cases they can describe both stationary and non stationary fractionation i e variable and inverse fractionation in general isotopic effects depend on the number of reactants and on the number of combinations resulting from the number of substitutions in all reactants and products describing with accuracy isotopic effects however depends also on the specific rate law used to describe the chemical or biochemical reaction that produces isotopic effects normally regardless of whether a reaction is purely chemical or whether it involves some enzyme of biological nature the equations used to describe isotopic effects base on first order kinetics this approach systematically leads to isotopic effects that can be described by means of the rayleigh equation in this case isotopic effects will always be expressed as a constant hence will not be able to describe isotopic

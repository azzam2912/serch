the yarns are then dyed the bindings may then be altered to create a new pattern and the yarns dyed again with another colour this process may be repeated multiple times to produce elaborate multicolored patterns when the dyeing is finished all the bindings are removed and the yarns are woven into cloth in other resist dyeing techniques such as tie dye and batik the resist is applied to the woven cloth whereas in ikat the resist is applied to the yarns before they are woven into cloth because the surface design is created in the yarns rather than on the finished cloth in ikat both fabric faces are patterned a characteristic of ikat textiles is an apparent blurriness to the design the blurriness is a result of the extreme difficulty the weaver has lining up the dyed yarns so that the pattern comes out perfectly in the finished cloth the blurriness can be reduced by using finer yarns or by the skill of the craftsperson ikats with little blurriness multiple colours and complicated patterns are more difficult to create and therefore often more expensive however the blurriness that is so characteristic of ikat is often prized by textile collectors

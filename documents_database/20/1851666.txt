it is a type v antifreeze protein with a molecular weight of 12 8 kda this type of afp is noted for its hyperactivity r inquisitor is a freeze avoidant species meaning that due to its afp r inquisitor prevents its body fluids from freezing altogether this contrasts with freeze tolerant species whose afps simply depress levels of ice crystal formation in low temperatures whereas most insect antifreeze proteins contain cysteines at least every sixth residue as well as varying numbers of 12 or 13 mer repeats of 8 3 12 5kda riafp is notable for containing only one disulfide bridge this property of riafp makes it particularly attractive for recombinant expression and biotechnological applications afps work through an interaction with small ice crystals that is similar to an enzyme ligand binding mechanism which inhibits recrystallization of ice this explanation of the interruption of the ice crystal structure by the afp has come to be known as the adsorption inhibition hypothesis according to this hypothesis afps disrupt the thermodynamically favourable growth of an ice crystal via kinetic inhibition of contact between solid ice and liquid water in this manner the nucleation sites of the ice crystal lattice are blocked by

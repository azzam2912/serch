it is classified as a luminous blue variable and is one of the most luminous stars in the lmc r71 has long been known as a blue supergiant and one of the brightest stars in the magellanic clouds it was given a spectral type of b2 5 iep by 1974 r71 had increased in brightness from about 11th magnitude to about magnitude 9 2 and examination of historical photographic plates showed that there had been similar changes in the past with the brightness peaking around 1914 and 1939 the increases in visual magnitude were accompanied by reddening apparent cooling of the star such outbursts of 1 1 5 magnitudes from blue supergiants accompanied by cooling of several thousand kelvin such that the bolometric luminosity remained approximately constant were considered characteristic of a class of variables then known as s doradus variables now called luminous blue variables the outburst of r71 lasted from about 1971 until 1977 and it then faded back to about 11th magnitude records are incomplete but a new outburst was observed to begin in 2006 with the brightness increasing beyond any previous observations to magnitude 8 7 the temperature also cooled to record levels around 6 650

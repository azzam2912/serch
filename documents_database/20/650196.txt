in fact for these two variants of sat schaefer s dichotomy theorem shows that their monotone versions where negations of variables are not allowed are also np complete schaefer defines a decision problem that he calls the generalized satisfiability problem for s denoted by sat s where formula 1 is a finite set of relations over propositional variables an instance of the problem is an s formula i e a conjunction of constraints of the form formula 2 where formula 3 and the formula 4 are propositional variables the problem is to determine whether the given formula is satisfiable in other words if the variables can be assigned values such that they satisfy all the constraints as given by the relations from s schaefer identifies six classes of sets of boolean relations for which sat s is in p and proves that all other sets of relations generate an np complete problem a finite set of relations s over the boolean domain defines a polynomial time computable satisfiability problem if any one of the following conditions holds otherwise the problem sat s is np complete a modern streamlined presentation of schaefer s theorem is given in an expository paper by

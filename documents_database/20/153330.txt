a branch and bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root the algorithm explores branches of this tree which represent subsets of the solution set before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm the algorithm depends on efficient estimation of the lower and upper bounds of regions branches of the search space if no bounds are available the algorithm degenerates to an exhaustive search the method was first proposed by ailsa land and alison doig whilst carrying out research at the london school of economics sponsored by british petroleum in 1960 for discrete programming and has become the most commonly used tool for solving np hard optimization problems the name branch and bound first occurred in the work of little et al on the traveling salesman problem the goal of a branch and bound algorithm is to find

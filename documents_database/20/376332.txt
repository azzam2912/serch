food chains are often far shorter on land usually limited to being secondary consumers for example wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores primary consumers which eat plants primary producers the apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management conservation and ecotourism apex predators have a long evolutionary history dating at least to the cambrian period when animals such as anomalocaris dominated the seas humans have for many centuries interacted with apex predators including the wolf birds of prey and cormorants to hunt game animals birds and fish respectively more recently humans have started interacting with apex predators in new ways these include interactions via ecotourism such as with the tiger shark and through rewilding efforts such as the proposed reintroduction of the lynx apex predators affect prey species population dynamics and populations of other predators both in aquatic and in terrestrial ecosystems non native predatory fish for instance have sometimes devastated formerly dominant predators a lake manipulation study found that when the non native smallmouth bass was removed lake trout the suppressed native apex predator diversified its prey selection and increased its trophic level as a terrestrial example the badger an apex predator predates on and also competes with the

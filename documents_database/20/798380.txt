1 after an axialsymmetric compression test initially the sample was cylindrical in shape and since symmetry was tried to be preserved during the test the cylindrical shape was maintained for a while during the test and the deformation was homogeneous but at extreme loading two x shaped shear bands had formed and the subsequent deformation was strongly localized see also the sketch on the right of fig 1 although not observable in brittle materials for instance glass at room temperature shear bands or more generally localized deformations usually develop within a broad range of ductile materials alloys metals granular materials plastics polymers and soils and even in quasi brittle materials concrete ice rock and some ceramics the relevance of the shear banding phenomena is that they precede failure since extreme deformations occurring within shear bands lead to intense damage and fracture therefore the formation of shear bands is the key to the understanding of failure in ductile materials a research topic of great importance for the design of new materials and for the exploiting of existing materials in extreme conditions as a consequence localization of deformation has been the focus of an intense research activity since the middle of the

it is a polyatomic anion with the chemical formula bicarbonate serves a crucial biochemical role in the physiological ph buffering system the term bicarbonate was coined in 1814 by the english chemist william hyde wollaston the prefix bi in bicarbonate comes from an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is twice as much carbonate per sodium ion in sodium bicarbonate nahco and other bicarbonates than in sodium carbonate naco and other carbonates the name lives on as a trivial name according to the wikipedia article iupac nomenclature of inorganic chemistry the prefix bi is a deprecated way of indicating the presence of a single hydrogen ion the recommended nomenclature today mandates explicit referencing of the presence of the single hydrogen ion sodium hydrogen carbonate or sodium hydrogencarbonate a parallel example is sodium bisulfite nahso the bicarbonate ion hydrogencarbonate ion is an anion with the empirical formula and a molecular mass of 61 01 daltons it consists of one central carbon atom surrounded by three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement with a hydrogen atom attached to one of the oxygens it is isoelectronic with nitric acid the bicarbonate ion carries a negative one formal

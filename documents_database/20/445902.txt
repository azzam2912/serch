this technique has been researched since the late 1920s and has been shown to direct the formation of both axonic and dendritic processes in cell culture it is only possible to direct outgrowth of in vitro preparations at this point in vitro preparations involve the use of a culture dish in which there is a species specific neuronal growth factor neurons are removed from a chosen animal plated onto the dish and allowed to grow often kept in incubation the application of an extracellular electric field shows that the cells will grow processes in a direction that demonstrates the direction of the applied electric field this could be either in the direction of the cathode or anode depending on the type of substrate the cells are plated onto the mechanism underlying this behavior is thought to involve the effect of the electric field on receptors and membrane proteins on the cell s surface these charged proteins would experience an electrophoretic force pulling them toward the oppositely charged pole of the electric field most of these membrane proteins are negatively charged but the growth when observed appears to be directed to the negative pole cathode this is a strange behavior that

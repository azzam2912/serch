cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii abbreviated coxii cox2 coii or mt co2 is the second subunit of cytochrome c oxidase the mt co2 gene is located on the p arm of mitochondrial dna at position 12 and it spans 683 base pairs the mt co2 gene produces a 25 6 kda protein composed of 227 amino acids mt co2 is a subunit of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase complex iv an oligomeric enzymatic complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain involved in the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen in eukaryotes this enzyme complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane in aerobic prokaryotes it is found in the plasma membrane the enzyme complex consists of 3 4 subunits prokaryotes to up to 13 polypeptides mammals the n terminal domain of cytochrome c oxidase contains two transmembrane alpha helices the structure of mt co2 is known to contain one redox center and a binuclear copper a center cua the cua is located in a conserved cysteine loop at 196 and 200 amino acid positions and conserved histidine at 204 several bacterial mt co2 have a c terminal extension that contains a covalently bound haem c the mt co2 gene

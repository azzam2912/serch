they are oxides of either nonmetals or of metals in high oxidation states their chemistry can be systematically understood by taking an oxoacid and removing water from it until only an oxide remains the resulting oxide belongs to this group of substances for example sulfurous acid so sulfuric acid so and carbonic acid co are acidic oxides an inorganic anhydride a somewhat archaic term is an acid anhydride without an organic moiety acidic oxides are not br nsted lowry acids because they do not donate protons however they are arrhenius acids because they increase the hydrogen ion concentration of water for instance carbon dioxide increases the hydrogen ion concentration of rain water ph 5 6 by a factor of 25 compared to pure water ph 7 they are also lewis acids because they accept electron pairs from some lewis bases most notably base anhydrides the oxides of period three elements demonstrate periodicity with respect to acidity as one moves across the period the oxides become more acidic sodium and magnesium oxides are alkaline aluminium oxides are amphoteric reacting both as a base or acid silicon phosphorus sulfur and chlorine oxides are acidic some non metal oxides such as nitrous oxide

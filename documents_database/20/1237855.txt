the gravitational force of a nearby space vehicle though minuscule is able to alter the trajectory of a much larger asteroid if the vehicle spends enough time close to it all that is required is that the vehicle thrust in a consistent direction relative to the asteroid s trajectory and that neither the vehicle nor its expelled reaction mass come in direct contact with the asteroid the tractor spacecraft could either hover near the object being deflected or orbit it directing its exhaust perpendicular to the plane of the orbit the concept has two key advantages namely that essentially nothing needs to be known about the mechanical composition and structure of the asteroid in advance and that the relatively small amounts of force used enable extremely precise manipulation and determination of the asteroid s orbit around the sun whereas other methods of deflection would require the determination of the asteroid s exact center of mass and considerable effort might be necessary to halt its spin or rotation by using the tractor method these considerations are irrelevant a number of considerations arise concerning means for avoiding a devastating collision with an asteroidal object should one be discovered on a trajectory that

nevertheless some of their equations are difficult to solve directly such as partial differential equations with numerical models geologists can use methods such as finite difference methods to approximate the solutions of these equations numerical experiments can then be performed in these models yielding the results that can be interpreted in the context of geological process both qualitative and quantitative understanding of a variety of geological processes can be developed via these experiments numerical modelling has been used to assist in the study of rock mechanics thermal history of rocks movements of tectonic plates and the earth s mantle flow of fluids is simulated using numerical methods and this shows how ground water moves or how motions of the molten outer core yields the geomagnetic field prior to the development of numerical modeling analog modeling which simulates nature with reduced scales in mass length and time was one of the major ways to tackle geological problems for instance to model the formation of thrust belts simple analytic or semi analytic mathematical models were also used to deal with relatively simple geological problems quantitatively in the late 1960s to 1970s following the development of finite element methods in solving continuum mechanics

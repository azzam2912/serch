it is unique to natural areas called peatlands bogs mires moors or muskegs the peatland ecosystem is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet because peatland plants capture co naturally released from the peat maintaining an equilibrium in natural peatlands the annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition but it takes thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of which is the average depth of the boreal northern peatlands sphagnum moss also called peat moss is one of the most common components in peat although many other plants can contribute the biological features of sphagnum mosses act to create a habitat aiding peat formation a phenomenon termed habitat manipulation soils consisting primarily of peat are known as histosols peat forms in wetland conditions where flooding or stagnant water obstructs the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere slowing the rate of decomposition peatlands particularly bogs are the primary source of peat although less common wetlands including fens pocosins and peat swamp forests also deposit peat landscapes covered in peat are home to specific kinds of plants including sphagnum moss ericaceous shrubs and sedges see bog for more information on this aspect of peat

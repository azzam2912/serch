the cytochrome p450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol steroids fatty acids and other lipids this protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum the enzyme starts the process of inactivating and degrading leukotriene b4 a potent mediator of inflammation this gene is part of a cluster of cytochrome p450 genes on chromosome 19 another member of this family cyp4f11 is approximately 16 kb away cyp4f2 along with cyp4a22 cyp4a11 and cyp4f3 and cyp2u1 also metabolize arachidonic acid to 20 hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid 20 hete by an omega oxidation reaction with the predominant 20 hete synthesizing enzymes in humans being cyp4f2 followed by cyp4a11 20 hete regulates blood flow vascularization blood pressure and kidney tubule absorption of ions in rodents and possibly humans gene polymorphism variants of cyp4f2 are associated with the development of hypertension cerebral infarction i e ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction in humans see 20 hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid for details members of the cyp4a and cyp4f sub families may also hydroxylate and thereby reduce the activity of various fatty acid metabolites of arachidonic acid including ltb4 5 hete 5 oxo eicosatetraenoic acid 12 hete and several prostaglandins that are involved in regulating

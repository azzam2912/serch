deficient sleep both in the form of sleep deprivation and restriction adversely impacts emotion generation emotion regulation and emotional expression scientists offer two explanations for the effects of sleep loss on emotions one explanation is that sleep loss causes disinhibition of emotional brain regions leading to an overall increase in emotional intensity also referred to as dysregulation model the other explanation describes how sleep loss causes an increase in fatigue and sleepiness coupled with an overall decrease in energy and arousal leading to an overall decrease in emotional intensity also referred to as fatigue model the dysregulation model is supported by neuroanatomical physiological and subjective self report studies emotional brain regions e g the amygdala have shown 60 greater reactivity to emotionally negative photographs following one night of sleep deprivation as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging five days of sleep restriction four hour sleep opportunity per night caused a decrease in connectivity with cortical brain regions involved in the regulation of the amygdala pupil diameter was shown to increase significantly in response to negative photographs following sleep deprivation when exposed to positive stimuli sleep deprived participants showed amplified emotional reactivity throughout various midbrain striatal limbic and visual processing brain

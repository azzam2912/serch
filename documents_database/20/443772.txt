both comic and cartoon deal with the everyday and secret lives of urban animals although they take very different approaches to it and while the characters are largely the same in both versions the stories and situations are very different the comic debuted in 1981 billy starts out as a normal human schoolboy who delights in mean spirited pranks and often bullies animals however early in the first comic album he is killed when he carelessly runs out in the street and is hit by a car in the afterlife he is told that he has done so many misdeeds in his life that his chances of getting into heaven are slim but he can get a second chance thus he is sent back to earth now in the form of a young cat but still able to remember his former life as a human boy the comic follows billy as he struggles to deal with life as a cat making many new friends and a few enemies among the many animals he meets most importantly mr hubert a kind hearted but blustery white alley cat who lives in a cadillac in the junkyard and who takes it upon himself

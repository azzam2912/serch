if formula 5 then formula 6 is the index set of formula 4 in general formula 6 is an index set if for every formula 9 with formula 10 i e they index the same function we have formula 11 intuitively these are the sets of natural numbers that we describe only with reference to the functions they index most index sets are incomputable non recursive aside from two trivial exceptions this is stated in rice s theorem let formula 12 be a class of partial recursive functions with index set formula 13 then formula 13 is recursive if and only if formula 13 is empty or formula 13 is all of formula 17 where formula 17 is the set of natural numbers including zero rice s theorem says any nontrivial property of partial recursive functions is undecidable

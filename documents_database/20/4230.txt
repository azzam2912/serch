many communication channels are subject to channel noise and thus errors may be introduced during transmission from the source to a receiver error detection techniques allow detecting such errors while error correction enables reconstruction of the original data in many cases error detection is the detection of errors caused by noise or other impairments during transmission from the transmitter to the receiver error correction is the detection of errors and reconstruction of the original error free data the modern development of error correction codes is credited to richard hamming in 1947 a description of hamming s code appeared in claude shannon s a mathematical theory of communication and was quickly generalized by marcel j e golay all error detection and correction schemes add some redundancy i e some extra data to a message which receivers can use to check consistency of the delivered message and to recover data that has been determined to be corrupted error detection and correction schemes can be either systematic or non systematic in a systematic scheme the transmitter sends the original data and attaches a fixed number of check bits or parity data which are derived from the data bits by some deterministic algorithm if

they represent a well distinct lineage of terror birds differing from the massive large groups and the smaller psilopterinae in general proportions they most resembled the patagornithinae which flourished somewhat earlier mainly to the south of the range of mesembriornis fossils of the terror bird have been found in montehermosan deposits of the monte hermoso formation in argentina two species are nowadays accepted mesembriornis incertus and mesembriornis milneedwardsi however this was recently disputed by an author who claimed mesembriornis to be a nomen nudum renamed the genus hermosiornis and proposed a new taxonomic systematics for the family mesembriornis lived on the pampa of eastern argentina from the late miocene to the late pliocene roughly 5 3 to 4 million years ago together with the north american giant titanis walleri it was among the last terror birds alive a study called terror birds on the run measured how fast ancient terror birds could run it was found that a terror bird s average top speed was and this is not heavily disputed however the speed of mesembriornis is now heavily debated this is probably because the method of calculation was not as accurate as other mathematical methods these methods are impossible

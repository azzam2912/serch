at the time research was primarily focused on single layer photovoltaic pv devices between two electrodes in which pv properties rely heavily on the nature of the electrodes in addition single layer pv devices notoriously have a poor fill factor this property is largely attributed to resistance that is characteristic of the organic layer the fundamentals of pc afm are modifications to traditional afm and focus on the use of pc afm in pv characterization in pc afm the major modifications include a second illumination laser an inverted microscope and a neutral density filter these components assist in the precise alignment of the illumination laser and the afm tip within the sample such modifications must complement the existing principals and instrumental modules of pc afm so as to minimize the effect of mechanical noise and other interferences on the cantilever and sample the original exploration of the pv effect can be accredited to research published by henri becquerel in 1839 becquerel noticed the generation of a photocurrent after illumination when he submerged platinum electrodes within an aqueous solution of either silver chloride or silver bromide in the early 20th century pochettino and volmer studied the first organic compound anthracene in

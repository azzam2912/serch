the term is rather uncommon for hepta coordinate compounds of iron it has to be distinguished from the terms hypervalent and hypercoordinate as high valent iron compounds neither necessarily violate the 18 electron rule nor necessarily show coordination numbers 6 the ferrate vi ion feo was the first structure in this class synthesized the synthetic compounds discussed below contain highly oxidized iron in general as the concepts are closely related oxoferryl species are commonly proposed as intermediates in catalytic cycles especially biological systems in which o activation is required diatomic oxygen has a high reduction potential e 1 23 v but the first step required to harness this potential is a thermodynamically unfavorable one electron reduction e 0 16 v this reduction occurs in nature by the formation of a superoxide complex in which a reduced metal is oxidized by o the product of this reaction is a peroxide radical that is more readily reactive the abundance of these species in nature and the chemistry that is available to them are the reasons why the study of these compounds is important a widely applicable method for the generation of high valent oxoferryl species is the oxidation with iodosobenzene several syntheses

this experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light in young s own judgement this was the most important of his many achievements during this period many scientists proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observations including robert hooke christiaan huygens and leonhard euler however isaac newton who did many experimental investigations of light had rejected the wave theory of light and developed his corpuscular theory of light according to which light is emitted from a luminous body in the form of tiny particles this theory held sway until the beginning of the nineteenth century despite the fact that many phenomena including diffraction effects at edges or in narrow apertures colours in thin films and insect wings and the apparent failure of light particles to crash into one another when two light beams crossed could not be adequately explained by the corpuscular theory which nonetheless had many eminent supporters including pierre simon laplace and jean baptiste biot while studying medicine at g ttingen in the 1790s young wrote a thesis on the physical and mathematical properties of sound and in 1800 he presented a paper to the royal society written in

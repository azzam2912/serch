berg s theory was both mutationist involving mutation in place of selection and orthogenetic involving direction early studies of directed mutation were performed by german geneticists richard goldschmidt claimed to have produced evidence for directed mutation in 1929 in his experiments on drosophila fruit flies exposed to elevated temperatures viktor jollos 1887 1941 in the 1930s had also carried out experiments on drosophila and written that his results had confirmed goldschmidt s work which was evidence for directed mutation in contrast to natural selection however later american geneticists were unable to replicate these experiments and the concepts fell out of favour compared to the standard darwinian mechanism of randomly occurring mutations directed mutagenesis was re proposed in 1988 by john cairns who was studying escherichia coli that lacked the ability to metabolize lactose he grew these bacteria in media in which lactose was the only source of energy in doing so he found that the rate at which the bacteria evolved the ability to metabolize lactose was many orders of magnitude higher than would be expected if the mutations were truly random this inspired him to propose that the mutations that had occurred had been directed at those genes involved

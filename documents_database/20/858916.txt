it was designed in the 1930s by attilio franco and dr piero crosti the main difference between it and conventional feedwater heaters widely used on the continent is that the franco crosti boiler uses both exhaust steam and exhaust gases from the firebox conventional feedwater heaters only use exhaust steam the franco crosti boiler is a modification of the conventional fire tube boiler design used on most steam locomotives unlike conventional boilers the heat remaining in the exhaust gases is used to preheat the water supply for the main boiler using a secondary heat exchange mechanism this mechanism known as the feedwater heater is essentially a secondary boiler the preheated feedwater is fed at full boiler pressure into the main boiler via clack valves the feedwater heater is not designed to produce steam instead raising the temperature of the feedwater this allows the heater to utilize the remaining energy in the exhaust gases effectively the typical configuration of a franco crosti boiler had a relatively conventional main boiler with one or two secondary feedwater heaters running parallel to the boiler barrel where the loading gauge did not allow the feedwater heater to be placed beside the boiler it was mounted

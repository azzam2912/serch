a natural process by which this channel can occur is a spin chain through which a number of spin states coupled by a time independent hamiltonian can be used to send a quantum state from one location to another the resulting quantum channel ends up being identical to an amplitude damping channel for which the quantum capacity the classical capacity and the entanglement assisted classical capacity of the quantum channel can be evaluated the amplitude damping channel models energy relaxation from an excited state to the ground state on a two dimensional system or qubit with decay probability formula 1 the channel s action on a density matrix formula 2 is given by where formula 4 are the kraus operators given by thus the main construct of the quantum channel based on spin chain correlations is to have a collection of n coupled spins at either side of the quantum channel there are two groups of spins and we refer to these as quantum registers a and b a message is sent by having the sender of the message encode some information on register a and then after letting it propagate over some time t having the receiver later retrieve

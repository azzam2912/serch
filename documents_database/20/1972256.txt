it may be composed of fine hydrophilic hypha which branches frequently to explore and exploit the soil matrix or may aggregate to form rhizomorphs highly differentiated hydrophobic enduring transport structures apart from mycorrhizas extramatrical mycelium is the primary vegetative body of ectomycorrhizal fungi it is the location of mineral acquisition enzyme production and a key means of colonizing new root tips extramatrical mycelium facilitates the movement of carbon into the rhizosphere moves carbon and nutrients between hosts and is an important food source for invertebrates the mycelial growth pattern extent of biomass accumulation and the presence or absence of rhizomorphs are used to classify fungi by exploration type agerer first proposed the designation of exploration types in 2001 and the concept has since been widely employed in studies of ectomycorrhizal ecology four exploration types are commonly recognized contact short distance medium distance and long distance contact exploration types possess a predominantly smooth mantle and lack rhizomorphs with ectomycorrhizas in close contact with the surrounding substrate short distance exploration types also lack rhizomorphs but the mantle is surrounded by frequent projections of hyphae which emanate a short distance into the surrounding substrate most ectomycorrhizal ascomycetes are included in this group medium

the term was introduced by l a borradaile who described it as one of the many attempts of nature to evolve a crab carcinisation is believed to have occurred independently in at least five groups of decapod crustaceans most notably king crabs which most scientists believe evolved from hermit crab ancestors the other examples are the family porcellanidae or porcelain crabs which are closely related to squat lobsters the hairy stone crab lomis hirta the coconut crab birgus latro and true crabs the example of king crabs family lithodidae evolving from hermit crabs has been particularly well studied and although some doubt this theory there is considerable evidence in its favour for example most hermit crabs are asymmetrical so that they fit well into spiral snail shells the abdomens of king crabs even though they do not use snail shells for shelter are also asymmetrical an exceptional form of carcinisation termed hypercarcinisation is seen in the porcelain crab allopetrolisthes spinifrons in addition to the shortened body form a spinifrons also shows similar sexual dimorphism to that seen in true crabs where males have a shorter pleon than females

depending on the context different exact definitions of this idea are in use a vector field f r r is called coercive if where formula 2 denotes the usual dot product and formula 3 denotes the usual euclidean norm of the vector x a coercive vector field is in particular norm coercive since formula 4 for formula 5 by cauchy schwarz inequality however a norm coercive mapping f r r is not necessarily a coercive vector field for instance the rotation f r r f x x x by 90 is a norm coercive mapping which fails to be a coercive vector field since formula 6 for every formula 7 a self adjoint operator formula 8 where formula 9 is a real hilbert space is called coercive if there exists a constant formula 10 such that for all formula 12 in formula 13 a bilinear form formula 14 is called coercive if there exists a constant formula 10 such that for all formula 12 in formula 13 it follows from the riesz representation theorem that any symmetric defined as formula 19 for all formula 20 in formula 9 continuous formula 22 for all formula 20 in formula 9 and some

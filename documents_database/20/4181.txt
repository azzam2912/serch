in a system enclosed so as to prevent mass transfer for processes at constant pressure the heat absorbed or released equals the change in enthalpy the unit of measurement for enthalpy in the international system of units si is the joule other historical conventional units still in use include the british thermal unit btu and the calorie enthalpy comprises a system s internal energy which is the energy required to create the system plus the amount of work required to make room for it by displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure enthalpy is defined as a state function that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the system s internal energy pressure and volume it is an extensive quantity change in enthalpy h is the preferred expression of system energy change in many chemical biological and physical measurements at constant pressure because it simplifies the description of energy transfer in a system enclosed so as to prevent matter transfer at constant pressure the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heat transfer or work other than expansion work the total enthalpy h of a system cannot be measured directly the same situation

a well cemented sandstone of nearly pure quartz in the 19th century it was widely used in construction and in refractory linings for iron furnaces the potsdam sandstone is named for its type locality in potsdam new york where in 1838 ebenezer emmons described it in outcrops along the raquette river the potsdam sandstone lies unconformably on a surface of precambrian metamorphic rock it is the earliest unit in the marine transgressive sedimentary rock sequence deposited during the early paleozoic as sea level rose to gradually inundate the craton of the paleocontinent of laurentia the rock which is formed from sediments eroded off unvegetated terrestrial landscapes and deposited in near shore coastal environments consists almost entirely of sand size quartz grains held together by quartz cement it ranges in color from gray to tan yellow and red with the colors imparted by small amounts of the red iron oxide mineral hematite feo and the yellow iron oxide mineral goethite feo oh as sea level rose in the depositional environment increasing amounts of carbonate minerals were deposited in the sediment with the result that the unit grades upward into dolomitic sandstone in the upper potsdam and then to sandy dolomite at

volume of fluid flowing v rv where in long pipes the loss in pressure assuming the pipe is level is proportional to the length of pipe involved friction loss is then the change in pressure p per unit length of pipe l when the pressure is expressed in terms of the equivalent height of a column of that fluid as is common with water the friction loss is expressed as s the head loss per length of pipe a dimensionless quantity also known as the hydraulic slope where friction loss which is due to the shear stress between the pipe surface and the fluid flowing within depends on the conditions of flow and the physical properties of the system these conditions can be encapsulated into a dimensionless number re known as the reynolds number where v is the mean fluid velocity and d the diameter of the cylindrical pipe in this expression the properties of the fluid itself are reduced to the kinematic viscosity where the friction loss in a uniform straight sections of pipe known as major loss is caused by the effects of viscosity the movement of fluid molecules against each other or against the possibly rough wall

electronic components mounted on an insulating board are interconnected by lengths of insulated wire run between their terminals with the connections made by wrapping several turns of uninsulated sections of the wire around a component lead or a socket pin wires can be wrapped by hand or by machine and can be hand modified afterwards it was popular for large scale manufacturing in the 1960s and early 1970s and continues today to be used for short runs and prototypes the method eliminates the design and fabrication of a printed circuit board wire wrapping is unusual among other prototyping technologies since it allows for complex assemblies to be produced by automated equipment but then easily repaired or modified by hand wire wrap construction can produce assemblies which are more reliable than printed circuits connections are less prone to fail due to vibration or physical stresses on the base board and the lack of solder precludes soldering faults such as corrosion cold joints and dry joints the connections themselves are firmer and have lower electrical resistance due to cold welding of the wire to the terminal post at the corners wire wrap was used for assembly of high frequency prototypes and small

viewshed analyses are a common function of most geographic information system gis software the analysis uses the elevation value of each cell of the digital elevation model dem to determine visibility to or from a particular cell the location of this particular cell varies depending on the needs of the analysis for example a viewshed analysis is commonly used to locate communication towers or determining the view from a road viewsheds can be calculated using an individual point such as a tower or multiple points such as a line representing a road when analyzing a line segment each of the vertices along the line is calculated to determine its visible area the process can also be reversed for example when locating a landfill the analysis can determine from where the landfill is visible to keep it hidden from view a viewshed analysis can be performed using one of many gis programs such as arcgis pro grass gis r los r viewshed qgis viewshed plugin luciadlightspeed luciadmobile saga gis visibility tnt mips arcmap maptitude erdas imagine a viewshed is created from a dem by using an algorithm that estimates the difference of elevation from one cell the viewpoint cell to the

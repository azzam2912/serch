above the main sequence the vast majority of stars in the instability strip are variable where the instability strip intersects the main sequence the vast majority of stars are stable but there are some variables including the roap stars stars in the instability strip pulsate due to he iii doubly ionized helium in normal a f g stars he is neutral in the stellar photosphere deeper below the photosphere at about 25 000 30 000k begins the he ii layer first he ionization second ionization he iii starts at about 35 000 50 000k when the star contracts the density and temperature of the he ii layer increases he ii starts to transform into he iii second ionization this causes the opacity of the star to increase and the energy flux from the interior of the star is effectively absorbed the temperature of the star rises and it begins to expand after expansion he iii begins to recombine into he ii and the opacity of the star drops this lowers the surface temperature of the star the outer layers contract and the cycle starts from the beginning the phase shift between a star s radial pulsations and brightness variations depends

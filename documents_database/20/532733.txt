the mii connects media access control mac devices with ethernet physical layer phy circuits the mac device controlling the mdio is called the station management entity sme mii has two signal interfaces the mdio interface is implemented by two signals the bus only supports a single mac as the master and can have up to 32 phy slaves the mdc can be periodic with a minimum period of 400 ns which corresponds to a maximum frequency of 2 5 mhz newer chips however allow faster accesses the mdio requires a specific pull up resistor of 1 5 k to 10 k taking into account the total worst case leakage current of 32 phys and one mac before a register access phy devices generally require a preamble of 32 ones to be sent by the mac on the mdio line the access consists of 16 control bits followed by 16 data bits the control bits consist of 2 start bits 2 access type bits read or write the phy address 5 bits the register address 5 bits and 2 turnaround bits during a write command the mac provides address and data for a read command the phy takes over the mdio

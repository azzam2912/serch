air masses cover many hundreds or thousands of miles and adapt to the characteristics of the surface below them they are classified according to latitude and their continental or maritime source regions colder air masses are termed polar or arctic while warmer air masses are deemed tropical continental and superior air masses are dry while maritime and monsoon air masses are moist weather fronts separate air masses with different density temperature and or moisture characteristics once an air mass moves away from its source region underlying vegetation and water bodies can quickly modify its character classification schemes tackle an air mass characteristics as well as modification the bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification though others have produced more refined versions of this scheme over different regions of the globe air mass classification involves three letters the first letter describes its moisture properties with c used for continental air masses dry and m for maritime air masses moist its source region t for tropical p for polar a for arctic or antarctic m for monsoon e for equatorial and s for superior air an adiabatically drying and warming air formed by significant downward motion in

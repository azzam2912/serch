plasma filaments extend from the inner electrode to the outer glass insulator giving the appearance of multiple constant beams of colored light see corona discharge and electric glow discharge plasma globes were most popular as novelty items in the 1980s the plasma lamp was invented by nikola tesla during his experimentation with high frequency currents in an evacuated glass tube for the purpose of studying high voltage phenomena tesla called his invention an inert gas discharge tube the modern plasma lamp design was subsequently developed by bill parker a student at mit although many variations exist a plasma lamp is usually a clear glass sphere filled with a mixture of various gases most commonly neon sometimes with other noble gases such as argon xenon and krypton at nearly atmospheric pressure a crackle tube is a related device filled with phosphor coated beads plasma lamps are driven by high frequency approximately alternating current at the drive circuit is essentially a specialized power inverter in which current from a lower voltage dc supply powers a high frequency electronic oscillator circuit whose output is stepped up by a high frequency high voltage transformer the radio frequency energy from the transformer is transmitted into

first patented by carl a vossberg jr us2807976a refractometer us2549402a these refractometers typically consist of a sensor placed inline with the fluid flow coupled to a control box the control box usually provides a digital readout as well as 4 20 ma analog outputs and relay outputs for controlling pumps and valves instead of placing the sensor inline of the process it can be placed in a bypass attached by a thin tube this measurement has been an important element in the process control of the chemical and refining pulp and paper food sugar and pharmaceutical industries for more than a century for instance the in line concentration measurement can be used as a real time predictive tool for the final concentration a quick and accurate response is needed to optimize production cost reduction is possible by reducing the variation of mean average of the product concentration the cost saving is related to the value of the component being measured a digital inline process refractometer sensor measures the refractive index and the temperature of the processing medium the measurement is based on the refraction of light in the process medium i e the critical angle of refraction using a light

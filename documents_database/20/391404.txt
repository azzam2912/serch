saliva of the blood sucking bug rhodnius prolixus contains at least seven homologous nitrophorins designated np1 to np7 in order of their relative abundance in the glands as isolated nitrophorins contain nitric oxide no ligated to the ferric heme iron fe histamine which is released by the host in response to tissue damage is another nitrophorin ligand nitrophorins transport no to the feeding site dilution binding of histamine and increase in ph from ph 5 in salivary gland to ph 7 4 in the host tissue facilitate the release of no into the tissue where it induces vasodilatation the salivary nitrophorin from the hemipteran cimex lectularius bedbug has no sequence similarity to rhodnius prolixus nitrophorins but is homologous to the inositol polyphosphate 5 phosphatase it is suggested that the two classes of insect nitrophorins have arisen as a product of the convergent evolution the crystal structures of several nitrophorin complexes are known the rhodnius prolixus nitrophorin structures reveal lipocalin like eight stranded barrel three helices and two disulfide bonds with heme inserted into one end of the barrel members of the lipocalin family are known to bind a variety of small hydrophobic ligands including biliverdin in a similar fashion the

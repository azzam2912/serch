trees transfer water and sap from the roots to the leaves through their vascular cells but in some trees as autumn begins the veins carrying the sap slowly close until a layer of cells called the abscission layer completely closes off the vein allowing the tree to rid itself of the leaf leaf marcescence is most often seen on juvenile plants and may disappear as the tree matures it also may not affect the entire tree sometimes leaves persist only on scattered branches marcescence is most obvious in deciduous trees that retain leaves through the winter several trees normally have marcescent leaves such as oak quercus beech fagus and hornbeam carpinus or marcescent stipules as in some but not all species of willows salix all oak trees may display foliage marcescence even species that are known to fully drop leaves when the tree is mature marcescent leaves of pin oak quercus palustris complete development of their abscission layer in the spring the base of the petiole remains alive over the winter many other trees may have marcescent leaves in seasons where an early freeze kills the leaves before the abscission layer develops or completes development diseases or pests can also

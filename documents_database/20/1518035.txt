it has a rotation period of 4 26 seconds and a slow down rate which implies it has a dipole magnetic field strength higher than all other rrats in fact its magnetic field is stronger than the quantum critical limit its pulses are the brightest of all the rrats and of the original 11 sources it has the highest burst rate the pulsar has three emission phases in one period and most intense pulses are from the middle phase many pulses are observed double peaked which are mostly in the middle emission phase the pulse intensity distribution is reported similar to some normal pulsars and giant pulse pulsars suggesting similar emission mechanisms x ray extended emission around rrat j1819 1458 is found which can be interpreted with a nebula somehow powered by the pulsar there is a possible candidate counterpart for rrat j1819 1458 it has been observed at x ray wavelengths in observations using the chandra and xmm newton x ray telescopes where an x ray spectrum typical of thermal emission from a cooling neutron was observed modulation of the x ray light at the 4 26 second rotation period is also observed indicating that there are hot spots

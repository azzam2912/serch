there is a closely related theorem classifying the irreducible representations of a connected compact lie group formula 2 the theorem states that there is a bijection from the set of dominant integral elements to the set of equivalence classes of irreducible representations of formula 1 or formula 2 the difference between the two results is in the precise notion of integral in the definition of a dominant integral element if formula 2 is simply connected this distinction disappears let formula 7 be a finite dimensional semisimple complex lie algebra with cartan subalgebra formula 8 let formula 9 be the associated root system we then say that an element formula 10 is integral if is an integer for each root formula 12 next we choose a set formula 13 of positive roots and we say that an element formula 10 is dominant if formula 15 for all formula 16 an element formula 10 dominant integral if it is both dominant and integral finally if formula 18 and formula 19 are in formula 20 we say that formula 18 is higher than formula 19 if formula 23 is expressible as a linear combination of positive roots with non negative real coefficients a

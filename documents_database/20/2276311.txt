the modern formulation of the problems and the solutions is due to fulton and macpherson to be precise they develops the intersection theory by a way of solving the problems of residual intersections namely by the use of the segre class of a normal cone to an intersection a generalization to a situation where the assumption on regular embedding is weakened is due to the formula in the topological setting is due to now suppose we are given y y and suppose i x x y y is regular of codimension d so that one can define i as before let f be the excess bundle of i and i that is it is the pullback to x of the quotient of n by the normal bundle of i let e f be the euler class top chern class of f which we view as a homomorphism from a x to a x then where i is determined by the morphism y y y finally it is possible to generalize the above construction and formula to complete intersection morphisms this extension is discussed in 6 6 as well as ch 17 of loc cit proof one can deduce the intersection

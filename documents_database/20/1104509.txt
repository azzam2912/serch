ppargc1a is also known as human accelerated region 20 har20 it may therefore have played a key role in differentiating humans from apes pgc 1 is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis pgc 1 is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates the genes involved in energy metabolism it is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis this protein interacts with the nuclear receptor ppar which permits the interaction of this protein with multiple transcription factors this protein can interact with and regulate the activities of camp response element binding protein creb and nuclear respiratory factors nrfs it provides a direct link between external physiological stimuli and the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and is a major factor causing slow twitch rather than fast twitch muscle fiber types endurance exercise has been shown to activate the pgc 1 gene in human skeletal muscle exercise induced pgc 1 in skeletal muscle increases autophagy and unfolded protein response pgc 1 protein may be also involved in controlling blood pressure regulating cellular cholesterol homoeostasis and the development of obesity pgc 1 is thought to be a master integrator of external signals it is known to be activated by a host of factors including pgc 1 has been

indeed since there are only 4 independent fields because of the pauli principle all the quartic local interactions are equivalent and all higher power local interactions vanish interactions containing derivatives such as formula 5 are not considered because they are non renormalizable the correlation functions of the thirring model massive or massless verify the osterwalder schrader axioms and hence the theory makes sense as a quantum field theory the massless thirring model is exactly solvable in the sense that a formula for the formula 6 points field correlation is known after it was introduced by walter thirring many authors tried to solve the massless case with confusing outcomes the correct formula for the two and four point correlation was finally found by k johnson then c r hagen and b klaiber extended the explicit solution to any multipoint correlation function of the fields the mass spectrum of the model and the scattering matrix was explicitly evaluated by bethe ansatz an explicit formula for the correlations is not known j i cirac p maraner and j k pachos applied the massive thirring model to the description of optical lattices in one space dimension and one time dimension the model can be

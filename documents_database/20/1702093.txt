the classical example is salcomine the complex with divalent cobalt usually denoted as co salen the metal free salen compound hsalen or salenh has two phenolic hydroxyl groups the salen ligand is usually its conjugate base salen resulting from the loss of protons from those hydroxyl groups the metal atom usually makes four coordination bonds to the oxygen and nitrogen atoms the salen anion forms complexes with most transition metals these complexes are usually prepared by the reaction of hsalen pro ligand with metal precursors containing built in bases such as alkoxides metal amides or metal acetate the pro ligand may also be treated with a metal halide with or without an added base lastly the pro ligand may be deprotonated by a non nucleophilic base e g sodium hydride before treatment with the metal halide for example jacobsen s catalyst is prepared from the salen ligand precursor with manganese acetate salen complexes with d metal ions such as ni salen typically have a low spin square planar molecular geometry in the coordination sphere other metal salen complexes may have additional ligands above the salen nitrogen oxygen plane complexes with one extra ligand such as vo salen may have a

inspired by the elgin marbles and intended by the artist to provide a moral lesson on the beauty of mercy it shows a near nude warrior whose sword has broken forced to his knees in front of another near nude soldier who prepares to inflict a killing blow a woman also near nude clutches the victorious warrior to beg him for mercy very unusually for a history painting of the period the combat does not depict a scene from history literature or religion and is not based on an existing artwork but is instead a scene from the artist s own imagination when it was shown at the royal academy summer exhibition of 1825 it attracted near universal praise from critics for its technical excellence its fusion of the styles of different schools of painting and its subject matter nevertheless it failed to find a buyer at the summer exhibition and was instead bought by fellow artist john martin the painting proved too large for martin s house and in 1831 he sold it on to the royal scottish academy it was transferred in 1910 to the national gallery of scotland where it remains william etty was born in 1787

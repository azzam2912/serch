commonly encountered pre packaged desiccants are solids that absorb water desiccants for specialized purposes may be in forms other than solid and may work through other principles such as chemical bonding of water molecules they are commonly encountered in foods to retain crispness industrially desiccants are widely used to control the level of water in gas streams although some desiccants are chemically inert others are extremely reactive and require specialized handling techniques the most common desiccant is silica an otherwise inert nontoxic water insoluble white solid tens of thousands of tons are produced annually for this purpose other common desiccants include activated charcoal calcium sulfate calcium chloride and molecular sieves typically zeolites desiccants may also be categorized by their type either i ii iii iv or v these types are a function of the shape of the desiccant s moisture sorption isotherm alcohols and acetones are also dehydrating agents one measure of desiccant efficiency is the ratio or percentage of water storable in the desiccant relative to the mass of desiccant another measure is the residual relative humidity of the air or other fluid being dried the performance of any desiccant varies with temperature and both relative humidity and absolute

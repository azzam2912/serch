the mechanism of the reaction was proposed in its original disclosure by a g brook with further evidence later supplied by george m rubottom after a prilezhaev type oxidation of the silyl enol ether with the peroxyacid to form the siloxy oxirane intermediate acid catalyzed ring opening yields an oxocarbenium ion this intermediate then participates in a 1 4 silyl migration brook rearrangement to give an siloxy carbonyl derivative that can be readily converted to the hydroxy carbonyl compound in the presence of acid base or a fluoride source in 1974 three independent groups reported on the reaction now known as the rubottom oxidation a g brook a hassner and g m rubottom considerable precedent for the reaction already existed for instance it was known as early as the 1930s that highly enolizable dicarbonyl compounds would react with peroxyacids although it was not until the 1950s and 60s hydroxy dicarbonyl compounds were in fact the product considerable work by a g brook during the 1950s on the mechanisms of organosilicon migrations which are now known as brook rearrangements in 1974 c h heathcock described the ozonolysis of silyl enol ethers to give a carboxylic acid product via oxidative cleavage where

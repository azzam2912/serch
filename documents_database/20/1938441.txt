the radiative properties of the ocean surface are exploited in order to estimate the salinity of the water s surface layer the depth of the water column that a satellite surface salinity measurement is sensitive to depends on the frequency or wavelength of the radiance that is being measured for instance the optical depth for seawater at the 1 413 ghz microwave frequency used for the aquarius mission is about 1 2 cm as with many passive remote sensing satellite products satellites measure surface salinity by initially taking radiance measurements emitted by the earth s atmosphere and ocean if the object emitting the measured radiance is considered to be a black body then the relationship between the object s temperature and the measured radiance can be related at a given frequency through the planck function or planck s law where formula 2 the intensity or brightness is the amount of energy emitted per unit surface per unit time per unit solid angle and in the frequency range between formula 3 and formula 4 formula 5 is the temperature of the black body formula 6 is planck s constant formula 3 is frequency formula 8 is the speed of light and

it was discovered in 1980 from photos taken by the voyager 1 probe and was provisionally designated in late 1985 it was officially named after pandora from greek mythology it is also designated as pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the f ring however recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role and that only prometheus the inner shepherd contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring it is more heavily cratered than nearby prometheus and has at least two large craters in diameter the majority of craters on pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris ridges and grooves are also present on moon s surface the orbit of pandora appears to be chaotic as a consequence of a series of four 118 121 mean motion resonances with prometheus the most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6 2 years when the periapsis of pandora lines up with the apoapsis of prometheus and the moons approach to within about pandora also has a 3 2 mean motion resonance with mimas from its very low density and relatively high albedo it seems likely that pandora is a very

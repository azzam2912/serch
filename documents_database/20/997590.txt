it is also known as the reductive acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa pathway this pathway enables these organisms to use hydrogen as an electron donor and carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor and as a building block for biosynthesis in this pathway carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide and formic acid or directly into a formyl group the formyl group is reduced to a methyl group and then combined with the carbon monoxide and coenzyme a to produce acetyl coa two specific enzymes participate on the carbon monoxide side of the pathway co dehydrogenase and acetyl coa synthase the former catalyzes the reduction of the co and the latter combines the resulting co with a methyl group to give acetyl coa some anaerobic bacteria and archaea use the wood ljungdahl pathway in reverse to break down acetate for example some methanogens break down acetate to a methyl group and carbon monoxide and then reduce the methyl group to methane while oxidizing the carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide when operating in the reverse direction the acetyl coa synthase is sometimes called acetyl coa decarbonylase the pathway occurs in bacteria and archaea e g methanogens and in acetate producing bacteria such

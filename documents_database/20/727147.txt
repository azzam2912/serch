like a yagi uda antenna yagi a quad consists of a driven element and one or more parasitic elements however in a quad each of these elements is a loop antenna which may be square round or some other shape it is used by radio amateurs on the hf and vhf amateur bands the quad antenna is a development of several inventions rigorous testing of the quad antenna show the following advantages over a yagi uda antenna it is easy to change polarization from vertical to horizontal it is easier to design a multiband quad antenna than a multiband yagi antenna the 2 element quad has almost the same gain as a 3 element yagi about 7 5 db over a dipole likewise a 3 element quad has more gain than a 3 element yagi however adding quad elements produces diminishing returns quoting from william orr whereas parasitic beams having twenty or thirty parasitic directors are efficient high gain antennas it would seem that maximum practical number of parasitic loop elements for the quad array is limited to four or five orr p 48 radiation resistance is affected by antenna height above ground element spacing and environmental conditions however values

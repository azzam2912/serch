it is the first selective relaxant binding agent srba sugammadex is used to reverse neuromuscular blockade after administration of the aminosterioid non depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents such as vecuronium or rocuronium sugammadex is a modified cyclodextrin with a lipophilic core and a hydrophilic periphery this gamma cyclodextrin has been modified from its natural state by placing eight carboxyl thio ether groups at the sixth carbon positions these extensions extend the cavity size allowing greater encapsulation of the rocuronium molecule these negatively charged extensions electrostatically bind to the quaternary nitrogen of the target as well as contribute to the aqueous nature of the cyclodextrin sugammadex s binding encapsulation of rocuronium is one of the strongest among cyclodextrins and their guest molecules the rocuronium molecule a modified steroid bound within sugammadex s lipophilic core is rendered unavailable to bind to the acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction sugammadex unlike neostigmine does not inhibit acetylcholinesterase so cholinergic effects are not produced and co administration of an antimuscarinic agent glycopyrronium bromide or atropine is not needed sugammadex might therefore be expected to have fewer adverse effects than the traditional reversal agents when muscle relaxant with rapid onset and short duration of action is required

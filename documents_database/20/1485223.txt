they are electronic navigation instruments that use a rotating antenna to sweep a narrow beam of microwaves around the water surface surrounding the ship to the horizon detecting targets by microwaves reflected from them generating a picture of the ship s surroundings on a display screen a radar has a flat antenna that spins emitting a signal then listening back for that signal the return signal bounces back at varying times based on what it may be bouncing off of radar is a vital component for safety at sea and near the shore captains need to be able to maneuver their ships within feet in the worst of conditions and to be able to navigate blind when there is no visibility at night or due to bad weather radars are rarely used alone in a marine setting in commercial ships they are integrated into a full system of marine instruments including chartplotters sonar two way marine radio satellite navigation gnss receivers such as the us global positioning system gps and emergency locators sart the integration of these devices is very important as it becomes quite distracting to look at several different screens therefore displays can often overlay charting radar sonar

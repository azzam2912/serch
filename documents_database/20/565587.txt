in the fem the structural system is modeled by a set of appropriate finite elements interconnected at discrete points called nodes elements may have physical properties such as thickness coefficient of thermal expansion density young s modulus shear modulus and poisson s ratio the origin of finite method can be traced to the matrix analysis of structures where the concept of a displacement or stiffness matrix approach was introduced finite element concepts were developed based on engineering methods in 1950s the finite element method obtained its real impetus in the 1960s and 1970s by john argyris and co workers at the university of stuttgart by ray w clough at the university of california berkeley by olgierd zienkiewicz and co workers ernest hinton bruce irons at the university of swansea by philippe g ciarlet at the university of paris at cornell university by richard gallagher and co workers the original works such as those by argyris and clough became the foundation for today s finite element structural analysis methods earlier books such as by zienkiewicz and more recent books such as by yang give comprehensive summary of developments in finite element structural analysis implementing the method in software is described in

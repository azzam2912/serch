the df 17 s hypersonic armament gives china significant leverage over current conventional abm s due to the glide vehicle s unpredictable ballistic trajectory the df 17 along with the df zf was officially unveiled at the china day military parade on october 1st 2019 making this china s first operational hypersonic weapon systems and one of the world s first to be put in full initial operation the df 17 uses the rocket booster from the already operational df 16b short range ballistic missile as such the design of the missile itself did not require any major changes the biggest change however is the obvious usage of a hypersonic glide vehicle rather than a conventional re entry warhead s found in normal ballistic missiles and mirvs the df zf hgv operates in a different matter than normal ballistic missiles or even intercontinental ballistic missiles in the first place rather than firing and landing in a normal arc the df 17 s hgv suppresses its trajectory and accelerates to reach mach 5 due to its extreme speed and suppressed lower altitude trajectory intercepting the glide vehicle becomes far more harder and complex than that of a conventional re entry vehicle

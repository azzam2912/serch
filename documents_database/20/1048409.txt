it acts by binding to and activating flt3 cd135 which is found on what in mice are called multipotent progenitor mpp and common lymphoid progenitor clp cells it also induces the mobilization of the hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells in vivo which may help the system to kill cancer cells flt3l is crucial for steady state plasmacytoid dendritic cell pdc and classical dendritic cell cdc development a lack of flt3l results in low levels of dendritic cells flt3l and its receptor are involved in the mammalian immune response to malaria in strains of plasmodium flt3l was shown to be released from mast cells and cause the expansion of dendritic cells leading to the activation of cd8 t cells the same paper suggested that flt3l release was caused by stimulation of mast cells with uric acid produced from a precursor secreted by the plasmodium parasite in situ vaccine isv combining flt3l local radiotherapy and a tlr3 agonist poly iclc could recruit antigen load and activate intratumoral cross presenting dendritic cells dcs in indolent non hodgkin s lymphomas inhls treatment clinical trial nct01976585 in this study intratumoral flt3l was able to 1 induce the accumulation of large numbers of tlr3 dcs in

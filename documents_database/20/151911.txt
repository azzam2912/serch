a small population has recently been established on faure island and it appears to have been successful it has also been reintroduced to wadderin sanctuary near narembeen in the central wheatbelt in 2013 the description of the species was published in the 1807 report of a french expedition to australia the authors zoologist fran ois p ron and illustrator charles lesueur described a specimen collected at bernier island during their visit to the region in 1801 naming the new species as kangurus faciatus evidence suggested that the mernine was the only living member of the sthenurine subfamily and a recent osteology based phylogeny of macropodids found that the banded hare wallaby was indeed a bastion of an ancient lineage agreeing with other molecular appraisals of the evolutionary history of l fasciatus however the authors analysis did not support the placement of the mernine within sthenurinae but suggest it belongs to a plesiomorphic clade which branched off from other macropodids in the early miocene and put forward the new subfamily lagostrophinae recent analysis of mtdna extracted from fossils of the sthenurine simosthenurus supports this conclusion this new subfamily includes the banded hare wallaby and the fossil genus troposodon the average banded

the earthquake occurred at 4 p m local time on april 2 1868 and caused a landslide and tsunami that led to 77 deaths the aftershock sequence for this event has continued up to the present day the island of hawaii commonly called the big island is the currently active volcanic center of the hawaiian islands formed over the hawaii hotspot the two active volcanoes on the big island are k lauea and mauna loa with a newer submarine volcano forming the loihi seamount to the southeast of the island continued growth of the southeastern part of the island is accompanied by major slumping and southeastward movement of the flanks of the two volcanoes this flank displacement is linked to extension within the rift zones associated with both of the active volcanoes the mauna loa and k lauea rifts from the interpretation of seismic reflection data it has been proposed that the southeastward displacement takes place on a decollement surface near the top of the oceanic crust the slumping is thought to affect only the upper part of the flank as the amount of shortening observed in the toe thrust zone is much larger than that observed in the extensional

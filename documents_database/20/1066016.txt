this falls in the realm of real time telemedicine applications by way of example a radiologist may guide an ultrasound examination from a remote location as such the proximate requisite expertise to accomplish a medical task is significantly diminished in the previous example a diagnostic quality ultrasound can be accomplished by non medically trained individuals manipulating an ultrasound device located with the patient under guidance from a remote location this is an example of teleradiology if appropriately configured the remote guidance can originate from another room or floor in the same building to as far away as another continent or even planet nasa researchers have successfully demonstrated remote guidance of diagnostic level cardiac ultrasonography using an ultrasound on the space station non medical astronauts performing the exam as guided by a terrestrially located expert remote diagnostics refers to a real time telemedical application which achieves diagnostic level quality and information exchange in this sense it refers to an expectation for quality sufficient for making or excluding a medical diagnosis in the tele medical context specific to radiologic images these images often are consistent with the dicom standard given bandwidth issues universally plaguing the healthcare environment imagery beyond still images and

it is defined to be the supremum of the set of projective dimensions of all a modules global dimension is an important technical notion in the dimension theory of noetherian rings by a theorem of jean pierre serre global dimension can be used to characterize within the class of commutative noetherian local rings those rings which are regular their global dimension coincides with the krull dimension whose definition is module theoretic when the ring a is noncommutative one initially has to consider two versions of this notion right global dimension that arises from consideration of the right a modules and left global dimension that arises from consideration of the left a modules for an arbitrary ring a the right and left global dimensions may differ however if a is a noetherian ring both of these dimensions turn out to be equal to weak global dimension whose definition is left right symmetric therefore for noncommutative noetherian rings these two versions coincide and one is justified in talking about the global dimension let a k x x be the ring of polynomials in n variables over a field k then the global dimension of a is equal to n this statement goes

it is a heterodimeric cytokine that is composed of two distinct genes epstein barr virus induced gene 3 ebi3 and il 27p28 il 27 is expressed by antigen presenting cells and interacts with a specific cell surface receptor complex known as il 27 receptor il 27r this receptor consists of two proteins il 27 and gp130 il 27 induces differentiation of the diverse populations of t cells in the immune system and also upregulates il 10 when il 27 binds to the il 27 receptor signaling pathways including jak stat and p38 mapk pathways are turned on there are two types of responses pro inflammatory and anti inflammatory which involve different types of cells such as macrophages dendritic cells t cells and b cells the response that is activated is very much dependent on the external surrounding of il 27 there are many different subsets of t cells such as th1 th2 th17 tr1 and treg cells il 27 is greatly involved in differentiation through inducing or suppressing of each t cell subset th1 cells which express ifn are promoted by il 27 through stat1 and t bet activation th2 cells which express il 4 are inhibited by il 27

infinite sets may be countable or uncountable some examples are the set of natural numbers whose existence is postulated by the axiom of infinity is infinite it is the only set that is directly required by the axioms to be infinite the existence of any other infinite set can be proved in zermelo fraenkel set theory zfc only by showing that it follows from the existence of the natural numbers a set is infinite if and only if for every natural number the set has a subset whose cardinality is that natural number if the axiom of choice holds then a set is infinite if and only if it includes a countable infinite subset if a set of sets is infinite or contains an infinite element then its union is infinite the power set of an infinite set is infinite any superset of an infinite set is infinite if an infinite set is partitioned into finitely many subsets then at least one of them must be infinite any set which can be mapped onto an infinite set is infinite the cartesian product of an infinite set and a nonempty set is infinite the cartesian product of an infinite number of

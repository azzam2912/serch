it was primarily developed in the early 1990s by dr amano atsushi historically during bypass surgeries the heart is stopped and a heart lung machine takes over the work of the heart and lungs when a cardiac surgeon chooses to perform the cabg procedure off pump also known as opcab off pump coronary artery bypass the heart is still beating while the graft attachments are made to bypass a blockage off pump coronary artery bypass was developed partly to avoid the complications of cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac surgery the medical community believes cardiopulmonary bypass causes a post operative cognitive decline known as postperfusion syndrome informally called pumphead but research has shown no long term difference between on and off pump coronary artery bypass in patients of lower risk this is probably because the pump is not the main cause of brain damage rather it is the embolic process described below sometimes the fatty type materials that collects to form a blockage or line on the walls of an artery may break loose during cabg procedure manipulation this debris can result in clots or emboli that may interrupt the flow of blood to the brain causing neurological damage or even stroke

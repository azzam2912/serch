a spike is technically an incomplete pass and therefore it has the effect of stopping the clock at the cost of exhausting a down a spike is performed when the offensive team is conducting a hurried drive near the end of the first half or of the game and the game clock is still running in the aftermath of the previous play as an incomplete pass the spike causes the referee to stop the game clock and the offensive team will have a chance to huddle and plan the next play without losing scarce game clock time a spike is not considered intentional grounding if it is done with the quarterback under center and immediately after the snap no penalty is assessed running a spike play presumes there will be at least one play by the same team immediately afterward so it would not be done on fourth down instead a regular play would have to be run without a huddle in the 1998 rose bowl ryan leaf spiked the ball and inadvertently ran the clock out on that play in the 2012 rose bowl russell wilson also ran the clock out on a spike ball play in both cases

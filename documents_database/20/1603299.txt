it is a solid known only as a thermally unstable insoluble white powder the systematic name cadmium dihydride a valid iupac name is constructed according to the compositional nomenclature cadmium dihydride is also used to refer to the related molecular compound dihydridocadmium and its oligomers care should be taken to avoid confusing the two compounds cadmium hydride is also used as a compositional iupac name for the compound with the chemical formula cdh in 1950 a research group led by glenn d barbaras synthesized cadmium hydride for the first time this reaction sequence consisted of demethylation of dimethylcadmium in diethyl ether at 78 c to cadmium hydride solid cadmium hydride on the basis of its infrared spectrum is believed to contain hydrogen bridge bonds other lower metal hydrides polymerize in a similar fashion unless cooled below cadmium hydride rapidly decomposes to produce cadmium and hydrogen dihydridocadmium is the monomeric molecular form with the chemical formula also written it is a colorless gas that does not persist undiluted it was produced by the gas phase reaction of excited cadmium atoms with dihydrogen h and the structure determined high resolution infrared emission spectra the molecule is linear with a bond length of

it has been put forward as a structural material for the casings of the physics package in nuclear weapons including those of north korea the composition is a ternary alloy of 7 5 niobium 2 5 zirconium 90 uranium mulberry was developed in the 1960s at ucrl binary alloy compositions were first studied to avoid the mechanical problems of pure uranium corrosion dimensional instability inability to improve its mechanical properties by heat treatment uranium molybdenum alloys were found susceptible to stress corrosion cracking uranium niobium alloys to be weak and uranium zirconium alloys to be brittle ternary alloys were next studied to try to avoid these drawbacks uranium niobium zirconium was found to be corrosion resistant and to permit age hardening which could increase its hardness from 110 to 270 ksi multiple crystal phases were observed with a critical temperature of 650 c above this the body centered cubic phase was stable water quenching to room temperature produces a transition phase and with aging this transforms to a tetragonal phase further aging produces a monoclinic phase that is observed metallographically as a widmanst tten pattern the crystal structure of the alloy has been studied particularly the phase uranium inclusions have

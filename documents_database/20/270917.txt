however despite its structural similarity to dmt its activity is induced by an oral dose of around 50 100 mg without the aid of mao inhibitors and the effects last for about 2 4 hours det is an analogue of the common tryptamine hallucinogen n n dimethyltryptamine or dmt the mechanism of action is thought to be serotonin receptor agonism much like other classic psychedelics det is sometimes preferred over dmt because it can be taken orally whereas dmt cannot this is because the enzyme monoamine oxidase degrades dmt into an inactive compound before it is absorbed to overcome this it must be administered in a different manner i e intravenously intramuscularly by inhalation by insufflation rectally or ingested along with an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase because det has ethyl groups attached to its nitrogen atom monoamine oxidase is unable to degrade it this is also true for many other tryptamines with larger nitrogen substituents although det is a synthetic compound with no known natural sources it has been used in conjunction with the mycelium of psilocybe cubensis to produce the synthetic chemicals 4 po det ethocybin and 4 ho det ethocin as opposed to the naturally occurring 4 po

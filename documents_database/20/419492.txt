the earliest human civilizations began near the shores of rivers and consequently coincided with the dawn of hydrology hydraulics and hydraulic engineering the fundamental principles of hydrostatics and dynamics were given by archimedes in his work on floating bodies around 250 bc in it archimedes develops the law of buoyancy also known as archimedes principle this principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces archimedes maintained that each particle of a fluid mass when in equilibrium is equally pressed in every direction and he inquired into the conditions according to which a solid body floating in a fluid should assume and preserve a position of equilibrium in the greek school at alexandria which flourished under the auspices of the ptolemies attempts were made at the construction of hydraulic machinery and about 120 bc the fountain of compression the siphon and the forcing pump were invented by ctesibius and hero the siphon is a simple instrument but the forcing pump is a complicated invention which could scarcely have been expected in the infancy of hydraulics it was probably suggested to ctesibius by the egyptian wheel or noria

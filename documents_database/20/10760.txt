the exact state of an atom or photon can be transmitted exactly in principle from one location to another with the help of classical communication and previously shared quantum entanglement between the sending and receiving location because it depends on classical communication which can proceed no faster than the speed of light it cannot be used for faster than light transport or communication of classical bits while it has proven possible to teleport one or more qubits of information between two entangled quanta this has not yet been achieved between anything larger than molecules although the name is inspired by the teleportation commonly used in fiction quantum teleportation is limited to the transfer of information rather than matter itself quantum teleportation is not a form of transportation but of communication it provides a way of transporting a qubit from one location to another without having to move a physical particle along with it the term was coined by physicist charles bennett the seminal paper first expounding the idea of quantum teleportation was published by c h bennett g brassard c cr peau r jozsa a peres and w k wootters in 1993 quantum teleportation was first realized in single photons

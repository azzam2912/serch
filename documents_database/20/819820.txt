according to gutierrez 2006 the literary hypertext authoring system known as literatronica was developed by juan b gutierrez instead of relying solely on static hypertext links for the system allows these as well it uses an ai engine to recommend the best next pages based on what readers have already read literatronica radically revises the 1990s notions of literary hypertext as modernist collage to the original notions of arpanet as document sharing where speed of access was put before what espen aarseth calls the aporia of links in short he asks is nonlinearity and disruption inherent to the medium the system addresses several of the major classic problems found with hypertext namely the problems of 1 authors input their pages into the web interface 2 authors decide which pages should be linked with each other 3 authors assign a numeric distance between connected pages a passage which follows easily or without much interpretive work might be a 5 while a passage that is distantly related might be a 25 out of these distances the system creates a map to help the reader traverse the map the system runs a shortest path algorithm to suggest paths because the system is dynamic

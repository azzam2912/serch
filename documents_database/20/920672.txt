chemesthetic sensations arise when chemical compounds activate receptors associated with other senses that mediate pain touch and thermal perception these chemical induced reactions do not fit into the traditional sense categories of taste and smell examples of chemesthetic sensations include the burn like irritation from capsaicin and related compounds in foods like chili peppers the coolness of menthol in mouthwashes and topical analgesic creams the stinging or tingling of carbonated beverages in the nose and mouth the tear induction of cut onions and the pungent cough inducing sensation in the back of the throat elicited by the oleocanthal in high quality extra virgin olive oil some of these sensations may be referred to as spiciness pungency or piquancy chemesthetic sensations sometimes arise by direct chemical activation of ion channels on sensory nerve fibers for example of transient receptor potential channels including those of the trpv trpa or trpm subtypes alternatively irritant chemicals may activate cells of the epithelium to release substances that indirectly activate the nerve fibers the respiratory passages including the nose and trachea possess specialized cells called solitary chemosensory cells which release acetylcholine or other activators to excite nearby nerve fibers because chemoresponsive nerve fibers are present in

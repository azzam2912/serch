it was formerly known as the ostracod limestone for the abundance of fossil freshwater ostracods within it the kilmaluag formation is very fossiliferous with ostracods gastropods bivalves and vertebrate fossil remains vertebrate fossils include fish crocodiles mammals lizards and some large reptile remains including dinosaurs the kilmaluag formation is bathonian and dates to around 167 million years old it is part of the great estuarine group of the hebrides basin a series of sediments laid down when the scottish hebrides was part of a warm shallow sea running between what is now mainland scotland the outer hebrides the kilmaluag formation is composed of dolomitised limestones fine grain sandstones and mudstones indicating that it alternated between a shallow environment and lagoonal mudflats as the basin subsided and rose causing sea levels to fluctuate these mudflats sometimes dried out to form desiccation cracks the kilmaluag formation is unusual among the estuarine group for the freshwater environment it preserves whereas many other formations in this group are predominantly brackish to marine in nature in many beds freshwater gastropods and bivalves can be found including viviparus and unio and freshwater ostracods such as darwinula many vertebrate fossils are found in the kilmaluag formation and

this process of specific binding is called hybridization a known quantity of rna spike in is mixed with the experiment sample during preparation the degree of hybridization between the spike ins and the control probes is used to normalize the hybridization measurements of the sample rna nucleic acid hybridization assays have been used for decades to detect specific sequences of dna or rna with a dna microarray precursor used as early as 1965 in such assays positive control oligonucleotides are necessary to provide a standard for comparison of target sequence concentration and to check and correct for nonspecific binding that is incidental binding of the rna to non complementary dna sequences these controls became known as spike ins with the advent of dna microarray chips in the 1990s and the commercialization of high throughput methods for sequencing and rna detection assays manufacturers of hybridization assay kits started to provide pre developed spike ins in the case of gene expression assay microarrays or rna sequencing rna seq rna spike ins are used rna spike ins can be synthesized by any means of creating rna synthetically or by using cells to transcribe dna to rna in vivo in cells rna can be

it normally relates to the amplitude volume but it may also involve elements such as filters frequencies or pitch for example a piano key when struck and held creates a near immediate initial sound which gradually decreases in volume to zero envelope generators which allow users to control the different stages of a sound are common features of synthesizers samplers and other electronic musical instruments the hammond novachord in 1938 uses an early implementation of an adsr envelope a seven position rotary knob set preset ads parameter for all 72 notes a pedal controls the release the envelope generator was created by the american engineer robert moog in the 1960s while experimenting with the first moog synthesizers composer herb deutsch suggested moog find a way to articulate the instrument so notes did not simply trigger on and off moog wired a doorbell button to the synthesizer and used a capacitor to store and slowly release voltage produced from hitting a key he refined the design to remove the need to push a separate button with every key press with two switches on every key one to produce the control voltage and the other to trigger the envelope generator the envelope

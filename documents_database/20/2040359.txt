it was chosen for the world intellectual property organization award in 2009 inverse coding goes back to victor ambartsumian s scientific legacy on inverse problems and represents the first solution of its kind in audio by separating sound sources at the same frequency by a time level model s5 scalable sparse spatial sound system is a scalable multichannel coding system which may incorporate a wide range of base audio codecs preferably with additional encapsulation capacity for external data e g mpeg 4 or mpeg d compatible bit stream syntax may thus be maintained and ecma 407 becomes invisible during transmission an s5 codec can be determined by the functional block diagrams of the s5 encoder and of the s5 decoder according to the standard s5 encoder shall at least consist of a base s5 encoder and a s5 decoder shall at least consist of a base s5 decoder the base s5 encoder compresses multichannel audio information by downmixing the f channel signal to g channels and produces sparse spatial data according to an inverse coding model which approaches the localization and ambiance of the original signal the inverse coding model directly constructs an upmix of h channels from the audio

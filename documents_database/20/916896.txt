it failed to reach orbit after the rocket s third stage malfunctioned the third stage was the first indian built cryogenic fuelled upper stage and was making its first flight the isro suspects that the failure was caused by the third stage not igniting weighing around two tons gsat 4 carried a multi channel ka band bent pipe and regenerative transponder and a navigation payload in the c l1 and l5 bands designed to guide civil and military aircraft gsat 4 was to have employed several new technologies such as a bus management unit miniaturised dynamically tuned gyros lithium ion battery 70 volt bus for ka band travelling wave tube amplifiers and electric propulsion gsat 4 also incorporated technological experiments like on board structural dynamic experiment thermal control coating experiment and vibration beam accelerometer with a lift off mass of about the spacecraft was to have generated a maximum of 2 760 w of power gsat 4 was also to have been the first indian spacecraft to employ ion propulsion four hall effect thrusters would have been used for north south station keeping operations two types of hall effect thrusters are developed by isro satellite centre isac and liquid propulsion

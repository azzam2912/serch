the motivating examples of relatively hyperbolic groups are the fundamental groups of complete noncompact hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume a group g is relatively hyperbolic with respect to a subgroup h if after contracting the cayley graph of g along h cosets the resulting graph equipped with the usual graph metric becomes a hyperbolic space and moreover it satisfies a technical condition which implies that quasi geodesics with common endpoints travel through approximately the same collection of cosets and enter and exit these cosets in approximately the same place given a finitely generated group g with cayley graph g equipped with the path metric and a subgroup h of g one can construct the coned off cayley graph formula 1 as follows for each left coset gh add a vertex v gh to the cayley graph g and for each element x of gh add an edge e x of length 1 2 from x to the vertex v gh this results in a metric space that may not be proper i e closed balls need not be compact the definition of a relatively hyperbolic group as formulated by bowditch goes as follows a group g is said to be

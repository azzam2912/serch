it is derived from fluorescein but differs by the presence of four bromine atoms at positions 2 4 5 and 7 of the xanthene ring and four chlorine atoms in the carboxyphenyl ring it has an absorption maximum around 540 nm and an emission maximum around 564 nm apart from industrial use phloxine b has functions as an antimicrobial substance viability dye and biological stain for example it is used in hematoxylin phloxine saffron hps staining to color the cytoplasm and connective tissue in shades of red in the presence of light phloxine b has a bactericidal effect on gram positive strains such as bacillus subtilis bacillus cereus and several methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa strains at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 25 m growth is reduced by 10 fold within 2 5 hours at concentrations of 50 m and 100 m growth is stopped completely and cell counts decrease by a factor of 10 to 10 for humans the food and drug administration deems phloxine b to be safe up to a daily dosage of 1 25 mg kg bacteria exposed to phloxine b die from oxidative damage phloxine b ionizes in water to become a negatively charged ion

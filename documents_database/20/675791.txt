testing for the presence of nitrate via wet chemistry is generally difficult compared with testing for other anions as almost all nitrates are soluble in water in contrast many common ions give insoluble salts e g halides precipitate with silver and sulfate precipitate with barium the nitrate anion is an oxidizer and many tests for the nitrate anion are based on this property unfortunately other oxidants present in the analyte may interfere and give erroneous results a common nitrate test known as the brown ring test can be performed by adding iron ii sulfate to a solution of a nitrate then slowly adding concentrated sulfuric acid such that the acid forms a layer below the aqueous solution a brown ring will form at the junction of the two layers indicating the presence of the nitrate ion note that the presence of nitrite ions will interfere with this test the overall reaction is the reduction of the nitrate ion by iron ii which is oxidised to iron iii and formation of a nitrosonium complex where nitric oxide is reduced to no this test is sensitive up to 2 5 micrograms and a concentration of 1 in 25 000 parts devarda s

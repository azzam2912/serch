pigs serve as natural hosts there is currently only one species in this genus the type species teschovirus a previously porcine teschovirus which is responsible for the porcine enteroviral encephalomyelitis disease caused in pigs the genus name comes from its type species and the disease it causes teschen disease a severe and fatal form of pig encephalomyelitis which itself was named for the town in the czech republic where the disease was first recognised in 1929 teschovirus has a single stranded linear non segmented rna genome the rna genome is positively sensed meaning that it has the same polarity as the mrna and no reverse transcription is necessary the size of the genome is between 7000 and 9000 nucleotides long in addition the virus genome contains at the 5 end a protein called vpg and the 3 end is polyadenylated through translation of the genome a polyprotein is produced it is later cleaved in order to give twelve proteins these proteins are nucleoproteins non structural proteins a polymerase proteases like the leader protein and the genome linked protein group ssrna viruses in teschovirus are non enveloped with icosahedral spherical and round geometries and t pseudo3 symmetry the diameter is around

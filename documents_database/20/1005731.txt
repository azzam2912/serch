london receives 0 52 and 4 74 kwh m per day in december and july respectively while the sunniest parts of the uk receive much less solar radiation than the sunniest parts of europe the country s insolation in the south is comparable with that of central european countries including germany which generates about 7 of its electricity from solar power additionally the uk s higher wind speeds cool pv modules leading to higher efficiencies than could be expected at these levels of insolation the department of energy and climate change decc assumes an average capacity factor of 9 7 for solar photovoltaics in the uk derry newman chief executive of solarcentury argues that the uk s famously overcast weather does not make it an unsuitable place for solar power as solar panels work on daylight not necessarily direct sunlight some solar cells work better in direct sunlight others can use more diffuse light while insolation rates are lower in england than france and spain they are still usable the table above shows electricity production from solar panels as a percentage of the final consumption of electricity in the uk and not gross supply to the grid these numbers may

they were designed to camouflage the aircraft by preventing it from appearing as a dark object against the sky the technology was developed by the us navy from 1943 onwards to enable a sea search aircraft to approach a surfaced submarine to within 30 seconds of flying time before becoming visible to the submarine s crew this in turn enabled the aircraft to engage the submarine with depth charges before it could dive to counter the threat from german submarines to allied shipping the concept was based on earlier research by the royal canadian navy in its diffused lighting camouflage project yehudi lights did not come into operational usage and were considered obsolete with postwar advances in radar with more recent improvements in stealth technology yehudi lights have again attracted interest the use of yehudi lights to camouflage aircraft by matching their luminance with the background sky was developed in part by the us navy s project yehudi from 1943 onwards following pioneering experiments in the canadian diffused lighting camouflage project for ships early in the second world war a canadian professor edmund godfrey burr had serendipitously stumbled upon the principle when he saw an aircraft coming in to land

one of the most important causes of starvation induced tolerance in vivo is biofilm growth which occurs in many chronic infections starvation in biofilms is due to nutrient consumption by cells located on the periphery of biofilm clusters and by reduced diffusion of substrates through the biofilm biofilm bacteria shows extreme tolerance to almost all antibiotic classes and supplying limiting substrates can restore sensitivity ordinarily the body responds to reduced energy intake by burning fat reserves and consuming muscle and other tissues specifically the body burns fat after first exhausting the contents of the digestive tract along with glycogen reserves stored in liver cells and after significant protein loss after prolonged periods of starvation the body uses the proteins within muscle tissue as a fuel source the magnitude and composition of the starvation response i e metabolic adaptation was estimated in a study of 8 individuals living in isolation in biosphere 2 for two years during their isolation they gradually lost an average of 15 range 9 24 of their body weight due to harsh conditions on emerging from isolation the eight isolated individuals were compared with a 152 person control group that initially had had similar physical characteristics on

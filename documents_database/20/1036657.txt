it can function as an antimicrobial against staphylococcus aureus lysostaphin is a 27 kda glycylglycine endopeptidase an antibacterial enzyme which is capable of cleaving the crosslinking pentaglycine bridges found in the cell wall peptidoglycan of certain staphylococci lysostaphin was first isolated from a culture of staphylococcus simulans by schindler and schuhardt in 1964 s aureus cell walls contain high proportions of pentaglycine making lysostaphin a highly effective agent against both actively growing and quiescent bacteria staphylococcal infections of both staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis continue to be a major issue in clinical settings particularly those with implantable devices staphylococci cause a significant percentage of device infections and like many other pathogens rather than living as free planktonic cells within the host they have the ability to form a multilayered community of sessile bacteria cells known as a biofilm on implantable devices once a staphylococcal biofilm has formed on an implanted medical device it is difficult to disrupt due to its antibiotic resistance and protection against bacterial action many studies have been previously published on lysostaphin since its isolation both in vitro and in vivo lysostaphin has been shown to eradicate susceptible s aureus biofilms it has also been reported to

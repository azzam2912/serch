some sodium cooled reactors like the bn 600 have sodium pools instead the rest of this article will assume that water is being used the water acts as neutron moderator cooling agent and radiation shield the layer of water directly above the reactor core shields the radiation so completely that operators may work above the reactor safely this design has two major advantages the reactor is easily accessible and the whole primary cooling system i e the pool water is under normal pressure this avoids the high temperatures and great pressures of nuclear power plants pool reactors are used as a source of neutrons and for training and in rare instances for processing heat but not for electrical generation open pools range in height from 6m to 9m 20 to 30 and diameter from 1 8m to 3 6m 6 to 12 some pools like the one at the canadian maple reactor are rectangular instead of cylindrical and often contain as much as 416 000 litres 110 000 gallons of water most pools are built above floor level but some are completely or partially below ground ordinary light water and heavy water only types exist as well as so called

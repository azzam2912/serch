both eyes are usually affected the corneas gradually become pigmented and infiltrated by blood vessels and the dog may eventually become blind csk is usually a bilateral progressive condition however the lesions are not symmetrical nor are they painful signs include pigmentation and vascularization of the cornea extension of blood vessels onto the cornea it is usually first seen at the lateral temporal limbus the junction between the cornea and sclera although it eventually can extend from any part of the limbus to cover the entire cornea severe cases can cause blindness although csk is usually identifiable by the appearance of the eye and the breed of the affected dog cytology will reveal the presence of lymphocytes and plasma cells csk is immune mediated in nature characterized by an infiltration of white blood cells into the superficial stroma of the cornea these cells are predominantly cd4 expressing t lymphocytes and to a lesser extent cd8 expressing t cells the cd4 expressing t cells secrete gamma interferon which causes expression of the major histocompatibility complex class ii molecules in the cells of the cornea these class ii molecules cause further inflammation by interacting with the t cells and triggering an immune

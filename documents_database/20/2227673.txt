in terms of feynman diagrams the luttinger ward functional is the sum of all closed bold two particle irreducible diagrams i e all diagrams without particles going in or out that do not fall apart if one removes two propagator lines it is usually written as formula 1 or formula 2 where formula 3 is the green s function and formula 4 is the bare interaction the luttinger ward functional has no direct physical meaning but it is useful in proving conservation laws the functional is closely related to the baym kadanoff functional constructed independently by gordon baym and leo kadanoff in 1961 some authors use the terms interchangeably if a distinction is made then the baym kadanoff functional is identical to the two particle irreducible effective action formula 5 which differs from the luttinger ward functional by a trivial term given a system characterized by the action formula 6 in terms of grassmann fields formula 7 the partition function can be expressed as the path integral where formula 9 is a binary source field by expansion in the dyson series one finds that formula 10 is the sum of all possibly disconnected closed feynman diagrams formula 11 in turn

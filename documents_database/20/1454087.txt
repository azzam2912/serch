it is hoped it would be able to study the martian surface sky sailor would be an autonomous solar powered mars aircraft that would fly for one martian day of 24 hours and scan features on the surface of mars if this project is funded and developed it would be able to take detailed pictures of mars especially in places where wheeled rovers cannot go the challenge for the developers was to make a very light weight model which was accomplished after that an autopilot had to be installed so a non stop autonomous flight for 24 hours could be achieved all this was tested with a scale model in a wind tunnel two major challenges for small autonomous aircraft for mars are to keep the weight down such as batteries and electronics and the other is designing the autonomous control systems for directing the flight some design considerations is the amount of solar power available over the course of a martian day and another is the battery storage capacity and the efficiency and weight of the solar cells one reason for a small size was to facilitate its transport to planet mars from earth the sky sailor concept has

the longer of the two pairs will always be the one that crosses antiparallelograms are also called contraparallelograms or crossed parallelograms an antiparallelogram is a special case of a crossed quadrilateral which has generally unequal edges a special form of the antiparallelogram is a crossed rectangle in which two opposite edges are parallel every antiparallelogram has an axis of symmetry through its crossing point because of this symmetry it has two pairs of equal angles as well as two pairs of equal sides together with the kites and the isosceles trapezoids antiparallelograms form one of three basic classes of quadrilaterals with a symmetry axis the convex hull of an antiparallelogram is an isosceles trapezoid and every antiparallelogram may be formed from the non parallel sides or either pair of parallel sides in case of a rectangle and diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid every antiparallelogram is a cyclic quadrilateral meaning that its four vertices all lie on a single circle several nonconvex uniform polyhedra including the tetrahemihexahedron cubohemioctahedron octahemioctahedron small rhombihexahedron small icosihemidodecahedron and small dodecahemidodecahedron have antiparallelograms as their vertex figures the cross sections formed by slicing the polyhedron by a plane that passes near a vertex perpendicularly to the

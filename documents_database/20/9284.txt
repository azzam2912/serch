in other words a problem is in nc if there exist constants c and k such that it can be solved in time using parallel processors stephen cook coined the name nick s class after nick pippenger who had done extensive research on circuits with polylogarithmic depth and polynomial size just as the class p can be thought of as the tractable problems cobham s thesis so nc can be thought of as the problems that can be efficiently solved on a parallel computer nc is a subset of p because polylogarithmic parallel computations can be simulated by polynomial time sequential ones it is unknown whether nc p but most researchers suspect this to be false meaning that there are probably some tractable problems that are inherently sequential and cannot significantly be sped up by using parallelism just as the class np complete can be thought of as probably intractable so the class p complete when using nc reductions can be thought of as probably not parallelizable or probably inherently sequential the parallel computer in the definition can be assumed to be a parallel random access machine pram that is a parallel computer with a central pool of memory and

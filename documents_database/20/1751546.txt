it is a thick sequence of carbonate rocks of middle cambrian age it was named for cathedral mountain in yoho national park by charles doolittle walcott the discoverer of the burgess shale fossils the cathedral formation includes fossil stromatolites oncolites and other algal remains as well as a few shale beds with trilobites the cathedral escarpment on its westernmost edge is thought to have played a major role in the deposition and preservation of the burgess shale fossils the cathedral formation consists primarily of massive cliff forming carbonate rocks it was originally deposited as limestone much of which may have been secreted by marine algae deposition took place in shallow water on an extensive algal reef or carbonate platform that had developed along the western margin of the north american craton the limestone was subsequently altered to dolostone in many areas the formation also includes several beds of shale with fossil trilobites that establish its age and stratigraphic relationships by biostratigraphy the cathedral escarpment is an abrupt cliff on the westernmost edge of the cathedral formation it was probably a submarine cliff that marked the edge of the original carbonate platform it is approximately 100 to 300 metres 330 to

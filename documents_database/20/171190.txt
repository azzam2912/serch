protein purification is vital for the characterization of the function structure and interactions of the protein of interest the purification process may separate the protein and non protein parts of the mixture and finally separate the desired protein from all other proteins separation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect of protein purification separation steps usually exploit differences in protein size physico chemical properties binding affinity and biological activity the pure result may be termed protein isolate protein purification is either preparative or analytical preparative purifications aim to produce a relatively large quantity of purified proteins for subsequent use examples include the preparation of commercial products such as enzymes e g lactase nutritional proteins e g soy protein isolate and certain biopharmaceuticals e g insulin several preparative purifications steps are often deployed to remove bi products such as host cell proteins which poses as a potential threat to the patient s health analytical purification produces a relatively small amount of a protein for a variety of research or analytical purposes including identification quantification and studies of the protein s structure post translational modifications and function pepsin and urease were the first proteins purified to the

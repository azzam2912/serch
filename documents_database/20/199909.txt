2600 bc a unique example of early pyramid development in egypt this was the second pyramid built by sneferu the bent pyramid rises from the desert at a 54 degree inclination but the top section above 47 metres is built at the shallower angle of 43 degrees lending the pyramid its very obvious bent appearance archaeologists now believe that the bent pyramid represents a transitional form between step sided and smooth sided pyramids see step pyramid it has been suggested that due to the steepness of the original angle of inclination the structure may have begun to show signs of instability during construction forcing the builders to adopt a shallower angle to avert the structure s collapse this theory appears to be borne out by the fact that the adjacent red pyramid built immediately afterwards by the same pharaoh was constructed at an angle of 43 degrees from its base this fact also contradicts the theory that at the initial angle the construction would take too long because sneferu s death was nearing so the builders changed the angle to complete the construction in time in 1974 kurt mendelssohn suggested the change of the angle to have been made as

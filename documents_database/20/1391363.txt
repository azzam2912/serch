in solid tumors poor access of the tumor to the drug can limit the fraction of tumor cells killed but the validity of the fractional kill hypothesis has also been established in animal models of leukemia as well as in human leukemia and lymphoma where drug access is less of an issue because only a fraction of the cells die with each treatment repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor current chemotherapy regimens apply drug treatment in cycles with the frequency and duration of treatments limited by toxicity to the patient the goal is to reduce the tumor population to zero with successive fractional kills for example assuming a 99 kill per cycle of chemotherapy a tumor of 10 cells would be reduced to less than one cell with six treatment cycles 10 0 01 cell cycle specificity of chemotherapy drugs cytarabine a dna synthesis inhibitor also known as ara c is cited as the classic cell cycle phase specific agent chemotherapy dosing schedules have been optimized based on the fact that cytarabine is only expected to be effective in the dna synthesis s phase of the cell cycle consistent with this leukemia

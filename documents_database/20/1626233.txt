the project involved numerous universities distributed worldwide and was sponsored by a number of international major oil companies the area of research was the majella mountain in central italy regarded as an analogue of a faulted and fractured hydrocarbon reservoir as can be found in major provinces like the middle east caspian basin mediterranean basin and other areas the scope was to obtain knowledge on the relation between fracture and fault generation and all types of geological aspects of the evolution of the geological structure the scope and mission of the project taskforcemajella tfm is to construct a model of the montagna della majella anticline structure as an analogue of a faulted and fractured carbonate reservoir similar to those in production and explored by the sponsors of the project eni and norsk hydro now merged into staoilhydro e g iran iraq libya canada caspian sea area etc the aim is to provide a predictive tool for the exploration and production of these prospects and reservoirs which are characterized by the fact that their production is for a considerable amount controlled by the presence of fractures and faults the montagna della majella is a mountain massif in the apennines in abruzzo

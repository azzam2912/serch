fractographic methods are routinely used to determine the cause of failure in engineering structures especially in product failure and the practice of forensic engineering or failure analysis in material science research fractography is used to develop and evaluate theoretical models of crack growth behavior one of the aims of fractographic examination is to determine the cause of failure by studying the characteristics of a fractured surface different types of crack growth e g fatigue stress corrosion cracking hydrogen embrittlement produce characteristic features on the surface which can be used to help identify the failure mode the overall pattern of cracking can be more important than a single crack however especially in the case of brittle materials like ceramics and glasses an important aim of fractography is to establish and examine the origin of cracking as examination at the origin may reveal the cause of crack initiation initial fractographic examination is commonly carried out on a macro scale utilising low power optical microscopy and oblique lighting techniques to identify the extent of cracking possible modes and likely origins optical microscopy or macrophotography are often enough to pinpoint the nature of the failure and the causes of crack initiation and growth if

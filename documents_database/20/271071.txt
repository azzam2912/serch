in plasma physics terms this is the cavity formed by the sun in the surrounding interstellar medium the bubble of the heliosphere is continuously inflated by plasma originating from the sun known as the solar wind outside the heliosphere this solar plasma gives way to the interstellar plasma permeating our galaxy radiation levels inside and outside the heliosphere differ in particular the galactic cosmic rays are less abundant inside the heliosphere so that the planets inside including earth are partly shielded from their impact the word heliosphere is said to have been coined by alexander j dessler who is credited with first use of the word in scientific literature in 1967 the scientific study of the heliosphere is heliophysics which includes space weather and space climate flowing unimpeded through the solar system for billions of kilometres the solar wind extends far beyond even the region of pluto until it encounters the termination shock where its motion slows abruptly due to the outside pressure of the interstellar medium beyond the shock lies the heliosheath a broad transitional region between the inner heliosphere and the external environment the outermost edge of the heliosphere is called the heliopause the overall shape of the

the term candidatus indicates that it has not proved possible to maintain this bacterium in culture detection of the liberibacters is based on pcr amplification of their 16s rrna gene with specific primers members of the genus are plant pathogens mostly transmitted by psyllids the genus was originally spelled liberobacter most importantly candidatus liberibacter is a causative agent of huanglongbing disease hlb also known as citrus greening disease candidatus liberibacter is trasmited by two insects from psyllidae family diaphorina citri in asia brazil and florida and trioza erytreae in africa the asian hlb strain candidatus liberibacter asiaticus is more heat tolerant while the african strain candidatus liberibacter africanus is asymptomatic at temperatures above 30 c species of candidatus liberibacter infecting solanaceous plants has been identified and it was carried by another psyllid a potato pest bactericera cockerelli candidatus liberibacter are carried in the heamolymph and salivary glands of psyllids since psyllids feed on sap this provides bacteria the entry to phloem of the plant they induce significant metabolic and regulatory changes that damage the plants transport system and affects plants defense systems these impairments have downstream negative effects on citrus microbiome of the infected plants since candidatus liberibacter cannot be

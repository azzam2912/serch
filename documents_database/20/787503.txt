in a sense the riesz potential defines an inverse for a power of the laplace operator on euclidean space they generalize to several variables the riemann liouville integrals of one variable if 0 locally integrable function f on r is the function defined by where the constant is given by this singular integral is well defined provided f decays sufficiently rapidly at infinity specifically if f l r with 1 p 1 is classical due to sobolev while for p 1 see the rate of decay of f and that of i f are related in the form of an inequality the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality where formula 3 is the vector valued riesz transform more generally the operators i are well defined for complex such that 0 weak sense as the convolution where k is the locally integrable function the riesz potential can therefore be defined whenever f is a compactly supported distribution in this connection the riesz potential of a positive borel measure with compact support is chiefly of interest in potential theory because i is then a continuous subharmonic function off the support of and is lower semicontinuous on all of r consideration of the fourier transform

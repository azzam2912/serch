a differential screw uses a spindle with two screw threads of differing leads aka thread pitch and possibly opposite handedness on which two nuts move as the spindle rotates the space between the nuts changes based on the difference between the threads these mechanisms allow extremely small adjustments using commonly available screws a differential screw mechanism using two nuts incurs higher friction and therefore requires more torque to turn than a simple single lead screw with an equivalent pitch many differential screw configurations are possible the micrometer adjuster pictured uses a nut sleeve with different inner and outer thread pitches to connect a screw on the adjusting rod end with threads inside the main barrel as the thimble rotates the nut sleeve the rod and barrel move relative to each other based on the differential between the threads another arrangement holds the two nuts co axially in a single fixture and has two separate screws with slightly different pitches length between threads entering from opposite ends the heads of the screws are fixed to the two objects whose spacing is to be adjusted each rotation of the fixture holding the nuts moves one screw into its nut by a small

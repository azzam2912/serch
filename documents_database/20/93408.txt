the main function of mhc molecules is to bind to antigens derived from pathogens and display them on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate t cells mhc molecules mediate interactions of leukocytes also called white blood cells wbcs which are immune cells with other leukocytes or with body cells the mhc determines compatibility of donors for organ transplant as well as one s susceptibility to an autoimmune disease via crossreacting immunization the human mhc is also called the hla human leukocyte antigen complex often just the hla the mhc in mice is called the histocompatibility system 2 or just the h 2 in a cell protein molecules of the host s own phenotype or of other biologic entities are continually synthesized and degraded each mhc molecule on the cell surface displays a molecular fraction of a protein called an epitope the presented antigen can be either self or non self thus preventing an organism s immune system targeting its own cells in its entirety the mhc population is like a meter indicating the balance of proteins within the cell the mhc gene family is divided into three subgroups mhc class i mhc class ii and mhc class iii

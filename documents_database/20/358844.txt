in humans this sense along with tactile spatial acuity vibration perception texture discrimination and proprioception is mediated by the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway of the central nervous system stereognosis tests determine whether or not the parietal lobe of the brain is intact typically these tests involved having the patient identify common objects e g keys comb safety pins placed in their hand without any visual cues stereognosis is a higher cerebral associative cortical function astereognosis is the failure to identify or recognize objects by palpation in the absence of visual or auditory information even though tactile proprioceptive and thermal sensations may be unaffected it may be caused by disease of the sensory cortex or posterior columns people suffering from alzheimer s disease show a reduction in stereognosis astereognosis can be caused by damage to the posterior association areas of the parietal temporal or occipital lobes or the postcentral gyrus of either hemisphere for other types of dementia stereognosis does not appear to decline mechanism of neural pathway the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway is responsible for relaying sensory information regarding proprioception vibration and fine touch first order neurons carry sensory information from proprioceptive and tactile receptors to the medulla

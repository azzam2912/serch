its goal is to measure or set a limit on the mixing angle a neutrino oscillation parameter responsible for changing electron neutrinos into other neutrinos the experiment uses reactors of the chooz nuclear power plant as a neutrino source and measures the flux of neutrinos they receive to accomplish this double chooz has a set of two detectors situated 400 meters and 1050 meters from the reactors double chooz is a successor to the chooz experiment one of its detectors occupies the same site as its predecessor until january 2015 all data has been collected using only the far detector the near detector was completed in september 2014 after construction delays and is taking physics data since beginning of 2015 double chooz uses two identical gadolinium doped liquid scintillator detectors placed in vicinity of two 4 25 gw thermal power reactors to measure antineutrino disappearance the two detectors are aptly referred to as near 400 meters from the reactor and far 1 050 meters from the reactor the far detector is placed inside a hill such that there is a 300 meters of water equivalent of shielding from cosmic muons the detector itself is a calorimetric liquid scintillator consisting of

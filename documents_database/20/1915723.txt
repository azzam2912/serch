the main challenge to their adoption is the cost of rfids the design and fabrication of asics needed for rfid are the major component of their cost so removing ics altogether can significantly reduce its cost the major challenges in designing chipless rfid is data encoding and transmission chipless rfid tags may use either time domain reflectometry or frequency signature techniques in time domain reflectometry the interrogator sends a pulse and listens for echoes the timing of pulse arrivals encodes the data in frequency signature rfids the interrogator sends waves of several frequencies a broadband pulse or a chirp and monitors the echoes frequency content the presence or absence of certain frequency components in the received waves encodes the data they may use chemicals magnetic materials or resonant circuits to attenuate or absorb radiation of a particular frequency in 2001 roke manor research centre announced materials that emit characteristic radiation when moved these may be exploited for storage of a few data bits encoded in the presence or absence of certain chemicals somark employed a dielectric barcode that may be read using microwaves the dielectric material reflects transmits and scatters the incident radiation the different position and orientation of these

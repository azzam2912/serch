it is a composite material single seat single propeller high wing airplane the zephyrus is designed to compete in the kremer prize sport competition the psu zephyrus was developed to compete in the kremer s prize sport competition the basic mission goal is to traverse an equilateral triangle with sides of 500 meters once in each direction in seven minutes the competition specifies a minimum average airspeed of 5 0 m s during the flight in addition for a flight to be considered official the airspeed cannot drop below 5 0 m s for a period of more than 20 seconds the aircraft is also being developed and constructed as a fulfillment of the course requirements of penn state s aersp 404h course the fuselage was sized based a dimension range of a 5 10 1 78 m pilot and the assumption that the pilot could output the necessary power to weight ratio to fly the aircraft will be no greater than 1 78 m constraints include minimum widths for pilot comfort and desired center of gravity of the aircraft the shape of the pod was designed to be a low drag body that will not generate lift regardless of

it may be considered a first attempt in finding the metric of a spinning black hole it is sometimes also used in homogeneous but anisotropic cosmological models formulated in the framework of general relativity the underlying taub space was found by and extended to a larger manifold by whose initials form the nut of taub nut taub s solution is an empty space solution of einstein s equations with topology r s and metric or equivalently line element where and m and l are positive constants taub s metric has coordinate singularities at formula 3 and newman tamburino and unti showed how to extend the metric across these surfaces when roy kerr developed the kerr metric for spinning black holes in 1963 he ended up with a 4 parameter solution one of which was the mass and another the angular momentum of the central body one of the two other parameters was the nut parameter which he threw out of his solution because he found it to be nonphysical since it caused the metric to be not asymptotically flat while other sources interpret it either as a gravomagnetic monopole parameter of the central mass or a twisting property of the

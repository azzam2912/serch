the 1377 was introduced in 1977 and has been in continuous production ever since a separately available shoulder stock which crosman designates model 1399 converts the rather long pistol into a carbine the 1377 is not a competition level target airgun but its long rifled barrel makes it fairly accurate atypically for modern pneumatic air pistols which are mostly charged with a single action of a lever action pump the 1377 can be pumped to various levels crosman recommends at least three pumps to ensure that the pellet clears the barrel but as many as ten pumps are advised by the manual crosman claims a pellet velocity of up to from a gun pumped ten times which is higher than that achieved by most pellet pistols of any kind many 1377 owners report success with only a few pumps and the lower velocity is accompanied by lower noise often an advantage for those shooting indoors the gun is noted for being highly modifiable a cottage industry has formed to provide its enthusiasts with parts and accessories examples of common modifications are custom grips and forearms to replace the factory plastic parts custom triggers for lighter and smoother trigger pull force

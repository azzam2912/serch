typically they are considered synapsids that evolved from an archaeothyris like synapsid in the late carboniferous but a recent study has recovered them as diapsid reptiles a varanopid from the latest middle permian pristerognathus assemblage zone is the youngest known varanopid and the last member of the pelycosaur group of synapsids no known varanopids developed a sail like dimetrodon the length of known varanopids including the tail varies from varanopids already showed some advanced characteristics of true pelycosaurs such as their deep narrow elongated skulls their jaws were long and their teeth were sharp however they were still primitive by mammalian standards they had long tails lizard like bodies and thin legs the varanopids were mostly carnivorous but as they were reduced in size their diets changed from a carnivorous to an insectivorous lifestyle compared to the other animals in early permian varanopids were agile creatures the genus ascendonanus provides the first extensive skin impressions for pelycosaur grade synapsids revealing scales akin to those of squamates parental care is known in heleosaurus suggesting that it is ancestral to synapsids as a whole class synapsida apsisaurus was formerly assigned as an eosuchian diapsid in 2010 it was redescribed by robert r

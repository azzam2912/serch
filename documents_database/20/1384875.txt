this is the current which is due to the transport of charges occurring because of non uniform concentration of charged particles in a semiconductor the drift current by contrast is due to the motion of charge carriers due to the force exerted on them by an electric field diffusion current can be in the same or opposite direction of a drift current the diffusion current and drift current together are described by the drift diffusion equation it is necessary to consider the part of diffusion current when describing many semiconductor devices for example the current near the depletion region of a p n junction is dominated by the diffusion current inside the depletion region both diffusion current and drift current are present at equilibrium in a p n junction the forward diffusion current in the depletion region is balanced with a reverse drift current so that the net current is zero the diffusion constant for a doped material can be determined with the haynes shockley experiment alternatively if the carrier mobility is known the diffusion coefficient may be determined from the einstein relation on electrical mobility the following table compares the two types of current no external electric field across

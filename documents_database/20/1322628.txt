aminopolycarboxylates that have lost acidic protons form strong complexes with metal ions this property makes aminopolycarboxylic acids useful complexone in a wide variety of chemical medical and environmental applications the parent of this family of ligands is the amino acid glycine hnchcoh in which the amino group nh is separated from the carboxyl group coh by a single methylene group ch when the carboxyl group is deprotonated the glycinate ion can function as a bidentate ligand binding the metal centre through the nitrogen and one of two carboxylate oxygen atoms to form chelate complexes of metal ions replacement of a hydrogen atom on the nitrogen of glycine by another acetate residue chcoh gives iminodiacetic acid ida which is a tridentate ligand further substitution gives nitrilotriacetic acid nta which is a tetradentate ligand these compounds can be described as aminopolycarboxylates related ligands can be derived from other amino acids other than glycine notably aspartic acid higher denticity is achieved by linking two or more glycinate or ida units together edta contains two ida units with the nitrogen atoms linked by two methylene groups and is hexadentate dtpa has two chch bridges linking three nitrogen atoms and is octadentate ttha has ten

the hotspot was responsible for the formation of rarotonga and some volcanics of aitutaki in addition to these volcanoes in the cook islands the composition of volcanic rocks in samoa and in the lau basin may have been influenced by the rarotonga hotspot and some atolls and seamounts in the marshall islands may have formed on the hotspot as well oceanic plateaus and linear volcanic chains dot the floor of the pacific ocean their formation has been explained with mantle plumes which rise from the core mantle boundary and spread out when they rise forming a large head that causes intense volcanic activity once it hits the crust this volcanism is responsible for the formation of the oceanic plateaus later the remnant tail of the plume is still rising and induces the formation of volcano chains as the crust moves over the plume tail thus forming the linear chains a number of hotspots are or were active in the pacific ocean and some of these may be the product of mantle plumes other hotspots such as rarotonga appear to have been active only for short time periods many of these are located in french polynesia where there is a superswell

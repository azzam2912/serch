electrochemical regeneration represents an alternative to thermal regeneration commonly used in waste water treatment applications common adsorbents include powdered activated carbon pac granular activated carbon gac and activated carbon fibre in waste water treatment the most commonly used adsorbent is granular activated carbon gac often used as to treat both liquid and gas phase volatile organic compounds and organic pollutants activated carbon beds vary in lifetime depending on the concentration of the pollutant s being removed their associated adsorption isotherms inlet flow rates and required discharge consents life times of these beds can range between hours and months activated carbon is often landfilled at the end of its useful life but sometimes it is possible to regenerate it restoring its adsorptive capacity allowing it to be re used thermal regeneration is the most prolific regeneration technique but has drawbacks in terms of high energy and commercial costs and a significant carbon footprint these drawbacks have encouraged research into alternative regeneration techniques such as electrochemical regeneration once the adsorptive capacity of the activated carbon bed has been exhausted by the adsorption of pollutant molecules the carbon is transferred to an electrochemical cell to either the anode or the cathode in which

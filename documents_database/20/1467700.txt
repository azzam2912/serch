kolmogorov s three series theorem combined with kronecker s lemma can be used to give a relatively easy proof of the strong law of large numbers let formula 1 be independent random variables the random series formula 2 converges almost surely in formula 3 if and only if the following conditions hold for some formula 4 then formula 5 the series of expected values of formula 6 converges condition i and borel cantelli give that formula 8 for formula 9 large almost surely hence formula 10 converges if and only if formula 11 converges conditions ii iii and kolmogorov s two series theorem give the almost sure convergence of formula 11 suppose that formula 10 converges almost surely without condition i by borel cantelli there would exist some formula 4 such that formula 15 for infinitely many formula 9 almost surely but then the series would diverge therefore we must have condition i we see that condition iii implies condition ii kolmogorov s two series theorem along with condition i applied to the case formula 17 gives the convergence of formula 18 so given the convergence of formula 11 we have formula 20 converges so condition ii is implied thus

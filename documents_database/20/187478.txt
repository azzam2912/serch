it transmits information from the body to the primary somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe of the brain the pathway receives information from sensory receptors throughout the body and carries this in nerve tracts in the white matter of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord to the medulla where it is continued in the medial lemniscus on to the thalamus and relayed from there through the internal capsule and transmitted to the somatosensory cortex the name dorsal column medial lemniscus comes from the two structures that carry the sensory information the dorsal columns of the spinal cord and the medial lemniscus in the brainstem there are three groupings of neurons that are involved in the pathway first order neurons second order neurons and third order neurons the first order neurons are sensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia that send their afferent fibers through the two dorsal columns the gracile fasciculus or gracile tract and the cuneate fasciculus or cuneate tract the first order axons make contact with second order neurons of the dorsal column nuclei the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus in the lower medulla the second order neurons send their axons

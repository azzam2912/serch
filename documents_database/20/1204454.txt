it forms green crystals the compound is produced on a large scale as a component of fertilizers and food additives like many monoxides mno adopts the rock salt structure where cations and anions are both octahedrally coordinated also like many oxides manganese ii oxide is often nonstoichiometric its composition can vary from mno to mno below 118 k mno is antiferromagnetic mno has the distinction of being one of the first compounds to have its magnetic structure determined by neutron diffraction the report appearing in 1951 this study showed that the mn ions form a face centered cubic magnetic sub lattice where there are ferromagnetically coupled sheets that are anti parallel with adjacent sheets manganese ii oxide undergoes the chemical reactions typical of an ionic oxide upon treatment with acids it converts to the corresponding manganese ii salt and water oxidation of manganese ii oxide gives manganese iii oxide mno occurs in nature as the rare mineral manganosite commercially it is prepared by reduction of mno with hydrogen carbon monoxide or methane e g mno can also be prepared by decarbonation of the carbonate this calcining process is conducted anaerobically lest mno form an alternative route mostly for demonstration purposes

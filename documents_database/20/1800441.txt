the technique dates back to at least the 1880s and results in fine grain increased perceived sharpness and smooth tonality but is time intensive and runs the risk of producing certain processing defects in traditional film development film is processed in concentrated development fluid for a brief period typically 8 to 12 minutes during this period the developing fluid is agitated often by inverting the development tank several times every few minutes this has the effect of spreading the developing fluid evenly over the surface of the film and preventing localised overdevelopment stand development instead uses a very dilute solution of developer often one part developer to fifty or one hundred parts water there is almost no agitation beyond initial mixing and developing times are greatly increased often an hour or more a related technique is semi stand development which uses a small amount of agitation stand development is noted for its perceived sharpness and relative simplicity the process was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was used by eugene atget and william mortensen among others it has a compensating effect in that the developer exhausts itself in areas which require greater development while remaining active

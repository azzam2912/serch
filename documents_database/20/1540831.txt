following immunisation the engineered antibody is expressed and taken up by dendritic cells resulting in the development of immune responses against tumour cells expressing the trp2 and gp100 antigens the major advantage of the immunobody technology is that the fc component of the engineered antibody will be recognised by the high affinity cd64 receptor present on dendritic cells leading to a significant enhancement of both the frequency and avidity of the t cell immune response the induction of high avidity t cells against trp 2 and gp100 destroys both primary and metastatic tumours leading to longer progression free survival phase i ii clinical trial of scib1 scancell is conducting a phase i ii clinical trial of scib1 its dna immunobody vaccine being developed for the treatment of melanoma the trial is being carried out at clinical sites in nottingham manchester guildford leeds and southampton the trial is an open label non randomised study to determine the safety and tolerability of four doses of scib1 administered intramuscularly using an electroporation device tds im manufactured by ichor medical systems usa the study will also assess immune effects and anti tumour activity in patients with melanoma the trial is being conducted in patients

the pinelli walckenaer atlas is explicitly dated 1384 according to its calendar but some scholars believe it to have been made a little later c 1410 two of the charts in the atlas the specific charts for the aegean and the adriatic were definitely later additions by someone else and not part of the original atlas one suggestion is that the latter two charts were made by the venetian cartographer francesco de cesanis around 1434 the calendar itself might date from 1458 the name of the atlas refers to its previous owners it was in the possession of the pinelli family of venice which owned the atlas for many years until it was purchased in 1790 by the baron charles athanase walckenaer of paris the pinelli walckenaer atlas is currently held by the british library add ms 19510 in london the pinelli walckenaer atlas is composed of seven sheets the first calendar sheet explicitly dates the atlas 1384 sheets 1 5 were made by the same anonymous person in the late 14th or early 15th century while sheets 6 7 were made by someone else possibly cesanis in the second quarter of the 15th century

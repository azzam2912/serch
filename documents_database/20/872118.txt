this procedure has been well established in the literature as a surgical intervention and is used to relieve negative symptoms of neuromuscular conditions such as spastic diplegia and other forms of spastic cerebral palsy the specific sensory nerves inducing spasticity are identified using electromyographic emg stimulation and graded on a scale of 1 mild to 4 severe spasticity abnormal nerve responses usually graded a 3 or 4 are isolated and cut thereby reducing symptoms of spasticity spasticity is defined as a velocity dependent increase in muscle tone in response to a stretch this upper motor neuron condition results from a lack of descending input from the brain that would normally release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid gaba which serves to dampen neuronal excitability in the nervous system spasticity is thought to be caused by an excessive increase of excitatory signals from sensory nerves without proper inhibition by gaba two common conditions associated with this lack of descending input are cerebral palsy and acquired brain injury dorsal rhizotomy selective dorsal rhizotomy sdr less often referred to as selective posterior rhizotomy spr is the most widely used form of rhizotomy and is today a primary treatment for spastic diplegia said

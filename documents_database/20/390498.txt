the programme is undertaken over four years students conduct phd equivalent research and undertake taught business and technical courses whilst working closely with an industrial sponsor successful candidates are awarded the degree of doctor of engineering engd and are addressed as doctor the first programmes began in 1992 in 2009 engineering doctorate schemes were offered by 45 uk universities both singly or in partnership with other universities as industrial doctorate centres students on the scheme are encouraged to describe themselves as research engineers rather than research students and as of 2009 the minimum funding level was 1 500 higher than the minimum funding level for phd students advocates of the scheme like to draw attention to the fact that engd students share some courses with mba students in the uk a similar formation to doctorate is the nvq 8 or qcf 8 however a doctoral degree typically incorporates a research project which must offer an original contribution to knowledge within an academic subject area an element which nvqs lack in summary an engd is essentially an engineering phd with a solid industrial base and an additional taught element countries following the german us model of education usually have similar requirements

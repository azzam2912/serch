he is a specialist on the properties of sulfur hexafluoride sf with an important patent and over 60 peer reviewed academic papers his most notable paper electron attachment to the perfluoroalkanes in journal of chemical physics 78 12 7200 7216 has been cited 88 times since its publication in 1983 in the early 1980s sauers developed a novel method by which to measure the degradation of sulfur hexafluoride sf in high voltage systems sf a hypervalent molecule is used as a gaseous insulator in conjunction with solid insulating material in high voltage systems such as transmission lines substations and switchgear when the dielectric strength of sf is exceeded regions of high electrical stress can cause nearby gas to partially ionize and begin conducting forming toxic products like sof or sf this method allows scientists to detect the toxic by products of sf breakdown at very low concentrations ppb using an ion molecule reaction cell and a negative ion mass spectrometer as opposed to conventional methods such as electron impact mass spectrometry ms gas chromatography gc with thermal conductivity detection gas chromatography with electron capture detection or a combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry

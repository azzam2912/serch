cobalamin is usually found in one of two biologically active forms methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin most prokaryotes as well as animals have cobalamin dependent enzymes whereas plants and fungi do not appear to use it in bacteria and archaea these enzymes include methionine synthase ribonucleotide reductase glutamate and methylmalonyl coa mutases ethanolamine ammonia lyase and diol dehydratase in certain mammals cobalamin is obtained through the diet and is required for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl coa mutase there are at least two distinct cobalamin biosynthetic pathways in bacteria either pathway can be divided into two parts there are about 30 enzymes involved in either pathway where those involved in the aerobic pathway are prefixed cob and those of the anaerobic pathway cbi several of these enzymes are pathway specific cbid cbig and cbik are specific to the anaerobic route of s typhimurium whereas cobe cobf cobg cobn cobs cobt and cobw are unique to the aerobic pathway of p denitrificans the cbib or cobd protein converts cobyric acid to cobinamide by the addition of aminopropanol on the f carboxylic group it is part of the cob operon aerobic cobalt chelatase consists of three subunits cobt cobn and cobs cobalamin vitamin b12 can

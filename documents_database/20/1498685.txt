many of these austrian wines were exported to germany some of them in bulk to be bottled at large scale german bottling facilities at these facilities some austrian wines were illegally blended into german wines by the importers resulting in diethylene glycol ending up in some bulk bottled german wines as well the scandal was uncovered by german wine laboratories performing quality controls on wines sold in germany and immediately made headlines around the world the affected wines were immediately withdrawn from the market a number of people involved in the scandal were sentenced to prison or heavy fines in austria and germany the short term effect of the scandal was a complete collapse of austrian wine exports and a total loss of reputation of the entire austrian wine industry with significant adverse effects on the reputation of german wines as well the long term effect was that the austrian wine industry focused their production on other wine types than previously primarily dry white wines instead of sweet wines and increasingly targeted a higher market segment but it took the austrian wine industry over a decade to recover much stricter wine laws were also enacted by austria at the time

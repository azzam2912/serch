formed by the largest schools in their predecessor conferences the conference only lasted nine years before disbanding the conference began in 1977 as schools from both the mississinewa valley conference and white river conference joined together this move was spurred by the then new class football playoff system where larger schools were awarded fewer points for playing small schools hurting their chances of a playoff spot both conferences had large enrollment disparities which did not benefit the larger schools this prompted three schools from each conference to start their own conference this would cause the end of both existing conferences the mvc was only a five member conference at this point and the a plan for the five remaining wrc schools to join with three schools from the big blue river and mid eastern conferences fell through so the seven schools ended up having to fend for themselves the newly formed conference only lasted in its original format for two years as mississinewa left for the more geographically compact central indiana athletic conference the remaining five schools continued their tenuous alliance although the same reason the conference formed attendance disparities plagued it through the rest of its existence anderson highland

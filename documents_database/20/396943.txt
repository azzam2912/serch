most atp is generated by oxidative phosphorylation in aerobic or anaerobic respiration while substrate level phosphorylation provides a quicker less efficient source of atp independent of external electron acceptors this is the case in human erythrocytes which have no mitochondria and in oxygen depleted muscle substrate level phosphorylation occurs in the cytoplasm of cells during glycolysis and in mitochondria either during the krebs cycle or by mthfd1l ec 6 3 4 3 an enzyme interconverting adp phosphate 10 formyltetrahydrofolate to atp formate tetrahydrofolate reversibly under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the pay off phase of glycolysis a net of 2 atp are produced by substrate level phosphorylation the first substrate level phosphorylation occurs after the conversion of 3 phosphoglyceraldehyde and pi and nad to 1 3 bisphosphoglycerate via glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase 1 3 bisphosphoglycerate is then dephosphorylated via phosphoglycerate kinase producing 3 phosphoglycerate and atp through a substrate level phosphorylation the second substrate level phosphorylation occurs by dephosphorylating phosphoenolpyruvate catalyzed by pyruvate kinase producing pyruvate and atp during the preparatory phase each 6 carbon glucose molecule is broken into two 3 carbon molecules thus in glycolysis dephosphorylation results in the production of 4 atp however the prior preparatory

the advert which appeared in print posters and cinema and television spots was conceived by irish advertising agency arks and starred relatively unknown irish actor joe mckinney as dancing man it was the final part of the guinness time advertising campaign which had been running in ireland since the late 1980s the advert was credited with increasing guinness sales market share and brand awareness figures however controversy arose following claims of plagiarism raised by british director mehdi norowzian who launched an unsuccessful lawsuit in 1998 seeking remuneration for the use of techniques and style from his 1992 short film joy the low budget ad featured only two characters a patron of a pub and the barman serving him the patron mckinney orders a pint of guinness stout and while waiting for the pint to be poured carries out a series of quirky dancing movements with the settling pint in the foreground to the amusement of the barman the piece ends with the patron taking his first sip of the freshly poured pint overlaid by the guinness advertising slogan no time like guinness time the advert is set to guaglione by p rez prado and makes heavy use of jump cutting

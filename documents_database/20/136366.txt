it is named after wac aw sierpi ski the sierpi ski space has important relations to the theory of computation and semantics because it is the classifying space for open sets in the scott topology explicitly the sierpi ski space is a topological space s whose underlying point set is 0 1 and whose open sets are the closed sets are so the singleton set 0 is closed and the set 1 is open empty set the closure operator on s is determined by a finite topological space is also uniquely determined by its specialization preorder for the sierpi ski space this preorder is actually a partial order and given by the sierpi ski space s is a special case of both the finite particular point topology with particular point 1 and the finite excluded point topology with excluded point 0 therefore s has many properties in common with one or both of these families let x be an arbitrary set the set of all functions from x to the set 0 1 is typically denoted 2 these functions are precisely the characteristic functions of x each such function is of the form where u is a subset of x

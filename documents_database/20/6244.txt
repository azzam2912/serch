ido was specifically designed to be grammatically orthographically and lexicographically regular and above all easy to learn and use in this sense ido is classified as a constructed international auxiliary language it is the most successful of many esperanto derivatives called esperantidos ido was created in 1907 out of a desire to reform perceived flaws in esperanto a language that had been created 20 years earlier to facilitate international communication the name of the language traces its origin to the esperanto word meaning offspring since the language is a descendant of esperanto after its inception ido gained support from some in the esperanto community but following the sudden death in 1914 of one of its most influential proponents louis couturat it declined in popularity there were two reasons for this first the emergence of further schisms arising from competing reform projects and second a general lack of awareness of ido as a candidate for an international language these obstacles weakened the movement and it was not until the rise of the internet that it began to regain momentum ido uses the same 26 letters as the english latin alphabet with no diacritics it draws its vocabulary from english french german

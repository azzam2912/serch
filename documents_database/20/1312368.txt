cleanrooms control impurities process control controls processing and burn in short term operation at extremes and probe and test reduce escapes probe wafer prober tests the semiconductor die prior to packaging via micro probes connected to test equipment final test tests the packaged device often pre and post burn in for a set of parameters that assure operation process and design weaknesses are identified by applying a set of stress tests in the qualification phase of the semiconductors before their market introduction e g according to the aec q100 and q101 stress qualifications parts average testing is a statistical method for recognizing and quarantining semiconductor die that have a higher probability of reliability failures this technique identifies characteristics that are within specification but outside of a normal distribution for that population as at risk outliers not suitable for high reliability applications tester based parts average testing varieties include parametric parts average testing p pat and geographical parts average testing g pat among others inline parts average testing i pat uses data from production process control inspection and metrology to perform the outlier recognition function bond strength measurement is performed in two basic types pull testing and shear testing both can

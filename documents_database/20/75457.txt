conversely as a non eutectic mixture cools down each mixture s component will solidify form its lattice at a distinct temperature until all material is solid the coordinates defining a eutectic point on a phase diagram are the eutectic percentage ratio on the atomic molecular ratio axis of the diagram and the eutectic temperature on the temperature axis of the diagram not all binary alloys have eutectic points because the valence electrons of the component species are not always compatible in any mixing ratio to form a new type of joint crystal lattice for example in the silver gold system the melt temperature liquidus and freeze temperature solidus meet at the pure element endpoints of the atomic ratio axis while slightly separating in the mixture region of this axis the term was coined in 1884 by british physicist and chemist frederick guthrie 1833 1886 the eutectic solidification is defined as follows this type of reaction is an invariant reaction because it is in thermal equilibrium another way to define this is the change in gibbs free energy equals zero tangibly this means the liquid and two solid solutions all coexist at the same time and are in chemical equilibrium there

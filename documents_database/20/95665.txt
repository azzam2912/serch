the first few elements of the sequence are shown then the ellipses indicate that the simplest interpretation should be applied for continuing the sequence should no terminating value appear to the right of the ellipses then the sequence is considered to be unbounded in general formula 6 denotes the set of all natural numbers formula 7 such that formula 8 another notation for formula 6 is the bracket notation formula 10 a subtle special case is formula 11 in which formula 12 is equal to the empty set formula 13 similarly formula 14 denotes the set of all formula 15 for formula 8 in each preceding example each set is described by enumerating its elements not all sets can be described in this way or if they can their enumeration may be too long or too complicated to be useful therefore many sets are defined by a property that characterizes their elements this characterization may be done informally using general prose as in the following example however the prose approach may lack accuracy or be ambiguous thus set builder notation is often used with a predicate characterizing the elements of the set being defined as described in the following section

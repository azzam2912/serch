cells of the primordium are called primordial cells a primordium is the simplest set of cells capable of triggering growth of the would be organ and the initial foundation from which an organ is able to grow in flowering plants a floral primordium gives rise to a flower although it is a frequently used term in plant biology the word is used in describing the biology of all multicellular organisms for example a tooth primordium in animals a leaf primordium in plants or a sporophore primordium in fungi plants produce both leaf and flower primordia cells at the shoot apical meristem sam primordium development in plants is critical to the proper positioning and development of plant organs and cells the process of primordium development is intricately regulated by a set of genes that affect the positioning growth and differentiation of the primordium genes including stm shoot meristemless and cuc cup shaped cotyledon are involved in defining the borders of the newly formed primordium the plant hormone auxin has also been implicated in this process with the new primordium being initiated at the placenta where the auxin concentration is highest there is still much to understand about the genes involved in

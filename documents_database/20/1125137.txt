the motivation for the mixed logit model arises from the limitations of the standard logit model the standard logit model has three primary limitations which mixed logit solves it obviates the three limitations of standard logit by allowing for random taste variation unrestricted substitution patterns and correlation in unobserved factors over time mixed logit can also utilize any distribution for the random coefficients unlike probit which is limited to the normal distribution it has been shown that a mixed logit model can approximate to any degree of accuracy any true random utility model of discrete choice given an appropriate specification of variables and distribution of coefficients the standard logit model s taste coefficients or formula 1 s are fixed which means the formula 1 s are the same for everyone mixed logit has different formula 1 s for each person i e each decision maker in the standard logit model the utility of person n for alternative i is with for the mixed logit model this specification is generalized by allowing formula 6 to be random the utility of person n for alternative i in the mixed logit model is with where are the parameters of the distribution of formula

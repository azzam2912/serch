it is the smallest field the two elements are nearly always called 0 and 1 being the additive and multiplicative identities respectively the field s addition operation is given by the table below which corresponds to the logical xor operation the field s multiplication operation corresponds to the logical and operation one may also define gf 2 as the quotient ring of the ring of integers z by the ideal 2z of all even numbers gf 2 z 2z because gf 2 is a field many of the familiar properties of number systems such as the rational numbers and real numbers are retained properties that are not familiar from the real numbers include because of the algebraic properties above many familiar and powerful tools of mathematics work in gf 2 just as well as other fields for example matrix operations including matrix inversion can be applied to matrices with elements in gf 2 see matrix ring any group v with the property v v 0 for every v in v i e every element is an involution is necessarily abelian and can be turned into a vector space over gf 2 in a natural fashion by defining 0 v 0

this volcanic center erupted after the voyager 1 flyby in 1979 making it one of the few planetary volcanoes known to have activated during this generation s lifetime further analysis and study by the galileo spacecraft helped with the overall study of io s volcanism galileo located it on io at zamama has a fissure fed type flow that is long with temperatures of and the volcanic center site has explosive and effusive eruption characteristics the flow appears to be emanating from the promethean type volcano remote sensing instruments built on the galileo spacecraft the near infrared mapping spectrometer nims solid state imager ssi photopolarimeter radiometer ppr collect and analyze volcanism on io s surface since there are no samples collected from io all of the interpretations are made by studying albedo effects morphology and or spectral variations in galileo data furthermore geomorphologic analysis is strictly used to study such specific planetary structures most of the data acquired from the jovian moon io was derived from geomorphologic interpretations of orbital imaging voyager 1 and galileo both used thermal remote sensing to accomplish this task thermal remote sensing is a branch of remote sensing which deals with processing and interpretations of

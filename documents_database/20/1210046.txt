more symbolically a set has the least upper bound property if every nonempty subset of the set that is bounded above has a least upper bound linear continua are particularly important in the field of topology where they can be used to verify whether an ordered set given the order topology is connected or not unlike the standard real line a linear continuum may be bounded on either side for example any real closed interval is a linear continuum examples in addition to the real numbers this map is known as the projection map the projection map is continuous with respect to the product topology on i i and is surjective let a be a nonempty subset of i i which is bounded above consider a since a is bounded above a must also be bounded above since a is a subset of i it must have a least upper bound since i has the least upper bound property therefore we may let b be the least upper bound of a if b belongs to a then b i will intersect a at say b c for some c i notice that since b i has the same order type

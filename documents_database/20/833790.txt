these two proteins are needed to block apoptosis in adenovirus infected cells e1b proteins work to prevent apoptosis that is induced by the small adenovirus e1a protein which stabilizes p53 a tumor suppressor e1b 19k blocks a p53 independent apoptosis mechanism without e1b 19k degradation of both cellular and viral dna occurs in addition to premature host cell death during the lytic cycle thus limiting viral replication e1b 19k mimics mcl1 which is a cellular antiapoptotic protein in infected cells the expression of e1a results in the degradation of mcl 1 which normally binds the propaptotic protein bak bak activation induces apoptosis by cooligomerizing with another proapoptotic protein bax together bak and bax form pores in the mitochondrial membrane releasing apoptogenic proteins like cytochrome c this and other proteins released from the mitochondria lead to activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 and the resulting apoptotic program however in adenovirus infected cells activated bak and bax are sequestered by e1b 19k preventing the pathway e1b 55k blocks p53 from inhibiting cell cycling and stops it from inducing apoptosis observations show that e1b 55k inhibits activation by p53 by binding a repression domain to it converting it from an activator to

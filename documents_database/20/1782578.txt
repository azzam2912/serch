combining photodynamic therapy with immunotherapy enhances the immunostimulating response and has synergistic effects for metastatic cancer treatment pit is type of molecular targeted cancer therapy which allows the selective destruction of cancer cells without any damage to normal tissues it is a light based cancer therapy which was developed and pioneered by professor julia levy and colleagues at the university of british columbia canada in 1983 professor julia levy s research has also been pivotal in the clinical approval of visudyne and photofrin over the last 35 years pit has been studied extensively in vitro and in vivo by numerous research teams all over the world more recently significant strides in pit have been made by professor kobayashi and his colleagues at national cancer institute bethesda maryland conventional photodynamic therapy pdt uses a non specific photosensitizer which can be activated by a non ionizing light to kill cancer cells photosensitizers are molecules that rapidly destroy cells though the production of reactive oxygen species ros when exposed to light at specific wavelength however this pdt treatment results in serious side effects because non targeted photosensitizers are also taken up by normal tissues pit treatment avoids the side effects problem through the

ngc 3256 is located about 100 million light years away and belongs to the hydra centaurus supercluster complex ngc 3256 provides a nearby template for studying the properties of young star clusters in tidal tails the system hides a double nucleus and a tangle of dust lanes in the central region the telltale signs of the collision are two extended luminous tails swirling out from the galaxy the tails are studded with a particularly high density of star clusters ngc 3256 is the most luminous galaxy in the infrared spectrum located within z 0 01 from earth ngc 3256 has double nuclei the northern and southern nucleus separated by 5 which at the distance of ngc 3256 corresponds to 850 pc the nuclei are clearly visible in radiowaves and mid infrared but the southern nucleus is hidden by dust lanes at the optical spectrum the two nuclei will coalesce as the merger proceeds to its final stage lipari et al note the presence of a third nucleus based on the presence of an obscured knot detected only at wavelengths 3 75 m which they suggest is a nuclear hii region there is evidence of an outflow of ionised gas from

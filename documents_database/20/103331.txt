the consensus view is that anglo saxon and scandinavian traditions describe the same people whereas the anglo saxon beowulf and widsith do not go further than treating his relationship with hro gar and their animosity with froda and ingeld the scandinavian sources expand on his life as the king at lejre and on his relationship with halga hro gar s brother in beowulf and widsith it is never explained how hro gar and hro ulf are uncle and nephew the poem beowulf introduces hro ulf as kinsman later the text explains that hro ulf is hro gar s nephew and that each was true to the other hro gar is given three siblings brothers heorogar and halga and an unnamed sister all the children of healfdene and belonging to the royal clan known as the scyldings the poem does not indicate which of hro gar s siblings is hro ulf s parent but later scandinavian tradition establishes this as halga hro gar and queen wealh eow had two young sons hre ric and hro mund and hro ulf would be their guardian in case hro gar dies in a deliberately ironic passage it appears that the queen trusts hro ulf

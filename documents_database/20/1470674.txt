the word means reversal in german the umkehr effect is observed when measurements are made with ultraviolet spectrophotometer of the ratio of the zenith sky light intensities of two wavelengths in the solar ultraviolet when the sun is near the horizon the shorter of two wavelengths intensity i is strongly absorbed and other intensity i is weakly absorbed if the value of log i i is plotted against the sun s zenith angle it is observed that this log intensity ratio decreases as the zenith angle increases until a minimum is reached for a zenith angle of about 8 when the wavelengths are 3114 and 3324 a this effect was first noticed by g tz in 1930 the umkehr measurement is known as customarily n value and is given by the logarithm base 10 of the ratio of cloudless zenith sky intensities at two different wavelengths scaled by a multiplicative factor 100 plus a constant which depends on instruments and extraterrestrial radiation methods for deriving vertical distribution from the umkehr measurements were developed by g tz dobson and meetham in 1934 using the dobson ozone spectrophotometer developed by gordon dobson in 1964 carlton mateer provided analysis on information content in

the various genera in nephilinae were formerly grouped in the family nephilidae and before that in the tetragnathidae and in the araneidae where they have been restored all nephiline genera partially renew their webs spiders in the subfamily nephilinae are commonly referred to as golden orb weavers the genera herennia nephilengys and nephilingis display extreme sexually driven selection the pedipalps of these genera have become highly derived by evolving enlarged complex palpal bulbs which break off inside the females copulatory openings after copulation the broken palps serve as mating plugs which makes future matings with a mated female more difficult these genera of spiders also participate in mate guarding a mated male will stand guard by his female and chase off other males thereby increasing the mated male s paternity share mated males are castrated in the process of mate plugging though this may be an advantage in mate guarding as mated males have been observed to fight more aggressively and win more frequently than virgin males so while the female spiders are still at least potentially polygamous the males have become monogamous up to the late 1980s following eug ne simon in 1894 nephila and its close relatives were

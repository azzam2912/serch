the flow profiles was first derived by john r womersley 1907 1958 in his work with blood flow in arteries the cardiovascular system of chordate animals is a very good example where pulsatile flow is found but pulsatile flow is also observed in engines and hydraulic systems as a result of rotating mechanisms pumping the fluid the pulsatile flow profile is given in a straight pipe by where the pulsatile flow profile changes its shape depending on the womersley number for formula 3 viscous forces dominate the flow and the pulse is considered quasi static with a parabolic profile for formula 4 the inertial forces are dominant in the central core whereas viscous forces dominate near the boundary layer thus the velocity profile gets flattened and phase between the pressure and velocity waves gets shifted towards the core the bessel function at its lower limit becomes which converges to the hagen poiseuille flow profile for steady flow for or to a quasi static pulse with parabolic profile when in this case the function is real because the pressure and velocity waves are in phase the bessel function at its upper limit it becomes which converges to this is highly reminiscent

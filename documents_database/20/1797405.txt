the molecule is isolated from the roots of rubia cordifolia and was first characterized in 1993 in 2004 the first synthesis of rubicordifolin was accomplished the molecule has been shown to have cytotoxic properties in vitro a biosynthetic pathway for rubicordifolin has yet been elucidated however it has been hypothesized that the dimerization of the two naphthoquinone units yields rubicordifolin naphthoquinones can be traced back to the shikimate pathway in plants shikimate is converted into chorismic acid which is further converted into 2 succinylbenzoic acid through a tpp dependent reaction after 2 succinylbenzoic acid has been produced a cyclization a prenylation a methylation and an oxidation occur which yields a naphthoquinone once this naphhthoquinone has been made a series of oxidations and cyclizations lead to two substrates that can undergo a 4 2 cycloaddition that leads to the product the trauner group at uc berkeley completed a synthesis of rubicordifolin in 2004 the synthesis of the natural product dubbed a biomimetic synthesis takes inspiration from the proposed dimerization of two naphthoquinones units mechanistically it is proposed that the phenylboronic acid promotes a cyclization that is followed by a diels alder reaction to yield the final product studies of rubicordifolin demonstrate

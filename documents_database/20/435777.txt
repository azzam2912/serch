it is a complex analytic function on the m fold product of upper half planes formula 1 satisfying a certain kind of functional equation let f be a totally real number field of degree m over the rational field let formula 2 be the real embeddings of f through them we have a map let formula 4 be the ring of integers of f the group formula 5 is called the full hilbert modular group for every element formula 6 there is a group action of formula 7 defined by formula 8 for define a hilbert modular form of weight formula 11 is an analytic function on formula 12 such that for every formula 13 unlike the modular form case no extra condition is needed for the cusps because of koecher s principle these modular forms for real quadratic fields were first treated in the 1901 g ttingen university habilitationssschrift of otto blumenthal there he mentions that david hilbert had considered them initially in work from 1893 4 which remained unpublished blumenthal s work was published in 1903 for this reason hilbert modular forms are now often called hilbert blumenthal modular forms the theory remained dormant for some decades erich

supported processors implement the nehalem microarchitecture and therefore have an integrated memory controller imc so the x58 does not have a memory interface initially supported processors were the core i7 but the chip also supported nehalem and westmere based xeon processors the quickpath architecture differs considerably from earlier intel architectures and is much closer to amd s hypertransport architecture except for the lack of a memory interface the x58 is similar to the traditional northbridge it communicates with the processor s via the high bandwidth quickpath interconnect it communicates with the southbridge via direct media interface dmi and it communicates with high bandwidth peripherals via pci express pcie the x58 is not a memory controller hub mch because it has no memory interface so intel calls it an i o hub this should not be confused with the similar term i o controller hub ich which has traditionally been used to refer to the southbridge chips intel documentation now refers to the southbridge as the legacy i o controller hub the x58 has 36 pcie lanes that are arranged in two 16 links dmi link and spare based link when used with the ich10 i o controller hub with 4

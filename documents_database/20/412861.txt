by 2 cultivar bright yellow 2 of the tobacco plant tobacco by 2 cells are nongreen fast growing plant cells which can multiply their numbers up to 100 fold within one week in adequate culture medium and good culture conditions this cultivar of tobacco is kept as a cell culture and more specifically as cell suspension culture a specialized population of cells growing in liquid medium they are raised by scientists in order to study a specific biological property of a plant cell in cell suspension cultures each of the cells is floating independently or at most only in short chains in a culture medium each of the cells has similar properties to the others the model plant system is comparable to hela cells for human research because the organism is relatively simple and predictable it makes the study of biological processes easier and can be an intermediate step towards understanding more complex organisms they are used by plant physiologists and molecular biologists as a model organism they are used as model systems for higher plants because of their relatively high homogeneity and high growth rate featuring still general behaviour of plant cell the diversity of cell types within any

oscillons in granular media result from vertically vibrating a plate with a layer of uniform particles placed freely on top when the sinusoidal vibrations are of the correct amplitude and frequency and the layer of sufficient thickness a localized wave referred to as an oscillon can be formed by locally disturbing the particles this meta stable state will remain for a long time many hundreds of thousands of oscillations in the absence of further perturbation an oscillon changes form with each collision of the grain layer and the plate switching between a peak that projects above the grain layer to a crater like depression with a small rim this self sustaining state was named by analogy with the soliton which is a localized wave that maintains its integrity as it moves whereas solitons occur as travelling waves in a fluid or as electromagnetic waves in a waveguide oscillons may be stationary oscillons of opposite phase will attract over short distances and form bonded pairs oscillons of like phase repel oscillons have been observed forming molecule like structures and long chains in comparison solitons do not form bound states stable interacting localized waves with subharmonic response were discovered and named oscillons

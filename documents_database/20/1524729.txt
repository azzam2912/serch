it produces an animal s mesenchyme cells at the onset of gastrulation during the epithelial mesenchymal transition emt the primary mesenchyme cells pmcs detach from the epithelium and become internalized mesenchyme cells that can migrate freely figure 1 each animal system utilizes an emt to produce mesenchyme cells while the mechanisms of ingression are not fully understood studies using the sea urchin as a model organism have begun to shed light on this developmental process and will be the focus here there are three main changes that must occur within a cell to enable the process of ingression the ingressing pmcs must first alter their affinity for the neighboring epithelial cells that will remain in the vegetal plate vertebrate pmcs ingress from the primitive streak during this time these cells must lose their affinity for the hyaline layer to which their apical surface is attached the ingressing cells will then apically constrict and alter their cellular architecture through a dramatic reorganization of their cytoskeleton lastly these cells will modify their mode of motility and presumably gain affinity for the basal lamina which composes the lining of the blastocoel the future migration substrate of the pmcs changes in the adhesion properties

they are the largest linear cationic amphipathic peptides detected in the venom of any spider they are structurally helical peptides the first five peptides namely oxyopinins 1 2a 2b 2c and 2d were described in 2002 from oxyopes kitabensis oxyopinin 1 is composed of 48 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 5221 2 da it has significant amino acid sequence similarity to other venoms of other animals for example it has 20 sequence similarity with the ant insecticidal peptide ponericinl2 it is also 29 identical to the amino acid residues of the frog antimicrobial peptide dermaseptin oxyopinins 2a 2b 2c and 2d originally designated oxyopinins 2 3 4 and 5 respectively are very similar in their sequences at least 27 out of 37 their amino acid residues are conserved that is identical their molecular sizes are 4127 1 4146 9 4064 7 and 4156 8 da respectively all the oxyopinins indicate their secondary structure essentially as alpha helical they cause disruption of both biological membranes and artificial vesicles particularly to those rich in phosphatidylcholine they act together with neurotoxins called oxytoxins from the same venom for increased effectiveness as insecticide the sixth peptide oxyopinin 4a oxt 4a was

in its simplest form a single write laser beam is shot once through the sample space along its path an optically induced chemical process is initiated resulting in the creation of a new chemical species or in changing the internal energy state of an existing one so that the molecules struck by the laser beam can be distinguished from the rest of the fluid such molecules are said to be tagged this line of tagged molecules is now transported by the fluid flow to obtain velocity information images at two instances in time are obtained and analyzed often by correlation of the image intensities to determine the displacement if the flow is three dimensional or turbulent the line will not only be displaced it will also be deformed there are three optical ways via which these tagged molecules can be visualized fluorescence phosphorescence and laser induced fluorescence lif in all three cases molecules relax to a lower state and their excess energy is released as photons in fluorescence this energy decay occurs rapidly within formula 1 s to formula 2 s at atmospheric pressure thus making direct fluorescence impractical for tagging in phosphorescence the decay is slower because the transition

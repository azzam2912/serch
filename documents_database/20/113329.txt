most species make little use of webs instead spending their lives as hunting spiders on plants many species frequent flowers in particular ambushing pollinators much as crab spiders do they tend to tolerate members of their own species more than most spiders do and at least one species has been identified as exhibiting social behaviour there are several genera of oxyopidae and they differ in their habits and adaptations most of them have large spiny bristles on their legs and in many species the bristles form almost a basket like structure that may assist in confining the prey that they grasp and protect the spider from its struggles most oxyopes and hamataliwa species are small to medium in size they tend to be drab ambush hunters depending to some extent on the season some occupy flowers ambushing pollinating insects in this they resemble the crab spiders thomisidae in behaviour others crouch in wait camouflaged on plant stalks or bark peucetia species on the other hand commonly are larger they are rangy and their camouflage is vivid green adapted to hunting or hiding among foliage lynx spiders in spite of being largely ambush hunters are very speedy runners and leapers alert

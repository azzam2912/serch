the word asymptotos in greek means non coincident and puts strong emphasis on the point that approximation does not turn into coincidence it is a salient feature of asymptotics but this property alone does not entirely cover the idea of asymptotics and etymologically the term seems to be quite insufficient in physics and other fields of science one frequently comes across problems of an asymptotic nature such as damping orbiting stabilization of a perturbed motion etc their solutions lend themselves to asymptotic analysis perturbation theory which is widely used in modern applied mathematics mechanics and physics but asymptotic methods put a claim on being more than a part of classical mathematics k friedrichs said asymptotic description is not only a convenient tool in the mathematical analysis of nature it has some more fundamental significance m kruskal introduced the special term asymptotology defined above and called for a formalization of the accumulated experience to convert the art of asymptotology to a science in addition the success of cybernetics attractors and catastrophe theory illustrates the fruitfulness of word creation as scientific research almost every physical theory formulated in the most general manner is rather difficult from a mathematical point of view therefore

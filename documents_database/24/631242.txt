this defines a flow path through which air travels which is set into vibration to produce sounds the shape of the bore has a strong influence on the instrument s timbre the cone and the cylinder are the two idealized shapes used to describe the bores of wind instruments instruments may consist of a primarily cylindrical tube ending in a flare or bell these shapes affect the prominence of harmonics associated with the timbre of the instrument the diameter of a cylindrical bore remains constant along its length the acoustic behavior depends on whether the instrument is stopped closed at one end and open at the other or open at both ends for an open pipe the wavelength produced by the first normal mode the fundamental note is approximately twice the length of the pipe the wavelength produced by the second normal mode is half that that is the length of the pipe so its pitch is an octave higher thus an open cylindrical bore instrument overblows at the octave this corresponds to the second harmonic and generally the harmonic spectrum of an open cylindrical bore instrument is strong in both even and odd harmonics for a stopped pipe the

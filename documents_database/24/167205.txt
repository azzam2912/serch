these services give the subscriber the capacity required to transmit appropriate signals between certain access points i e user network interfaces the bearer services include the following bearer services gsm specifies different mechanisms for data transmission the original gsm allowing for data rates of up to 9600 bit s for non voice services bearer services permit transparent and non transparent synchronous or asynchronous data transmission transparent bearer services only use the functions of the physical layer layer 1 to transmit data data transmission has a constant delay and throughput if no transmission errors occur the only mechanism to increase transmission quality is the use of forward error correction fec which codes redundancy into the data stream and helps to reconstruct the original data in case of transmission errors depending on the fec data rates of 2 4 4 8 or 9 6 kbit s are possible transparent bearer services do not try to recover lost data in case of for example shadowing or interruptions due to handover non transparent bearer services use protocols of layers two and three to implement error correction and flow control these services use the transparent bearer services adding a radio link protocol rlp this protocol

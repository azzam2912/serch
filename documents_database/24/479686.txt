the loop current is an extension of the western boundary current of the north atlantic subtropical gyre serving as the dominant circulation feature in the eastern gulf of mexico the loop currents transports between 23 and 27 sverdrups and reaches maximum flow speeds of from 1 5 to 1 8 meters second a related feature is an area of warm water with an eddy or loop current ring that separates from the loop current somewhat randomly every 3 to 17 months swirling at 1 8 to 2 meters second these rings drift to the west at speeds of 2 to 5 kilometers day and have a lifespan of up to a year before they bump into the coast of texas or mexico these eddies are composed of warm caribbean waters and possess physical properties that isolate the masses from surrounding gulf common waters the rings can measure 200 to 400 kilometers in diameter and extend down to a depth of 1000 meters around 1970 it was believed that the loop current exhibited an annual cycle in which the loop feature extended farther to the north during the summer further study over the past few decades however has shown that the

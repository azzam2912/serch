branches of the central arteries are given to the red pulp and these are called penicillar arteries the lienal artery is remarkable for its large size in proportion to the size of the organ and also for its tortuous course it divides into six or more branches which enter the hilum of the spleen and ramify throughout its substance receiving sheaths from an involution of the external fibrous tissue similar sheaths also invest the nerves and veins each branch runs in the transverse axis of the organ from within outward diminishing in size during its transit and giving off in its passage smaller branches some of which pass to the anterior others to the posterior part these ultimately leave the trabecular sheaths and terminate in the proper substance of the spleen in small tufts or pencils of minute arterioles which open into the interstices of the reticulum formed by the branched sustentacular cells each of the larger branches of the artery supplies chiefly that region of the organ in which the branch ramifies having no anastomosis with the majority of the other branches the arterioles supported by the minute trabeculae traverse the pulp in all directions in bundles penicilli of

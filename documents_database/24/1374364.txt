low contrast areas are replaced by a gray background the filtered image will represent the rate of color change at each location of the original image applying an embossing filter to an image often results in an image resembling a paper or metal embossing of the original image hence the name the emboss filter also called a directional difference filter will enhance edges in the direction of the selected convolution mask s when the emboss filter is applied the filter matrix is in convolution calculation with the same square area on the original image so it involves a large amount of calculation when either the image size or the emboss filter mask dimension is large the emboss filter repeats the calculation as encoded in the filter matrix for every pixel in the image the procedure itself compares the neighboring pixels on the image leaving a mark where a sharp change in pixel value is detected in this way the marks form a line following an object s contour the process yields an embossed image with edges highlighted four primary emboss filter masks are formula 1 formula 2 formula 3 formula 4 according to the need to enhance edge details from

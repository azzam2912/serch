the statement of post s theorem uses several concepts relating to definability and recursion theory this section gives a brief overview of these concepts which are covered in depth in their respective articles the arithmetical hierarchy classifies certain sets of natural numbers that are definable in the language of peano arithmetic a formula is said to be formula 1 if it is an existential statement in prenex normal form all quantifiers at the front with formula 2 alternations between existential and universal quantifiers applied to a formula with bounded quantifiers only formally a formula formula 3 in the language of peano arithmetic is a formula 1 formula if it is of the form where formula 6 contains only bounded quantifiers and q is formula 7 if m is even and formula 8 if m is odd a set of natural numbers a is said to be formula 9 if it is definable by a formula 9 formula that is if there is a formula 9 formula formula 3 such that each number n is in a if and only if formula 13 holds it is known that if a set is formula 9 then it is formula 15 for any

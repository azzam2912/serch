it is a special case of generalized quantifier in classical logic quantifier prefixes are linearly ordered such that the value of a variable y bound by a quantifier q depends on the value of the variables bound by quantifiers preceding q in a logic with finite partially ordered quantification this is not in general the case branching quantification first appeared in a 1959 conference paper of leon henkin systems of partially ordered quantification are intermediate in strength between first order logic and second order logic they are being used as a basis for hintikka s and gabriel sandu s independence friendly logic the simplest henkin quantifier formula 2 is it in fact every formula with a henkin prefix not just the simplest one is equivalent to its second order skolemization i e it is also powerful enough to define the quantifier formula 5 i e there are infinitely many defined as several things follow from this including the nonaxiomatizability of first order logic with formula 2 first observed by ehrenfeucht and its equivalence to the formula 8 fragment of second order logic existential second order logic the latter result published independently in 1970 by herbert enderton and w walkoe the

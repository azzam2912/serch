the parameters a b c are calculated by trial and error letting then the period of one of the herman ring of g is 3 shishikura also given an example a rational function which possesses a herman ring with period 2 but the parameters showed above are different from his so there is a question how to find the formulas of the rational functions which possess herman rings with higher period according to the result of shishikura if a rational function possesses a herman ring then the degree of is at least 3 there also exist meromorphic functions that possess herman rings herman rings for transcendental meromorphic functions have been studied by t nayak according to a result of nayak if there is an omitted value for such a function then herman rings of period 1 or 2 do not exist also it is proved that if there is only a single pole and at least an omitted value the function has no herman ring of any period

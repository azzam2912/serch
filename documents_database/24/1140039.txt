the effector domain may be a transcriptional activator a or repressor r a methylation domain m or a nuclease n modification of the endogenous dna binding zinc finger domain is the basis of the most advanced field in construction of gene specific artificial transcription factors linking together six zfps produces a target site of 18 19 bp assuming specificity to that one sequence and that the sequence of the genome is random 18 bp is long enough to be unique in all known genomes indeed the spacing between subsites becomes part of the target sequence due to restrictions in the flexibility of the protein which can be controlled targeting sites as small as 9 bp provides some degree of specificity almost certainly attributable in some part to chromatin occlusion depending upon the requirements of the investigation there are several techniques available to define a dna recognition domain that will confer the specificity of a zfp based transcription factor three phage display strategies have been described involving either parallel sequential or bipartite selection of the constituent zinc fingers the parallel selection fig 1 a approach assumes that the individual zinc finger domains are functionally independent on this basis existing predetermined domains

free logics may allow for terms that do not denote any object free logics may also allow models that have an empty domain a free logic with the latter property is an inclusive logic in classical logic there are theorems that clearly presuppose that there is something in the domain of discourse consider the following classically valid theorems a valid scheme in the theory of equality which exhibits the same feature is informally if f is y g is is pegasus and we substitute pegasus for y then 4 appears to allow us to infer from everything identical with pegasus is pegasus that something is identical with pegasus the problem comes from substituting nondesignating constants for variables in fact we cannot do this in standard formulations of first order logic since there are no nondesignating constants classically x x y is deducible from the open equality axiom y y by particularization i e 3 above in free logic 1 is replaced with similar modifications are made to other theorems with existential import e g the rule of particularization becomes ar e r xax axiomatizations of free logic are given by theodore hailperin 1957 jaakko hintikka 1959 karel lambert 1967 and

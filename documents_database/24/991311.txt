his name is associated with the description of the pi bond between transition metals and alkenes the dewar chatt duncanson model chatt received his ph d at the university of cambridge under the direction of f g mann for research on organoarsenic and organophosphorus compounds and their complexes with transition metals he was employed at imperial chemical industries from 1949 to 1962 during which time he often in collaboration with bernard l shaw published influential work on the metal hydrides and metal alkene complexes during this period he reported the first example of c h bond activation by a transition metal and one of the first examples of a transition metal hydride in the 1960s chatt moved to a professorship at the university of sussex and subsequently assumed directorship of the nitrogen fixation unit under the agricultural research council using the transition metal dinitrogen complex w n dppe his group first demonstrated the conversion of a dinitrogen ligand into ammonia this work provided some of the first molecular models for nitrogen fixation among his many awards he was recognized with the 1981 wolf prize for pioneering and fundamental contributions to synthetic transition metal chemistry particularly transition metal hydrides and dinitrogen

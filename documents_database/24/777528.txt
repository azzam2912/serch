the underlying method constructs a signed distance field that extends from the boundary and can be used to solve the motion of the boundary in this field the powerful level set method is due to osher and sethian 1988 however the straightforward implementation via a dense d dimensional array of values results in both time and storage complexity of formula 1 where formula 2 is the cross sectional resolution of the spatial extents of the domain and formula 3 is the number of spatial dimensions of the domain the narrow band level set method introduced in 1995 by adalsteinsson and sethian restricted most computations to a thin band of active voxels immediately surrounding the interface thus reducing the time complexity in three dimensions to formula 4 for most operations periodic updates of the narrowband structure to rebuild the list of active voxels were required which entailed an formula 5 operation in which voxels over the entire volume were accessed the storage complexity for this narrowband scheme was still formula 6 differential constructions over the narrow band domain edge require careful interpolation and domain alteration schemes to stabilise the solution this formula 5 time complexity was eliminated in the approximate sparse

understanding the geodynamic processes in which these terranes are created is key to understanding the development and subsequent deformation of the bns and eurasian deformation as a whole with an average elevation of just above 5 000 m the tibetan plateau is the largest elevated region on earth explaining how such a large area 2 5 million km can have such high elevations has perplexed geologists for some time it is known that significant tectonic activity took place before the indo asian collision as terranes were being accreted onto the eurasian plate during the late jurassic early cretaceous but the extent of deformation and the influence these earlier tectonic events had on the subsequent evolution of the tibetan plateau is poorly understood in search of clues geologists have looked to the high pressure terranes outcropping along suture zones to find answers the bangong nujiang suture in particular features extensive high pressure terranes throughout much of its length there are multiple processes that can lead to the development of high pressure terranes first upper crustal rocks have to be carried to great depths nearing the mantle boundary this could be accomplished by continental margin subduction microcontinent subduction sediment subduction intracontinental subduction

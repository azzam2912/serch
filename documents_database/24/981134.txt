hyphomycetes lack closed fruit bodies and are often referred to as moulds or molds most hyphomycetes are now assigned to the ascomycota on the basis of genetic connections made by life cycle studies or by phylogenetic analysis of dna sequences many remain unassigned phylogenetically identification of hyphomycetes is primarily based on microscopic morphology including conidial morphology especially septation shape size colour and cell wall texture the arrangement of conidia as they are borne on the conidiogenous cells e g if they are solitary arthrocatenate blastocatenate basocatenate or gloiosporae the type conidiogenous cell e g non specialized or hypha like phialide annellide or sympodial and other additional features such as the presence of sporodochia or synnemata because asexual forms of fungi usually occur separately from their sexual forms when microscopic fungi began to be studied in the early 19th century it was often unknown when two morphologically different forms were actually part of one species the tendency for some organisms to apparently only have asexual forms or for their sexual forms to be discovered long after the asexual forms meant that an independent taxonomy was developed for asexual fungi near the beginning of the 20th century when it became clearer that

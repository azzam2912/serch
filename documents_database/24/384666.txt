this planet is a part of the so called noon universe and presents a planetwide experimental laboratory used by null physicists scientists working on null t a sort of teleportation used in the noon universe since the second half of the 22nd century it isn t clear when it was discovered but presumably somewhere between 2146 and 2154 ad rainbow is a very comfortable planet with a moderate climate a calm atmosphere little seismic activity and a rather phlegmatic native fauna there is only one continent in the northern hemisphere and some small archipelagos in the south one which is covered with an ocean remarkably the coastal line between the southern ocean and the northern continent roughly coincides with the equator rainbow didn t have a native intelligent species until it was discovered by earth s explorers shortly after that it was inhabited by null physicists scientists studying the null t teleportation the null t was an urgent and promising problem in the 50s but it was also quite dangerous see below the wave so the government of earth decided to move all null physicists to another planet where they could carry out their experiments without endangering the rest of

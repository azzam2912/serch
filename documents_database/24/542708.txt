the dancer uses their arms to support their body above the floor while moving their legs in a circle the 6 step is foundational to b boying not only because it is the first footwork sequence breakers often learn but also because it remains the move around which many sets are structured many break moves can begin from the 6 step the move sets up the direction of rotation and builds momentum while imparting body control the breaker stays low and in contact with the ground which places him in perfect position for performing other moves each of the six distinct steps puts the body in a different position which can be used as starting points for other moves steps 1 2 and 3 4 described below are most often used for launching other moves conversely any move which ends on the ground can be transitioned smoothly back into the 6 step the body position after step 2 and step 4 are mirror images of each other six step often involves looking straight ahead constantly and placing the feet in the same place for each rotation but can be done with your body facing a different direction for each rotation

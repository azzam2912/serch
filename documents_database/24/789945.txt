this mixture which can have an overall copper concentration within the range of 1 through 20 is used as a fungicidal spray for trees and small fruits similar to the bordeaux mixture one of the earliest fungicides in use burgundy mixture also known as sal soda bordeaux is used as a fungus preventative applicant on plants before fungi have appeared bordeaux mixture contains copper ii sulfate cuso and hydrated lime ca oh while burgundy mixture contains copper sulphate cuso and sodium carbonate naco first used around 1885 burgundy mixture has since been replaced by synthetic organic compounds or by compounds that contain copper in a non reactive chelated form this helps to prevent the accumulation of high levels of copper in sediments surrounding the plants burgundy mixture is made by combining dissolved copper sulphate and dissolved sodium carbonate dissolved copper sulphate ratios generally range from 1 1 to 1 18 sodium carbonate is generally added in higher quantities and at a dissolved ratio of 1 1 5 over time the sodium carbonate will crystallize out of solution and the closer the copper sulphate to carbonate mixture is to 1 1 ratios the faster this process occurs this property is one

the overall process generally takes place over several steps involving coupled rotations about several of the molecule s single bonds in conjunction with minor deformations of bond angles most commonly the term is used to refer to the interconversion of the two chair conformers of cyclohexane derivatives which is specifically referred to as a chair flip although other cycloalkanes and inorganic rings undergo similar processes cyclohexane is a prototype for low energy degenerate ring flipping the chair is the strongly preferred conformation two h nmr signals should be observed in principle corresponding to axial and equatorial protons however due to the cyclohexane chair flip only one signal is seen for a solution of cyclohexane at room temperature as the axial and equatorial proton rapidly interconvert relative to the nmr time scale the coalescence temperature at 60 mhz is ca 60 c the molecular motions involved in a chair flip are detailed in the figure on the right the half chair conformation d 10 8 kcal mol c symmetry is the energy maximum when proceeding from the chair conformer a 0 kcal mol reference d symmetry to the higher energy twist boat conformer b 5 5 kcal mol d symmetry the

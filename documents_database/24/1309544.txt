the dri is a dimensionless number which is proportional to the maximum spinal compression suffered during the event the dri is derived as the solution to an equation which models the human spine as a lumped single degree of freedom spring shock absorber system the model uses an ordinary linear second order differential equation with constant coefficients with spinal compression as the variable the forcing function in the equation is the accelerative shock load delivered to the pelvis by the event the equation is given below formula 1 in this equation x denotes the spinal compression and dz dt denotes the time dependent shock acceleration the input the coefficients and are the lumped spinal frequency and damping 52 90 radians second 0 224 the dri is defined in terms of the maximum spinal compression x calculated from the differential equation dri g x where g is the acceleration of gravity 9 806 m s the dri measure was derived from research on cadavers as well as from willing volunteers essentially aviators who activated the ejection seat mechanism the limiting dri value according to nato stanag 4569 is 17 7 with a 10 chance of serious injury this corresponds to a

the total area of bottom covered with hypoxic waters with oxygen concentrations less than 2 mg l in the baltic sea has averaged 49 000 km over the last 40 years the ultimate cause of hypoxia is excess nutrient loading from human activities causing algal blooms the blooms sink to the bottom and use oxygen to decompose at a rate faster than it can be added back into the system through the physical processes of mixing the lack of oxygen anoxia kills bottom living organisms and creates dead zones the rapid increase in hypoxia in coastal areas around the world is due to the excessive inputs of plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus by human activities the sources of these nutrients include agriculture sewage and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen containing compounds from the burning of fossil fuels the nutrients stimulate the growth of algae causing problems with eutrophication the algae sink to the bottom and use the oxygen when they decompose if mixing of the bottom waters is slow such that oxygen stocks are not renewed hypoxia can occur the total area of bottom covered with hypoxic waters with oxygen concentrations less than 2 mg l in the baltic

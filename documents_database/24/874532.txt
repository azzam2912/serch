this result is not related to the well known craig interpolation theorem although both results are named after the same logician william craig let formula 1 be an enumeration of the axioms of a recursively enumerable set t of first order formulas construct another set t consisting of for each positive integer i the deductive closures of t and t are thus equivalent the proof will show that t is a decidable set a decision procedure for t lends itself according to the following informal reasoning each member of t is either formula 3 or of the form since each formula has finite length it is checkable whether or not it is formula 3 or of the said form if it is of the said form and consists of j conjuncts it is in t if the reoccurring conjunct is formula 6 otherwise it is not in t again it is checkable whether the conjunct is in fact formula 7 by going through the enumeration of the axioms of t and then checking symbol for symbol whether the expressions are identical the proof above shows that for each recursively enumerable set of axioms there is a recursive set of axioms

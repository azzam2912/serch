often such a length is used as an input to a formula in order to predict some characteristics of the system examples in computational mechanics a characteristic length is defined to force localization of a stress softening constitutive equation the length is associated with an integration point for 2d analysis it is calculated by taking the square root of the area for 3d analysis it is calculated by taking the cubic root of the volume associated to the integration point the general formula for the characteristic length is the volume of a system divided by its surface formula 1 a typical use case is calculating flow through circular and non circular tubes in order to examine flow conditions i e the reynolds number in those cases the characteristic length is the diameter of the pipe or in case of non circular tubes its hydraulic diameter formula 2 formula 3 where formula 4 is the cross sectional area of the pipe and formula 5 is its wetted perimeter it is defined such that it reduces to a circular diameter of d for circular pipes for flow through a square duct with a side length of a the hydraulic diameter formula 2

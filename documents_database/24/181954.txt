evaluated at a particular point of the parameter vector the score indicates the steepness of the log likelihood function and thereby the sensitivity to infinitesimal changes to the parameter values if the log likelihood function is continuous over the parameter space the score will vanish at a local maximum or minimum this fact is used in maximum likelihood estimation to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function since the score is a function of the observations that are subject to sampling error it lends itself to a test statistic known as score test in which the parameter is held at a particular value further the ratio of two likelihood functions evaluated at two distinct parameter values can be understood as a definite integral of the score function the score is the gradient the vector of partial derivatives of formula 1 the natural logarithm of the likelihood function with respect to an m dimensional parameter vector formula 2 thus differentiation yields a formula 4 row vector and indicates the sensitivity of the likelihood its derivative normalized by its value in older literature the term linear score may be used to refer to the score with respect to infinitesimal translation

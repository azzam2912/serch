dynamos were the first electrical generators capable of delivering power for industry and the foundation upon which many other later electric power conversion devices were based including the electric motor the alternating current alternator and the rotary converter today the simpler alternator dominates large scale power generation for efficiency reliability and cost reasons a dynamo has the disadvantages of a mechanical commutator also converting alternating to direct current using power rectification devices such as vacuum tubes or more recently via solid state technology is effective and usually economical the word dynamo from the greek word dynamis meaning force or power was originally another name for an electrical generator and still has some regional usage as a replacement for the word generator the word dynamo was coined in 1831 by michael faraday who utilized his invention toward making many discoveries in electricity faraday discovered electrical induction and magnetism the original dynamo principle of werner von siemens referred only to the direct current generators which use exclusively the self excitation self induction principle to generate dc power the earlier dc generators which used permanent magnets were not considered dynamo electric machines the invention of the dynamo principle self induction was a huge

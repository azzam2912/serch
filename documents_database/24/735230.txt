launch would have taken place on october 31 1973 with a venus flyby on march 3 1974 and return to earth on december 1 1974 the proposed mission would use a saturn v to send three astronauts to fly past venus in a flight which would last approximately one year the s ivb stage would be a wet workshop similar to the original design of skylab in this concept the interior of the fuel tank would be filled with living quarters and various equipment that did not take up a significant amount of volume the s ivb would then be filled with propellants as normal and used to accelerate the craft on its way to venus once the burn was complete any remaining propellant was vented to space and then the larger fuel tank could be used as living space while the smaller oxygen tank would be used for waste storage only so much equipment could be carried in the hydrogen tank without taking up too much room while other pieces could not be immersed in liquid hydrogen and survive these sorts of systems would instead be placed in the interstage area between the s ivb and the apollo command

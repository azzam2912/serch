ncbi s archives hosts data pertaining to diverse types of samples from many species and as such the biosample database is similarly diverse examples of a biosample include a primary tissue biopsy an individual organism or an environmental isolate the biosample database captures sample metadata in a structured way by encouraging use of controlled sample attribute field name vocabularies this metadata is key in giving the sample data context allowing it to be more fully understood reused and enables aggregation of disparate data sets sample metadata is linked to relevant experimental data across many archival databases relieving submitter burden by enabling one time submission of sample description they then can reference that sample when necessary when making data deposits to other archives biosample records are indexed and searchable supporting cross database queries by sample description the biosamples database was launched in 2011 to help aggregate and standardise sample metadata historically each archive had created its own convention for sample metadata collection these usually were limited in their standardisation and had no method to indicate when the a sample was used across multiple data sets in addition to this there is a growing awareness amongst the research community that sample metadata

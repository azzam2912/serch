the outerplanarity index of a planar graph is the minimum value of formula 1 for which it is formula 1 outerplanar an outerplanar graph or 1 outerplanar graph has all of its vertices on the unbounded outside face of the graph a 2 outerplanar graph is a planar graph with the property that when the vertices on the unbounded face are removed the remaining vertices all lie on the newly formed unbounded face and so on more formally a graph is formula 1 outerplanar if it has a planar embedding such that for every vertex there is an alternating sequence of at most formula 1 faces and formula 1 vertices of the embedding starting with the unbounded face and ending with the vertex in which each consecutive face and vertex are incident to each other the formula 1 outerplanar graphs have treewidth at most formula 8 however some bounded treewidth planar graphs such as the nested triangles graph may be formula 1 outerplanar only for very large formula 1 linear in the number of vertices baker s technique covers a planar graph with a constant number of formula 1 outerplanar graphs and uses their low treewidth in order to quickly

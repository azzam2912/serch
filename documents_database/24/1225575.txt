by overwriting the data on the storage device the data is rendered unrecoverable and achieves data sanitization ideally software designed for data erasure should permanent data erasure goes beyond basic file deletion commands which only remove direct pointers to the data disk sectors and make the data recovery possible with common software tools unlike degaussing and physical destruction which render the storage media unusable data erasure removes all information while leaving the disk operable new flash memory based media implementations such as solid state drives or usb flash drives can cause data erasure techniques to fail allowing remnant data to be recoverable software based overwriting uses a software application to write a stream of zeros ones or meaningless pseudorandom data onto all sectors of a hard disk drive there are key differentiators between data erasure and other overwriting methods which can leave data intact and raise the risk of data breach identity theft or failure to achieve regulatory compliance many data eradication programs also provide multiple overwrites so that they support recognized government and industry standards though a single pass overwrite is widely considered to be sufficient for modern hard disk drives good software should provide verification of data removal

the system relies heavily on xliff translation memory exchange tmx termbase exchange format tbx and accompanying standards to ensure a free and unencumbered exchange of translation and localization data opentms implements a standard translation workflow but features a very fine grained modularity that makes its adaptable to any conceivable workflow design the architecture of opentms is mainly based on several models these models describe the key components of opentms each model handles a specific aspect of the translation process and its requirements the models form a framework which guide the construction of language specific software tools the following core models are identified on top of those models the application model organises real applications like the gui model opentms uses a data source in the data model which organises the access to databases or any other kind of devices which allows to store tm terminology even machine translation data currently the following data sources are supported tmx files xliff file sql databases data sources have to implement a set of methods based on the data source interface opentms can be accesses as directly through java or through an xml rpc server opentms was initiated by the forum open language tools folt

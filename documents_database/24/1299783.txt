an affine quartic surface is the solution set of an equation of the form where f is a polynomial of degree 4 such as f x y z x y xyz z 1 this is a surface in affine space a on the other hand a projective quartic surface is a surface in projective space p of the same form but now f is a homogeneous polynomial of 4 variables of degree 4 so for example f x y z w x y xyzw z w w if the base field is r or c the surface is said to be real or complex respectively one must be careful to distinguish between algebraic riemann surfaces which are in fact quartic curves over c and quartic surfaces over r for instance the klein quartic is a real surface given as a quartic curve over c if on the other hand the base field is finite then it is said to be an arithmetic quartic surface

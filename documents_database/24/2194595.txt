bubble chambers are similar to cloud chambers both in application and in basic principle a chamber is normally made by filling a large cylinder with a liquid heated to just below its boiling point as particles enter the chamber a piston suddenly decreases its pressure and the liquid enters into a superheated metastable phase charged particles create an ionization track around which the liquid vaporizes forming microscopic bubbles bubble density around a track is proportional to a particle s energy loss bubbles grow in size as the chamber expands until they are large enough to be seen or photographed several cameras are mounted around it allowing a three dimensional image of an event to be captured the bibc chamber body was machined from a block of aluminium it was filled with propane or freon the chamber was designed to look for charmed particles which are so un stable that they usually decay too quickly to give big bubble chambers a good chance of catching them in fact the track of a charmed particle could be lost amongst the large half a millimetre bubbles of large chambers the bubbles in the minichamber were about ten times smaller and stood a better

gradient values with respect to a particular quantity of interest can be efficiently calculated by solving the adjoint equation methods based on solution of adjoint equations are used in wing shape optimization fluid flow control and uncertainty quantification for example formula 1 this is an it stochastic differential equation now by using euler scheme we integrate the parts of this equation and get another equation formula 2 here formula 3 is a random variable later one is an adjoint equation consider the following linear scalar advection diffusion equation for the primal solution formula 4 in the domain formula 5 with dirichlet boundary conditions let the output of interest be the following linear functional derive the weak form by multiplying the primal equation with a weighting function formula 8 and performing integration by parts where then consider an infinitesimal perturbation to formula 11 which produces an infinitesimal change in formula 12 as follows note that the solution perturbation formula 14 must vanish at the boundary since the dirichlet boundary condition does not admit variations on formula 15 using the weak form above and the definition of the adjoint formula 16 given below we obtain next use integration by parts to transfer

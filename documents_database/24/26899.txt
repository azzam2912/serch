the main advantages of hypergolic propellants are that they can be stored as liquids at room temperature and that engines which are powered by them are easy to ignite reliably and repeatedly although commonly used hypergolic propellants are difficult to handle due to their extreme toxicity and or corrosiveness in contemporary usage the terms hypergol or hypergolic propellant usually mean the most common such propellant combination dinitrogen tetroxide plus hydrazine and or its relatives monomethylhydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine soviet rocket engine researcher valentin glushko experimented with hypergolic fuel as early as 1931 it was initially used for chemical ignition of engines starting kerosene nitric acid engines with an initial charge of phosphorus dissolved in carbon disulfide starting in 1935 prof o lutz of the german aeronautical institute experimented with over 1000 self igniting propellants he assisted the walter company with the development of c stoff which ignited with concentrated hydrogen peroxide bmw developed engines burning a hypergolic mix of nitric acid with various combinations of amines xylidines and anilines hypergolic propellants were discovered independently for the third time in the u s by galcit and navy annapolis researchers in 1940 they developed engines powered by aniline and nitric acid robert

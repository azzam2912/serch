in polymer matrix composites polymers act as binder or matrix to secure in place incorporated particulates fibres or other reinforcements they were first used after world war ii and continuing research has led to an increased range of thermoset resins polymers or plastics as well as engineering grade thermoplastics all developed for use in the manufacture of polymer composites with enhanced and longer term service capabilities thermoset polymer matrix technologies also find use in a wide diversity of non structural industrial applications the foremost types of thermosetting polymers used in structural composites are benzoxazine resins bis maleimide resins bmi cyanate ester resins epoxy epoxide resins phenolic pf resins unsaturated polyester up resins polyimides polyurethane pur resins silicones and vinyl esters these are made by the reaction of phenols formaldehyde and primary amines which at elevated temperatures 400 f 200 c undergo ring opening polymerisation forming polybenzoxazine thermoset networks when hybridised with epoxy and phenolic resins the resulting ternary systems have glass transition temperatures in excess of 490 f 250 c cure is characterised by expansion rather than shrinkage and uses include structural prepregs liquid molding and film adhesives for composite construction bonding and repair the high aromatic content of the

this family is used to build a predictive model based on given observation it works based on the concept of separate and conquer to directly induce rules from a given training set and build its knowledge repository algorithms under rules family are usually available in data mining tools such as keel and weka known for knowledge extraction and decision making rules family algorithms are mainly used in data mining to create a model that predicts the actions of a given input features it goes under the umbrella of inductive learning which is a machine learning approach in this type of learning the agent is usually provided with previous information to gain descriptive knowledge based on the given historical data thus it is a supervised learning paradigm that works as a data analysis tool which uses the knowledge gained through training to reach a general conclusion and identify new objects using the produced classifier inductive learning had been divided into two types decision tree dt and covering algorithms ca dts discover rules using decision tree based on the concept of divide and conquer while ca directly induces rules from the training set based on the concept of separate and conquers although

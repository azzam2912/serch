every set of three of these four circles has among them three crossing points and by the assumption of non collinearity there exists a circle passing through these three crossing points the conclusion is that like the first set of four circles the second set of four circles defined in this way all pass through a single point p in general not the same point as m the second theorem considers five circles in general position passing through a single point m each subset of four circles defines a new point p according to the first theorem then these five points all lie on a single circle c the third theorem consider six circles in general position that pass through a single point m each subset of five circles defines a new circle by the second theorem then these six new circles c all pass through a single point the sequence of theorems can be continued indefinitely

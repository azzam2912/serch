vinculin is located at the cytoplasmic side of focal contacts or adhesion plaques in addition to actin vinculin interacts with other structural proteins such as talin and alpha actinins vinculin is a large protein of 116 kda about a 1000 residues structurally the protein consists of an acidic n terminal domain of about 90 kda separated from a basic c terminal domain of about 25 kda by a proline rich region of about 50 residues the central part of the n terminal domain consists of a variable number 3 in vertebrates 2 in caenorhabditis elegans of repeats of a 110 amino acids domain alpha catenins are evolutionary related to vinculin catenins are proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic domain of a variety of cadherins the association of catenins to cadherins produces a complex which is linked to the actin filament network and which seems to be of primary importance for cadherins cell adhesion properties three different types of catenins seem to exist alpha beta and gamma alpha catenins are proteins of about 100 kda which are evolutionary related to vinculin in terms of their structure the most significant differences are the absence in alpha catenin of the repeated domain and

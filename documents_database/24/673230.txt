in 1925 in a landmark contribution to catalytic theory taylor suggested that a catalysed chemical reaction is not catalysed over the entire solid surface of the catalyst but only at certain active sites or centres he also developed important methods for procuring heavy water during world war ii and pioneered the use of stable isotopes in studying chemical reactions taylor was born in st helens lancashire england in 1890 the son of glass technologist james and ellen n e stott taylor he was educated at cowley grammar school in st helens and then attended the university of liverpool where he received his bsc in 1909 and his msc in 1910 taylor then carried out three years of graduate work in liverpool after which he spent one year at the nobel institute in stockholm in the laboratory of svante arrhenius and another at the technische hochschule in hanover under max bodenstein these studies earned him a phd degree from the university of liverpool in 1914 taylor showed that chemisorption may be an activated process and occur slowly moreover he conceived the idea that chemically active sites might be sparse on the surface of a catalyst and hence could be inhibited with

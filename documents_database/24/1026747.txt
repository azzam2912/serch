the molecules may be shifted between the states in response to environmental stimuli such as changes in ph light temperature an electric current microenvironment or in the presence of ions and other ligands in some cases a combination of stimuli is required the oldest forms of synthetic molecular switches are ph indicators which display distinct colors as a function of ph currently synthetic molecular switches are of interest in the field of nanotechnology for application in molecular computers or responsive drug delivery systems molecular switches are also important in biology because many biological functions are based on it for instance allosteric regulation and vision they are also one of the simplest examples of molecular machines the capacity of some compounds to change in function of the ph was known since te sixteenth century this effect was even known before the discovery of the acidity basicity concept those are found in a wide range of plants like roses cornflowers primroses and violets robert boyle was the first person to describe this effect employing plant juices in the forms of solution and impregnated paper the most common use of these compounds is the ph indicators which are molecules with acid basic properties

violacea is a gram negative bacterium located in marine sediment in the ryukyu trench at a depth of 5 110m the first description of this organism was published in 1998 by japanese microbiologists yuichi nogi chiaki kato and koki horikoshi who named the species after its violet appearance when it is grown on marine agar 2216 plates shewanella violacea is a motile rod shaped bacterium with flagella it is a facultative anaerobic organism and considered an extremophile due to its optimal growing conditions at 8 c and 30 mpa researchers are evaluating this species to better understand the specific mechanisms s violacea uses in order to thrive in its unusually cold and high pressure environment shewanella violacea is a member of the shewanella genus recent evaluation of the shewanella phylogeny has led to a division of this genus into two categories group 1 and group 2 these categories were created from an evaluation of the 16s rrna sequences as well as a comparison of membrane lipid compositions group 1 shewanella species are mostly extremophiles while group 2 shewanella species are mostly mesophiles s violacea is a member of group 1 shewanella due to specific genetic adaptations that have enabled the

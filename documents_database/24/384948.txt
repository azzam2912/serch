all compounds have been described in varying degrees of detail although serious doubts have been cast on the existence of pi mixed chalcogen halides also exist in the gas phase the phosphorus pentahalides have trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry as explained by vsepr theory phosphorus pentafluoride is a relatively inert gas notable as a mild lewis acid and a fluoride ion acceptor it is a fluxional molecule in which the axial ax and equatorial eq fluorine atoms interchange positions by the berry pseudorotation mechanism phosphorus pentachloride phosphorus pentabromide and phosphorus heptabromide are ionic in the solid and liquid states pcl is formulated as pclpcl but in contrast pbr is formulated as pbr br and pbr is formulated as pbr br they are widely used as chlorinating and brominating agents in organic chemistry the phosphorus iii halides are the best known of the three series they are usually prepared by direct reaction of the elements or by transhalogenation phosphorus trifluoride is used as a ligand in coordination chemistry where it resembles carbon monoxide phosphorus trichloride is a major industrial chemical and widely used starting material for phosphorus chemistry phosphorus tribromide is used in organic chemistry to convert alcohols to alkyl bromides and

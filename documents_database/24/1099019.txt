it was originally intended as a form genus to facilitate stratigraphy and environmental reconstruction the fossils do not display enough features to classify them confidently even at a kingdom level the organisms comprise tubes of around 10 m diameter with an ornamented granular surface texture these fossils were compared to late silurian ludlow epoch fossils retrieved from the burgsvik beds by sherwood pike and gray and the genus was used when similar fossils were recovered from the scottish island of kerrera by charles wellman ten years later similar unornamented filaments are known from the usa however these latter fossils have now been assigned to tortotubus the type species of the genus consists of flattened filaments perhaps an artefact resulting from post burial pressure their branching is typically at obtuse angles the irregularly sized grana which ornament their surfaces are concentrated at branching points they are often found as individuals but sometimes group together into wefts as wellman has termed them the filaments are septate with the septa looking like pinch points where the tube is slightly constricted like a twisted balloon no sign of perforation was visible in the septa perforate spores are only found in red algae and fungi

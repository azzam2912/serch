the native state of a biomolecule may possess all four levels of biomolecular structure with the secondary through quaternary structure being formed from weak interactions along the covalently bonded backbone this is in contrast to the denatured state in which these weak interactions are disrupted leading to the loss of these forms of structure and retaining only the biomolecule s primary structure an alternate usage in metallurgy refers to metals which are found chemically uncombined in nature while all protein molecules begin as simple unbranched chains of amino acids once completed they assume highly specific three dimensional shapes that ultimate shape known as tertiary structure is the folded shape that possesses a minimum of free energy it is a protein s tertiary folded structure that makes it capable of performing its biological function in fact shape changes in proteins are the primary cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including those caused by prions and amyloid i e mad cow disease kuru creutzfeldt jakob disease many enzymes and other non structural proteins have more than one native state and they operate or undergo regulation by transitioning between these states however native state is used almost exclusively in the singular typically to distinguish

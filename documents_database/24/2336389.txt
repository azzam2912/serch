the islands lie around 200 km to the south of the subduction boundary between the african plate and the eurasian plate the platform is crossed by a rift zone formed of three grabens the pantelleria graben that of malta and that of linosa the faults bounding these grabens are associated with most of the earthquakes that affect the archipelago although some earthquakes with epicentres in sicily may have damaging effects such as the 1693 sicily earthquake the maltese archipelago situated between sicily and tunisia was created through the uplift of sedimentary rocks this uplift dates from the late miocene to the pliocene malta forms the crest of a tilted block on the edge of the malta graben the isle of lampedusa is made up of an identical structure on the southwest side of this rift the rocks are exclusively sedimentary there is a lot of limestone which has contributed to the construction of the ancient buildings of the island these rocks come from marine deposits essentially from lagoons dating from between 25 and 5 million years ago the stratigraphy of the maltese islands consists of five geological formations ranging in age from late oligocene to late miocene the oldest exposed

originally titled the ambidextrous universe mirror asymmetry and time reversed worlds subsequent editions are known as the new ambidextrous universe symmetry and asymmetry from mirror reflections to superstrings the book begins with the subject of mirror reflection and from there passes through symmetry in geometry poetry art music galaxies suns planets and living organisms it then moves down into the molecular scale and looks at how symmetry and asymmetry have evolved from the beginning of life on earth there is a chapter on carbon and its versatility and on chirality in biochemistry chapter 18 and subsequent chapters deals with a conundrum called the ozma problem see below the second half of the book concerns various aspects of atomic and subatomic physics and how they relate to mirror asymmetry and the related concepts of chirality antimatter magnetic and electrical polarity parity charge and spin time invariance and reversal is discussed implications for particle physics theoretical physics and cosmology are covered and brought up to date in later editions of the book with regard to guts toes superstring theory and m theory the 18th chapter the ozma problem poses a problem that gardner claims would arise if earth should ever enter into

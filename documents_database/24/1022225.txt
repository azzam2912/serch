this enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction although its primary substrate is single stranded it can also occasionally introduce single stranded breaks in double stranded dna or rna or dna rna hybrids the enzyme hydrolyses single stranded region in duplex dna such as loops or gaps it also cleaves a strand opposite a nick on the complementary strand it has no sequence specificity well known versions include s1 found in aspergillus oryzae yellow koji mold and nuclease p1 found in penicillium citrinum members of the s1 p1 family are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and are thought to be associated in programmed cell death and also in tissue differentiation furthermore they are secreted extracellular that is outside of the cell their function and distinguishing features mean they have potential in being exploited in the field of biotechnology alternative names include endonuclease s1 aspergillus single stranded nucleate endonuclease deoxyribonuclease s1 deoxyribonuclease s1 aspergillus nuclease s1 neurospora crassa single strand specific endonuclease s1 nuclease single strand endodeoxyribonuclease single stranded dna specific endonuclease single strand specific endodeoxyribonuclease single strand specific dnase and aspergillus oryzae s1 nuclease most nucleases with ec 3 1 30 1 activity are homologous to each other in a

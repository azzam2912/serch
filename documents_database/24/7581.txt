examples of pump sources include electrical discharges flashlamps arc lamps light from another laser chemical reactions and even explosive devices the type of pump source used principally depends on the gain medium and this also determines how the energy is transmitted to the medium a helium neon hene laser uses an electrical discharge in the helium neon gas mixture a nd yag laser uses either light focused from a xenon flash lamp or diode lasers and excimer lasers use a chemical reaction the gain medium is the major determining factor of the wavelength of operation and other properties of the laser gain media in different materials have linear spectra or wide spectra gain media with wide spectra allow tuning of the laser frequency there are hundreds if not thousands of different gain media in which laser operation has been achieved see list of laser types for a list of the most important ones the gain medium is excited by the pump source to produce a population inversion and it is in the gain medium where spontaneous and stimulated emission of photons takes place leading to the phenomenon of optical gain or amplification examples of different gain media include the optical

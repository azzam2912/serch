focus stacking can be used in any situation where individual images have a very shallow depth of field macro photography and optical microscopy are two typical examples focus stacking can also be useful in landscape photography focus stacking offers flexibility since it is a computational technique images with several different depths of field can be generated in post processing and compared for best artistic merit or scientific clarity focus stacking also allows generation of images physically impossible with normal imaging equipment images with nonplanar focus regions can be generated alternative techniques for generating images with increased or flexible depth of field include wavefront coding and light field cameras the starting point for focus stacking is a series of images captured at different focus distances in each image different areas of the sample will be in focus while none of these images has the sample entirely in focus they collectively contain all the data required to generate an image which has all parts of the sample in focus in focus regions of each image may be detected automatically for example via edge detection or fourier analysis or selected manually the in focus patches are then blended together to generate the final

the breakdown of glycogen a process known as glycogenolysis releases glucose in the form of glucose 1 phosphate g 1 p the g 1 p is converted to g 6 p by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase g 6 p is readily fed into glycolysis or can go into the pentose phosphate pathway if g 6 p concentration is high a process that provides atp to the muscle cells as an energy source during muscular activity the store of atp needs to be constantly replenished when the supply of oxygen is sufficient this energy comes from feeding pyruvate one product of glycolysis into the krebs cycle when oxygen supply is insufficient typically during intense muscular activity energy must be released through anaerobic metabolism lactic acid fermentation converts pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase most importantly fermentation regenerates nad maintaining the nad concentration so that additional glycolysis reactions can occur the fermentation step oxidizes the nadh produced by glycolysis back to nad transferring two electrons from nadh to reduce pyruvate into lactate refer to the main articles on glycolysis and fermentation for the details instead of accumulating inside the muscle cells lactate produced by anaerobic fermentation is taken up by the liver this

this technique tries to identify the person behind an attack by analyzing their computational behaviour this concept is sometimes confused with intrusion detection also known as ids techniques which are the art of detecting intruder actions intruder detection systems try to detect who is attacking a system by analyzing his or her computational behaviour or biometric behaviour keystroke dynamics is paramount in intruder detection techniques because it is the only parameter that has been classified as a real behavioural biometric pattern keystroke dynamics analyze times between keystrokes issued in a computer keyboard or cellular phone keypad searching for patterns first techniques used statistics and probability concepts like standard deviations and mean later approaches use data mining neural networks support vector machine etc some other earlier works reference the concept of intruder authentication intruder verification or intruder classification but the si6 project was one of the first projects to deal with the full scope of the concept there is a confusion with the spanish translation of intrusion detection system also known as ids some people translate it as sistemas de detecci n de intrusiones but others translate it as sistemas de detecci n de intrusos only the former is correct

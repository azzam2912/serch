8 1 of all evaluated fish species are listed as vulnerable the iucn also lists eight fish subspecies as vulnerable of the subpopulations of fishes evaluated by the iucn 18 species subpopulations have been assessed as vulnerable for a species to be assessed as vulnerable to extinction the best available evidence must meet quantitative criteria set by the iucn designed to reflect a high risk of extinction in the wild endangered and critically endangered species also meet the quantitative criteria of vulnerable species and are listed separately see list of endangered fishes list of critically endangered fishes vulnerable endangered and critically endangered species are collectively referred to as threatened species by the iucn additionally 3191 fish species 21 of those evaluated are listed as data deficient meaning there is insufficient information for a full assessment of conservation status as these species typically have small distributions and or populations they are intrinsically likely to be threatened according to the iucn while the category of data deficient indicates that no assessment of extinction risk has been made for the taxa the iucn notes that it may be appropriate to give them the same degree of attention as threatened taxa at least until

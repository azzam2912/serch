using sidereal time it is possible to easily point a telescope to the proper coordinates in the night sky briefly sidereal time is a time scale that is based on earth s rate of rotation measured relative to the fixed stars viewed from the same location a star seen at one position in the sky will be seen at the same position on another night at the same sidereal time this is similar to how the time kept by a sundial can be used to find the location of the sun just as the sun and moon appear to rise in the east and set in the west due to the rotation of earth so do the stars both solar time and sidereal time make use of the regularity of earth s rotation about its polar axis solar time following the sun while sidereal time roughly follows the stars more exactly sidereal time is the angle measured along the celestial equator from the observer s meridian to the great circle that passes through the march equinox and both celestial poles and is usually expressed in hours minutes and seconds common time on a typical clock measures a slightly longer cycle

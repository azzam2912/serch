heat pumps move thermal energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one a heat pump uses external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink the most common design of a heat pump involves four main components a condenser an expansion valve an evaporator and a compressor the heat transfer medium circulated through these components is called refrigerant while air conditioners and freezers are familiar examples of heat pumps the term heat pump is more general and applies to many heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac devices used for space heating or space cooling heat pumps usually can be used either in heating mode or cooling mode as required by the user when a heat pump is used for heating it employs the same basic refrigeration type cycle used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator but in the opposite direction releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment in this use heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground heat pumps are also increasingly used to heat

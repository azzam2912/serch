it is a strictly sensory nerve and has no motor function it approaches the femoral artery where this vessel passes beneath the sartorius and lies in front of the artery behind the aponeurotic covering of the adductor canal as far as the opening in the lower part of the adductor magnus here it diverges from the artery and emerges from behind the lower edge of the aponeurotic covering of the canal it descends vertically along the medial side of the knee behind the sartorius pierces the fascia lata between the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis and becomes subcutaneous the nerve then passes along the tibial side of the leg accompanied by the great saphenous vein descends behind the medial border of the tibia and at the lower third of the leg divides into two branches the saphenous nerve about the middle of the thigh gives off a branch which joins the subsartorial plexus at the medial side of the knee it gives off a large infrapatellar branch which pierces the sartorius and fascia lata and is distributed to the skin in front of the patella below the knee the branches of the saphenous nerve medial crural cutaneous branches are

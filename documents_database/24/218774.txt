this is slow enough that it could potentially take millions of years for waste to diffuse through several tens of meters of sediment so that by the time it reaches open ocean it would be highly dilute and decayed large regions of the ocean floor are thought to be completely geologically inactive and it is not expected that there will be extensive human activity there in the future water absorbs essentially all radiation within a few meters provided the waste remains contained one of the problems associated with this option includes the difficulty of recovering the waste if necessary once it is emplaced deep in the ocean also establishing an effective international structure to develop regulate and monitor a sub seabed repository would be extremely difficult beyond technical and political considerations the london convention places prohibitions on disposing of radioactive materials at sea and does not make a distinction between waste dumped directly into the water and waste that is buried underneath the ocean s floor it remained in force until 2018 after which the sub seabed disposal option can be revisited at 25 year intervals depositing waste in suitable containers in subduction zones has also been suggested here waste

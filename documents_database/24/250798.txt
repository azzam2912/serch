configuration space registers are mapped to memory locations device drivers and diagnostic software must have access to the configuration space and operating systems typically use apis to allow access to device configuration space when the operating system does not have access methods defined or apis for memory mapped configuration space requests the driver or diagnostic software has the burden to access the configuration space in a manner that is compatible with the operating system s underlying access rules in all systems device drivers are encouraged to use apis provided by the operating system to access the configuration space of the device one of the major improvements the pci local bus had over other i o architectures was its configuration mechanism in addition to the normal memory mapped and i o port spaces each device function on the bus has a configuration space which is 256 bytes long addressable by knowing the eight bit pci bus five bit device and three bit function numbers for the device commonly referred to as the bdf or b d f as abbreviated from bus device function this allows up to 256 buses each with up to 32 devices each supporting eight functions a single

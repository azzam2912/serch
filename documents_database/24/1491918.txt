vigs are used in military technology e g some directed energy weapons as a secondary stage of another pulsed power source commonly an explosive driven ferroelectric generator discrete component vigs pictured consist of a stack of well coupled common mode chokes interconnected with a stack of capacitors the inductors present a high inductance to currents that are in phase in the two windings and a far lower inductance when the winding currents are flowing in opposite directions the capacitors are charged with alternating polarity and when the switch usually a triggered or free running spark gap in practice is closed the voltage across every second capacitor rapidly inverts as a half cycle of oscillation at a frequency set by the capacitance resonating with the differential mode inductance of the chokes at the same time the other capacitors discharge very slowly due to not having a differential current flowing to cancel the reactance so after a half period all the capacitors are in series and the voltages add this arrangement has a conceptual equivalence to the spiral vig with the alternating capacitors being equivalent to the capacitance between the windings and the common mode chokes being equivalent to the inductance of

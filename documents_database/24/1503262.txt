a space filling tree is defined by an incremental process that results in a tree for which every point in the space has a finite length path that converges to it in contrast to space filling curves individual paths in the tree are short allowing any part of the space to be quickly reached from the root a space filling tree is defined by an iterative process whereby a single point in a continuous space is connected via a continuous path to every other point in the space by a path of length and for every point in the space there is at least one path that converges to it the term space filling tree in this sense was created in a 2009 tech report that defines space filling and tree differently than their traditional definitions in mathematics as explained in the space filling curve article in 1890 peano found the first space filling curve and by jordan s 1887 definition which is now standard a curve is a single function not a sequence of functions the curve is space filling because it is a curve whose range contains the entire 2 dimensional unit square as explained in the first

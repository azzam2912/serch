he is notable in the area of experimental condensed matter physics particularly semiconductor nanofabrication and the study of quantum effects in nanometer scale electronic devices at ultra low temperatures he obtained his bsc in physics from the university of london in 1988 and a phd under michael pepper and michael kelly physicist from the university of cambridge in 1993 with a thesis entitled low dimensional transport in back gated heterostructures he was awarded an epsrc postdoctoral fellowship to continue his work at the cavendish laboratory which led to new understandings of electrical conduction in highly correlated low dimensional quantum systems hamilton moved to the university of new south wales in 1999 where he was one of the founding members of the arc centre of excellence for quantum computer technology he managed the quantum measurement program in the centre from 2000 2005 developing techniques for controlling and reading out quantum information in silicon quantum computer devices in 2005 he moved full time to the school of physics where he leads the quantum electronic devices group working on quantum transport in semiconductor nanostructures in particular electron and hole transport in gaas quantum wires and dots he was awarded the australasian science prize

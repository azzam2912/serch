a radioactive actinide metal neptunium is the first transuranic element its position in the periodic table just after uranium named after the planet uranus led to it being named after neptune the next planet beyond uranus a neptunium atom has 93 protons and 93 electrons of which seven are valence electrons neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air the element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states ranging from 3 to 7 it is radioactive poisonous pyrophoric and can accumulate in bones which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous although many false claims of its discovery were made over the years the element was first synthesized by edwin mcmillan and philip h abelson at the berkeley radiation laboratory in 1940 since then most neptunium has been and still is produced by neutron irradiation of uranium in nuclear reactors the vast majority is generated as a by product in conventional nuclear power reactors while neptunium itself has no commercial uses at present it is used as a precursor for the formation of plutonium 238 used in radioisotope thermal generators to provide electricity for spacecraft neptunium has also been used in detectors of high

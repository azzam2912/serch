the tumors generally begin in layers of connective tissue such as that under the skin between muscles and surrounding organs and will generally start as a small lump with inflammation that grows at first the lump will be self contained as the tumor exists in its stage 1 state and will not necessarily expand beyond its encapsulated form however it may develop cancerous processes that can only be detected through microscopic examination as such at this level the tumor is usually treated by excision that includes wide margins of healthy looking tissue followed by thorough biopsy and additional excision if necessary the prognosis for a stage 1 tumor excision is usually fairly positive but if the tumors progress to levels 2 and 3 prognosis is worse because tumor cells have likely spread to other locations these locations can either be nearby tissues or system wide locations that include the lungs kidneys and liver in these cases prognosis is grim and chemotherapy and radiation are the only methods of controlling the cancer spindle cell sarcoma can develop for a variety of reasons including genetic predisposition but it also may be caused by a combination of other factors including injury and inflammation

the protein encoded by this gene is localized to the mitochondria and may play pivotal roles in the malate aspartate shuttle that operates in the metabolic coordination between cytosol and mitochondria the protein encoded by mdh2 exists as a dimer which indicate the important connection between protein stability and enzymatic activity each subunit contains two structurally and functionally distinct domains the first is the nad binding domain which exists in the amino terminal half of each molecule and contains a parallel sheet structure otherwise known as a rosman fold motif the core dinucleotide binding structure is composed of four beta sheets and one alpha helix the other domain is a carboxy terminal domain that contains the substrate binding site and amino acids that are necessary for catalysis the active site of these enzymes is in a cleft between two domains crystallography reveals the dimer interface which consists mainly of interacting alpha helices that form a compact interaction the active sites in these dimeric proteins are well separated from each other because malate dehydrogenase is closely tied to the citric acid cycle regulation is highly dependent on tca products citrate also affects mdh activity by very complex manner it inhibits the

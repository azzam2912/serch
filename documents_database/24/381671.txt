hence each non abelian finite simple group has order divisible by at least three distinct primes the theorem was proved by using the representation theory of finite groups several special cases of it had previously been proved by burnside jordan and frobenius john thompson pointed out that a proof avoiding the use of representation theory could be extracted from his work on the n group theorem and this was done explicitly by for groups of odd order and by for groups of even order simplified the proofs this proof is by contradiction let pq be the smallest product of two prime powers such that there is a non solvable group g whose order is equal to this number if g had a nontrivial proper normal subgroup h then because of the minimality of g h and g h would be solvable so g as well which would contradict our assumption so g is simple if a were zero g would be a finite q group hence nilpotent and therefore solvable similarly g cannot be abelian otherwise it would be nilpotent as g is simple its center must therefore be trivial by the first statement of sylow s theorem g has

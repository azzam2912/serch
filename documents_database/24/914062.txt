the main alloying elements are cobalt and nickel but chromium molybdenum and carbon are also added its exceptional properties are hardness tensile strength fracture toughness and ductility aermet is weldable with no preheating needed aermet alloy is not corrosion resistant so it must be sealed if used in a moist environment aermet is a registered trademark of carpenter technology corporation three types of aermet alloys are currently available aermet 100 also known as aermet for tooling aermet 310 and aermet 340 alloy examples of applications include armor fasteners airplane landing gear ordnance jet engine shafts structural members and drive shafts the uns number is k92580 the alloy has a modulus of elasticity of 28 200 ksi and a density of 0 285 lbf in 7 89 g cm aermet 100 alloy is somewhat more difficult to machine than 4340 at hrc 38 therefore carbide tools are usually used standard shapes that are available include round sheet welding wire billet plate strip and wire aermet alloy is special in that it must be hardened twice in order to reach its maximum effectiveness the first hardening application is a solution treatment at for 1 hour it is then quenched to a temperature

the maximum possible data rate per user is increased the more frequency blocks are assigned to a user the sum data rate of a cell is increased as well because of a better resource utilization in addition load balancing is possible with carrier aggregation depending on the positions of the component carriers three cases of carrier aggregation are distinguished there is no difference between these three cases from a baseband perspective however the complexity from an rf point of view is increased in the case inter band carrier aggregation the chanel bandwidth for umts hspa is about 3 8 mhz with a carrier spacing of 5 mhz carrier aggregation is also called dual cell in the context of umts hspa through carrier aggregation part of the umts extension hspa two downlink carriers may be assigned to one user since release 8 release 10 supports four carrier aggregation and eight carrier aggregation is supported since release 11 3gpp standardized carrier aggregation for hspa for the uplink for up to two component carriers since release 9 lte supports since its first release channel bandwidths of 1 4 mhz 3 mhz 5 mhz 10 mhz 15 mhz and 20 mhz since lte advanced

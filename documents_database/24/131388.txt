found in all living cells nad is called a dinucleotide because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups one nucleotide contains an adenine nucleobase and the other nicotinamide nad exists in two forms an oxidized and reduced form abbreviated as nad and nadh respectively in metabolism nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is involved in redox reactions carrying electrons from one reaction to another the cofactor is therefore found in two forms in cells nad is an oxidizing agent it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced this reaction forms nadh which can then be used as a reducing agent to donate electrons these electron transfer reactions are the main function of nad however it is also used in other cellular processes most notably a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins in posttranslational modifications because of the importance of these functions the enzymes involved in nad metabolism are targets for drug discovery in organisms nad can be synthesized from simple building blocks de novo from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid in an alternative fashion more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from food as niacin similar compounds are released by

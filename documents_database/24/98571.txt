the preprocessor provides the ability for the inclusion of header files macro expansions conditional compilation and line control in many c implementations it is a separate program invoked by the compiler as the first part of translation the language of preprocessor directives is only weakly related to the grammar of c and so is sometimes used to process other kinds of text files preprocessing is defined by the first four of eight phases of translation specified in the c standard one of the most common uses of the preprocessor is to include another file the preprocessor replaces the line codice 2 with the text of the file stdio h which declares the codice 3 function among other things this can also be written using double quotes e g codice 4 if the filename is enclosed within angle brackets the file is searched for in the standard compiler include paths if the filename is enclosed within double quotes the search path is expanded to include the current source directory c compilers and programming environments all have a facility which allows the programmer to define where include files can be found this can be introduced through a command line flag which can

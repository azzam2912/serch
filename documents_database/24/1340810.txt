it was introduced by per bak chao tang and kurt wiesenfeld in a 1987 paper the model is a cellular automaton in its original formulation each site on a finite grid has an associated value that corresponds to the slope of the pile this slope builds up as grains of sand or chips are randomly placed onto the pile until the slope exceeds a specific threshold value at which time that site collapses transferring sand into the adjacent sites increasing their slope bak tang and wiesenfeld considered process of successive random placement of sand grains on the grid each such placement of sand at a particular site may have no effect or it may cause a cascading reaction that will affect many sites the model has since been studied on the infinite lattice on other non square lattices and on arbitrary graphs including directed multigraphs the iteration rules for the model on the square lattice with sites formula 1 can be defined as follows begin with some nonnegative configuration of values formula 2 which is finite meaning any site formula 4 with is unstable and can topple or fire sending one of its chips to each of its four neighbors

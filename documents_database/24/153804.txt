a pure number having no units attached and having a numerical value that is independent of whatever system of units may be used perhaps the best known example is the fine structure constant which has an approximate value of the term fundamental physical constant is normally used to refer to the dimensionless constants but has also been used primarily by nist and codata to refer to certain universal dimensioned physical constants such as the speed of light c vacuum permittivity planck constant h and the gravitational constant g that appear in the most basic theories of physics other physicists do not recognize this usage and reserve the use of the term fundamental physical constant solely for dimensionless universal physical constants that currently cannot be derived from any other source this narrower usage will be followed here there is no exhaustive list of such constants but it does make sense to ask about the minimal number of fundamental constants necessary to determine a given physical theory thus the standard model requires 25 physical constants about half of them the masses of fundamental particles which become dimensionless when expressed relative to the planck mass or alternatively as coupling strength with the higgs

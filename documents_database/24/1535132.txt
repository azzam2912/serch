first created in 1990 by dr yiyu yao the extension makes use of loss functions to derive formula 1 and formula 2 region parameters like rough sets the lower and upper approximations of a set are used the following contains the basic principles of decision theoretic rough sets using the bayesian decision procedure the decision theoretic rough set dtrs approach allows for minimum risk decision making based on observed evidence let formula 3 be a finite set of formula 4 possible actions and let formula 5 be a finite set of formula 6 states formula 7 is calculated as the conditional probability of an object formula 8 being in state formula 9 given the object description formula 10 formula 11 denotes the loss or cost for performing action formula 12 when the state is formula 9 the expected loss conditional risk associated with taking action formula 12 is given by object classification with the approximation operators can be fitted into the bayesian decision framework the set of actions is given by formula 16 where formula 17 formula 18 and formula 19 represent the three actions in classifying an object into pos formula 20 neg formula 20 and bnd formula 20

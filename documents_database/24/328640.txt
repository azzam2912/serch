the asteroid was named by the director of the modena observatory in honor of the italian astronomer angelo secchi it is classified as an s type asteroid in the late 1990s a network of astronomers worldwide gathered light curve data that was ultimately used to derive the spin states and shape models of 10 new asteroids including 306 unitas the computed shape model for this asteroid is regular while the light curve displays two maxima per rotation lightcurve data has also been recorded by observers at the antelope hill observatory which has been designated as an official observatory by the minor planet center measurements of the thermal inertia of 306 unitas give an estimate range from 100 to 260 m k s compared to 50 for lunar regolith and 400 for coarse sand in an atmosphere although 306 unitas has an orbit similar to the vesta family asteroids it was found to be an unrelated interloper on the basis of its non matching spectral type

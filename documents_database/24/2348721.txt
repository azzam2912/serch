it consists of a miocene lava plateau and a number of pliocene to holocene age individual vents including cinder cones tamanrasset lies east northeast from the field cinder cones lava domes lava flows and maars form the field which covers a surface of elongated west to east there are about 132 individual vents in the area measuring tahalra is part of a province of volcanic fields in the hoggar which has been active since the mesozoic seismic tomography has shown the existence of low velocity mantle beneath the tahalra and atakor volcanic fields sign of the presence of recent volcanism the basement beneath the field consists of rocks of precambrian age mostly metamorphic rocks and plutons which are part of a mobile belt at the margin of the west african craton parts of the basement are covered with paleozoic rocks the field has erupted basalt basanite rhyolite and trachyte they contain amphibole clinopyroxene magnetite and olivine phenocrysts patterns in trace element composition and isotope ratios imply that the magmas either developed from variable starting material or from metasomatized mantle volcanic activity started in the miocene and led to the development of a lava plateau up to thick eruptions continued in

an epidermal growth factor produced by monocytes and macrophages due to an affinity for heparin is termed hb egf it has been shown to play a role in wound healing cardiac hypertrophy and heart development and function first identified in the conditioned media of human macrophage like cells hb egf is an 87 amino acid glycoprotein that displays highly regulated gene expression ectodomain shedding results in the soluble mature form of hb egf which influences the mitogenicity and chemotactic factors for smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts the transmembrane form of hb egf is the unique receptor for diphtheria toxin and functions in juxtacrine signaling in cells both forms of hb egf participate in normal physiological processes and in pathological processes including tumor progression and metastasis organ hyperplasia and atherosclerotic disease hb egf can bind two locations on cell surfaces heparan sulfate proteoglycans and egf receptor effecting cell to cell interactions heparin binding egf like growth factor has been shown to interact with nrd1 zinc finger and btb domain containing protein 16 and bag1 hb egf biological activities with these genes influence cell cycle progression molecular chaperone regulation cell survival cellular functions adhesion and mediation of cell migration the nrd1 gene

the encoded protein is part of the large atp dependent chromatin remodelling complex swi snf which is required for transcriptional activation of genes normally repressed by chromatin it possesses at least two conserved domains that could be important for its function first it has an arid domain which is a dna binding domain that can specifically bind an at rich dna sequence known to be recognized by a swi snf complex at the beta globin locus second the c terminus of the protein can stimulate glucocorticoid receptor dependent transcriptional activation it is thought that the protein encoded by this gene confers specificity to the swi snf complex and may recruit the complex to its targets through either protein dna or protein protein interactions two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene this gene has been commonly found mutated in gastric cancers ovarian clear cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer in breast cancer distant metastases acquire inactivation mutations in arid1a not seen in the primary tumor and reduced arid1a expression confers resistance to different drugs such as trastuzumab and mtor inhibitors these findings provide a rationale for why tumors accumulate arid1a mutations lack of this gene protein seems

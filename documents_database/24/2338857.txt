it was first observed on 5 february 2018 by the mount lemmon survey conducted at the mount lemmon observatory near tucson arizona in the united states the discovery was announced on 4 march 2018 along with another hyperbolic object a 2017 u7 based on the absolute magnitude of 15 1 it may measure several kilometers in diameter on 22 march 2018 it was determined to be a hyperbolic comet while near perihelion a 2018 c2 s heliocentric orbit is not bound to the solar system unlike oumuamua it is probably not an interstellar object the heliocentric eccentricity drops below 1 starting with an epoch of july 2022 when it is 12 9 au from the sun making the orbit bound to the sun before it leaves the planetary region of the solar system the more stable barycentric orbit of a 2018 c2 shows that it is only a very distant small solar system body approaching as far as 20 000 80 000 au from the sun around the distance of the oort cloud it had an orbital period of roughly 1 million years until the current approach to the solar system where perturbations will shorten the orbit drastically to 2

this layer may be implemented by a phy chip the physical layer consists of the electronic circuit transmission technologies of a network it is a fundamental layer underlying the higher level functions in a network and can be implemented through a great number of different hardware technologies with widely varying characteristics the physical layer defines the means of transmitting raw bits rather than logical data packets over a physical data link connecting network nodes the bitstream may be grouped into code words or symbols and converted to a physical signal that is transmitted over a transmission medium the physical layer provides an electrical mechanical and procedural interface to the transmission medium the shapes and properties of the electrical connectors the frequencies to broadcast on the line code to use and similar low level parameters are specified here within the semantics of the osi model the physical layer translates logical communications requests from the data link layer into hardware specific operations to cause transmission or reception of electronic signals in a local area network lan or a metropolitan area network man using open systems interconnection osi architecture the physical signaling sublayer is the portion of the physical layer that the internet

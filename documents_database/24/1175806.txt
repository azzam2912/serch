the device is necessary because the amplitudes provided by the transducers themselves are insufficient for most practical applications of power ultrasound another function of the ultrasonic horn is to efficiently transfer the acoustic energy from the ultrasonic transducer into the treated media which may be solid for example in ultrasonic welding ultrasonic cutting or ultrasonic soldering or liquid for example in ultrasonic homogenization sonochemistry milling emulsification spraying or cell disruption ultrasonic processing of liquids relies of intense shear forces and extreme local conditions temperatures up to 5000 k and pressures up to 1000 atm generated by acoustic cavitation the ultrasonic horn is commonly a solid metal rod with a round transverse cross section and a variable shape longitudinal cross section the rod horn another group includes the block horn which has a large rectangular transverse cross section and a variable shape longitudinal cross section and more complex composite horns the devices from this group are used with solid treated media the length of the device must be such that there is mechanical resonance at the desired ultrasonic frequency of operation one or multiple half wavelengths of ultrasound in the horn material with sound speed dependence on the horn s cross

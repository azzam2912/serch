it is determined by the angle of tilting on each side of the boat as its center of gravity cg moves sideways as a result of the passengers or cargo moving laterally or as a response to an external force e g wave the wider the boat and the further its volume is distributed away from its center line cl the greater the initial stability wide mono hull small boats such as the jonsboat have a great deal of initial stability and allow the occupants to stand upright to engage in fishing activities and so do narrower small boats such as w kayaks that feature a twin hull very narrow mono hull boats such as canoes and kayaks have little initial stability but twin hull w kayaks are considerably more stable due to the fact that their buoyancy is distributed at a greater distance from their center line and therefore acts more effectively to reduce tilting for purposes of stability it is advantageous to keep the centre of gravity as low as possible in small boats so occupants are generally seated flatwater rowing shells which have length to beam ratios of up to 30 1 are inherently unstable and must

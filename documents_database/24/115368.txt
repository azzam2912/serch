in an integral of a functional if a function is varied by adding to it another function that is arbitrarily small and the resulting integrand is expanded in powers of the coefficient of in the first order term is called the functional derivative for example consider the functional where if is varied by adding to it a function and the resulting integrand is expanded in powers of then the change in the value of to first order in can be expressed as follows the coefficient of denoted as is called the functional derivative of with respect to at the point for this example functional the functional derivative is the left hand side of the euler lagrange equation in this section the functional derivative is defined then the functional differential is defined in terms of the functional derivative given a manifold representing continuous smooth functions with certain boundary conditions etc and a functional defined as the functional derivative of denoted is defined by where formula 6 is an arbitrary function the quantity is called the variation of in other words is a linear functional so by the riesz markov kakutani representation theorem this functional is given by integration against some measure

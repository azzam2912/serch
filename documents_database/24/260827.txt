rod and cone cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth the human eye can differentiate between about 10 million colors and is possibly capable of detecting a single photon the eye is part of the sensory nervous system similar to the eyes of other mammals the human eye s non image forming photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina receive light signals which affect adjustment of the size of the pupil regulation and suppression of the hormone melatonin and entrainment of the body clock the eye is not shaped like a perfect sphere rather it is a fused two piece unit composed of the anterior segment and the posterior segment the anterior segment is made up of the cornea iris and lens the cornea is transparent and more curved and is linked to the larger posterior segment composed of the vitreous retina choroid and the outer white shell called the sclera the cornea is typically about 11 5 mm 0 3 in in diameter and 0 5 mm 500 m in thickness near its center the posterior chamber constitutes the remaining five sixths its diameter is typically about 24 mm

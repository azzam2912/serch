they are not as common in the tropics but genera such as cephalodromia and platypygus are known from these regions many of these microbombyliids have a humpbacked thorax as in the acroceridae and lack the dense vestiture common in the bombyliidae mythicomyiids have until recently not had much attention in the literature their small size has caused them to be missed when collecting yellow pan trapping and fine mesh netting in malaise and aerial sweep nets has resulted in a number of undescribed species from many parts of the world a high diversity of both genera and species exists for this family in africa especially northern and southern portions about 350 species are known most in the genus mythicomyia coquillett hundreds more await description because of their extremely small size and curious body shapes some genera have been at times placed in the acroceridae or empididae originally taxa were placed in the subfamily mythicomyiinae in the empididae later they were transferred to the bombyliidae where mythicomyiids have long been treated zaitzev 1991 was the first to give characters warranting raising the group to family level subsequent workers have followed zaitzev s lead and treat the group as a separate family

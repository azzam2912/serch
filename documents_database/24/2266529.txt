they are therefore types of exotic meson the term arises from the names given to some of the first such particles discovered x 3872 y 4260 and z 3900 although the symbols x and y have since been deprecated by the particle data group since 2003 a frontier for the standard model sm has emerged at low energies through xyz particle discoveries the well established theory of quantum chromodynamics qcd is tested by many exotic charmonium discoveries since the x 3872 was first identified at the belle experiment in 2003 the basic model of hadron physics is the assembling of quarks into groups of 3 baryons or a quark and anti quark pair mesons a meson with a charm quark and an anti charm quark is called charmonium and the same parallels with the bottom quark and bottomonium more than two dozen previously unpredicted charmonium and bottomonium like states have been discovered and the understanding of heavy quarkonium physics is undetermined previously postulated exotic standard model states might apply to these new unique particles one proposed state is the hybrid state of a quark anti quark and a gluon sometimes mentioned with charm quarks as an excited charmonium a multi

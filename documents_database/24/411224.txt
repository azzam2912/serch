in particular a prng is said to have a full cycle if for any valid seed state the prng traverses every valid state before returning to the seed state i e the period is equal to the cardinality of the state space the restrictions on the parameters of a prng for it to possess a full cycle are known only for certain types of prngs such as linear congruential generators and linear feedback shift registers there is no general method to determine whether a prng algorithm is full cycle short of exhausting the state space which may be exponentially large compared to the size of the algorithm s internal state given a random number seed that is greater or equal to zero a total sample size greater than 1 and an increment coprime to the total sample size a full cycle can be generated with the following logic each nonnegative number smaller than the sample size occurs exactly once unsigned int seed 0 unsigned int sample size 3000 unsigned int generated number seed sample size unsigned int increment 7 for unsigned int iterator 0 iterator sample size iterator def cycle seed sample size increment nb seed seed 17 sample size

the loudspeakers have built in amplifiers and feature a feedback sensor on the woofer the sensor measures the output signal of the woofer and compares it to the amplifier input signal this results in a very low distortion and furthermore a more extended low frequency response in a relatively small enclosure any distortion induced by the enclosure or the woofer itself is immediately corrected by the feedback loop to a degree the sensor feedback system also compensates for non optimal room acoustics although the motional feedback technology had been experimented with for several years philips was the first company to successfully create a working prototype and create a commercial product line of loudspeakers and equipment the product manager of the philips high fidelity group piet gouw was responsible for the launch of most of the motional feedback loudspeakers and other high fidelity equipment today at the age of 86 gouw is an active member of mfbfreaks com the home of motional feedback collectors he shares historical stories and answers questions on the mfbfreaks com forum today motional feedback is used by high end audio designers it is said that tentlabs owner guido tent has designed an active subwoofer which uses

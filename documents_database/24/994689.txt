it also has biological activity in its own right including acting as a melatonin receptor agonist an agonist of the trkb and having antioxidant effects like melatonin nas is an agonist at the melatonin receptors mt mt and mt and may be considered to be a neurotransmitter in addition nas is distributed in some areas of the brain where serotonin and melatonin are not suggesting that it may have unique central duties of its own instead of merely functioning as a precursor in the synthesis of melatonin nas is known to have anti depressant neurotrophic and cognition enhancing effects and has been proposed to be a target for the treatment of aging associated cognitive decline and depression nas has been shown to act as a potent trkb receptor agonist while serotonin and melatonin do not subchronic and chronic administration of nas to adult mice induces proliferation of neural progenitor cells npc s blockage of trkb abolished this effect suggesting that it is trkb dependent nas was also found to significantly enhance npc proliferation in sleep deprived mice it is thought that the anti depressant and neurotrophic effects of nas are in part due to its role as a trkb agonist

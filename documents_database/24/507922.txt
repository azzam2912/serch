michaud aims to replace large physical chimneys with a vortex of air created by a shorter less expensive structure the ave induces ground level vorticity resulting in a vortex similar to a naturally occurring landspout or waterspout michaud s patent claims that the main application is that the air flow through the louvers at the base will drive low speed air turbines 21 generating twenty percent additional electric power from the heat normally wasted by conventional power plants that is the vortex engine s proposed main application is as a bottoming cycle for large power plants that need cooling towers the application proposed by louat in his patent claims is to provide a less expensive alternative to a physical solar updraft tower in this application the heat is provided by a large area of ground heated by the sun and covered by a transparent surface that traps hot air in the manner of a greenhouse a vortex is created by deflecting vanes set at an angle relative to the tangent of the outer radius of the solar collector louat estimated that the minimum diameter of the solar collector would need to be 44 metres in order to collect useful energy

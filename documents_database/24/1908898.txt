the nbt toolbox has so far been used in seven peer reviewed research articles and has a broad user base of more than 1000 users the nbt toolbox provides unique features for analysis of resting state eeg or meg recordings nbt offers a pipeline from data storage to statistics including artifact rejection signal visualization biomarker computation statistical testing and biomarker databasing nbt allows for easy implementation of new biomarkers and incorporates an online wiki the nbtwiki that aims at facilitating collaboration among nbt users including extensive help and tutorials the standardised way of data storage and analysis that nbt proposes allow different research projects to merge compare or share their data and biomarker algorithms neuronal oscillations are generated at many spatial and temporal scales of neuronal organization and thought to provide a network level mechanism for the coordination of spatio temporally distributed spiking activity for an adequate understanding of quantitative changes in neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalography eeg or magnetoencephalography meg as a consequence of disease experimental manipulations or genetic variability there is a need to apply multiple biomarker algorithms the aim of the nbt toolbox is to make biomarker research easier at all levels from having raw data cleaning

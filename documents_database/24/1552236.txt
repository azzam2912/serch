the system made entirely with transistors for high performance was conceived designed and developed by a small group of researchers led by mario tchou 1924 1961 it was the first solid state computer designed and manufactured in italy the acronym elea stood for elaboratore elettronico aritmetico arithmetical electronic computer then changed to elaboratore elettronico automatico for marketing reasons and was chosen with reference to the ancient greek colony of elea home of the eleatic school of philosophy about forty units were placed with customers in august 1964 only a few years after releasing the 9003 olivetti s mainframe business was sold to ge the elea 9000 had three generations elea 9001 macchina zero machine zero prototype was made with vacuum tubes but used germanium transistors for the tape drive system the system was completed in spring 1957 and was later sent to ivrea where for six years it controlled the olivetti production warehouses the machine was a prototype elea 9002 macchina 1v machine 1v 1958 was a prototype with printed circuits and optimized design much faster than its predecessor and utilizing silicon transistors for the management of tape drives the machine was used as a test for the transistors to

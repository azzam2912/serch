the adaptation made is usually always to non functional characteristics rather than functional ones something of a misnomer because the thing that adapts is the working system rather than the more abstract architecture which defines the adaptability that is required of that system adaptive software architecture used by programmers in relation to a program an adaptive algorithm is an algorithm which changes its behavior based on the resources available for example in the c standard library the stable partition program acquires as much memory as it can get up to what it would need at most and applies the algorithm using that available memory adaptive infrastructure architecture used by infrastructure engineers in relation to the configuration of processors the computing resources used by applications the partition size or the number of servers in a cluster or the share of a processor or the number of processes are configured so that they shrink or grow with demand adaptive business architecture could also be used for example in connection with a workflow system that assigns human resources to a task or service to match the demand for that task or service or an organisation structure that flexes in response to business changes

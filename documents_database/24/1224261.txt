the planet is the innermost object orbiting the pulsar psr b1257 12 making it a pulsar planet in the dead stellar system it is about twice as massive as the moon and is listed as the least massive planet with the mass accurately determined known including among the planets in the solar system the convention that arose for designating pulsars was that of using the letters psr pulsating source of radio followed by the pulsar s right ascension and degrees of declination the modern convention prefixes the older numbers with a b meaning the coordinates are for the 1950 0 epoch all new pulsars have a j indicating 2000 0 coordinates and also have declination including minutes pulsars that were discovered before 1993 tend to retain their b names rather than use their j names but all pulsars have a j name that provides more precise coordinates of its location in the sky on its discovery the planet was designated psr 1257 12 a and later psr b1257 12 a it was discovered before the convention that extrasolar planets receive designations consisting of the star s name followed by lower case roman letters starting from b was established however it

chhipaa or ranjit is one of the castes of newar the newari caste system is divided according to profession the ranjitkar caste is concerned with the dyeing of clothes as well as other color related activities the word ranjitkar comes from sanskrit origins crudely meaning people concerned with colors whereas the word chhipaa is a nepal bhasa compound word which can be roughly translated as color and allow to dry there are very little written historic documents on ranjitkars however judging by the extravagant clothings that are seen in the sculptures one can speculate that ranjitkars or some other people were present in the nepal during the licchavi era by latest the first mention of ranjitkars in written history might have been during the declaration of the division of castes by jayasthiti malla ethnically ranjitkars like other newar communities are of diverse origin including but not limited to various indic and tibeto burman tribes they have features resembling both tibeto burman and aryans so one may infer that ranjitkars are heterogeneous groups rather that a kin or ethnically homogeneous group like all new s ranjitkars follow a syncretic hindu buddhist religion the priest of ranjitkars are bajrachharyas who are buddhists

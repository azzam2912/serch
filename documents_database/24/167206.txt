hyas was a notable archer who was killed by his intended prey some stories have him dying after attempting to rob a lion of its cubs some have him killed by a serpent but most commonly he is said to have been gored by a wild boar his sisters the hyades mourned his death with so much vehemence and dedication that they died of grief zeus in recognition of their familial love took pity upon them and changed them into stars the constellation hyades and placed them in the head of taurus where their annual rising and setting are accompanied by plentiful rain the mythological use for a hyas apparently a back formation from hyades may simply have been to provide a male figure to consort with the archaic rain nymphs the hyades a chaperone responsible for their behavior as all the archaic sisterhoods even the muses needed to be controlled under the olympian world picture ruck and staples in fact among the poets it is immaterial whether hyas is described as their father or their brother and his death gave these weepy rain nymphs a cause for their weeping mourning for a male being an acceptably passive female role

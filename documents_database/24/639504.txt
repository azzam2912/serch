in effect it was a highly sensitive thermoresistor which could recover amplitude modulated signals something that the coherer the standard detector of the time could not do the first device used to demodulate audio signals it was later superseded by the electrolytic detector also generally attributed to fessenden the barretter principle is still used as a detector for microwave radiation similar to a bolometer fessenden s 1902 patent describes the construction of the device a fine platinum wire about in diameter is embedded in the middle of a silver tube having a diameter of about this compound wire is then drawn until the silver wire has a diameter of about as the platinum wire within it is reduced in the same ratio it is drawn down to a final diameter of the result is called wollaston wire the silver cladding is etched off a short piece of the composite wire leaving an extremely fine platinum wire this is supported on two heavier silver wires in a loop inside a glass bulb the leads are taken out through the glass envelope and the whole device is put under vacuum and then sealed the hot wire barretter depends upon the increase of

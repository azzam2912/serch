several reactions and reagents bear his name most notably the meerwein ponndorf verley reduction the wagner meerwein rearrangement the meerwein arylation reaction and meerwein s salt he originally trained to be a chemistry technician or chemotechnician at the fresenius university of applied sciences between 1898 and 1900 before studying for a chemistry degree at the university of bonn after finishing his phd with richard ansch tz he worked at the university of berlin before returning to bonn where he became professor in 1914 from 1922 till 1928 he was professor for organic chemistry at the university of k nigsberg the last change in his academic career was to the university of marburg the war devastated the institute and meerwein was planning the rebuilding which was finished in 1953 the year he retired from lecturing he conducted experimental work with the help of two postdocs until his death in 1965 his greatest impact upon organic chemistry was to propose the carbocation 2 as a reactive intermediate originally as a rationalization of the racemization of isobornyl chloride 1 catalysed by a lewis acid such as sncl his proposed mechanism for racemization involved a subsequent 2 6 hydride transfer which allows the carbocation

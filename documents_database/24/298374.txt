it is used as a preservative to prevent dried fruit from discoloring and for preserving meats and is used in the same way as sodium thiosulfate to convert elemental halogens to their respective hydrohalic acids in photography and for reducing chlorine levels in pools in boiler systems sulfite and bisulfite are the most commonly employed oxygen scavengers used to prevent pitting corrosion sodium sulfite is also a byproduct of sulfur dioxide scrubbing a part of the flue gas desulfurization process sodium sulfite can be prepared in lab by reacting sodium hydroxide solution with sulfur dioxide gas evolution of so by adding few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid will indicate if sodium hydroxide is nearly gone turned to aqueous sodium sulfite sodium sulfite is made industrially by reacting sulfur dioxide with a solution of sodium carbonate the initial combination generates sodium bisulfite nahso which is converted to the sulfite by reaction with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate the overall reaction is sodium sulfite is primarily used in the pulp and paper industry it is used in water treatment as an oxygen scavenger agent to treat water being fed to steam boilers to avoid corrosion problems in the photographic industry to protect

the generator was originally designed to produce a current pulse with a maximum of 1 8 million amperes in 240 nanoseconds 150 nanoseconds rise time at present the machine is operated with a maximum current of approximately 1 4 million amperes and operates as a z pinch facility the generator consists of four voltage multipliers marx generators each one containing 24 capacitors at the maximum charging voltage of 100 kilo volts an output voltage of 2 4 million volts is produced and delivered into the load section research at the magpie generator has focused in the past on the field of inertial confinement fusion but has recently seen significant adaptations for studies of laboratory astrophysics in particular the study of astrophysical jets in young stellar objects see herbig haro object has been motivated by improved observational capabilities in the recent years the simulation of such large scale events has been undertaken at magpie both from a computational point of view through the gorgon code and from an experimental one by means of the generator magpie is one of several similar pulsed power machines worldwide of which the largest and most powerful is the z machine at sandia national laboratories albuquerque

carinae is a variable star in the constellation carina the spectral type of v399 carinae has been variously assigned between a5 and f0 being a bright luminous supergiant its spectrum is described as having a non photospheric continuum and silicon absorption lines indicative of high mass loss v399 carinae has long been suspected to be variable a 1981 study of yellow supergiants fit observations to a cepheid like light curve with a period of 58 8 days although the luminosity and spectral type do not place the star near the cepheid instability strip it was listed in the general catalogue of variable stars as a possible cep variable further observations refined the period to 47 25 days the hipparcos catalogue classified v399 car as a semiregular variable with a period of 88 days and a mean amplitude of only 0 04 magnitudes an automated classification from hipparos photometry suggested it is an cygni variable the observed brightness varies from magnitude 4 63 to 4 72 v399 lies amongst the stars of the open cluster ic 2581 by far the brightest member of the cluster it is about 7 500 light years from earth assuming it is a member of ic

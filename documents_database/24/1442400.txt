it may have an important role in calcium homeostasis studies in rats indicate that this protein may also play a role in aging as it shows age associated down regulation this gene is part of a gene cluster on chromosome xp11 3 xp11 23 alternative splicing results in two transcript variants having different 5 utrs but encoding the same protein regucalcin is a proposed name for a calcium binding protein that was discovered in 1978 this protein is also known as senescence marker protein 30 smp30 regucalcin differs from calmodulin and other ca related proteins as it does not contain an ef hand motif of ca binding domain it may regulate the effect of ca on liver cell functions from many investigations regucalcin has been shown to play a multifunctional role in many cell types as a regulatory protein in the intracellular signaling system regucalcin and its gene rgn are identified in 16 species consisting of regucalcin family regucalcin is greatly expressed in the liver of rats although the protein is found in small amounts in other tissues and cells the rat regucalcin gene consists of seven exons and six introns and several consensus regulatory elements exist upstream of the

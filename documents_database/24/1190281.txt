pci consists of 39 amino acids mw 4295 da forming a 27 residue globular core stabilized by three disulfide bridges and a c terminal tail with residues 35 39 pci contains a small cysteine rich module called a t knot scaffold that is shared by several different protein families including the egf family because of the structural similarities with egf pci inhibits tumor cell growth mechanism of action is inhibition of receptor dimerization and receptor trans autophosphorylation induced by epidermal growth factor egf pci blocks the formation and activation of erbb1 erbb 2 egfr and her2 heterodimers that have a prominent role in carcinoma development pci also inhibits transforming growth factor alpha tgf alpha in addition for pancreatic enzymes carboxypeptidase a and b pci also inhibits carboxypeptidase r without affecting the activity of carboxypeptidase n in the circulation and have therefore use in thrombolytic therapy blood clot lysis scaffold disambiguation protein kinase chemotherapy thrombolysis cancer research

1964 flower 1964 included the baltoceratidae in the ellesmeroceratid suborder ellesmeroceratina further study of baltoceratid interiors namely regarding the generally thin connecting rings and lack of siphuncular diaphragms showed they are distinct from the typical ellesmerocerids and belong as the ancestral group to the orthocerida where assigned by kroger et al 2007 the baltorceratidae are characterized by dominantly straight slender smooth shells with a moderately large ventral siphuncle composed of orthochoantic septal necks and thin connecting rings free of diaphragms and which in advanced forms becomes more central in position septa are close spaced resulting in short camerae and may form shallow ventral lobes cameral deposits are normal which develop apically and more ventrally two stocks are found within the baltoceratidae those with a calcareous rod secreted on the lower surface of the inside of the siphuncle known as rod bearing and those without in which the interior of the siphuncle tube is empty known as vacuosiphonate empty siphuncled forms the vacuosiphonate gave rise to the michelinoceratidae commonly known as the orthoceratidae which has its beginning in the lower cassinian stage in the latter part of the lower ordovician rod bearing forms gave rise to the troedsonnellidae with early members

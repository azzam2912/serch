they can be used as stereoselective industrial biocatalysts enzymes are proteins that catalyze i e accelerate chemical reactions they are natural catalysts and are ubiquitous in plants animals and microorganisms where they catalyze processes that are vital to living organisms they are intimately involved in numerous biotechnological processes such as cheese making beer brewing and winemaking that date back to the dawn of civilization recent advances in biotechnology particularly in genetic and protein engineering and genetics have provided the basis for the efficient development of enzymes with improved properties for established applications and novel tailor made enzymes for completely new applications where enzymes were not previously used today enzymes are widely applied in many different industries and the number of applications continues to increase examples include food baking dairy products starch conversion and beverage beer wine fruit and vegetable juices processing animal feed textiles pulp and paper detergents biosensors cosmetics health care and nutrition waste water treatment pharmaceutical and chemical manufacture and more recently biofuels such as biodiesel the main driver for the widespread application of enzymes is their small environmental footprint many traditional chemical conversions used in various industries suffer from inherent drawbacks from both an economic and environmental

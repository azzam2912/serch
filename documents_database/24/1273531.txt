bispinors are for example used to describe relativistic spin wave functions in the weyl basis a bispinor consists of two two component weyl spinors formula 2 and formula 3 which transform correspondingly under 0 and 0 representations of the formula 4 group the lorentz group without parity transformations under parity transformation the weyl spinors transform into each other the dirac bispinor is connected with the weyl bispinor by a unitary transformation to the dirac basis the dirac basis is the one most widely used in the literature a bispinor field formula 6 transforms according to the rule where formula 8 is a lorentz transformation here the coordinates of physical points are transformed according to formula 9 while formula 10 a matrix is an element of the spinor representation for spin of the lorentz group in the weyl basis explicit transformation matrices for a boost formula 11 and for a rotation formula 12 are the following here formula 15 is the boost parameter and formula 16 represents rotation around the formula 17 axis formula 18 are the pauli matrices the exponential is the exponential map in this case the matrix exponential defined by putting the matrix into the usual power series

every match is under the control of match officials who consist of the referee and two touch judges or assistant referees further officials can be authorised depending on the level and form of the game when the game of rugby union was developed at rugby school there were no official rugby referees it was not until many years later when the game began to spread internationally that an official was included before the creation of rugby referees the captains from both teams would set the rules down before the game began the two captains would arbitrate the game together as it went on this is where the advantage law comes from in rugby union this was because a team s captain was not likely to complain or stop play if his side benefited from the other team s infringement in 1892 the international rugby board was created as a result of a disputed try that the captains could not agree on whether it had been scored the rugby laws were changed to require one referee and two touch judges at each game to make the arbitration easier and more consistent since then the match official s job has remained constant

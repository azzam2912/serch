it is based on the notion of the killing form a symmetric bilinear form on formula 1 defined by the formula where tr denotes the trace of a linear operator the criterion was introduced by cartan s criterion for solvability states the fact that formula 4 in the solvable case follows from lie s theorem since the trace can be computed after extending the ground field and the theorem puts formula 7 in upper triangular form over the algebraic closure of the ground field the converse can be deduced from the nilpotency criterion based on the jordan chevalley decomposition applying cartan s criterion to the adjoint representation gives cartan s criterion for semisimplicity states conversely it follows easily from cartan s criterion for solvability that a semisimple algebra in characteristic 0 has a non degenerate killing form cartan s criteria fail in characteristic formula 11 for example if a finite dimensional lie algebra is nilpotent then the killing form is identically zero and more generally the killing form vanishes on any nilpotent ideal the converse is false there are non nilpotent lie algebras whose killing form vanishes an example is given by the semidirect product of an abelian lie algebra

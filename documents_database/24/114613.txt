in other words a b is an identity if a and b define the same functions this means that an identity is an equality between functions that are differently defined for example a b a 2 ab b and are identities identities are sometimes indicated by the triple bar symbol instead of the equals sign geometrically these are identities involving certain functions of one or more angles they are distinct from triangle identities which are identities involving both angles and side lengths of a triangle only the former are covered in this article these identities are useful whenever expressions involving trigonometric functions need to be simplified an important application is the integration of non trigonometric functions a common technique involves first using the substitution rule with a trigonometric function and then simplifying the resulting integral with a trigonometric identity one example is formula 1 which is true for all complex values of formula 2 since the complex numbers formula 3 are the domain of sin and cos as opposed to which is true only for some values of formula 2 not all for example the latter equation is true when formula 6 false when formula 7 the following identities hold

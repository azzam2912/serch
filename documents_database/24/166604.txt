contain equal amount of and forms if the racemization results in a mixture where the and enantiomers are present in equal quantities the resulting sample is described as a racemic mixture or a racemate racemization can proceed through a number of different mechanisms and it has particular significance in pharmacology as different enantiomers may have different pharmaceutical effects chiral molecules have two forms at each point of asymmetry which differ in their optical characteristics the levorotatory form the form will rotate the plane of polarization of a beam of light to the left whereas the dextrorotatory form the form will rotate the plane of polarization of a beam of light to the right the two forms which are non superposable when rotated in 3 dimensional space are said to be enantiomers the notation is not to be confused with and naming of molecules which refers to the similarity in structure to glyceraldehyde and glyceraldehyde also r and s refer to the chemical structure of the molecule based on cahn ingold prelog priority rules of naming rather than rotation of light racemization occurs when one pure form of an enantiomer is converted into equal proportion of both enantiomers forming a racemate

photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful and sensitive experimental technique to study surface physics it is based on the photoelectric effect originally observed by heinrich hertz in 1887 and later explained by albert einstein in 1905 that when a material is shone by light the electrons can absorb photons and escape from the material with the kinetic energy formula 1 where formula 2 is the incident photon energy formula 3 the work function of the material since the kinetic energy of ejected electrons are highly associated with the internal electronic structure by analyzing the photoelectron spectroscopy one can realize the fundamental physical and chemical properties of the material such as the type and arrangement of local bonding electronic structure and chemical composition in addition because electrons with different momentum will escape from the sample in different directions angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy is widely used to provide the dispersive energy momentum spectrum the photoemission experiment is conducted using synchrotron radiation light source with typical photon energy of 20 100 ev synchrotron light is ideal for investigating two dimensional surface systems and offers unparalleled flexibility to continuously vary the incident photon energy however due to the high costs to construct and maintain this

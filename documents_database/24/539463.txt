it is developed by the shell oil company shell s in situ conversion process has been under development since the early 1980s in 1997 the first small scale test was conducted on the mahogany property test site located west of denver on colorado s western slope in the piceance creek basin since 2000 additional research and development activities have carried on as a part of the mahogany research project the oil shale heating at mahogany started early 2004 from this test site shell has recovered of shale oil the process heats sections of the vast oil shale field in situ releasing the shale oil and oil shale gas from the rock so that it can be pumped to the surface and made into fuel in this process a freeze wall is first to be constructed to isolate the processing area from surrounding groundwater to maximize the functionality of the freeze walls adjacent working zones will be developed in succession wells eight feet apart are drilled and filled with a circulating super chilled liquid to cool the ground to water is then removed from the working zone heating and recovery wells are drilled at intervals within the working zone electrical heating

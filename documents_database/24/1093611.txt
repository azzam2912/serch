sod is a common test for the accuracy of computational fluid codes like riemann solvers and was heavily investigated by sod in 1978 the test consists of a one dimensional riemann problem with the following parameters for left and right states of an ideal gas formula 1 formula 2 where the time evolution of this problem can be described by solving the euler equations which leads to three characteristics describing the propagation speed of the various regions of the system namely the rarefaction wave the contact discontinuity and the shock discontinuity if this is solved numerically one can test against the analytical solution and get information how well a code captures and resolves shocks and contact discontinuities and reproduce the correct density profile of the rarefaction wave the different states of the solution are separated by the time evolution of the three characteristics of the system which is due to the finite speed of information propagation two of them are equal to the speed of sound of the both states the first one is the position of the beginning of the rarefaction wave while the other is the velocity of the propagation of the shock defining the states after the

both of the natural isotopes have an unexpectedly low nuclear binding energy per nucleon 5 3 mev when compared with the adjacent lighter and heavier elements helium 7 1 mev and beryllium 6 5 mev the longest lived radioisotope of lithium is lithium 8 which has a half life of just 839 4 milliseconds lithium 9 has a half life of 178 3 milliseconds and lithium 11 has a half life of about 8 75 milliseconds all of the remaining isotopes of lithium have half lives that are shorter than 10 nanoseconds the shortest lived known isotope of lithium is lithium 4 which decays by proton emission with a half life of about seconds although the half life of lithium 3 is yet to be determined and is likely to be much shorter like helium 2 diproton which undergoes proton decay within s lithium 7 and lithium 6 are two of the primordial nuclides that were produced in the big bang with lithium 7 to be 10 of all primordial nuclides and amount of lithium 6 around 10 a small percentage of lithium 6 is also known to be produced by nuclear reactions in certain stars the isotopes of lithium

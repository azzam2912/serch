only two were built the d xvi had a fully cantilevered fabric covered parasol wing mounted above the fuselage on a pair of n form struts from the lower fuselage these struts were laterally stabilized with a near horizontal strut on each side joining the upper fuselage and the upper end of the rear member of the n in plan the wing was straight tapered with blunt tips and included a trailing edge cut out to improve upward vision from the cockpit the wing was quite thick and the ailerons short its fuselage was flat sided and rectangular in cross section with plywood covering the prototypes differed in the way this covering was applied on one the grain ran diagonally on the other longitudinally they also differed in their vertical tails one broader and lower than the other both had deep horn balanced rudders which extended to the keel the horizontal tail was mounted at mid fuselage with a straight edged unswept tailplane bearing overhung balanced elevators with outward increasing chord both prototypes had conventional undercarriages with a rigid axle mounted to the lower fuselage by v form struts the main difference between the two prototypes was in the engines

there are two dates for these horeke basalts one at 2 84 and the other at 2 67 million years there is a slight difference in chemistry in the two rocks that have been dated suggesting that the eruption took the form of several flows that once blanketed the high ground to the east of horeke erosion of the clay underlay of the basalt plateau cap started to create a v valley the edges of the cap broke off these blocks travelled downwards along the hill sides towards the bottom of the valley where they accumulated they fill now a portion of the valley which is about 1 4 km long and up to 350 m wide some of the channels discovered in the basalt are 1000 mm deep and up to 300 mm wide which is highly unusual for basalts it is the result of chemical leaching by acidic seepage from the humus on top of the boulders

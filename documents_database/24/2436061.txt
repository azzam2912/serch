it s a restricted version of the deutsch jozsa algorithm where instead of distinguishing between two different classes of functions it tries to learn a string encoded in a function the bernstein vazirani algorithm was designed to prove an oracle separation between complexity classes bqp and bpp given an oracle that implements some function formula 1 it is promised that the function formula 2 is a dot product between formula 3 and a secret string formula 4 modulo 2 formula 5 find formula 6 classically the most efficient method to find the secret string is by evaluating the function formula 7 times where formula 8 formula 9 in contrast to the classical solution which needs at least formula 7 queries of the function to find formula 6 only one query is needed quantumly the quantum algorithm is as follows apply a hadamard transform to the formula 7 qubit state formula 14 to get perform a controlled negation of every state in the superposition generated by the previous hadamard transformation for which the oracle when applied to this state returns 1 this transforms the superposition into another hadamard transform is applied to each qubit which makes it so that for qubits

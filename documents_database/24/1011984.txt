advantages like measuring the distribution of a large amount of analytes at one time without destroying the sample make it a useful method in tissue based study sample preparation is a critical step in imaging spectroscopy scientists take thin tissue slices mounted on conductive microscope slides and apply a suitable maldi matrix to the tissue either manually or automatically next the microscope slide is inserted into a maldi mass spectrometer the mass spectrometer records the spatial distribution of molecular species such as peptides proteins or small molecules suitable image processing software can be used to import data from the mass spectrometer to allow visualization and comparison with the optical image of the sample recent work has also demonstrated the capacity to create three dimensional molecular images using maldi imaging technology and comparison of these image volumes to other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging mri the tissue samples must be preserved quickly in order to reduce molecular degradation the first step is to freeze the sample by wrapping the sample then submerging it in a cryogenic solution once frozen the samples can be stored below 80 c for up to a year when ready to be analyzed the tissue

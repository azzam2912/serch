pumping can be done by turning or on a transition like a ramp or quarter pipe when applied to longboards it is also known as long distance skateboard pumping or ldp pumping is a technique similar to pumping a surfboard transition pumping can only be done when there is a slope differential between the front and rear wheels on a ramp it therefore is only possible at the top and bottom of the slope but in a pipe it is possible at any height above the flat the rider should push downward on the truck with the greatest slope under the wheels on the top of a ramp the front wheels should be pushed and at the bottom the rear trucks should be pushed on a pipe the weight should be applied to the rear truck throughout the entire transition flatland pumping is essentially carving with the proper amount of weight application in order to gain momentum it involves shifting weight in sync with the board s movements in order to gain momentum like pivoting but with all four wheels on the ground by proper timing the proper foot position and the proper set up impressive results can be achieved

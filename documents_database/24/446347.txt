for use the contents are frozen in a freezer both ice and other non toxic refrigerants mostly water can absorb a considerable amount of heat before they warm above 0 c due to the high latent heat of fusion of water these packs are commonly used to keep food cool in portable coolers or as a cold compress to alleviate the pain of minor injuries or in insulated shipping containers to keep products cool during transport ice packs are used in coolers to keep perishable foods especially meats dairy products eggs etc below the danger zone when outside a refrigerator or freezer and to keep drinks pleasantly cool the amount of ice needed varies with the amount of food its initial temperature the thermal insulation of the cooler and the ambient temperature and exposure to direct sunlight ice initially well below freezing temperature will last a little longer water has a much higher latent heat of fusion than most substances and a melting temperature which is convenient and easily attained with for example a household freezer additives to improve the properties of water are often used for example substances can be added to prevent bacterial growth in the pack or

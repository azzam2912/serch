the objective of the euclid mission is to better understand dark energy and dark matter by accurately measuring the acceleration of the universe to achieve this the korsch type telescope will measure the shapes of galaxies at varying distances from earth and investigate the relationship between distance and redshift dark energy is generally accepted as contributing to the increased acceleration of the expanding universe so understanding this relationship will help to refine how physicists and astrophysicists understand it euclid mission advances and complements esa s planck telescope the mission is named after the ancient greek mathematician euclid of alexandria euclid is a medium class m class mission and is part of esa s cosmic vision 2015 2025 scientific program this class of missions have an esa budget cap at around 500 million euclid was chosen in october 2011 together with solar orbiter out of several competing missions the launch date is planned for june 2022 euclid will probe the history of the expansion of the universe and the formation of cosmic structures by measuring the redshift of galaxies out to a value of 2 which is equivalent to seeing back 10 billion years in the past the link between galactic

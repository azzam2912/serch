its role is to disrupt the antiviral activity of the human enzyme apobec specifically apobec3g a3g in short by targeting it for ubiquitination and cellular degradation apobec is a cytidine deaminase enzyme that mutates viral nucleic acids vif is a 23 kilodalton protein that is essential for viral replication vif inhibits the cellular protein apobec3g from entering the virion during budding from a host cell by targeting it for proteasomal degradation vif binds to a3g as well as the cellular cullin5 e3 ubiquitin ligase elob eloc cul5 and a cbfb cofactor so that the ligase can be hijacked to tag a3g for degradation the crystal structure of the hiv vif bc box in complex with human elonginb and elonginc was solved in 2008 and the structure of the full vif e3 complex was solved in 2014 in the absence of vif apobec3g causes hypermutation of the viral genome rendering it dead on arrival at the next host cell apobec3g is thus a host defence to retroviral infection which hiv 1 has overcome by the acquisition of vif targeting vif has been suggested as a strategy for future hiv drug therapies vif was considered as a phospho protein and phosphorylation seemed

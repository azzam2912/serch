it is often useful to render picture elements pixels in separate passes and then combine the resulting multiple 2d images into a single final image called the composite for example compositing is used extensively when combining computer rendered image elements with live footage alpha blending is also used in 2d computer graphics to put rasterized foreground elements over a background in order to combine these picture elements correctly it is necessary to keep an associated matte for each element this matte contains the coverage information the shape of the geometry being drawn making it possible to distinguish between parts of the image where the geometry was actually drawn and parts that are empty to store matte information the concept of an alpha channel was introduced by alvy ray smith in the late 1970s and fully developed in a 1984 paper by thomas porter and tom duff in a 2d picture element pixel which stores a color for each pixel additional data is stored in the alpha channel with a value ranging from 0 to 1 a value of 0 means that the pixel is transparent and does not provide any coverage information i e there is no occlusion at the

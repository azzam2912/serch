its name was proposed by remo ruffini and john archibald wheeler during the les houches lectures in 1971 and is derived from the greek word ergon which means work it received this name because it is theoretically possible to extract energy and mass from this region the ergosphere touches the event horizon at the poles of a rotating black hole and extends to a greater radius at the equator with a low spin of the central mass the shape of the ergosphere can be approximated by an oblate spheroid while with higher spins it resembles a pumpkin shape the equatorial maximal radius of an ergosphere corresponds to the schwarzschild radius of a non rotating black hole the polar minimal radius can be as little as half the schwarzschild radius the radius of a non rotating black hole in the case that the black hole is rotating maximally at higher rotation rates the black hole could not have formed as a black hole rotates it twists spacetime in the direction of the rotation at a speed that decreases with distance from the event horizon this process is known as the lense thirring effect or frame dragging because of this dragging effect

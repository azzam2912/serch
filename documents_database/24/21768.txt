for a cubic polynomial with real coefficients the discriminant is zero when two roots coincide positive if the roots are three distinct real numbers and negative if there is one real root and two distinct complex conjugate roots for a real polynomial of degree 4 or greater the discriminant is zero if and only if it has a multiple root and positive if and only if the number of non real roots is a multiple of 4 the discriminant is widely used in number theory either directly or through its generalization as the discriminant of a number field for factoring a polynomial with integer coefficients the standard method consists in first factoring its reduction modulo a prime number not dividing the discriminant nor dividing the leading coefficient in algebraic geometry the discriminant with respect to one of the variables characterizes the points of a hypersurface where the implicit function theorem does not apply the term discriminant was coined in 1851 by the british mathematician james joseph sylvester let be a polynomial of degree this means formula 4 such that the coefficients formula 5 belong to a field or more generally to a commutative ring the resultant of and its derivative

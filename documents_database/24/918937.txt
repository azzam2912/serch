individually these two carbides have the highest melting points among the binary compounds and respectively and their alloy with a composition tahfc is believed to have a melting point of very few measurements of melting point in tantalum hafnium carbide have been reported because of the obvious experimental difficulties at extreme temperatures a 1965 study of the tac hfc solid solutions at temperatures 2225 2275 c found a minimum in the vaporization rate and thus maximum in the thermal stability for tahfc this rate was comparable to that of tungsten and was weakly dependent on the initial density of the samples which were sintered from tac hfc powder mixtures also at 2225 2275 c in a separate study tahfc was found to have the minimum oxidation rate among the tac hfc solid solutions tahfc was manufactured by goodfellow company as a 45 m powder at a price of 9 540 kg 99 0 purity individual tantalum and hafnium carbides have a rocksalt cubic lattice structure they are usually carbon deficient and have nominal formulas tac and hfc with x 0 7 1 0 for ta and x 0 56 1 0 for hf the same structure is also observed for

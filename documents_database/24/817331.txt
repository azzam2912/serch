closeness is typically expressed in terms of a dissimilarity function the less similar the objects the larger the function values formally the nearest neighbor nn search problem is defined as follows given a set s of points in a space m and a query point q m find the closest point in s to q donald knuth in vol 3 of the art of computer programming 1973 called it the post office problem referring to an application of assigning to a residence the nearest post office a direct generalization of this problem is a k nn search where we need to find the k closest points most commonly m is a metric space and dissimilarity is expressed as a distance metric which is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality even more common m is taken to be the d dimensional vector space where dissimilarity is measured using the euclidean distance manhattan distance or other distance metric however the dissimilarity function can be arbitrary one example is asymmetric bregman divergence for which the triangle inequality does not hold the nearest neighbor search problem arises in numerous fields of application including various solutions to the nns problem have been proposed the quality

the terms in this glossary may be used by industry professionals for education materials and by the general public in a closed loop system the heat exchanger is typically coils of high density polyethylene pipe installed in the ground under or around a building a heat transfer fluid usually water or water mixed with antifreeze propylene glycol ethanol or methanol is circulated through this pipe warming or cooling to the temperature of the earth or rock around it in open loop systems the pipe draws water from a well lake or pond after it is warmed or cooled the water is returned via a discharge well or back to the lake or pond the fluid from the open or closed loop is circulated through a heat pump the refrigerant in the heat pump either extracts heat from the fluid or rejects heat to it cooling or warming the refrigerant when heat is absorbed by the refrigerant the heat pump boosts its temperature and sends it to the air handler to circulate hot air to heat the home and optionally to a hot water heater to produce domestic hot water the now cooled fluid goes back into the closed loop or

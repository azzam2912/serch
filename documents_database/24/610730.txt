there are some minor differences in how the palmar plates are attached proximally and in the segmentation of the flexor tendon sheath but the major differences are the smaller dimension and reduced mobility of the distal joint the pip joint exhibits great lateral stability its transverse diameter is greater than its antero posterior diameter and its thick collateral ligaments are tight in all positions during flexion contrary to those in the metacarpophalangeal joint the capsule extensor tendon and skin are very thin and lax dorsally allowing for both phalanx bones to flex more than 100 until the base of the middle phalanx makes contact with the condylar notch of the proximal phalanx at the level of the pip joint the extensor mechanism splits into three bands the central slip attaches to the dorsal tubercle of the middle phalanx near the pip joint the pair of lateral bands to which contribute the extensor tendons continue past the pip joint dorsally to the joint axis these three bands are united by a transverse retinacular ligament which runs from the palmar border of the lateral band to the flexor sheath at the level of the joint and which prevents dorsal displacement of that

assuming that is an invertible function the second equation can be written as taking the equation can be written as for a function assumed to be known the task is to solve the functional equation for the function possibly satisfying additional requirements such as the change of variables for a real parameter brings abel s equation into the celebrated schr der s equation the further change into b ttcher s equation the abel equation is a special case of and easily generalizes to the translation equation e g for formula 6 the abel function further provides the canonical coordinate for lie advective flows one parameter lie groups initially the equation in the more general form was reported even in the case of a single variable the equation is non trivial and admits special analysis in the case of a linear transfer function the solution is expressible compactly the equation of tetration is a special case of abel s equation with in the case of an integer argument the equation encodes a recurrent procedure e g and so on fatou coordinates describe local dynamics of discrete dynamical system near a parabolic fixed point

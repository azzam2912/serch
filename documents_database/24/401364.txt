it covers the case for small deflections of a beam that are subjected to lateral loads only it is thus a special case of timoshenko beam theory it was first enunciated circa 1750 but was not applied on a large scale until the development of the eiffel tower and the ferris wheel in the late 19th century following these successful demonstrations it quickly became a cornerstone of engineering and an enabler of the second industrial revolution additional analysis tools have been developed such as plate theory and finite element analysis but the simplicity of beam theory makes it an important tool in the sciences especially structural and mechanical engineering prevailing consensus is that galileo galilei made the first attempts at developing a theory of beams but recent studies argue that leonardo da vinci was the first to make the crucial observations da vinci lacked hooke s law and calculus to complete the theory whereas galileo was held back by an incorrect assumption he made the bernoulli beam is named after jacob bernoulli who made the significant discoveries leonhard euler and daniel bernoulli were the first to put together a useful theory circa 1750 at the time science and engineering were

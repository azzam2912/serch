this process occurs in mammalian embryos and can also occur later on in fully developed organisms during mammalian embryo development cavitation is a routine process however the formation of cavities in fully developed organs especially in lung tissue is usually the sign of a severe medical condition or disease such as tuberculosis cavitation is a crucial process in the development of mammalian embryos after fertilization rapid cell division occurs which results in the formation of the morula or a solid ball of cells the morula is the precursor structure to the blastula which is an animal embryo in the early stages of development the morula consists of a cluster of internal cells covered by a layer of external cells the internal cells become the inner cellular mass which becomes the entire embryo the external cells are destined to become a structure called the trophoblast a layer of tissue on the inside of the embryo that provides it with nourishment the trophoblast cells become extraembryonic structures necessary for development after the initial formation of the morula it does not have an interior space or cavity cavitation occurs to create a cavity on the inside of the morula this process occurs when

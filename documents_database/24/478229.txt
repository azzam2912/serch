the e288 experiment team a group of physicists led by leon lederman who worked on the e288 particle detector announced that a particle with a mass of about 6 0 gev which decayed into an electron and a positron was being produced by the fermilab particle accelerator the particle s initial name was the greek letter upsilon formula 1 after taking further data the group discovered that this particle did not actually exist and the discovery was named oops leon as a pun on the original name and the first name of the e288 collaboration leader the original publication was based on an apparent peak resonance in a histogram of the invariant mass of electron positron pairs produced by protons colliding with a stationary beryllium target implying the existence of a particle with a mass of 6 gev which was being produced and decaying into two leptons an analysis showed that there was less than one chance in fifty that the apparent resonance was simply the result of a coincidence subsequent data collected by the same experiment in 1977 revealed that the resonance had been such a coincidence after all however a new resonance at 9 5 gev was discovered

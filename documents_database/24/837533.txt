orbital has developed infrastructure in engine design and modelling numerical analysis computational fluid dynamics combustion and fuel system development rapid turn around prototyping and engine management system software and hardware design orbital autogas systems a former subsidiary of orbital corporation used to produce a retrofit lpg system applicable to a range of vehicles orbital liquid lpg injection lli is claimed to be the latest generation in automotive lpg fuel systems promising substantial fuel savings improved fuel consumption and reduced pollution injection of lpg into the engine as a liquid rather than a vapour is claimed to improve engine volumetric efficiency producing more power from less fuel due to falling demand for automotive lpg conversions and the resulting decline in profitability the business was closed in december 2015 the assets and ongoing customer and supplier contracts were sold to sprint gas aust pty ltd for approximately a 500 000 a technology named flexdi purports to improve emissions and fuel consumption in internal combustion engines designed to accept any common fuel type the invention is being promoted to marine recreational and light commercial vehicle markets including autorickshaws in 2003 the company was awarded a banksia award for its innovative combustion technology winning

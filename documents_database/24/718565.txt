in this technology a collection of capture antibodies are spotted and fixed on a solid surface such as glass plastic membrane or silicon chip and the interaction between the antibody and its target antigen is detected antibody microarrays are often used for detecting protein expression from various biofluids including serum plasma and cell or tissue lysates antibody arrays may be used for both basic research and medical and diagnostic applications the concept and methodology of antibody microarrays were first introduced by tse wen chang in 1983 in a scientific publication and a series of patents when he was working at centocor in malvern pennsylvania chang coined the term antibody matrix and discussed array arrangement of minute antibody spots on small glass or plastic surfaces he demonstrated that a 10 10 100 in total and 20 20 400 in total grid of antibody spots could be placed on a 1 1 cm surface he also estimated that if an antibody is coated at a 10 g ml concentration which is optimal for most antibodies 1 mg of antibody can make 2 000 000 dots of 0 25 mm diameter chang s invention focused on the employment of antibody microarrays for the

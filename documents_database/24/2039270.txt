this technique builds on the principle of electrowetting which has proven useful in liquid actuation due to fast switching response times and low power consumption where traditional electrowetting runs into challenges however such as in the simultaneous manipulation of multiple droplets oew presents a lucrative alternative that is both simpler and cheaper to produce oew surfaces are easy to fabricate since they require no lithography and have real time reconfigurable large scale manipulation control due to its reaction to light intensity the traditional electrowetting mechanism has been receiving increasing interest due to its ability to control tension forces on a liquid droplet as surface tension acts as the dominant liquid actuation force in nano scale applications electrowetting has been used to modify this tension at the solid liquid interface through the application of an external voltage the applied electric field causes a change in the contact angle of the liquid droplet and in turn changes the surface tensions across the droplet precise manipulation of the electric field allows control of the droplets the droplet is placed on an insulating substrate located in between an electrode the optoelectrowetting mechanism adds a photoconductor underneath the conventional electrowetting circuit with an ac power

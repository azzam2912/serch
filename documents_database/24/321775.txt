this is measured with respect to a reference frame in which the solid earth is fixed a so called earth centered earth fixed or ecef reference frame this variation is only a few meters polar motion is defined relative to a conventionally defined reference axis the cio conventional international origin being the pole s average location over the year 1900 it consists of three major components a free oscillation called chandler wobble with a period of about 435 days an annual oscillation and an irregular drift in the direction of the 80th meridian west which has lately been shifted toward the east the mean displacement far exceeds the magnitude of the wobbles this can lead to errors in software for earth observing spacecraft since analysts may read off a 5 meter circular motion and ignore it while a 20 meter offset exists fouling the accuracy of the calculated latitude and longitude the latter are determined based on the international terrestrial reference system which follows the polar motion the slow drift about 20 m since 1900 is partly due to motions in the earth s core and mantle and partly to the redistribution of water mass as the greenland ice sheet

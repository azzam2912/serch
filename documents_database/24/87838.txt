stormwater can soak into the soil infiltrate be stored on the land surface in ponds and puddles evaporate or runoff most runoff is conveyed directly to nearby streams rivers or other water bodies surface water without treatment in natural landscapes such as forests soil absorbs much of the stormwater plants also reduce stormwater by improving infiltration intercepting precipitation as it falls and by taking up water through their roots in developed environments unmanaged stormwater can create two major issues one related to the volume and timing of runoff flooding and the other related to potential contaminants the water is carrying water pollution stormwater is also an important resource as human population and demand for water grow particularly in arid and drought prone climates stormwater harvesting techniques and purification could potentially make some urban environments self sustaining in terms of water with less vegetation and more impervious surfaces parking lots roads buildings compacted soil developed areas allow less rain to infiltrate into the ground and more runoff is generated than in the undeveloped condition additionally conveyances such as ditches and storm sewers quickly transport runoff away from commercial and residential areas into nearby water bodies this greatly increases the volume of

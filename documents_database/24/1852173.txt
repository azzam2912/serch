kif15 maintains half spindle separation by opposing forces generated by other motor proteins kif15 co localizes with microtubules and actin filaments in both dividing cells and in postmitotic neurons kif15 also known as kinesin 12 and hklp2 is a motor protein expressed in all cells during mitosis and in postmitotic neurons undergoing axon growth kif15 maintains bipolar microtubule spindle apparatus in dividing cells and shares redundant functions with kif11 kif15 is thought to promote spindle assembly by cross linking and sliding along microtubules creating a separation between centrosomes hela cells depleted of kif11 with reduced microtubule dynamics are able to form bipolar spindles from acentrosomal asters in a kif15 dependent manner hence inhibition of kif15 function will be a vital therapeutic approach in cancer chemotherapy kif15 restricts the movement of short microtubules into growing axons by generating forces on microtubules which counteract those generated by cytoplasmic dynein kif15 together with kif23 become enriched in dendrites as neurons mature to promote the transport of minus end distal microtubules into nascent dendrites kif15 has been shown to interact with tpx2 both these dimers cooperate to slide along microtubules and maintain bipolar spindles

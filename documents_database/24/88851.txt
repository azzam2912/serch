it is distinct from acute beryllium poisoning which became rare following occupational exposure limits established around 1950 berylliosis is an occupational lung disease while there is no cure symptoms can be treated with single or prolonged exposure by inhalation the lungs may become sensitized to beryllium berylliosis has an insidious onset and runs an indolent course some people who are sensitized to beryllium may not have symptoms continued exposure causes the development of small inflammatory nodules called granulomas of note the authors of a 2006 study suggested that beryllium inhalation was not the only form of exposure and perhaps skin exposure was also a cause as they found that a reduction in beryllium inhalation did not result in a reduction in cbd or beryllium sensitization granulomas are seen in other chronic diseases such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis and it can occasionally be hard to distinguish berylliosis from these disorders however granulomas of cbd will typically be non caseating i e not characterized by necrosis and therefore not exhibiting a cheese like appearance grossly ultimately this process leads to restrictive lung disease a decrease in diffusion capacity the earliest symptoms are typically cough and shortness of breath other symptoms include chest

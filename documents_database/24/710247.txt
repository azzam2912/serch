they have the secondary network also called a grid network with all supply transformers bussed together on the secondary side at one location spot networks are considered the most reliable and most flexible arrangement of connecting power to all types of loads switching can be done without interrupting the power to the loads electricity distribution networks are typically of two types radial or interconnected a radial network arranges the station and branches like a tree with no connection to any other supply this is typical of long rural lines with isolated load areas in general the radial distribution network has more power failures than the interconnected distribution networks in a secondary network the transformers are distributed across an area e g in streets and have multiple supplies the transformers are wired together on the secondary side the system is arranged so that nearby transformers do not use the same feeder in case of an issue with a feeder or transformer the load is fed by nearby transformers so there is no interruption although a voltage drop for said load may then be present usually a fault on the secondary side is not a big problem since the conductors will destroy

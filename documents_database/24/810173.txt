the comparison is made by using the copula or linking verb is or its negative is not therefore a judgment is a declarative sentence which is a categorical proposition example the tiger is four footed a predicate can also have its own predicate in the example the predicate four footed can itself have the further predicate animal one of these predicates is immediately and directly connected to the subject or thing the other predicate is mediate and indirectly connected to the subject the tiger is a four footed animal in order to have clear knowledge of the relation between a predicate and a subject i can consider a predicate to be a mediate predicate between this mediate predicate or attribute i can place an intermediate predicate for example in the judgment the sun is luminous i attempt a clarification by inserting the predicate star which then becomes an immediate predicate intermediate between the subject sun and the mediate predicate luminous the sun is a star that is luminous sun subject is copula star immediate predicate intermediate predicate middle term luminous remote mediate predicate kant calls this process ratiocination it is the comparison of a remote mediate predicate with a subject

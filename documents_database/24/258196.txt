it permits building the code as the symbols are being transmitted having no initial knowledge of source distribution that allows one pass encoding and adaptation to changing conditions in data the benefit of one pass procedure is that the source can be encoded in real time though it becomes more sensitive to transmission errors since just a single loss ruins the whole code there are a number of implementations of this method the most notable are fgk faller gallager knuth and vitter algorithm it is an online coding technique based on huffman coding having no initial knowledge of occurrence frequencies it permits dynamically adjusting the huffman s tree as data are being transmitted in a fgk huffman tree a special external node called 0 node is used to identify a newly coming character that is whenever new data is encountered output the path to the 0 node followed by the data for a past coming character just output the path of the data in the current huffman s tree most importantly we have to adjust the fgk huffman tree if necessary and finally update the frequency of related nodes as the frequency of a datum is increased the sibling property

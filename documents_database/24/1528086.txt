the gene is expressed in nearly all tissue types at very low levels evolutionarily it can be found throughout the kingdom animalia while the function of the protein is not fully understood by the scientific community bioinformatic tools have shown that the protein bares much similarity to zinc finger or transposase proteins many of its orthologs paralogs and neighboring genes have been shown to possess zinc finger domains the protein contains a hat dimerization domain nears its c terminus this domain is highly conserved in transposase enzymes c7orf38 is located on chromosome 7 at q22 1 its genomic sequence contains 5 612 bp the predominant transcript contains two exons and is 2 507 bp in length the translated protein contains 573 amino acids the 573 amino acid protein has a molecular weight of 66 280 05 the isoelectric point was found to occur at a ph of 5 775 about 1 6 ph lower than that of the average human ph two deviations from prototypical human proteins are evident the protein contains a less than expected number of glycine residues and is rich in leucine residues there are not sections of strong hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity thus it is not predicted

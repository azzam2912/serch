classical wiener space is useful in the study of stochastic processes whose sample paths are continuous functions it is named after the american mathematician norbert wiener consider e r and a metric space m d the classical wiener space c e m is the space of all continuous functions f e m i e for every fixed t in e in almost all applications one takes e 0 t or 0 and m r for some n in n for brevity write c for c 0 t r this is a vector space write c for the linear subspace consisting only of those functions that take the value zero at the infimum of the set e many authors refer to c as classical wiener space the vector space c can be equipped with the uniform norm turning it into a normed vector space in fact a banach space this norm induces a metric on c in the usual way formula 4 the topology generated by the open sets in this metric is the topology of uniform convergence on 0 t or the uniform topology thinking of the domain 0 t as time and the range r as space an intuitive

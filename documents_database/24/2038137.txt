it has coxeter diagram and symmetry order 512 the uniform 8 8 duoprism can be constructed from 8 8 or 4 4 symmetry order 256 or 64 with extended symmetry doubling these with a 2 fold rotation that maps the two orientations of prisms together these can be expressed by 4 permutations of uniform coloring of the octagonal prism cells seen in a skew 2d orthogonal projection it has the same vertex positions as the hexicated 7 simplex except for a center vertex the projected rhombi and squares are also shown in the ammann beenker tiling the regular complex polytope 4 in formula 1 has a real representation as an 8 8 duoprism in 4 dimensional space 4 has 64 vertices and 16 8 edges its symmetry is 4 order 128 it also has a lower symmetry construction or with symmetry 2 order 64 this is the symmetry if the red and blue 8 edges are considered distinct the dual of a 8 8 duoprism is called a 8 8 duopyramid or octagonal duopyramid it has 64 tetragonal disphenoid cells 128 triangular faces 80 edges and 16 vertices the regular complex polygon 4 has 16 vertices in formula 1 with

it arises especially in the step response of bandlimited systems such as low pass filters it is often followed by ringing and at times conflated with the latter maximum overshoot is defined in katsuhiko ogata s discrete time control systems as the maximum peak value of the response curve measured from the desired response of the system in control theory overshoot refers to an output exceeding its final steady state value for a step input the percentage overshoot po is the maximum value minus the step value divided by the step value in the case of the unit step the overshoot is just the maximum value of the step response minus one also see the definition of overshoot in an electronics context for second order systems the percentage overshoot is a function of the damping ratio and is given by the damping ratio can also be found by in electronics overshoot refers to the transitory values of any parameter that exceeds its final steady state value during its transition from one value to another an important application of the term is to the output signal of an amplifier usage overshoot occurs when the transitory values exceed final value when they

sulfate is the spelling recommended by iupac but sulphate is used in british english salts acid derivatives and peroxides of sulfate are widely used in industry sulfates occur widely in everyday life sulfates are salts of sulfuric acid and many are prepared from that acid the sulfate anion consists of a central sulfur atom surrounded by four equivalent oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement the symmetry is the same as that of methane the sulfur atom is in the 6 oxidation state while the four oxygen atoms are each in the 2 state the sulfate ion carries an overall charge of 2 and it is the conjugate base of the bisulfate or hydrogen sulfate ion which is in turn the conjugate base of sulfuric acid organic sulfate esters such as dimethyl sulfate are covalent compounds and esters of sulfuric acid the tetrahedral molecular geometry of the sulfate ion is as predicted by vsepr theory the first description of the bonding in modern terms was by gilbert lewis in his groundbreaking paper of 1916 where he described the bonding in terms of electron octets around each atom that is no double bonds and a formal charge of 2 on the sulfur

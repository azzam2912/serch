the x 15 set speed and altitude records in the 1960s reaching the edge of outer space and returning with valuable data used in aircraft and spacecraft design the x 15 s official world record for the highest speed ever recorded by a manned powered aircraft set in october 1967 when william j knight flew at mach 6 70 at a speed of has remained unbroken during the x 15 program 12 pilots flew a combined 199 flights of these 8 pilots flew a combined 13 flights which met the air force spaceflight criterion by exceeding the altitude of thus qualifying these pilots as being astronauts the air force pilots qualified for military astronaut wings immediately while the civilian pilots were eventually awarded nasa astronaut wings in 2005 35 years after the last x 15 flight the x 15 was based on a concept study from walter dornberger for the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca for a hypersonic research aircraft the requests for proposal rfps were published on 30 december 1954 for the airframe and on 4 february 1955 for the rocket engine the x 15 was built by two manufacturers north american aviation was contracted for the airframe

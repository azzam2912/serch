the steel contains both chromium between 15 and 20 and nickel between 2 and 10 5 metals as the main non iron constituents it is an austenitic stainless steel it is less electrically and thermally conductive than carbon steel and is essentially non magnetic it has a higher corrosion resistance than regular steel and is widely used because of the ease in which it is formed into various shapes the composition was developed by w h hatfield at firth vickers in 1924 and was marketed under the trade name staybrite 18 8 it is specified by sae international as part of its sae steel grades outside of the us it is commonly known as a2 stainless steel in accordance with iso 3506 for fasteners in the commercial cookware industry it is known as 18 8 stainless steel in the unified numbering system it is uns s30400 the japanese equivalent grade of this material is sus304 it is also specified in european norm 1 4301 304 stainless steel has excellent resistance to a wide range of atmospheric environments and many corrosive media it is subject to pitting and crevice corrosion in warm chloride environments and to stress corrosion cracking above about

the deformation of the medium influences the flow of the fluid and vice versa the theory was proposed by maurice anthony biot 1935 1941 as a theoretical extension of soil consolidation models developed to calculate the settlement of structures placed on fluid saturated porous soils the theory of poroelasticity has been widely applied in geomechanics hydrology biomechanics tissue mechanics cell mechanics and micromechanics an intuitive sense of the response of a saturated elastic porous medium to mechanical loading can be developed by thinking about or experimenting with a fluid saturated sponge if a fluid saturated sponge is compressed fluid will flow from the sponge if the sponge is in a fluid reservoir and compressive pressure is subsequently removed the sponge will reimbibe the fluid and expand the volume of the sponge will also increase if its exterior openings are sealed and the pore fluid pressure is increased the basic ideas underlying the theory of poroelastic materials are that the pore fluid pressure contributes to the total stress in the porous matrix medium and that the pore fluid pressure alone can strain the porous matrix medium there is fluid movement in a porous medium due to differences in pore fluid pressure

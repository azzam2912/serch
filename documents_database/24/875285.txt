digital photography and digital cinematography have both advantages and disadvantages relative to still film and motion picture film photography in the 21st century photography came to be predominantly digital but traditional photochemical methods continue to serve many users and applications the visual quality of a digital photograph can be evaluated in several ways the pixel count of an image is related to its spatial resolution and is often used as a figure of merit the quantity of picture elements pixels in the image sensor is usually counted in millions and called megapixels sensor pixel density sets a limit on the final output resolution of images captured with that sensor other factors such as the effect of a bayer pattern or other filter on the digital sensor and the image processing algorithm used to interpolate raw sensor data to image pixels most digital sensors are arranged in a rectangular grid pattern making certain images for example of parallel lines susceptible to moir pattern artifacts film is not affected by moir because of the random orientation of the silver salts in its emulsion however the pattern of these silver salts may become visible upon enlargement creating the patterns called grain in the

that is it satisfies for any formula 5 and any formula 6 and any formula 7 equivalently a pairing is an r linear map where formula 9 denotes the tensor product of m and n a pairing can also be considered as an r linear map formula 10 which matches the first definition by setting formula 11 a pairing is called perfect if the above map formula 12 is an isomorphism of r modules a pairing is called non degenerate on the right if for the above map we have that formula 13 for all formula 14 implies formula 15 similarly formula 16 is called non degenerate on the left if formula 13 for all formula 18 implies formula 19 a pairing is called alternating if formula 20 and for the above map we have formula 21 for all m any scalar product on a real vector space v is a pairing set in the above definitions the determinant map 2 2 matrices over k k can be seen as a pairing formula 22 the hopf map formula 23 written as formula 24 is an example of a pairing for instance hardie et al present an explicit construction of the

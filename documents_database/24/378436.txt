a pyramidal diamond point is pressed into the polished surface of the test material with a known often 100g load for a specified dwell time and the resulting indentation is measured using a microscope the geometry of this indenter is an extended pyramid with the length to width ratio being 7 1 and respective face angles are 172 degrees for the long edge and 130 degrees for the short edge the depth of the indentation can be approximated as 1 30 of the long dimension the knoop hardness hk or khn is then given by the formula where hk values are typically in the range from 100 to 1000 when specified in the conventional units of kg mm the si unit pascals are sometimes used instead 1 kg mm 9 80665 mpa the test was developed by frederick knoop and colleagues at the national bureau of standards now nist of the united states in 1939 and is defined by the astm e384 standard the advantages of the test are that only a very small sample of material is required and that it is valid for a wide range of test forces the main disadvantages are the difficulty of using a

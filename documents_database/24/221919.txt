during mastication three muscles of mastication musculi masticatorii are responsible for adduction of the jaw and one the lateral pterygoid helps to abduct it all four move the jaw laterally other muscles usually associated with the hyoid such as the mylohyoid muscle are responsible for opening the jaw in addition to the lateral pterygoid the muscles are in humans the mandible or lower jaw is connected to the temporal bone of the skull via the temporomandibular joint this is an extremely complex joint which permits movement in all planes the muscles of mastication originate on the skull and insert into the mandible thereby allowing for jaw movements during contraction each of these primary muscles of mastication is paired with each side of the mandible possessing one of the four unlike most of the other facial muscles which are innervated by the facial nerve or cn vii the muscles of mastication are innervated by the trigeminal nerve or cn v more specifically they are innervated by the mandibular branch or v this is a testament to their shared embryological origin from the first pharyngeal arch the muscles of facial expression on the other hand derive from the second pharyngeal arch the

they are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily igsf cam the members of the l1 family in humans are called l1 or l1cam chl1 close homologue of l1 neurofascin and nrcam ngcam related cell adhesion molecule l1 family members are found on neurons especially on their axons sometimes they are found on glia such as schwann cells radial glia and bergmann glia cells and as such are important for neural cell migration during development l1 family members are expressed throughout the vertebrate and invertebrate kingdoms l1 family members are able to bind to a number of other proteins as cell adhesion molecules they often bind homophilically to themselves for example l1 on one cell binding to l1 on an adjacent cell l1 family members also bind heterophilically to members of the contactin or cntn1 family l1 family members bind to many cytoplasmic proteins such as ankyrins ezrin moesin radixin erm proteins signaling molecules like src src gene and erk extracellular signal regulated kinases and proteins important in trafficking such as ap 2 nrcam and neurofascin both have class 1 pdz domain binding motifs at their cooh termini nrcam can bind to sap102 and other members of the maguk family roles in

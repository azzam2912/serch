when both formula 1 and formula 2 are categorical variables a conditional probability table is typically used to represent the conditional probability the conditional distribution contrasts with the marginal distribution of a random variable which is its distribution without reference to the value of the other variable if the conditional distribution of formula 2 given formula 1 is a continuous distribution then its probability density function is known as the conditional density function the properties of a conditional distribution such as the moments are often referred to by corresponding names such as the conditional mean and conditional variance more generally one can refer to the conditional distribution of a subset of a set of more than two variables this conditional distribution is contingent on the values of all the remaining variables and if more than one variable is included in the subset then this conditional distribution is the conditional joint distribution of the included variables for discrete random variables the conditional probability mass function of formula 2 given formula 12 can be written according to its definition as due to the occurrence of formula 13 in a denominator this is defined only for non zero hence strictly positive formula 14

estimation of covariance matrices then deals with the question of how to approximate the actual covariance matrix on the basis of a sample from the multivariate distribution simple cases where observations are complete can be dealt with by using the sample covariance matrix the sample covariance matrix scm is an unbiased and efficient estimator of the covariance matrix if the space of covariance matrices is viewed as an extrinsic convex cone in r however measured using the intrinsic geometry of positive definite matrices the scm is a biased and inefficient estimator in addition if the random variable has normal distribution the sample covariance matrix has wishart distribution and a slightly differently scaled version of it is the maximum likelihood estimate cases involving missing data require deeper considerations another issue is the robustness to outliers to which sample covariance matrices are highly sensitive statistical analyses of multivariate data often involve exploratory studies of the way in which the variables change in relation to one another and this may be followed up by explicit statistical models involving the covariance matrix of the variables thus the estimation of covariance matrices directly from observational data plays two roles estimates of covariance matrices are required

it can contribute to efficiency in the program s operation if properly and appropriately used the opposite of lazy loading is eager loading this makes it ideal in use cases where network content is accessed and initialization times are to be kept at a minimum such as in the case of web pages there are four common ways of implementing the lazy load design pattern lazy initialization a virtual proxy a ghost and a value holder each has its own advantages and disadvantages with lazy initialization the object to be lazily loaded is originally set to null and every request for the object checks for null and creates it on the fly before returning it first as in this c example private int mywidgetid private widget mywidget null public widget mywidget or with the null coalescing operator private int mywidgetid private widget mywidget null public widget mywidget this method is the simplest to implement although if null is a legitimate return value it may be necessary to use a placeholder object to signal that it has not been initialized if this method is used in a multithreaded application synchronization must be used to avoid race conditions virtual proxy is an

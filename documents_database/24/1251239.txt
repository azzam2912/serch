novaezelandiae which it resembled in appearance but was later lumped with reischek s parakeet from the antipodes islands in a 2001 paper by wee ming boon and others following an examination of the molecular systematics of the genus which found that many of the red crowned parakeet subspecies should be elevated to full species however subsequently the provenance of boon et al s supposed macquarie island material was shown to be mistaken originating from the antipodes islands instead when macquarie island was discovered in 1810 the parrots were widespread in tussock grassland and abundant on the shoreline feeding on invertebrates in beach washed seaweed despite the introduction of dogs and cats to the island by 1820 as well as being hunted for food by sealers the parrots remained common there until about 1880 the transition from abundance to extinction took little more than a decade the critical events leading to the extinction of the parrot were the introductions of both wekas and european rabbits to the island in the 1870s and their subsequent spread during the 1880s until then winter with the seasonal absence of burrow nesting petrels and breeding penguins was a period of food scarcity for terrestrial predators

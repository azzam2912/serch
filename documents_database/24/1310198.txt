in contrast to early wireless sensor networks that were dedicated to a specific application e g target tracking vsns enable multi purpose collaborative and resource efficient wsns the key idea difference of vsns is the collaboration and resource sharing by doing so nodes achieve application objectives in a more resource efficient way these networks may further involve dynamically varying subset of sensor nodes e g when the phenomenon migrates sensors that detect the phenomenon changes with time and or users users that are accessing the network changes with time a vsn can be formed by providing logical connectivity among collaborative sensors nodes can be grouped into different vsns based on the phenomenon they track e g rock slides vs animal crossing or the task they perform vsns are expected to provide the protocol support for formation usage adaptation and maintenance of subset of sensors collaborating on a specific task s even the nodes that do not sense the particular event phenomenon could be part of a vsn as far as they are willing to allow sensing nodes to communicate through them thus vsns make use of intermediate nodes networks or other vsns to efficiently deliver messages across members of a

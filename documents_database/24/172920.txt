if the parameter or the statistic is the mean it is called the standard error of the mean sem the sampling distribution of a population mean is generated by repeated sampling and recording of the means obtained this forms a distribution of different means and this distribution has its own mean and variance mathematically the variance of the sampling distribution obtained is equal to the variance of the population divided by the sample size this is because as the sample size increases sample means cluster more closely around the population mean therefore the relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is such that for a given sample size the standard error equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size in other words the standard error of the mean is a measure of the dispersion of sample means around the population mean in regression analysis the term standard error refers either to the square root of the reduced chi squared statistic or the standard error for a particular regression coefficient as used in e g confidence intervals the standard error of the mean sem can be expressed as where since the population standard deviation

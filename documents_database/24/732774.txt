it was a joint venture of the university of california irvine the university of michigan and the brookhaven national laboratory like several other particle detectors see kamiokande ii it was built primarily with the goal of observing proton decay but it achieved greater fame through neutrino observation particularly those from supernova sn 1987a imb consisted of a roughly cubical tank about 17 17 5 23 meters filled with 2 5 million gallons of ultrapure water which was surrounded by 2 048 photomultiplier tubes imb detected fast moving particles such as those produced by proton decay or neutrino interactions by picking up the cerenkov radiation generated when such a particle moves faster than the speed of light in water since directional information was available from the phototubes imb was able to estimate the initial direction of neutrinos ground was broken at the salt mine in 1979 the water tank for the detector itself was finished in 1981 the project was delayed by funding problems and leaks in the water tank but by the end of summer 1982 the detector was operating at full capacity the first results were published in 1982 in 1987 it gained fame for detecting 8 of the

like most of his compatriots borges was a great admirer of this work which he often characterized as the one clearly great work in argentine literature because mart n fierro has been widely considered beginning with leopoldo lugones s el payador 1916 the fountainhead or pinnacle of argentine literature argentina s don quixote or divine comedy and because borges was certainly argentina s greatest twentieth century writer borges s 1953 book of essays about the poem and its critical and popular reception el mart n fierro written with margarita guerrero gives insight into borges s identity as an argentine the poem s central character mart n fierro is a gaucho a free poor pampas dweller who is illegally drafted to serve at a border fort defending against indian attacks he eventually deserts and becomes a gaucho matrero basically the argentine equivalent of a north american western outlaw in his book of essays borges displays his typical concision evenhandedness and love of paradox but he also places himself in the spectrum of views of mart n fierro and thus effectively gives a clue as to his borges s relation to nationalist myth borges has nothing but praise for the aesthetic merit

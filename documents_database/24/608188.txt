they contain actin filaments cross linked into bundles by actin binding proteins e g fascin and fimbrin filopodia form focal adhesions with the substratum linking it to the cell surface many types of migrating cells display filopodia which are thought to be involved in both sensation of chemotropic cues and resulting changes in directed locomotion activation of the rho family of small ras related gtpases particularly cdc42 and their downstream intermediates results in the polymerization of actin fibers by ena vasp homology proteins growth factors bind to receptor tyrosine kinases resulting in the polymerization of actin filaments which when cross linked make up the supporting cytoskeletal elements of filopodia rho activity also results in activation by phosphorylation of ezrin moesin radixin family proteins that link actin filaments to the filopodia membrane filopodia have roles in sensing migration and cell cell interaction to close a wound in vertebrates growth factors stimulate the formation of filopodia in fibroblasts to direct fibroblast migration and wound closure in developing neurons filopodia extend from the growth cone at the leading edge in neurons deprived of filopodia by partial inhibition of actin filaments polymerization growth cone extension continues as normal but direction of growth is disrupted

it was the first x ray mission capable of simultaneously observing targets over more than 3 decades of energy from 0 1 to 300 kiloelectronvolts kev with relatively large area good for the time energy resolution and imaging capabilities with a spatial resolution of 1 arc minute between 0 1 and 10 kev bepposax was a major programme of the italian space agency asi with the participation of the netherlands agency for aerospace programmes nivr the prime contractor for the space segment was alenia while nuova telespazio led the development of the ground segment most of the scientific instruments were developed by the italian national research council cnr while the wide field cameras were developed by the netherlands institute for space research sron and the lecs was developed by the astrophysics division of the european space agency s estec facility bepposax was named in honour of the italian physicist giuseppe beppo occhialini sax stands for satellite per astronomia a raggi x or satellite for x ray astronomy x ray observations cannot be performed from ground based telescopes since earth s atmosphere blocks most of the incoming radiation one of bepposax s main achievements was the identification of numerous gamma ray

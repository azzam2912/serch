reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning it differs from supervised learning in that labelled input output pairs need not be presented and sub optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected instead the focus is finding a balance between exploration of uncharted territory and exploitation of current knowledge the environment is typically formulated as a markov decision process mdp as many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilize dynamic programming techniques the main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the mdp and they target large mdps where exact methods become infeasible reinforcement learning due to its generality is studied in many other disciplines such as game theory control theory operations research information theory simulation based optimization multi agent systems swarm intelligence statistics and genetic algorithms in the operations research and control literature reinforcement learning is called approximate dynamic programming or neuro dynamic programming the problems of interest in reinforcement learning have also been studied in the theory of optimal control which is concerned mostly with the existence and characterization of optimal solutions

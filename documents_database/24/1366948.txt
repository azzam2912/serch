the basic design of the pressurized water reactor includes a requirement that the coolant water in the reactor coolant system must not boil put another way the coolant must remain in the liquid state at all times especially in the reactor vessel to achieve this the coolant in the reactor coolant system is maintained at a pressure sufficiently high that boiling does not occur at the coolant temperatures experienced while the plant is operating or in an analyzed transient to pressurize the coolant system to a higher pressure than the boiling point of the coolant at operating temperatures a separate pressurizing system is required that is the function of the pressurizer in a pressurized water reactor plant the pressurizer is basically a cylindrical pressure vessel with hemispherical ends mounted with the long axis vertical and directly connected by a single run of piping to the reactor coolant system it is located inside the reactor containment building although the water in the pressurizer is the same reactor coolant as in the rest of the reactor coolant system it is basically stagnant i e reactor coolant does not flow through the pressurizer continuously as it does in the other parts of the

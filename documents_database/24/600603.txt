these compounds have a net positive charge that is electrostatically attracted to the negative charged cell membranes of certain viruses fungi and bacteria csas have a high binding affinity for such membranes including lipid a and are able to rapidly disrupt the target membranes leading to rapid cell death while csas have a mechanism of action that is also seen in antimicrobial peptides which form part of the body s innate immune system they avoid many of the difficulties associated with their use as medicines ceragenins were invented by dr paul b savage of brigham young university s department of chemistry and biochemistry in data previously presented by dr savage and other researchers csas have been shown to have broad spectrum antibacterial activity dr derya unutmaz associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the vanderbilt university school of medicine tested several csas in his laboratory for their ability to kill hiv directly according to unutmaz we have some preliminary but very exciting results but we would like to formally show this before making any claims that would cause unwanted hype on february 6 2006 researchers including dr paul b savage announced that a ceragenin compound csa 54 appears to inactivate

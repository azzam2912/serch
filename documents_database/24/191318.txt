the heteroatom may vary but it usually is oxygen nitrogen or sulfur a related reaction is hydrogenation where hydrogen is added to the molecule without cleaving bonds usually hydrogenolysis is conducted catalytically using hydrogen gas the term hydrogenolysis was coined by carleton ellis in reference to hydrogenolysis of carbon carbon bonds earlier sabatier had already observed the hydrogenolysis of benzyl alcohol to toluene and as early as 1906 padoa and ponti had observed the hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol homer burton adkins and ralph connor were the first to call the carbon oxygen bond cleavage hydrogenolysis in petroleum refineries catalytic hydrogenolysis of feedstocks is conducted on a large scale to remove sulfur from feedstocks releasing gaseous hydrogen sulfide hs the hydrogen sulfide is subsequently recovered in an amine treater and finally converted to elemental sulfur in a claus process unit in those industries desulfurization process units are often referred to as hydrodesulfurizers hds or hydrotreaters hdt catalysts are based on molybdenum sulfide containing smaller amounts of cobalt or nickel hydrogenolysis is accompanied by hydrogenation another hydrogenolysis reaction of commercial importance is the hydrogenolysis of esters into alcohols by catalysts such as copper chromite in the laboratory hydrogenolysis is used in organic

acantharian skeletons are composed of strontium sulfate crystals secreted by vacuoles surrounding each spicule or spine acantharians are the only marine organisms known to biomineralize strontium sulfate as the main component of their skeletons making them quite unique unlike other radiolarians whose skeletons are made of silica acantharian skeletons do not fossilize primarily because strontium sulfate is very scarce in seawater and the crystals dissolve after the acantharians die the skeletons are made up of either ten diametric or twenty radial spicules diametric spicules cross the center of the cell whereas radial spicules terminate at the center of the cell where they either form a tight or flexible junction depending on species the cell is divided into two regions the endoplasm and the ectoplasm the endoplasm at the core of the cell contains the main organelles including many nuclei and is delineated from the ectoplasm by a capsular wall made of a microfibril mesh in symbiotic species the algal symbionts are maintained in the endoplasm the ectoplasm consists of cytoplasmic extensions used for prey capture and also contains food vacuoles for prey digestion the ectoplasm is surrounded by a periplasmic cortex also made up of microfibrils but arranged into twenty

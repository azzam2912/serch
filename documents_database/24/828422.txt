pseudotachylyte is typically dark in color and is glassy in appearance it was named after its appearance resembling the basaltic glass tachylyte typically the glass is completely devitrified into very fine grained material with radial and concentric clusters of crystals the glass may also contain crystals with quench textures that formed via crystallization from the melt chemical composition of pseudotachylyte generally reflects the local bulk chemistry pseudotachylyte may form via frictional melting of faults in large scale landslides and by impact processes many researchers often define the rock as one formed via the melting however the original description definition by shand did not include interpretation about its generation and it is suggested that there are pseudotachylytes formed via comminution without melting quartz in pseudotachylyte from the vredefort impact site displays high residual stress as documented by synchrotron x ray laue microdiffraction it is found either along fault surfaces fault vein type as the matrix to a fault breccia pseudotachylyte breccia or as veins injected into the walls of the fault injection vein type in most cases researchers search for and describe good evidence that the pseudotachylyte formed by frictional melting of the wall rocks during rapid fault movement associated with

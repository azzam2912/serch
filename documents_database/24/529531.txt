the start codon always codes for methionine in eukaryotes and archaea and a modified met fmet in bacteria mitochondria and plastids the most common start codon is aug the start codon is often preceded by a 5 untranslated region 5 utr in prokaryotes this includes the ribosome binding site alternative start codons are different from the standard aug codon and are found in both prokaryotes bacteria and archaea and eukaryotes alternate start codons are still translated as met when they are at the start of a protein even if the codon encodes a different amino acid otherwise this is because a separate transfer rna trna is used for initiation bioinformatics programs usually allow for alternative start codons when searching for protein coding genes alternate start codons non aug are very rare in eukaryotic genomes however naturally occurring non aug start codons have been reported for some cellular mrnas seven out of the nine possible single nucleotide substitutions at the aug start codon of dihydrofolate reductase were functional as translation start sites in mammalian cells in addition to the canonical met trna met and aug codon pathway mammalian cells can initiate translation with leucine using a specific leucyl trna that decodes

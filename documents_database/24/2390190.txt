the oldest rocks in argentina date to the precambrian strontium oxygen and carbon isotope data from carbonate rocks in the sierra de pie de palo are part of an ophiolite unit related to the grenville orogeny formed as cover rock in the appalachian margin of the continent laurentia around 720 million years ago these neoproterozoic age rocks are believed to have formed above much older archean craton rock throughout the late proterozoic sections of argentina were part of a metamorphic mobile belt adjacent to the brazilian shield regional metamorphism produced scheelite belts and wolframite in parts of san luis and cordoba provinces to the north along the bolivian border in the altiplano drilling has revealed precambrian horblende granoblastite and biotite granoblastite formed from magma during the grenville orogeny 1 05 billion years ago metamorphosed around 530 million years ago granitoid and metamorphic rocks elsewhere in the el cristo area in the southern tandilia range experienced intense folding more than two billion years ago and then metamorphosed to almandine grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies 1 8 billion years ago brittle deformation granite emplacement and chloritization occurred in the formation 900 million years ago extremely ancient trace fossils have been

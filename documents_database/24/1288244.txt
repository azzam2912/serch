the printing in 1506 was the first illustrated printing in poland aski s statutes were drawn up by chancellor and primate jan aski hence they are named for him and consolidated nearly all the legislation that had earlier appeared in poland aski had been asked to codify existing polish law by the sejm parliament meeting in 1505 at radom the statutes in 720 folio pages comprised two parts the first confirmed by king aleksander jagiellon and thus carrying the force of law collected all manner of legislation privileges statutes and edicts promulgated by the king or adopted by the sejm as well as treaties such as peace treaties that had been entered into with the teutonic order the second part discussed the legal system primarily magdeburg law and included text from the sachsenspiegel weichbild and l beck law the statutes showed a certain bias in promoting aski s political views they supported the execution movement which sought to strengthen the power of the lesser nobility szlachta and the king while weakening the aristocratic magnates and so omitted some documents that favored the magnates notably aski s statutes omitted the 1501 privilege of mielnik and union of mielnik the mielnik laws

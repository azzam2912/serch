a goal of pom is to make ecological modeling more rigorous and comprehensive a traditional ecosystem model attempts to approximate the real system as closely as possible pom proponents posit that an ecosystem is so information rich that an ecosystem model will inevitably either leave out relevant information or become over parameterized and lose predictive power through a focus on only the relevant patterns in the real system pom offers a meaningful alternative to the traditional approach an attempt to mimic the scientific method pom requires the researcher to begin with a pattern found in the real system posit hypotheses to explain the pattern and then develop predictions that can be tested a model used to determine the original pattern may not be used to test the researcher s predictions through this focus on the pattern the model can be constructed to include only information relevant to the question at hand pom is also characterized by an effort to identify the appropriate temporal and spatial scale at which to study a pattern and to avoid the assumption that a single process might explain a pattern at multiple temporal or spatial scales it does however offer the opportunity to look explicitly

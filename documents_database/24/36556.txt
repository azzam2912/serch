in the food chain heterotrophs are primary secondary and tertiary consumers but not producers living organisms that are heterotrophic include all animals and fungi some bacteria and protists and parasitic plants the term heterotroph arose in microbiology in 1946 as part of a classification of microorganisms based on their type of nutrition the term is now used in many fields such as ecology in describing the food chain heterotrophs may be subdivided according to their energy source if the heterotroph uses chemical energy it is a chemoheterotroph e g humans and mushrooms if it uses light for energy then it is a photoheterotroph e g green non sulfur bacteria heterotrophs represent one of the two mechanisms of nutrition trophic levels the other being autotrophs auto self troph nutrition autotrophs use energy from sunlight photoautotrophs or inorganic compounds lithoautotrophs to convert inorganic carbon dioxide to organic carbon compounds and energy to sustain their life comparing the two in basic terms heterotrophs such as animals eat either autotrophs such as plants or other heterotrophs or both detritivores are heterotrophs which obtain nutrients by consuming detritus decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces saprotrophs also called lysotrophs are chemoheterotrophs that use

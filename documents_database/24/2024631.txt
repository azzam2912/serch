in particular if such an algorithm does not find any root one does not know whether it is because there is no real root some algorithms compute all complex roots but as there are generally much fewer real roots than complex roots most of their computation time is generally spent for computing non real roots in the average a polynomial of degree has complex roots and only real roots moreover it may be difficult to distinguish the real roots from the non real roots with small imaginary part see the example of wilkinson s polynomial in next section the first complete real root isolation algorithm results from sturm s theorem 1829 however when real root isolation algorithms began to be implemented on computers it appeared that algorithms derived from sturm s theorem are less efficient than those derived from descartes rule of signs 1637 since the beginning of 20th century there is an active research activity for improving the algorithms derived from descartes rule of signs getting very efficient implementations and computing their computational complexity the best implementations can routinely isolate real roots of polynomials of degree more than 1 000 for finding real roots of a polynomial the common

the result can be viewed as a structure in which two adjacent atoms are connected by both a covalent and an ionic bond normally written x y ylides are thus 1 2 dipolar compounds and a subclass of zwitterions they appear in organic chemistry as reagents or reactive intermediates the class name ylide for the compound should not be confused with the suffix ylide many ylides may be depicted by a multiple bond form in a resonance structure known as the ylene form however this is incorrect the actual bonding picture is strictly zwitterionic the structure on the right with the strong coulombic attraction between the onium atom and the adjacent carbon accounting fo the reduced bond length consequently the carbon anion is trigonal pyramidal phosphonium ylides are used in the wittig reaction a method used to convert ketones and especially aldehydes to alkenes the positive charge in these wittig reagents is carried by a phosphorus atom with three phenyl substituents and a bond to a carbanion ylides can be stabilised or non stabilised a phosphonium ylide can be prepared rather straightforwardly typically triphenylphosphine is allowed to react with an alkyl halide in a mechanism analogous to that of an

this foul smelling colorless liquid is the simplest aromatic thiol the chemical structures of thiophenol and its derivatives are analogous to phenols except the oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group oh bonded to the aromatic ring is replaced by a sulfur atom the prefix thio implies a sulfur containing compound and when used before a root word name for a compound which would normally contain an oxygen atom in the case of thiol that the alcohol oxygen atom is replaced by a sulfur atom thiophenols also describes a class of compounds formally derived from thiophenol itself all have a sulfhydryl group sh covalently bonded to an aromatic ring the organosulfur ligand in the medicine thiomersal is a thiophenol there are several methods of synthesis for thiophenol and related compounds although thiophenol itself is usually purchased for laboratory operations methods are the reduction of benzenesulfonyl chloride with zinc and the action of elemental sulfur on phenyl magnesium halide or phenyllithium followed by acidification via the newman kwart rearrangement phenols 1 can be converted to the thiophenols 5 by conversion to the o aryl dialkylthiocarbamates 3 followed by heating to give the isomeric s aryl derivative 4 in the leuckart thiophenol reaction

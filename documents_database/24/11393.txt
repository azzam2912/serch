any material exhibiting these properties is a superconductor unlike an ordinary metallic conductor whose resistance decreases gradually as its temperature is lowered even down to near absolute zero a superconductor has a characteristic critical temperature below which the resistance drops abruptly to zero an electric current through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source this phenomenon was discovered by dutch physicist heike kamerlingh onnes on april 8 1911 in leiden like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines superconductivity is a quantum mechanical mystery it is characterized by the meissner effect the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state the occurrence of the meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics in 1986 it was discovered that some cuprate perovskite ceramic materials have a critical temperature above such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a conventional superconductor leading the materials to be termed high temperature superconductors the cheaply available coolant liquid nitrogen boils at 77 k and thus the existence of superconductivity at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that

with the chemical formula ch coch it is a colorless oil although commercial samples are often yellow because of its low toxicity and wide liquid range it is used as a plasticizer dbp is produced by the reaction of n butanol with phthalic anhydride these precursor compounds are produced cleanly and cheaply dbp is an important plasticizer that allows major engineering plastics such as pvc to be used such modified pvc is widely used in plumbing for carrying sewerage and other corrosive materials monobutyl phthalate mbp is its major metabolite double saponification of dbp leads to phthalic acid and 1 butanol dbp has a low vapor pressure of 2 67 x 10 pa thus dbp does not evaporate readily hence its utility as a plasticizer i henry s law constant is 8 83 x 10 atm m mol as reflected by its octanol water partition coefficient of around 4 it is lipophilic which means that it is not readily mobilized dissolved by water nonetheless dissolved organic compounds doc increase its mobility in landfills biodegradation by microorganisms represents one route for remediation of pollution by dbp for example enterobacter species can biodegrade municipal solid waste where the dbp concentration can be

it is constructed from several separate layers of andesite and dacite on top of tertiary and precambrian layers the volcano was active over six million years ago with the neighbouring volcano ajoya active over seven million years ago since then erosion and glacial activity have dramatically reduced the height of the volcano and excavated a central depression choquelimpie is part of one of two belts of volcanically generated ore deposits it is mined for silver and gold since spanish times and a prospect in the 1980s indicated the presence of over eleven tons of ore choquelimpie is located in parinacota province arica y parinacota region chile the border with bolivia is east the basement rock surrounding choquelimpie is mostly of tertiary age or younger with the exception of a narrow segment of precambrian schists some of the tertiary rocks are sediments which accumulated in basins and are of volcanic or biogenic origin volcanism in the area started with ignimbrites and now eroded stratovolcanoes which have been dated at 10 0 6 mya and the 19 mya condoriri ignimbrite local fault zones and lineaments also contribute to the geomorphology the former choquelimpie volcano which partially overlaps with the ajoya volcano to

it is one of the most notable works by the indian poet the poet was very pained at the fact that india was under british rule and laments that fact in this poem the poet expresses a sense of personal loss in the downfall of his country india addressing india the poet says that in the old days india was worshipped like a deity poet wonders where that glory and splendour has disappeared and regrets the fact that his motherland has now been reduced to the position of a slave of the british empire the author also mentions that the country has been humiliated and ashamed of herself grovelling in the dust there was time when the country soared like an eagle in the skies but now the wings of that great bird have been clipped and it is chained the poet has no wreath of flowers to offer the country but instead he will dig into the past and will try to sing of some parts of that great history which is no longer available to the younger generation the only reward author wants for his effort is that the country should have a kind wish for the author

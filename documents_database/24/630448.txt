the measure is useful in determining which end of the distribution contributed most to the observed inequality the index can be turned into a normative measure by imposing a coefficient formula 1 to weight incomes greater weight can be placed on changes in a given portion of the income distribution by choosing formula 1 the level of inequality aversion appropriately the atkinson index becomes more sensitive to changes at the lower end of the income distribution as formula 1 approaches 1 conversely as the level of inequality aversion falls that is as formula 1 approaches 0 the atkinson becomes more sensitive to changes in the upper end of the income distribution the atkinson formula 1 parameter is often called the inequality aversion parameter since it quantifies the amount of social utility that is assumed to be gained from complete redistribution of resources for formula 6 no aversion to inequality it is assumed that no social utility is gained by complete redistribution and the atkinson index formula 7 is zero for formula 8 infinite aversion to inequality it is assumed that infinite social utility is gained by complete redistribution in which case formula 9 the atkinson index formula 7 then varies

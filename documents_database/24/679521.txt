the bar mine s principal advantage is its long length and therefore its trigger length a typical anti tank landmine is circular and a vehicle s wheels or tracks which make up only a small proportion of its total width must actually press on the mine to activate it to increase the probability of a vehicle striking the mine the mine s effective trigger width must be increased the bar mine s shape allows a 50 reduction in the number of mines in a minefield without reducing its effectiveness it was reported that it would take 90 sappers 150 minutes to lay a 1 000 yard mine field consisting of 1 250 mk 7 british anti tank mines weighing a total of 17 tonnes by comparison it would take 30 sappers 60 minutes to lay a 1 000 yard minefield consisting of 655 bar mines weighing a total of 7 2 tonnes the long mines can also be laid through a simple plough attached to the rear of a fv432 armoured personnel carrier laying circular mines in similar fashion requires a far larger plough and more powerful towing vehicle the bar mine laying fv432s were also usually fitted with launchers

in dog breeding a male dog that wins respected competitions becomes highly sought after as breeders believe the sire possesses the genes necessary to produce champions the popular sire is often bred extensively with many females this can cause undetected undesirable genetic traits in the stud to spread rapidly within the gene pool it can also reduce genetic diversity by the exclusion of other males while a popular stud can sire a large number of litters the effect of a popular dam is more limited the constraints of the female reproductive cycle requires dams to have several months in between each litter so even at capacity a dam would not be able to parent as many offspring as a sire furthermore a dam bred repeatedly may experience a sharp decline in her litter count due to a weaker body caused by too many consecutive pregnancies genetic diversity in a population is dependent on the cumulative effects of mutation natural selection and population size over many generations the effective population size n is the number of individuals in a given population that are able to reproduce and contribute offspring to the next generation genetic diversity decays over generations at a rate

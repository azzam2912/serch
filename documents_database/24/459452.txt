it is usually supplied as the hydrated solid or as an aqueous solution together with other thiophosphates such as sodium monothiophosphate and sodium trithiophosphate it is a colorless compound but commercial samples can appear dark owing to the presence of impurities it is used to facilitate the isolation of molybdenum from its ores the compound has been prepared in a multistep process starting with the base hydrolysis of phosphorus pentasulfide the salt is isolated as the hydrate napos ho it is prone to hydrolysis especially when it is heated as an aqueous solutions its structure has been examined by x ray crystallography this salt is used as a flotation agent in molybdenite mineral concentration from ores where it is usually known as nokes reagent the salt is generated by the reaction of phosphorus pentasulfide with sodium hydroxide often using impure reagents to obtain a mixture of the desired salt and related thiophosphates and oxidized species molybdenite particles which are normally hydrophobic become hydrophilic in the presence of this salt in this context the nokes reagent is called a depressant since it suppresses the flotation tendency of the solids

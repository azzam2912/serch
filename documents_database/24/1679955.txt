a second peg below it can be moved back and forth until it is just detectably nearer than the fixed one stereoacuity is this difference in the two positions converted into an angle of binocular disparity i e the difference in their binocular parallax conversion to the angle of disparity d is performed by inserting the position difference dz in the formula where a is the interocular separation of the observer and z the distance of the fixed peg from the eye to transfer d into the usual unit of minutes of arc a multiplicative constant c is inserted whose value is 3437 75 1 radian in arcminutes in the calculation a dz and z must be in the same units say feet inches cm or meters for the average interocular distance of 6 5 cm a target distance of 6m and a typical stereoacuity of 0 5 minute of arc the just detectable depth interval is 8 cm as targets come closer this interval gets smaller by the inverse square of the distance so that an equivalent detectable depth interval at meter is 0 01 cm or the depth of impression of the head on a coin these very

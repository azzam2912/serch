precisely this formula express the value of the partial derivative of any multiindex order of a holomorphic function of several variables in any interior point of a given bounded domain as a hypersurface integral of the values of the function on the boundary of the domain itself in this respect it is analogous and generalizes the bochner martinelli formula reducing to it when the absolute value of the multiindex order of differentiation is when considered for functions of complex variables it reduces to the ordinary cauchy formula for the derivative of a holomorphic function however when its integral kernel is not obtainable by simple differentiation of the bochner martinelli kernel the andreotti norguet formula was first published in the research announcement however its full proof was only published later in the paper another different proof of the formula was given by in 1977 and 1978 lev aizenberg gave still another proof and a generalization of the formula based on the cauchy fantappi leray kernel instead on the bochner martinelli kernel the notation adopted in the following description of the integral representation formula is the one used by and by the notations used in the original works and in other references

it is a type of sieve where up to half of all residue classes of numbers are removed as opposed to small sieves such as the selberg sieve wherein only a few residue classes are removed the method has been further heightened by the larger sieve which removes arbitrarily many residue classes its name comes from its original application given a set formula 1 such that the elements of s are forbidden to lie in a set a z p z modulo every prime p how large can s be here a is thought of as being large i e at least as large as a constant times p if this is not the case we speak of a small sieve the early history of the large sieve traces back to work of yu b linnik in 1941 working on the problem of the least quadratic non residue subsequently alfr d r nyi worked on it using probability methods it was only two decades later after quite a number of contributions by others that the large sieve was formulated in a way that was more definitive this happened in the early 1960s in independent work of klaus roth and enrico

the nd3 protein is a subunit of nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain variants of mt nd3 are associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes melas leigh s syndrome ls and leber s hereditary optic neuropathy lhon mt nd3 is located in human mitochondrial dna from base pair 10 059 to 10 404 the mt nd3 gene produces a 13 kda protein composed of 115 amino acids mt nd3 is one of seven mitochondrially encoded subunits of the enzyme nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone also known as complex i it is the largest of the respiratory complexes the structure is l shaped with a long hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centres and the nadh binding site mt nd3 and the rest of the mitochondrially encoded subunits are the most hydrophobic of the subunits of complex i and form the core of the transmembrane region mt nd3 is a subunit of the respiratory chain complex i that is believed to belong to the minimal assembly of core proteins required to

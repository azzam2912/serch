the industries which most often manufactures free form surfaces are basically aerospace automotive die mold industries bio medical and power sector for turbine blades manufacturing generally 3 or 5 axis cnc milling machine is used for this purpose the manufacturing process of free form surface is not an easy job as the tool path generation in present cam technology is generally based on geometric computation so tool path are not optimum the geometry can also be not described explicitly so errors and discontinuities occurrence in the solid structure cannot be avoided free form surfaces are machined with the help of different tool path generation method like adaptive iso planar tool path generation constant scallop tool path generation adaptive iso parametric method iso curvature isophote and by other methods the different methods are chosen based on the parameters which is needed to be optimized cam software generally creates a tool path without considering any mechanics process these causes risk of tool damage tool deflection and errors on surface finish by minimizing the forces we can increase tool life different optimization method can be used considering process parameters like feed rate spindle speed steps tool diameter magnitude and preset maximum force the

the name comes from the concept of indicating to the user that which their naked eye cannot discern such as the presence or exact quantity of some small distance for example a small height difference between two flat surfaces a slight lack of concentricity between two cylinders or other small physical deviations the classic mechanical version called a dial indicator provides a dial display similar to a clock face with clock hands the hands point to graduations in a circular scales on the dial which represent the distance of the probe tip from a zero setting the internal works of a mechanical dial indicator are similar to the precision clockworks of a mechanical wristwatch employing a rack and pinion gear to read the probe position instead of a pendulum escapement to read time the side of the indicator probe shaft is cut with teeth to provide the rack gear when the probe moves the rack gear drives a pinion gear to rotate spinning the indicator clock hand springs preload the gear mechanism to minimize the backlash error in the reading precise quality of the gear forms and bearing freedom determines the repeatable precision of measurement achieved since the mechanisms are

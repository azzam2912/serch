the protocol for immunosurgery includes preincubation with an antiserum rinsing it with hes derivation media to remove the antibodies exposing it to complement and then removing the lysed trophoectoderm through a pipette this technique is used to isolate the inner cell mass of the blastocyst the trophoectoderm s cell junctions and tight epithelium shield the icm from antibody binding by effectively making the cell impermeable to macromolecules immunosurgery can be used to obtain large quantities of pure inner cell masses in a relatively short period of time the icm obtained can then be used for stem cell research and is better to use than adult or fetal stem cells because the icm has not been affected by external factors such as manually bisecting the cell however if the structural integrity of the blastocyst is compromised prior to the experiment the icm is susceptible to the immunological reaction thus the quality of the embryo used is imperative to the experiment s success in addition when using complement derived from animals the source of the animals matters they should be kept in a specific pathogen free environment to increase the likelihood that the animal has not developed natural antibodies against the bacterial

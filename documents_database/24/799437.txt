it was first identified by m eiken in 1958 who called it bacteroides corrodens eikenella corrodens is a pleomorphic bacillus that sometimes appears coccobacillary and typically creates a depression or pit in the agar on which it is growing only half produce the pitting of the agar considered characteristic it grows in aerobic and anaerobic conditions but requires an atmosphere enhanced by 3 10 carbon dioxide the colonies are small and greyish they produce a greenish discoloration of the underlying agar and smell faintly of bleach hypochlorite they are oxidase positive catalase negative urease negative and indole negative and reduce nitrate to nitrite in 2006 azakami et al reported that the periodontal pathogen e corrodens have ortholog of luxs the gene required for quorum sensing qs signal molecule ai 2 synthesis and e corrodens can produce ai 2 signal for cell to cell communication and ai 2 has a role on biofilm formation by e corrodens karim et al reported that this bacteria can produce ai 2 inactivation enzyme during its stationary phase karim et al also reported that luxs mediated qs may facilitate the maturation and detachment of biofilm formation in e corrodens which can leads to progression of

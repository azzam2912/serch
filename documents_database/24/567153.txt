the word picoides combined the latin picus for a woodpecker and the greek oid s meaning resembling the genus picoides formerly contained around 12 species in 2015 a molecular phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial dna sequences from pied woodpeckers the tribe dendropicini found that three existing genera picoides veniliornis and dendropicos were polyphyletic after the creation of six new monophyletic genera and the subsequent rearrangement in which most of the former members of picoides were moved to leuconotopicus and dryobates only three of the original species remained some taxonomic authorities including the american ornithological society continue to place some of the species now found in dryobates and leuconotopicus here the males of all three species have yellow on the crown though this feature is also present in some other pied woodpeckers namely brown fronted and yellow crowned the remaining color pattern of the plumage structural features and life habits are very similar to related woodpeckers of the dryobates and leuconotopicus genera the foot of all three species show an extreme adaptation to arboreal living by lacking the first digit or hallux it has been pointed out however that various species of pied woodpecker are similar in having a short

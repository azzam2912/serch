intuitively unrestricted domain is a common requirement for social choice functions and is a condition for arrow s impossibility theorem with unrestricted domain the social welfare function accounts for all preferences among all voters to yield a unique and complete ranking of societal choices thus the voting mechanism must account for all individual preferences it must do so in a manner that results in a complete ranking of preferences for society and it must deterministically provide the same ranking each time voters preferences are presented the same way unrestricted domain is one of the conditions for arrow s impossibility theorem under that theorem it is impossible to have a social choice function that satisfies unrestricted domain pareto efficiency independence of irrelevant alternatives and non dictatorship however the conditions of the theorem can be satisfied if unrestricted domain is removed duncan black defined a restriction to domains of social choice functions called single peaked preferences under this principle all of the choices have a predetermined position along a line giving them a linear ordering every voter has some special place he likes best along that line his ordering of the choices is determined by their distances from that spot for example

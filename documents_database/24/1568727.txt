the technique was invented by professor elsayed elsayed wagih in collaboration with professor jacqueline fletcher of the department of plant pathology noble research centre oklahoma state university usa in 1993 physiological phenomena whether at the cellular or molecular level in living organisms are driven either directly or indirectly by enzyme reactions the assay of enzyme activities in living organisms is therefore one of the most commonly performed activities in modern physiology laboratories numerous methods of enzyme assays are available to quantitatively follow enzyme reactions these methods which have been grouped in six categories namely spectrophotometric fluorescence nanometric electrode polarimetric radiobiochemical are with no drawbacks recently a new qualitative or rather semi quantitative micro technique first described by wagih and fletcher 1993 and termed zymoblot has been introduced to detect enzyme activities in spiroplasmas and bacteria and many other biological systems later the technique was made quantitative by densitometry and successfully used to monitor peroxidase activity in virus infected plants as little as 1 l or less of a sample is enough to detect enzyme activity by the zymoblot technique as the coloured product being insoluble accumulates at a confined area over the spotting site the other techniques based on colorimetry

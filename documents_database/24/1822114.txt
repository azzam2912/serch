physically ricci np scalars are related with the energy momentum distribution of the spacetime due to einstein s field equation given a complex null tetrad formula 4 and with the convention formula 5 the ricci np scalars are defined by where overline means complex conjugate formula 6 formula 7 formula 8 formula 9 remark i in these definitions formula 10 could be replaced by its trace free part formula 11 or by the einstein tensor formula 12 because of the normalization i e inner product relations that remark ii specifically for electrovacuum we have formula 15 thus formula 16 and therefore formula 17 is reduced to formula 18 remark iii if one adopts the convention formula 19 the definitions of formula 20 should take the opposite values that is to say formula 21 after the signature transition according to the definitions above one should find out the ricci tensors before calculating the ricci np scalars via contractions with the corresponding tetrad vectors however this method fails to fully reflect the spirit of newman penrose formalism and alternatively one could compute the spin coefficients and then derive the ricci np scalars formula 20 via relevant np field equations that while the

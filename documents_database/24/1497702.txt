chinese records about the motions of mars appeared before the founding of the zhou dynasty 1045 bce detailed observations of the position of mars were made by babylonian astronomers who developed arithmetic techniques to predict the future position of the planet the ancient greek philosophers and hellenistic astronomers developed a geocentric model to explain the planet s motions measurements of mars angular diameter can be found in ancient greek and indian texts in the 16th century nicolaus copernicus proposed a heliocentric model for the solar system in which the planets follow circular orbits about the sun this was revised by johannes kepler yielding an elliptic orbit for mars that more accurately fitted the observational data the first telescopic observation of mars was by galileo galilei in 1610 within a century astronomers discovered distinct albedo features on the planet including the dark patch syrtis major planum and polar ice caps they were able to determine the planet s rotation period and axial tilt these observations were primarily made during the time intervals when the planet was located in opposition to the sun at which points mars made its closest approaches to the earth better telescopes developed early in the 19th century

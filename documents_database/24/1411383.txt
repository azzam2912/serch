this facilitates data encryption by simplifying encryption key management keys may be created on a server and then retrieved possibly wrapped by other keys both symmetric and asymmetric keys are supported including the ability to sign certificates kmip also allows for clients to ask a server to encrypt or decrypt data without needing direct access to the key the kmip standard was first released in 2010 clients and servers are commercially available from multiple vendors the kmip standard effort is governed by the oasis standards body technical details can also be found on the official kmip page and wiki a kmip server stores and controls managed objects such as symmetric and asymmetric keys certificates and user defined objects clients then use the protocol to access these objects subject to a security model that is implemented by the servers operations are provided to create locate retrieve and update managed objects each managed object has an immutable value such as a key block that contains a cryptographic key they also contain mutable attributes which can be used to store meta data about the keys some attributes are derived directly from the value such as the cryptographic algorithm and length of a key

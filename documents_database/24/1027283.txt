it occurs in many languages at a phonetic or allophonic level and no meaningful distinction in length is made however as it became phonemic in many germanic languages it is especially significant in them both historically and in the modern languages open syllable lengthening affected the stressed syllables of all germanic languages in their history to some degree curiously it seems to have affected the languages around a similar time between the 12th and the 16th centuries during the late middle ages the languages differ mainly as to the specific vowels that were lengthened the specific environment but also in the result of the lengthening there is substantial variation and in many languages the process has been largely undone by paradigmatic levelling sometimes the newly lengthened vowels merged with existing long vowels but in other languages they remained distinct because the older long vowels underwent changes of their own such as in icelandic and to a lesser degree the scandinavian languages the lengthening often also applied in reverse at some point by shortening long vowels in closed syllables as a consequence of the combination of the two changes vowel length and consonant length came to be in complementary distribution one

one of these proofs more recently developed but requiring only elementary techniques from calculus has attracted attention in modern mathematics due to its mathematical elegance and its connections to the theory of diophantine approximations stephen lucas calls this proof one of the more beautiful results related to approximating julian havil ends a discussion of continued fraction approximations of with the result describing it as impossible to resist mentioning in that context the purpose of the proof is not primarily to convince its readers that is indeed bigger than systematic methods of computing the value of exist if one knows that is approximately 3 14159 then it trivially follows that diophantine approximation of it is a convergent in the simple continued fraction expansion of it is greater than as can be readily seen in the decimal expansions of these values the approximation has been known since antiquity archimedes wrote the first known proof that is an overestimate in the 3rd century bce although he may not have been the first to use that approximation his proof proceeds by showing that is greater than the ratio of the perimeter of a circumscribed regular polygon with 96 sides to the diameter of the

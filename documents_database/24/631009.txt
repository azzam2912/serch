such elements use small numerical aperture usually atomic mirrors use grazing incidence and the reflectivity drops drastically with increase of the grazing angle for efficient normal reflection atoms should be ultracold and dealing with such atoms usually involves magnetic magneto optical or optical traps rather than an optics recent scientific publications about atom nano optics evanescent field lenses and ridged mirrors show significant improvement since the beginning of the 21st century in particular an atomic hologram can be realized an extensive review article optics and interferometry with atoms and molecules appeared in july 2009 more bibliography about atom optics can be found at the resource letter

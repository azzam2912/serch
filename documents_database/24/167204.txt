when certain organic materials are heated they undergo thermal decomposition and release flammable gases flashover occurs when the majority of the exposed surfaces in a space are heated to their autoignition temperature and emit flammable gases see also flash point flashover normally occurs at or for ordinary combustibles and an incident heat flux at floor level of an example of flashover is ignition of a piece of furniture in a domestic room the fire involving the initial piece of furniture can produce a layer of hot smoke which spreads across the ceiling in the room the hot buoyant smoke layer grows in depth as it is bounded by the walls of the room the radiated heat from this layer heats the surfaces of the directly exposed combustible materials in the room causing them to give off flammable gases via pyrolysis when the temperatures of the evolved gases become high enough these gases will ignite throughout their extent the original swedish terminology related to the term flashover has been altered in its translation to conform with current european and north american accepted scientific definitions as follows flashover is one of the most feared phenomena among firefighters firefighters are taught to recognize

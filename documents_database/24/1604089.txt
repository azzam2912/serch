art exploits the phenomenon of half wave resonance whereby a suitably excited resonant target such as a pipeline wall exhibits longitudinal resonances at certain frequencies characteristic of the target s thickness knowing the speed of sound in the target material the half wave resonant frequencies can be used to calculate the target s thickness art differs from traditional ultrasonic testing although both are forms of nondestructive testing based on acoustics art generally uses lower frequencies and has a wider bandwidth this has enabled its use in gaseous environments without a liquid couplant det norske veritas has licensed the technology for use in on shore water pipes worldwide to breivoll inspection technologies as breivoll has proven the efficiency of the technology in assessing the condition of metallic water pipes both with and without coating the company has since 2008 successfully developed a method to enter and inspect water mains and is a world leader in their market art has also been used in field tests at gassco s k rst facility in 2012 dnv s art activities were spun out into a subsidiary halfwave in a closely related technique the presence of cracks in a solid structure can be detected by

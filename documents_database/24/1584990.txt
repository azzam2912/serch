gec supplied the electrical equipment while ucw was responsible for the mechanical components and assembly ucw delivered fifty locomotives to spoornet between 1990 and 1992 numbered in the range from 10 126 to 10 175 contrary to prior ucw practice gec works numbers were allocated to the class 10e1 locomotives with the exception of the class 9e also a ucw built gec locomotive ucw did not allocate builder s numbers to previous locomotives it built for the sar or spoornet but used the sar or spoornet unit numbers for their record keeping the class 10e1 was introduced as a new standard 3 kv dc heavy goods locomotive with a continuous power rating of four class 10e1 units are capable of performing the same work as six class 6e1 units the entire class 10e1 fleet features electronic chopper control which is smoother in comparison to the rheostatic resistance control which was used in the classes 1e to 6e1 electric locomotives the locomotive makes use of either regenerative or rheostatic braking as the situation demands both traction and electric braking power are continuously variable with the electric braking optimised to such an extent that maximum use will be made of the regenerative

the difficulty or impossibility of solving certain geometric problems like trisection of an angle using ruler and compass only is the basis for the various protocols in geometric cryptography this field of study was suggested by mike burmester ronald l rivest and adi shamir in 1996 though the cryptographic methods based on geometry have practically no real life applications they are of use as pedagogic tools for the elucidation of other more complex cryptographic protocols some of the geometric cryptographic methods are based on the impossibility of trisecting an angle using ruler and compass given an arbitrary angle there is a straightforward ruler and compass construction for finding the triple of the given angle but there is no ruler and compass construction for finding the angle which is exact one third of a given angle hence the function which assigns the triple of an angle to a given angle can be thought of as a one way function the only constructions allowed being ruler and compass constructions a geometric identification protocol has been suggested based on the one way function indicated above assume that alice wishes to establish a means of proving her identity later to bob initialization alice publishes

the function is named in honour of franz mertens this definition can be extended to positive real numbers as follows less formally m x is the count of square free integers up to x that have an even number of prime factors minus the count of those that have an odd number the first 143 m n is the mertens function slowly grows in positive and negative directions both on average and in peak value oscillating in an apparently chaotic manner passing through zero when n has the values because the m bius function only takes the values 1 0 and 1 the mertens function moves slowly and there is no x such that m x x the mertens conjecture went further stating that there would be no x where the absolute value of the mertens function exceeds the square root of x the mertens conjecture was proven false in 1985 by andrew odlyzko and herman te riele however the riemann hypothesis is equivalent to a weaker conjecture on the growth of m x namely m x o x since high values for m x grow at least as fast as the square root of x this puts a rather

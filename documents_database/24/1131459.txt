the ccn acronym is derived from the first three members of the family identified namely cyr61 ccn1 ctgf connective tissue growth factor or ccn2 and nov these proteins together with wisp1 ccn4 wisp2 ccn5 this gene and wisp3 ccn6 comprise the six member ccn family in vertebrates ccn proteins characteristically contain an n terminal secretory signal peptide followed by four structurally distinct domains with homologies to insulin like growth factor binding protein igfbp von willebrand type c repeats vwc thrombospondin type 1 repeat tsr and a cysteine knot motif within the c terminal ct domain however wisp 2 is unique among this family of proteins by lacking precisely the ct domain wisp 2 ccn5 inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells human uterine myometrial cells and leiomyoma cells ectopic expression of wisp 2 also inhibits the motility and invasiveness of breast carcinoma cells wisp 2 also inhibits cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis an effect that appears linked to the absence of the ct domain

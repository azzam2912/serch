it lies deeper than the biceps brachii and makes up part of the floor of the region known as the cubital fossa the brachialis is the prime mover of elbow flexion while the biceps brachii appears as a large anterior bulge on the arm and commands considerable interest among body builders the brachialis underlying it actually generates about 50 more power and is thus the prime mover of elbow flexion the brachialis originates from the anterior surface of the distal half of the humerus near the insertion of the deltoid muscle which it embraces by two angular processes its origin extends below to within 2 5 cm of the margin of the articular surface of the humerus at the elbow joint its fibers converge to a thick tendon which is inserted into the tuberosity of the ulna the brachialis is supplied by the muscular branches of brachial artery and the recurrent radial artery the brachialis muscle is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve which runs on its superficial surface between it and the biceps brachii however in 70 80 of people the muscle has double innervation with the radial nerve c5 t1 the divide between the two innervations is at the

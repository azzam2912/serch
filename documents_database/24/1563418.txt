they are used to understand to develop and to communicate different mathematical features of the same object or operation as well as connections between different properties multiple representations include graphs and diagrams tables and grids formulas symbols words gestures software code videos concrete models physical and virtual manipulatives pictures and sounds representations are thinking tools for doing mathematics the use of multiple representations supports and requires tasks that involve decision making and other problem solving skills the choice of which representation to use the task of making representations given other representations and the understanding of how changes in one representation affect others are examples of such mathematically sophisticated activities estimation another complex task can strongly benefit from multiple representations curricula that support starting from conceptual understanding then developing procedural fluency for example aims foundation activities frequently use multiple representations supporting student use of multiple representations may lead to more open ended problems or at least accepting multiple methods of solutions and forms of answers project based learning units such as webquests typically call for several representations some representations such as pictures videos and manipulatives can motivate because of their richness possibilities of play technologies involved or connections with interesting areas

while the tangential components of the flow velocity are discontinuous across the vortex sheet the normal component of the flow velocity is continuous the discontinuity in the tangential velocity means the flow has infinite vorticity on a vortex sheet at high reynolds numbers vortex sheets tend to be unstable in particular they may exhibit kelvin helmholtz instability the formulation of the vortex sheet equation of motion is given in terms of a complex coordinate formula 1 the sheet is described parametrically by formula 2 where formula 3 is the arclength between coordinate formula 4 and a reference point and formula 5 is time let formula 6 denote the strength of the sheet that is the jump in the tangential discontinuity then the velocity field induced by the sheet is formula 7 the integral in the above equation is a cauchy principal value integral we now define formula 8 as the integrated sheet strength or circulation between a point with arc length formula 3 and the reference material point formula 10 in the sheet formula 11 as a consequence of kelvin s circulation theorem in the absence of external forces on the sheet the circulation between any two material points in

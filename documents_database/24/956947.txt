photodarkening limits the density of excitations in fiber lasers and amplifiers the experimental results suggest that operating at a saturated regime helps to reduce photodarkening one could expect the term photodarkening to refer to any process when any object becomes non transparent dark due to illumination with light formally the darkening of the photo emulsion also could be considered as photodarkening however recent papers use this term meaning reversible creation of absorbing color centers in optical fibers one may expect that the effect is not specific for fibers therefore the definition should cover wide class of phenomena excluding perhaps non reversible darkening of photographic emulsions according to the encyclopedia of laser physics and technology photodarkening is the effect that the optical losses in a medium can grow when the medium is irradiated with light at certain wavelengths we may also define photodarkening as reversible creation of absorption centers in optical media at the illumination with light the inverse of the timescale at which photodarkening occurs can be interpreted as photodarkening rate usually photodarkening is attributed to creation of color centers due to resonant interaction of electromagnetic field with an active medium the phenomenon similar to photodarkening in fibers was recently

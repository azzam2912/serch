the term formose is a portmanteau of formaldehyde and aldose the reaction is catalyzed by a base and a divalent metal such as calcium the intermediary steps taking place are aldol reactions reverse aldol reactions and aldose ketose isomerizations intermediates are glycolaldehyde glyceraldehyde dihydroxyacetone and tetrose sugars in 1959 breslow proposed a mechanism for the reaction consisting of the following steps the reaction exhibits an induction period during which only the nonproductive cannizzaro disproportionation of formaldehyde to methanol and formate occurs the initial dimerization of formaldehyde to give glycolaldehyde 1 occurs via an unknown mechanism possibly promoted by light or through a free radical process and is very slow however the reaction is autocatalytic 1 catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of formaldehyde to produce an additional molecule of 1 hence even a trace as low as 3 ppm of glycolaldehyde is enough to initiate the reaction the autocatalytic cycle begins with the aldol reaction of 1 with formaldehyde to make glyceraldehyde 2 an aldose ketose isomerization of 2 forms dihydroxyacetone 3 a further aldol reaction of 3 with formaldehyde produces tetrulose 6 which undergoes another ketose aldose isomerization to form aldotetrose 7 either threose or erythrose the retro aldol

it is a highly oxidized tetranortriterpenoid which boasts a plethora of oxygen bearing functional groups including an enol ether acetal hemiacetal tetra substituted epoxide and a variety of carboxylic esters azadirachtin has a complex molecular structure it presents both secondary and tertiary hydroxyl groups and a tetrahydrofuran ether in its molecular structure alongside 16 stereogenic centres 7 of which are tetrasubstituted these characteristics explain the great difficulty encountered when trying to prepare this compound from simple precursors using methods of synthetic organic chemistry hence the first total synthesis was published over 22 years after the compound s discovery this first synthesis was completed by the research group of steven ley at the university of cambridge in 2007 the described synthesis was a relay approach with the required heavily functionalized decalin intermediate being made by total synthesis on a small scale but being derived from the natural product itself for the gram scale operations required to complete the synthesis initially found to be active as a feeding inhibitor towards the desert locust schistocerca gregaria it is now known to affect over 200 species of insects by acting mainly as an antifeedant and growth disruptor it was recently found that azadirachitin possesses

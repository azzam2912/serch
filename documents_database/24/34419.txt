further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another alpha particle produce lithium 5 and beryllium 8 respectively both products are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei unless a third alpha particle fuses with a beryllium 8 nucleus before that time to produce a stable carbon 12 nucleus the half life of li is and that of be is when a star runs out of hydrogen to fuse in its core it begins to contract and heat up if the central temperature rises to 10 k six times hotter than the sun s core alpha particles can fuse fast enough to produce significant amounts of carbon the net energy release of the process is 7 275 mev as a side effect of the process some carbon nuclei fuse with additional helium to produce a stable isotope of oxygen and energy fusing with additional helium nuclei can create heavier elements in a chain of stellar nucleosynthesis known as the alpha process but these reactions are only significant at higher temperatures and pressures than in cores undergoing the triple alpha process this creates a situation in which stellar nucleosynthesis produces large amounts of carbon and oxygen but

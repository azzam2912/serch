bisection should be done in such a way that the bandwidth between two partitions is minimum bisection bandwidth gives the true bandwidth available in the entire system bisection bandwidth accounts for the bottleneck bandwidth of the entire network therefore bisection bandwidth represents bandwidth characteristics of the network better than any other metric for a linear array with n nodes bisection bandwidth is one link bandwidth for linear array only one link needs to be broken to bisect the network into two partitions for ring topology with n nodes two links should be broken to bisect the network so bisection bandwidth becomes bandwidth of two links for tree topology with n nodes can be bisected at the root by breaking one link so bisection bandwidth is one link bandwidth for mesh topology with n nodes formula 1 links should be broken to bisect the network so bisection bandwidth is bandwidth of formula 1 links for hyper cube topology with n nodes n 2 links should be broken to bisect the network so bisection bandwidth is bandwidth of n 2 links theoretical support for the importance of this measure of network performance was developed in the phd research of clark thomborson formerly

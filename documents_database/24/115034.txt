such implementations cannot encode times after 03 14 07 utc on 19 january 2038 just like the y2k problem the year 2038 problem is caused by insufficient capacity of the chosen storage unit the latest time that can be represented in unix s signed 32 bit integer time format is 2 1 2 147 483 647 seconds after 1 january 1970 times beyond that on most architectures will wrap around and be stored internally as a negative number which these systems will interpret as having occurred at rather than 19 january 2038 this is caused by integer overflow the counter runs out of usable digit bits flips the sign bit instead and reports a maximally negative number then continues to count up to zero and then up through the positive integers again resulting erroneous calculations on such systems are likely to cause problems for users and other reliant parties programs that work with future dates will begin to run into problems sooner for example a program that works with dates 20 years in the future should have been fixed no later than 19 january 2018 in may 2006 reports surfaced of an early manifestation of the y2038 problem in the

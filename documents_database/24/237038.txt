confield saw the experimental use of computer programs specifically max msp to form the basis of songs instead of stand alone synthesizers according to booth most of confield came out of experiments with max that weren t really applicable in a club environment like ep7 before it and their 2003 release draft 7 30 booth and brown make use of generative sequences on confield however in an interview following the release of draft 7 30 booth explained that although the beats they create using generative sequences may seem completely random to some he and brown exercised tight control over the limits and rules of what the beats could do on confield you have something that some people would call random but i would say is quantifiable booth said it seems that for a lot of people if they hear something that doesn t sound regular they assume it s random if live musicians were playing it they d probably call it jazz or something but the fact that it s coming out of a computer as they perceive it somehow seems to make it different for me it s just messing around with a lot of analogue sequencers and drum

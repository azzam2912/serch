this method of pollination is done by manually transferring pollen from the stamen of one plant to the pistil of another this is often done with a cotton swab or small brush but can also be done by removing the petals from a male flower and brushing it against the stigmas of female flowers or by simply shaking flowers in the case of bisexual flowers such as tomatoes common reasons for choosing this method include the lack of pollinators keeping control of cross pollination between varieties grown together and creating specific hybrids examples of this are vanilla plants which are transported to areas where its natural pollinator doesn t exist or plants grown in greenhouses urban areas or with a cover to control pests where natural pollinators cannot reach them pollinator decline and the concentrated pollination needs of monoculture can also be a factor however these are not the only reasons and variable techniques for hand pollination have arisen for many specialty crops for instance hand pollination is used with date palms to avoid wasting space and energy growing sufficient male plants for adequate natural pollination because of the level of labor involved hand pollination is only an option on

it was first obtained by werner heisenberg and hans heinrich euler in 1936 by treating the vacuum as a medium it predicts rates of quantum electrodynamics qed light interaction processes it takes into account vacuum polarization to one loop and is valid for electromagnetic fields that change slowly compared to the inverse electron mass here m is the electron mass e the electron charge formula 2 and formula 3 in the weak field limit this becomes formula 4 it describes photon photon scattering in qed robert karplus and maurice neuman calculated the full amplitude which is very small and has not been seen delbr ck scattering of gamma rays was observed in 1953 by robert wilson photon splitting in strong magnetic fields was measured in 2002 pvlas is searching for vacuum polarization of laser beams crossing magnetic fields to detect effects from axion dark matter no signal has been found and searches continue osqar at cern is also studying vacuum birefringence a team of astronomers from italy poland and the u k has reported in 2016 observations of the light emitted by a neutron star pulsar rx j1856 5 3754 the star is surrounded by a very strong magnetic field

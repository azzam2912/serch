thyratrons can handle much greater currents than similar hard vacuum tubes electron multiplication occurs when the gas becomes ionized producing a phenomenon known as townsend discharge gases used include mercury vapor xenon neon and in special high voltage applications or applications requiring very short switching times hydrogen unlike a vacuum tube valve a thyratron cannot be used to amplify signals linearly in the 1920s thyratrons were derived from early vacuum tubes such as the uv 200 which contained a small amount of argon gas to increase its sensitivity as a radio signal detector and the german lrs relay tube which also contained argon gas gas rectifiers which predated vacuum tubes such as the argon filled general electric tungar bulb and the cooper hewitt mercury pool rectifier also provided an influence irving langmuir and g s meikle of ge are usually cited as the first investigators to study controlled rectification in gas tubes about 1914 the first commercial thyratrons appeared circa 1928 the term thyristor was derived from a combination of thyratron and transistor since the 1960s thyristors have replaced thyratrons in most low and medium power applications thyratrons resemble vacuum tubes both in appearance and construction but differ in behavior

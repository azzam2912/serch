the replica exchange method was originally devised by swendsen and wang then extended by geyer and later developed among others by hukushima and nemoto giorgio parisi sugita and okamoto formulated a molecular dynamics version of parallel tempering this is usually known as replica exchange molecular dynamics or remd essentially one runs n copies of the system randomly initialized at different temperatures then based on the metropolis criterion one exchanges configurations at different temperatures the idea of this method is to make configurations at high temperatures available to the simulations at low temperatures and vice versa this results in a very robust ensemble which is able to sample both low and high energy configurations in this way thermodynamical properties such as the specific heat which is in general not well computed in the canonical ensemble can be computed with great precision typically a monte carlo simulation using a metropolis hastings update consists of a single stochastic process that evaluates the energy of the system and accepts rejects updates based on the temperature t at high temperatures updates that change the energy of the system are comparatively more probable when the system is highly correlated updates are rejected and the simulation is

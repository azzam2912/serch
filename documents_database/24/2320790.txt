the very high proportion of cyclohexyl fatty acids specifically c19 0 cyclo and c17 0 cyclo versus straight counterparts was a major distinguishing feature versus the betaproteobacteria and is probably involved in ensuring membrane stability at high growth temperatures members of the class can all use molecular oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor i e are aerobic as well as nitrate which can be used by some members during denitrification the autotrophic members of the class do not use carboxysomes to concentrate carbon dioxide or improve rubisco efficiency as a carboxylase versus an oxygenase the dominant respiratory quinone of the class is ubiquinone 8 and menaquinones or rhodoquinones are not observed though they are in the neighbouring betaproteobacteria

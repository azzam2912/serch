such pulses have a broadband optical spectrum and can be created by mode locked oscillators they are commonly referred to as ultrafast events amplification of ultrashort pulses almost always requires the technique of chirped pulse amplification in order to avoid damage to the gain medium of the amplifier they are characterized by a high peak intensity or more correctly irradiance that usually leads to nonlinear interactions in various materials including air these processes are studied in the field of nonlinear optics in the specialized literature ultrashort refers to the femtosecond fs and picosecond ps range although such pulses no longer hold the record for the shortest pulses artificially generated indeed x ray pulses with durations on the attosecond time scale have been reported the 1999 nobel prize in chemistry was awarded to ahmed h zewail for the use of ultrashort pulses to observe chemical reactions at the timescales on which they occur opening up the field of femtochemistry there is no standard definition of ultrashort pulse usually the attribute ultrashort applies to pulses with a temporal duration of a few tens of femtoseconds but in a larger sense any pulse which lasts less than a few picoseconds can be considered

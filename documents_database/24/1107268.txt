in particular there is a decrease in viscosity as the tube s diameter decreases although only with a tube diameter of between 10 and 300 micrometers this is because erythrocytes move over to the centre of the vessel leaving only plasma near the wall of the vessel the effect was first documented by a german group in 1930 shortly after in 1931 it was reported independently by the swedish scientists robin f hr us and torsten lindqvist after whom the effect is commonly named robert robin sanno f hr us was a swedish pathologist and hematologist born on october 15 1888 in stockholm he died on september 18 1968 in uppsala sweden johan torsten lindqvist was a swedish physician who was born in 1906 and died in 2007 f hr us and lindqvist published their article in the american journal of physiology in 1931 describing the effect their study represented an important advance in the understanding of hemodynamics which had widespread implications for the study of human physiology they forced blood through fine glass capillary tubes connecting two reservoirs capillary diameters were less than 250 m and experiments were conducted at sufficiently high shear rates 100 1 s so that

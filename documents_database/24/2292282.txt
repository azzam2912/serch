ndufaf4 is a mitochondrial assembly protein involved in the assembly of nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone also known as complex i which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain mutations in this gene have been associated with complex i deficiency and infantile mitochondrial encephalomyopathy elevations in hrpap20 have also been implicated in breast cancer ndufaf4 is located on the q arm of chromosome 6 in position 16 1 and has 3 exons the ndufaf4 gene produces a 23 7 kda protein composed of 203 amino acids hrpap20 is a phosphoprotein containing a phosphate group attachment and potentially multiple kinase recognition sequences additionally it has a cam binding sequence that allows it to interact with calmodulin cam which itself is involved in numerous cellular processes nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex i catalyzes the transfer of electrons from nadh to ubiquinone coenzyme q in the first step of the mitochondrial respiratory chain resulting in the translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane ndufaf4 encodes a complex i assembly factor that is important for the correct assembly and function of complex i ndufaf4 colocalizes comigrates to several assembly intermediates and is codependent

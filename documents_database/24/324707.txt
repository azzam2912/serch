this is a smaller scale in comparison with nanotechnology and picotechnology which refer to 10 m and 10 m respectively work in the femtometer range involves manipulation of excited energy states within atomic nuclei specifically nuclear isomers to produce metastable or otherwise stabilized states with unusual properties in the extreme case excited states of the individual nucleons that make up the atomic nucleus protons and neutrons are considered ostensibly to tailor the behavioral properties of these particles the most advanced form of molecular nanotechnology is often imagined to involve self replicating molecular machines and there have been some speculations suggesting something similar might be possible with analogues of molecules composed of nucleons rather than atoms for example the astrophysicist frank drake once speculated about the possibility of self replicating organisms composed of such nuclear molecules living on the surface of a neutron star a suggestion taken up in the science fiction novel dragon s egg by the physicist robert forward it is thought by physicists that nuclear molecules may be possible but they would be very short lived and whether they could actually be made to perform complex tasks such as self replication or what type of technology could be

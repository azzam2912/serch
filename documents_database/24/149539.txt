as a successor to the mos technology 6560 vic the team at mos technology had previously failed to produce two graphics chips named mos technology 6562 for the commodore toi computer and mos technology 6564 for the color pet due to memory speed constraints in order to construct the vic ii charpentier and winterble made a market survey of current home computers and video games listing up the current features and what features they wanted to have in the vic ii the idea of adding sprites came from the texas instruments ti 99 4a computer and its tms9918 graphics coprocessor the idea to support collision detection came from the mattel intellivision the atari 800 was also mined for desired features about 3 4 of the chip surface is used for the sprite functionality the chip was partly laid out using electronic design automation tools from applicon now a part of ugs corp and partly laid out manually on vellum paper the design was partly debugged by fabricating chips containing small subsets of the design which could then be tested separately this was easy since mos technology had both its research and development lab and semiconductor plant at the same location

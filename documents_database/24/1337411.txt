in this context an x ray welder is a tradesman who consistently welds at such a high proficiency that he rarely introduces defects into the weld pool and is able to recognize and correct defects in the weld pool during the welding process it is assumed or trusted by the quality control department of a fabrication or manufacturing shop that the welding work performed by an x ray welder would pass an x ray inspection for example defects like porosity concavities cracks cold laps slag and tungsten inclusions lack of fusion penetration etc are rarely seen in a radiographic x ray inspection of a weldment performed by an x ray welder with the growing use of synchrotron radiation in the welding process the older usage of the phrase x ray welding might cause confusion but the two terms are unlikely to be used in the same work environment because synchrotron radiation x ray welding is a remotely automated and mechanized process many advances in welding technology have resulted from the introduction of new sources of the thermal energy required for localized melting these advances include the introduction of modern techniques such as gas tungsten arc gas metal arc submerged arc

nest was initially developed by markus diesmann and marc oliver gewaltig and is now developed and maintained by the nest initiative a nest simulation tries to follow the logic of an electrophysiological experiment that takes place inside a computer with the difference that the neural system to be investigated must be defined by the experimenter the neural system is defined by a possibly large number of neurons and their connections in a nest network different neuron and synapse models can coexist any two neurons can have multiple connections with different properties thus the connectivity can in general not be described by a weight or connectivity matrix but rather as an adjacency list to manipulate or observe the network dynamics the experimenter can define so called devices which represent the various instruments for measuring and stimulation found in an experiment these devices write their data either to memory or to file nest is extensible and new models for neurons synapses and devices can be added the following example simulates spiking activity in a sparse random network with recurrent excitation and inhibition the figure shows the spiking activity of 50 neurons as a raster plot time increases along the horizontal axis neuron

the substrate is transported on a conveyor belt or calender rolls at a regulated speed through the curtain to ensure an even coat of the die the curtain is created by using a slit or die at the base of the holding tank allowing the liquid to fall upon the substrate some polymers are melted and extruded for coating many manufactures will also include a catch pan to retrieve and reuse the excess fluid curtain coating is a process in which the object or substrate to be coated is guided through a curtain of fluid located in a gap between two conveyors the mechanism is formed by a tank of fluid from which a thin screen falls down in between the two conveyors the thickness of the coating layer that falls upon the object is mainly determined by the speed of the conveyor and the amount of material leaving the tank pump speed curtain coating is a premetered method which means that the amount of liquid required is supplying from the tank to the screen to be deposited on the substrate curtain coating is one of the technologies used in the converting industry to modify the properties of substrates to

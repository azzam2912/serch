the model is named after the initial letters of its components software hardware environment liveware and places emphasis on the human being and human interfaces with other components of the aviation system the shell model adopts a systems perspective that suggests the human is rarely if ever the sole cause of an accident the systems perspective considers a variety of contextual and task related factors that interact with the human operator within the aviation system to affect operator performance as a result the shell model considers both active and latent failures in the aviation system each component of the shell model software hardware environment liveware represents a building block of human factors studies within aviation the human element or worker of interest is at the centre or hub of the shell model that represents the modern air transportation system the human element is the most critical and flexible component in the system interacting directly with other system components namely software hardware environment and liveware however the edges of the central human component block are varied to represent human limitations and variations in performance therefore the other system component blocks must be carefully adapted and matched to this central component to

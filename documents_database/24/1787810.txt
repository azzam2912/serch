the theorem asserts that a certain procedure when applied to an arbitrary polygon always yields a regular polygon having the same number of sides as the initial polygon the theorem was first published by karel petr 1868 1950 of prague in 1908 the theorem was independently rediscovered by jesse douglas 1897 1965 in 1940 and also by b h neumann 1909 2002 in 1941 the naming of the theorem as petr douglas neumann theorem or as the pdn theorem for short is due to stephen b gray this theorem has also been called douglas s theorem the douglas neumann theorem the napoleon douglas neumann theorem and petr s theorem the pdn theorem is a generalisation of the napoleon s theorem which is concerned about arbitrary triangles and of the van aubel s theorem which is related to arbitrary quadrilaterals the petr douglas neumann theorem asserts the following in the case of triangles the value of n is 3 and that of n 2 is 1 hence there is only one possible value for k namely 1 the specialisation of the theorem to triangles asserts that the triangle a is a regular 3 gon that is an equilateral triangle a is

structured triglycerides are achieved through an enzymatic process using vegetable oils current usage of structured triglycerides is mainly for infant formula providing human milk fat substitute fats in human breast milk provides about 50 of energy needed for the development and growth newborn infant about 98 of the fats provided by the human milk are in the form of triglycerides which themselves are molecules consisting of mixtures of three fatty acids bonded to sn 1 sn 2 and sn 3 positions of a glycerol backbone the human mammary gland provides the baby with a unique fat composition where the fatty acids arranged in specific combinations different from the triglycerides in other human tissues and plasma or from common dietary fats and oils palmitic acid c16 0 is the major saturated fatty acid in human milk accounting for 17 25 of the total fatty acids with over 70 of 16 0 is esterified at the milk triglyceride sn 2 position the major unsaturated fatty acid in human milk is oleic acid 18 1n 9 and this is mostly esterified at the triglyceride sn 1 3 outer positions the positioning of palmitic acid at the sn 2 position is conserved in all

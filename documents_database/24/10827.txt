the soil is raised above the surrounding soil approximately six inches to waist high and may be enriched with compost vegetable plants are spaced in geometric patterns much closer together than in conventional row gardening the spacing is such that when the vegetables are fully grown their leaves just barely touch each other creating a microclimate in which weed growth is suppressed and moisture is conserved raised beds lend themselves to the development of complex agriculture systems that utilize many of the principles and methods of permaculture they can be used effectively to control erosion and recycle and conserve water and nutrients by building them along contour lines on slopes this also makes more space available for intensive crop production they can be created over large areas with the use of several commonly available tractor drawn implements and efficiently maintained planted and harvested using hand tools this form of gardening is compatible with square foot gardening and companion planting circular raised beds with a path to the center a slice of the circle cut out are called keyhole gardens often the center has a chimney of sorts built with sticks and then lined with feedbags or grasses that allows water

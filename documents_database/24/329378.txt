vestian is a family of asteroids the cratering family is located in the inner asteroid belt in the vicinity of its namesake and principal body 4 vesta it is one of the largest asteroid families with more than 15 000 known members and consists of mostly bright v type asteroids so called vestoids the vestian asteroids consist of 4 vesta the second most massive of all asteroids mean diameter of 530 km and many small asteroids below 10 km diameter the brightest of these 1929 kollaa and 2045 peking have an absolute magnitude of 12 2 which would give them a radius of about 7 5 km assuming the same high albedo as 4 vesta the family originated from an impact on asteroid 4 vesta with the giant south polar crater the likely impact site the family are thought to be the source of the hed meteorites the vesta family also includes a few j type asteroids related to the v type which are thought to have come from the deeper layers of vesta s crust and are similar to the diogenite meteorites a hcm numerical analysis by zappala 1995 determined a large group of core family members whose proper

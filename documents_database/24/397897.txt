it is soluble in water and is mainly used as a coagulating agent promoting particle collision by neutralizing charge in the purification of drinking water and waste water treatment plants and also in paper manufacturing the anhydrous form occurs naturally as a rare mineral millosevichite found e g in volcanic environments and on burning coal mining waste dumps aluminium sulfate is rarely if ever encountered as the anhydrous salt it forms a number of different hydrates of which the hexadecahydrate al so 16ho and octadecahydrate al so 18ho are the most common the heptadecahydrate whose formula can be written as al ho so 5ho occurs naturally as the mineral alunogen aluminium sulfate is sometimes called alum or papermaker s alum in certain industries however the name alum is more commonly and properly used for any double sulfate salt with the generic formula where x is a monovalent cation such as potassium or ammonium aluminium sulfate may be made by adding aluminium hydroxide al oh to sulfuric acid hso or by heating aluminum metal in a sulfuric acid solution the alum schists employed in the manufacture of aluminium sulfate are mixtures of iron pyrite aluminium silicate and various bituminous substances and

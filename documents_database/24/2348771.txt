currently there are not any fda approved aav cancer treatments as the first fda approved aav treatment was approved december 2017 however there are many oncolytic aav applications that are in development and have been researched aav is a small virus that was found as a contaminant in adenovirus studies aav is a non pathogenic virus so it is currently being investigated for many gene therapy applications including oncolytic cancer treatments due to its relatively safe nature aav also has little risk for insertional mutagenesis a common problem when dealing with viral vectors as its transgenes are normally expressed episomally it was found that aav genome inserts in less than 10 of occasions aav infects a cell and the expression is less than when episomally expressed aav can only package genomes between 2 5 2 kb in size when they are flanked with inverted terminal repeat sequences itrs but optimally holds a genome of 4 1 to 4 9 kb in length this limits the therapeutic application of aav as a cancer treatment as the gene the virus carries must be able to fit in less than 4 9 kb aav and its many different strains known as serotypes to

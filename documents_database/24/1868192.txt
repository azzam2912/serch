stages of threat vary along a spectrum referred to as the predatory imminence continuum spanning from low risk pre encounter to high risk interaction threats the main assumption of the predatory imminence continuum is that as threat levels increase defensive response strategies change during the pre encounter period an animal may engage in activities like exploration or foraging but if the animal senses that a predator is nearby the animal may begin to express species specific defense reactions such as freezing in an attempt to avoid detection by the predator however in situations where a threat is imminent once the animal is detected by its predator freezing may no longer be the optimal behaviour for survival at this point the animal enters the circa strike phase where its behaviour will transition from passive freezing to active flight or even attack if escape is not possible the development of the predatory imminence continuum began with the description of species specific defence reactions species specific defence reactions are innate responses demonstrated by an animal when they experience a threat since survival behaviours are so vital for an animal to acquire and demonstrate rapidly it has been theorized that these defence reactions would

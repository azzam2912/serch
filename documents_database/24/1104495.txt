chk1 coordinates the dna damage response ddr and cell cycle checkpoint response activation of chk1 results in the initiation of cell cycle checkpoints cell cycle arrest dna repair and cell death to prevent damaged cells from progressing through the cell cycle in 1993 beach and associates initially identified chk1 as a serine threonine kinase which regulates the g2 m phase transition in fission yeast constitutive expression of chk1 in fission yeast was shown to induce cell cycle arrest the same gene called rad27 was identified in budding yeast by carr and associates in 1997 homologs were identified in more complex organisms including the fruit fly human and mouse through these findings it is apparent chk1 is highly conserved from yeast to humans human chk1 is located on chromosome 11 on the cytogenic band 11q22 23 chk1 has a n terminal kinase domain a linker region a regulatory sq tq domain and a c terminal domain chk1 contains four ser gln residues chk 1 activation occurs primarily through the phosphorylation of the conserved sites ser 317 ser 345 and less often at ser 366 checkpoint kinases chks are protein kinases that are involved in cell cycle control two checkpoint kinase subtypes

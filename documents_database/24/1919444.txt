khi solar one is 50 megawatts mw and is the first solar tower plant in africa it covers an area of abengoa claim it is the first thermal solar tower plant in africa and the first tower plant to achieve 24 hours of operation with solar energy only but that thanks to the decline in power demand at night since full power storage lasts only 2 hours the kso is an evolution of the ps10 and ps20 projects operating since 2007 and 2009 respectively in spain kso solar field is made of more than 4 000 heliostats totaling up to of mirror surface focusing solar energy on a boiler located on top a centralized tower kso uses a superheated steam cycle that should be able to reach a maximum operating temperature of 530 c accumulated saturated steam is also used to provide up to two hours of thermal storage at the plant kso condenser is cooled with a dry cooling system a natural draft condenser that uses towers to distribute air across fin blades in order to dissipate heat the project has been developed by the spanish company abengoa and the project was financed with help from industrial development corporation

joint service small arms program with the goal of significantly reducing the weight of small arms and their ammunition following a series of military programs to investigate advances in small arms spiw future rifle acr oicw the lsat program is the us military s latest project to replace existing us small arms tactical concepts and the research from the previous small arms programs indicates that lightening small arms is the first significant step towards increasing soldiers lethality and survivability initiated in 2004 then called the lightweight machine gun and ammunition program development is now led by textron development began with two types of weight reducing ammunition and a light machine gun to serve as a testbed and technology demonstrator minimization of program risk is shown by the development of the lower performing but less risky polymer cased ammunition alongside caseless ammunition which falls higher in both criteria by the use of extensive computer simulations before prototyping and by the use of existing and proven technologies such as the high ignition temperature propellant hitp developed for the heckler koch g11 in 2008 the program had achieved working prototypes for the polymer cased ammunition and the lmg which were tested by the

a multigene haplotype is a set of inherited alleles covering several genes or gene alleles long haplotypes like a30 dq2 are generally the result of descent by common ancestry as haplotypes increase in size chromosomal recombination fragments them in a generation dependent process a30 dq2 can be written in an extended form covering the major histocompatibility loci as follows hla a 3002 cw 0501 b 1801 drb1 0301 dqa1 0501 dqb1 0201 there are several composite haplotypes a30 cw5 b18 and a variant a30 cbl b18 comprise a30 b18 there is also the b18 dr3 component and the hla dr3 dq2 5 other haplotypes such as cw5 b16 dr3 or b8 dr3 dq2 5 have been presented in the literature a dozen inflammatory diseases of the immune system can attribute some risk to the haplotype some diseases like coeliac disease primarily associate with certain genes while other diseases like type 1 diabetes may have several highly different genes that attribute risk still other diseases like myasthenia gravis have undetermined linkage to the haplotype haplotypes of a30 b18 or cw5 b18 have been studied see allelefrequencies net and ihwc 1991 despite that large areas of northern africa have not been studies

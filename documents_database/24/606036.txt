their skulls were much stronger than those of their relatives the protorothyrididae and had teeth that were better able to deal with tough plant material the postcranial skeleton is very similar to that of advanced reptiliomorph amphibians so much in fact that the amphibian seymouriamorpha and diadectomorpha were thought to be reptiles and grouped together in cotylosauria as the first reptiles in the early 20th century captorhinids have broad robust skulls that are generally triangular in shape when seen in dorsal view the premaxillae are characteristically downturned early smaller forms possessed single rows of teeth while larger more derived forms such as captorhinus and the herbivorous moradisaurus which could reach an estimated snout vent length of 2 meters 6 5 feet possessed multiple rows of teeth until recently concordia cunninghami was thought to be the basalmost known member of captorhinidae a novel phylogenic study of primitive reptile relationships by muller reisz in 2006 recovered thuringothyris as a sister taxon of the captorhinidae the same results were obtained in later phylogenic analyses concordia is still the earliest known captorhinid as all other captorhinid taxa are known only from permian deposits captorhinidae contains a single subfamily the moradisaurinae moradisaurinae was named and

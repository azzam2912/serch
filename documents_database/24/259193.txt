he is a professor at nanjing university born in huai an jiangsu sun and his twin brother sun zhihong proved a theorem about what are now known as the wall sun sun primes that guided the search for counterexamples to fermat s last theorem in 2003 he presented a unified approach to three famous topics of paul erd s in combinatorial number theory covering systems restricted sumsets and zero sum problems or egz theorem he used q series to prove that any natural number can be represented as a sum of an even square and two triangular numbers he conjectured and proved with b k oh that each positive integer can be represented as a sum of a square an odd square and a triangular number in 2009 he conjectured that any natural number can be written as the sum of two squares and a pentagonal number as the sum of a triangular number an even square and a pentagonal number and as the sum of a square a pentagonal number and a hexagonal number he also raised many open conjectures on congruences and posed over 100 conjectural series for powers of formula 1 in 2013 he published a paper

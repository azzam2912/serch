it results in one lateral hemisphere of the earth with the grid of parallels and meridians the method is common in the geophysical sciences in the figure the area preserving property of the projection can be seen by comparing a grid sector near the center of the net with one at the far right of the net the two sectors have the same area on the sphere and the same area on the disk the angle distorting property can be seen by examining the grid lines most of them do not intersect at right angles on the schmidt net a single schmidt net can only represent one hemisphere of the earth typically a pair of schmidt nets is used to represent both sides of the globe it is relatively simple to re plot a gridded map of the world onto a schmidt net if the azimuth is chosen to be the junction of the equator with any particular meridian from the world map s grid each grid square surrounding this chosen longitude is simply re plotted into the corresponding distorted grid square in the schmidt net points of latitude longitude can be plotted relative to the azimuth s longitude interpolating

it is one of the three intermuscular spaces found in the axillary space the other two spaces are quadrangular space and triangular space two of its borders are as follows some sources state the lateral border is the humerus while others define it as the lateral head of the triceps the effective difference is relatively minor though the radial nerve is visible through the triangular interval on its way to the posterior compartment of the arm profunda brachii also passes through the triangular interval from anterior to posterior triangular interval syndrome tis was described as a differential diagnosis for radicular pain in the upper extremity it is a condition where the radial nerve is entrapped in the triangular interval resulting in upper extremity radicular pain the radial nerve and profunda brachii pass through the triangular interval and are hence vulnerable the triangular interval has a potential for compromise secondary alterations in thickness of the teres major and triceps it is described based on cadaveric studies that fibrous bands were commonly present between the teres major and triceps when these bands were present rotation of the shoulder caused a reduction in cross sectional area of the space normal resting postures of

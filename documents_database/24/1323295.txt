this tube was first proposed by a polish limnologist named olszewski in 1961 and helps combat the negative effects of eutrophication high nutrient content in lakes the basic concept behind the olszewski tube is the reduction of nutrient concentration and destratification the more specific goal is hypolimnetic withdrawal when nutrients build up in a lake eutrophication occurs and this generally occurs in the top layer of a lake the nutrients come both naturally and artificially and usually contain phosphates the artificial nutrients can come from sewage and fertilizers from agricultural runoff phosphorus from the phosphates causes algae to grow rapidly and spread throughout the top layer of the lake algal blooms have negative effects on both the aesthetics and the ecology of the lake aesthetically the lake is not pleasing because it is covered with algae ecologically eutrophication causes organisms in the lake to die because the algae deplete the dissolved oxygen in the lake at the most simple level the olszewski tube is a pipe that spans from the bottom hypolimnetic layer of the lake to the outlet the outlet part of the pipe is installed under lake level in order for the device to act as a siphon

it is a specific case of bistatic radar the latter also including the exploitation of cooperative and non cooperative radar transmitters conventional radar systems comprise a collocated transmitter and receiver which usually share a common antenna to transmit and receive a pulsed signal is transmitted and the time taken for the pulse to travel to the object and back allows the range of the object to be determined in a passive radar system there is no dedicated transmitter instead the receiver uses third party transmitters in the environment and measures the time difference of arrival between the signal arriving directly from the transmitter and the signal arriving via reflection from the object this allows the bistatic range of the object to be determined in addition to bistatic range a passive radar will typically also measure the bistatic doppler shift of the echo and also its direction of arrival these allow the location heading and speed of the object to be calculated in some cases multiple transmitters and or receivers can be employed to make several independent measurements of bistatic range doppler and bearing and hence significantly improve the final track accuracy the term passive radar is sometimes used incorrectly to

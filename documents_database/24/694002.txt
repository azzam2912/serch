while similar to black powder it was chemically formulated and formed hydraulically into a specific grain shape to provide a slower burn rates with neutral or progressive burning as opposed to the faster and regressive burn typical of randomly shaped grains of black powder produced by crushing and screening powder formed into sheets in a press box as was typical for cannon powder previously for pure explosive damage high burn rates or detonation speeds and accompanying brisance are generally preferable but in guns and especially cannons slower burning powder decreases firing stresses this allows for lighter longer and more accurate barrels with associated decreases in production and maintenance costs further modifications of its burning rate were achieved by shaping the powder grains into prismatic shapes typically single perforated hexagonal or octagonal prisms they became obsolete as a propellant due to the introduction of nitro explosive propellants such as poudre b in france and later by cordite in britain these new propellants produced less smoke particularly less black smoke the differences in burning rate were achieved by several means changes to formulation were altering ingredients relative percentage by weight and using differently processed charcoals for fuel than those of a standard

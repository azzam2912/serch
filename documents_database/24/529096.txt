the members were elected in the norwegian parliamentary election of 10 september 2001 the parliament convened on 22 october 2001 and the term ended on 30 september 2005 members to stortinget are elected based on party list proportional representation in plural member constituencies this means that representatives from different political parties are elected from each constituency the constituencies are identical to the 19 counties of norway the electorate does not vote for individuals but rather for party lists with a ranked list of candidates nominated by the party this means that the person on top of the list will get the seat unless the voter alters the ballot parties may nominate candidates from outside their own constituency and even norwegian citizens currently living abroad the sainte lagu method is used for allocating parliamentary seats to parties as a result the percentage of representatives is roughly equal to the nationwide percentage of votes still a party with a high number of votes in only one constituency can win a seat there even if the nationwide percentage is low in this election this happened with the coastal party conversely if a party s initial representation in stortinget is proportionally less than it

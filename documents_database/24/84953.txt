analogously in any group g powers b can be defined for all integers k and the discrete logarithm log a is an integer k such that in number theory the more commonly used term is index we can write x ind a mod m read the index of a to the base r modulo m for r a mod m if r is a primitive root of m and gcd a m 1 discrete logarithms are quickly computable in a few special cases however no efficient method is known for computing them in general several important algorithms in public key cryptography base their security on the assumption that the discrete logarithm problem over carefully chosen groups has no efficient solution let g be any group denote its group operation by multiplication and its identity element by 1 let b be any element of g for any positive integer k the expression b denotes the product of b with itself k times similarly let b denote the product of b with itself k times for k 0 the k th power is the identity let a also be an element of g an integer k that solves the equation is termed

his main interest is algebraic geometry vezzosi earned an ms degree in physics at the university of florence under the supervision of alexandre m vinogradov and a phd in mathematics at the scuola normale superiore in pisa under the supervision of angelo vistoli his first papers dealt with differential calculus over commutative rings intersection theory equivariant algebraic k theory motivic homotopy theory and existence of vector bundles on singular algebraic surfaces around 2001 2002 he started his collaboration with bertrand to n together they created homotopical algebraic geometry hag whose more relevant part is derived algebraic geometry dag which is by now a powerful and widespread theory slightly later this theory have been reconsidered and highly expanded by jacob lurie more recently vezzosi together with tony pantev bertrand to n and michel vaqui defined a derived version of symplectic structures and studied important properties and examples an important instance being kai behrend s symmetric obstruction theories further together with damien calaque these authors introduced and studied a derived version of poisson and coisotropic structures with applications to deformation quantization lately to n and vezzosi partly in collaboration with anthony blanc and marco robalo moved to applications of derived and non

air pressure is typically generated by breath or with a bellows in the hornbostel sachs system it is number 412 13 a member of interruptive free aerophones free reed instruments are contrasted with non free or enclosed reed instruments where the timbre is fully or partially dependent on the shape of the instrument body hornbostel sachs number 42 flute reed and brass the following illustrations depict the type of reed typical of harmonicas pitch pipes accordions and reed organs as it goes through a cycle of vibration one side of the reed frame is omitted from the images for clarity in reality the frame completely encloses the reed airflow over one side of the reed creates a region of low pressure on that side see the bernoulli s principle article for details causing the reed to flex towards the low pressure side the reed frame is constructed so that the flexing of the reed obstructs the airflow which reduces or eliminates the low pressure region and allows the reed to flex back each time the reed passes through the frame it interrupts air flow these rapid periodic interruptions of the air flow create the audible vibrations perceived by the listener

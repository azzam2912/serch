it was invented by max friedrich meyer and popularized by harry partch the first of partch s four concepts is the scale of musical intervals begins with absolute consonance 1 to 1 and gradually progresses into an infinitude of dissonance the consonance of the intervals decreasing as the odd numbers of their ratios increase almost all of partch s music is written in the 43 tone scale and although most of his instruments can play only subsets of the full scale he used it as an all encompassing framework partch chose the 11 limit i e all rational numbers with odd factors of numerator and denominator not exceeding 11 as the basis of his music because the 11th harmonic is the first that is utterly foreign to western ears the seventh harmonic is poorly approximated by 12 tone equal temperament but it appears in ancient greek scales is well approximated by meantone temperament and it is familiar from the barbershop quartet the ninth harmonic is comparatively well approximated by equal temperament and it exists in pythagorean tuning because 3 3 9 but the 11th harmonic falls right in the middle between two pitches of 12 tone equal temperament 551 3

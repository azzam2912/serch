he is a broad scope theorist who carried out research on a wide range of condensed matter physics phenomena his early work dealt with optical properties electron energy loss theory of excitons and nonlocal dielectric response in solids including layer crystals such as graphite and semiconductors charge and spin density waves surface physics in all its aspects particularly reconstruction roughening and melting also in clusters the prediction the berry phase in fullerene the first calculated stm map of graphite now a standard in the field matter at extreme pressures carbon oxygen hydrogen co2 iron at earth core conditions water and ammonia at deep planetary conditions pressure induced insulator metal transitions in layer compounds like mos2 in nanophysics he and his group predicted helical structures of metal nanowires the spontaneous magnetism of metal nanocontacts including the electronic circumstances for normal or ferromagnetic kondo effect therein his and his collaborator s theory of strongly correlated superconductivity was recently confirmed in compounds such as cs3c60 pioneering papers on quantum annealing are now basic to current developments in quantum computing more recently he moved on to the theory of nanofriction a field where he also obtained the erc advanced grant modphysfrict 2013 2019 more

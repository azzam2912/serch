the program s objectives are to involve graduate students in the process of spaceflight development and to provide low cost access to space for scientific research and the testing of nanoscale devices the canx projects include canx 1 canx 2 the bright target explorer brite and canx 4 5 the canadian advanced nanospace experiment canx program is the first canadian nanosatellite program and the only one of its kind at present it is operated by teachers and graduate students at the university of toronto institute for aerospace studies space flight laboratory utias sfl the program was established in 2001 by dr robert e zee manager of utias sfl and is based on the cubesat program started by stanford university and california polytechnic state university its projects include canx 1 canx 2 canx 3 brite and canx 4 5 the program s objectives are to involve graduate students in the process of spacecraft development and to provide relatively low cost access to space for scientific research and the testing of nanoscale devices in orbital space in march 2009 canx 2 completed its first year in orbit the canadian advanced nanospace experiment 1 canx 1 is canada s first nanosatellite and a

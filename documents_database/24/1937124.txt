it is a contraction of self quenching a squegging or self blocking oscillator produces an intermittent or changing output signal wildlife tags for birds and little mammals use squegging oscillators the armstrong super regenerative radio receiver uses a self blocking oscillator too the receiver sensitivity rises while the oscillation builds up the oscillation stops when the operation point no longer fulfills the barkhausen stability criterion the blocking oscillator recovers to the initial state and the cycle starts again the receive frequency of the armstrong super regenerative receiver was some hundred kilohertz the self quenching frequency was ten kilohertz just above the highest audio frequency the headphone could reproduce squegging is an oscillation that builds up and dies down with a much longer time constant than the fundamental frequency of the oscillation a self quenching oscillator circuit oscillates at two or more frequencies at the same time in an audio amplifier all forms of oscillation are generally unwanted poor design and layout can sometimes lead to squegging in such an amplifier as always this arises from a combination of high and low frequency oscillations poor layout or poor shielding leads to high frequency oscillations where the output has been coupled back

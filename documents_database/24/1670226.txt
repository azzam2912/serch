a nearly equivalent operation is count trailing zeros ctz or number of trailing zeros ntz which counts the number of zero bits following the least significant one bit the complementary operation that finds the index or position of the most significant set bit is log base 2 so called because it computes the binary logarithm formula 1 this is closely related to count leading zeros clz or number of leading zeros nlz which counts the number of zero bits preceding the most significant one bit these four operations also have negated versions there are two common variants of find first set the posix definition which starts indexing of bits at 1 herein labelled ffs and the variant which starts indexing of bits at zero which is equivalent to ctz and so will be called by that name given the following 32 bit word the count trailing zeros operation would return 3 while the count leading zeros operation returns 16 the count leading zeros operation depends on the word size if this 32 bit word were truncated to a 16 bit word count leading zeros would return zero the find first set operation would return 4 indicating the 4th position from

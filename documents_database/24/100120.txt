the formula was primarily presented as a generalization of the balmer series for all atomic electron transitions of hydrogen it was first empirically stated in 1888 by the swedish physicist johannes rydberg then theoretically by niels bohr in 1913 who used a primitive form of quantum mechanics the formula directly generalizes the equations used to calculate the wavelengths of the hydrogen spectral series in 1880 rydberg worked on a formula describing the relation between the wavelengths in spectral lines of alkali metals he noticed that lines came in series and he found that he could simplify his calculations using the wavenumber the number of waves occupying the unit length equal to 1 the inverse of the wavelength as his unit of measurement he plotted the wavenumbers n of successive lines in each series against consecutive integers which represented the order of the lines in that particular series finding that the resulting curves were similarly shaped he sought a single function which could generate all of them when appropriate constants were inserted first he tried the formula formula 1 where n is the line s wavenumber n is the series limit m is the line s ordinal number in the series

it is sometimes used to refer to all rnas or just mrna depending on the particular experiment it differs from the exome in that it includes only those rna molecules found in a specified cell population and usually includes the amount or concentration of each rna molecule in addition to the molecular identities the term can be applied to the total set of transcripts in a given organism or to the specific subset of transcripts present in a particular cell type unlike the genome which is roughly fixed for a given cell line excluding mutations the transcriptome can vary with external environmental conditions because it includes all mrna transcripts in the cell the transcriptome reflects the genes that are being actively expressed at any given time with the exception of mrna degradation phenomena such as transcriptional attenuation the study of transcriptomics which includes expression profiling splice variant analysis etc examines the expression level of rnas in a given cell population often focusing on mrna but sometimes including others such as trnas srnas transcriptomics techniques include dna microarrays and next generation sequencing technologies called rna seq transcription can also be studied at the level of individual cells by single cell transcriptomics

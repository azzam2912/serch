the information to be encoded can be text or numeric data usual data size is from a few bytes up to 1556 bytes the length of the encoded data depends on the number of cells in the matrix error correction codes are often used to increase reliability even if one or more cells are damaged so it is unreadable the message can still be read a data matrix symbol can store up to 2 335 alphanumeric characters data matrix symbols are rectangular usually square in shape and composed of square cells which represent bits depending on the coding used a light cell represents a 0 and a dark cell is a 1 or vice versa every data matrix is composed of two solid adjacent borders in an l shape called the finder pattern and two other borders consisting of alternating dark and light cells or modules called the timing pattern within these borders are rows and columns of cells encoding information the finder pattern is used to locate and orient the symbol while the timing pattern provides a count of the number of rows and columns in the symbol as more data is encoded in the symbol the number of

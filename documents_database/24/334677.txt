a total of 230 examples were constructed mainly for north american railroads and industrial operations the sw1001 was developed because emd s sw1000 model had proved unpopular among industrial railroad customers as the heights of its walkway and cab eaves were much greater than those of earlier emd switcher models the overall height was similar but the sw1000 s roof was much flatter in curvature industrial railroads that only operated switchers often had facilities designed to the proportions of emd s earlier switchers the sw1001 in essence placed the hood and powertrain of the sw1000 with the underframe and cab of the earlier sw1200 the emd 645 series diesel engine had a deeper crankcase and oil pan than the sw1200 s emd 567 series engine the engine had to be mounted on risers for sufficient clearance raising the whole hood about above the walkway compared to the sw1000 and requiring a spacer under the hood the cab was similar to that of the sw1200 but not identical it is longer and has a different window arrangement the sw1001 uses the same pilot plates as the sw1000 given the lower frame height these protrude above the walkway deck height giving the

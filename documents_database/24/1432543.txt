the relationship is represented by the equation where l and m are the luminosity and mass of the sun and 1 main sequence stars this equation and the usual value of a 3 5 only applies to main sequence stars with masses 2 m eddington luminosity then a 1 in summary the relations for stars with different ranges of mass are to a good approximation as the following for stars with masses less than 0 43 m convection is the sole energy transport process so the relation changes significantly for stars with masses m 55 m the relationship flattens out and becomes l m but in fact those stars don t last because they are unstable and quickly lose matter by intense solar winds it can be shown this change is due to an increase in radiation pressure in massive stars these equations are determined empirically by determining the mass of stars in binary systems to which the distance is known via standard parallax measurements or other techniques after enough stars are plotted stars will form a line on a logarithmic plot and slope of the line gives the proper value of a another form valid for k type main

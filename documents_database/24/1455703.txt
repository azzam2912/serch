one of these results is now known as de bruijn s theorem according to this theorem a harmonic brick one in which each side length is a multiple of the next smaller side length can only be packed into a box whose dimensions are multiples of the brick s dimensions de bruijn was led to prove this result after his then seven year old son f w de bruijn was unable to pack bricks of dimension formula 1 into a formula 2 cube the cube has a volume equal to that of formula 3 bricks but only formula 4 bricks may be packed into it one way to see this is to partition the cube into formula 3 smaller cubes of size formula 6 colored alternately black and white this coloring has more unit cells of one color than of the other but with this coloring any placement of the formula 1 brick must have equal numbers of cells of each color therefore any tiling by bricks would also have equal numbers of cells of each color an impossibility de bruijn s theorem proves that a perfect packing with these dimensions is impossible in a more general way that applies

the equilibrium equations are since there are four unknown forces or variables v v v and h but only three equilibrium equations this system of simultaneous equations does not have a unique solution the structure is therefore classified as statically indeterminate to solve statically indeterminate systems determine the various moment and force reactions within it one considers the material properties and compatibility in deformations if the support at b is removed the reaction v cannot occur and the system becomes statically determinate or isostatic note that the system is completely constrained here the system becomes an exact constraint kinematic coupling the solution to the problem is if in addition the support at a is changed to a roller support the number of reactions are reduced to three without h but the beam can now be moved horizontally the system becomes unstable or partly constrained a mechanism rather than a structure in order to distinguish between this and the situation when a system under equilibrium is perturbed and becomes unstable it is preferable to use the phrase partly constrained here in this case the 2 unknowns v and v can be determined by resolving the vertical force equation and the moment

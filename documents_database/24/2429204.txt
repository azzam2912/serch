it is endemic to a single crag located in the pyrenees of aragon spain a previously unknown species dioscorea chouardii was discovered in the 1950s growing in cracks in a limestone cliff in the pyrenees mountains in northeastern spain the fissures in which it lives are so inaccessible that it proved difficult to estimate the number of plants at first it was thought that there were some 300 to 500 plants scattered across the rock face but later with the erection of some scaffolding and the help of binoculars and telescopes individual plants could be monitored and a total figure of around 9 000 plants was reached the plant has been described as a living fossil a relict from the tertiary period dioscorea chouardii is morphologically very similar to another relict species dioscorea pyrenaica which has a rather wider distribution in the pyrenees the former grows in vertical cracks on shaded north facing limestone cliffs at between while the latter grows on limestone screes at over rapd testing strongly suggests that d chouardii is not an ecotype of d pyrenaica and that the two taxa should be considered separate species dioscorea chouardii is related to the yam and grows from

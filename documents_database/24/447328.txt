it is known to occur in aqueous solutions but it has not been isolated as a pure material although this fact does not detract from the significance of as oh as oh is a pyramidal molecule consisting of three hydroxyl groups bonded to arsenic the h nmr spectrum of arsenous acid solutions consists of a single signal consistent with the molecule s high symmetry in contrast the nominally related phosphorus species hpo mainly adopts the structure hpo oh p oh is a very minor equilibrium component of such solutions the differing behaviors of the as and p compounds reflect a trend whereby high oxidation states are more stable for lighter members of main group elements than their heavier congeners one tautomer of arsenous acid is haso oh which is called arsonic acid it has not been isolated or well characterized the preparation of as oh involves a slow hydrolysis of arsenic trioxide in water addition of base converts arsenous acid to the arsenite ions aso oh aso oh and aso with its first p k being 9 2 as oh is a weak acid reactions attributed to aqueous arsenic trioxide are due to arsenous acid and its conjugate bases like

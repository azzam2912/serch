any foliation on a manifold induces a haefliger structure which uniquely determines the foliation a haefliger structure on a space x is determined by a haefliger cocycle a codimension q haefliger cocycle consists of a covering of x by open sets u together with continuous maps from u u to the sheaf of germs of local diffeomorphisms of r satisfying the 1 cocycle condition more generally c pl analytic and continuous haefliger structures are defined by replacing sheaves of germs of smooth diffeomorphisms by the appropriate sheaves a codimension q foliation can be specified by a covering of x by open sets u together with a submersion from each open set u to r such that for each there is a map from u u to local diffeomorphisms with whenever v is close enough to u the haefliger cocycle is defined by an advantage of haefliger structures over foliations is that they are closed under pullbacks if f is a continuous map from x to y then one can take pullbacks of foliations on y provided that f is transverse to the foliation but if f is not transverse the pullback can be a haefliger structure that is not a

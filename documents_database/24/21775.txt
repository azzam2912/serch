species with one cotyledon are called monocotyledonous monocots plants with two embryonic leaves are termed dicotyledonous dicots in the case of dicot seedlings whose cotyledons are photosynthetic the cotyledons are functionally similar to leaves however true leaves and cotyledons are developmentally distinct cotyledons are formed during embryogenesis along with the root and shoot meristems and are therefore present in the seed prior to germination true leaves however are formed post embryonically i e after germination from the shoot apical meristem which is responsible for generating subsequent aerial portions of the plant the cotyledon of grasses and many other monocotyledons is a highly modified leaf composed of a scutellum and a coleoptile the scutellum is a tissue within the seed that is specialized to absorb stored food from the adjacent endosperm the coleoptile is a protective cap that covers the plumule precursor to the stem and leaves of the plant gymnosperm seedlings also have cotyledons and these are often variable in number multicotyledonous with from 2 to 24 cotyledons forming a whorl at the top of the hypocotyl the embryonic stem surrounding the plumule within each species there is often still some variation in cotyledon numbers e g monterey pine pinus

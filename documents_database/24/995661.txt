it is transcribed by rna polymerase i as part of the 45s precursor that also contains 18s and 28s rrna its function is thought to be in ribosome translocation it is also known to form covalent linkage to the p53 tumour suppressor protein 5 8s rrna can be used as a reference gene for mirna detection the 5 8s ribosomal rna is used to better understand other rrna processes and pathways in the cell l567 5 rrna structure is approximately 150 nucleotides in size and it consists of plenty of folded strands some of which are presumed to be single stranded this ribosomal rna along with the 28s and 5s rrna as well as 46 ribosomal proteins forms the ribosomal large subunit lsu the 5 8s rrna is initially transcribed along with the 18s and 28s rrna in the 45s preribosomal rna along with the its 1 and its 2 internal transcribed spacer and a 5 and 3 ets external transcribed spacer the 5 8s rrna is located between the two its regions with its1 separating it from the 18s rrna in the 5 direction and its2 separating it from the 28s rrna in the 3 direction the its and

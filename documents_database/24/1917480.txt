the squared distance function wrt to p is directionally differentiable on all m his ph d thesis 1985 transferred the concept of cut locus to manifolds with and without boundary in 1992 essentially a specialisation of the latter works lead to his paper presenting a mathematical foundation of the medial axis of solid objects in euclidean space it showed that the medial axis of a solid body can be viewed as the interior cut locus of the solid s boundary and the medial axis is a deformation retract of the solid therefore it represents the homotopy type of a solid thus including the solid s homology type furthermore the medial axis can be used to reconstruct the solid later on since 1997 the subject of the medial axis received a rapidly growing attention in computational geometry but also wrt its applications in vision and robotics a voronoi diagram of a finite point set a in euclidean space can be viewed as cut locus of that point set in 1997 wolter apparently pioneered computations of geodesic voronoi diagrams and geodesic medial axis on general parametrized curved surfaces in the surface case the length of a shortest geodesic join defines the distance

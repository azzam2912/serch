it is a colorless liquid that is poorly soluble in water but soluble in most organic solvents it is produced on a massive scale 2 000 000 000 kg y for use in numerous applications such as solvents flavors and fragrances and especially as a precursor for production of other chemicals such as emollients and plasticizers it is encountered in natural plant fragrances and the odor has been reported as heavy earthy and slightly floral for the r enantiomer and a light sweet floral fragrance for the s enantiomer the branching in 2 ethylhexanol inhibits its crystallization due to packing disruption this results in a very low freezing point esters of 2 ethylhexanol are similarly affected and it therefore finds application as a feedstock in the production of plasticizers and lubricants where its presence helps reduce viscosity and lower freezing points almost all 2 ethylhexanol manufactured is used as a precursor for the synthesis of the diester bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp a plasticizer because it is a fatty alcohol its esters tend to have emollient properties it is also commonly used as a low volatility solvent 2 ethylhexanol can also be used as a cetane number booster when reacted

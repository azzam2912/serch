the protein encoded by this gene is a type i membrane receptor for group b coxsackie viruses and subgroup c adenoviruses car protein is expressed in several tissues including heart brain and more generally epithelial and endothelial cells in cardiac muscle car is localized to intercalated disc structures which electrically and mechanically couple adjacent cardiomyocytes car plays an important role in the pathogenesis of myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy and in arrhythmia susceptibility following myocardial infarction or myocardial ischemia human car protein has a theoretical molecular weight of 40 0 kda and is composed of 365 amino acids the human car gene cxadr is found on chromosome 21 alternative splicing is known to produce at least 2 splice variants known as hcar1 and hcar2 and are each composed of at least 7 exons pseudogenes of this gene are found on chromosomes 15 18 and 21 car is a transmembrane bound protein with two ig like extracellular domains a transmembrane domain a cytoplasmic domain and two n linked glycosylation sites car contains two disulfide bonded loops residues 35 130 and 155 220 the n terminal segment comprises the two extracellular domains d1 and d2 d1 is most distal from the membrane and contains

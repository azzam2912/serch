two examples of such algorithms are karger stein algorithm and monte carlo algorithm for minimum feedback arc set the name refers to the grand casino in the principality of monaco at monte carlo which is well known around the world as an icon of gambling the term monte carlo was first introduced in 1947 by nicholas metropolis las vegas algorithms are the subset of monte carlo algorithms that always produce the correct answer because they make random choices as part of their working the time taken might vary between runs even with the same input if there is a procedure for verifying whether the answer given by a monte carlo algorithm is correct and the probability of a correct answer is bounded above zero then with probability one running the algorithm repeatedly while testing the answers will eventually give a correct answer whether this process is a las vegas algorithm depends on whether halting with probability one is considered to satisfy the definition whereas the answer returned by a deterministic algorithm is always expected to be correct this is not the case for monte carlo algorithms for decision problems these algorithms are generally classified as either false biased or true

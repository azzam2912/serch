its name is derived from the initials of the institute of radio engineers a value of 100 ire is defined to be 714 mv in an analog ntsc video signal a value of 0 ire corresponds to the voltage value of 0 mv the signal value during the blanking period the sync pulse is normally 40 ire below this 0 ire value so the total range covered from peak to trough of an all white signal would be 140 ire note that video signals use the ire unit instead of dc voltages to describe levels and amplitudes based on a standard 1 v ntsc composite video signal that swings from 286 mv sync tip to 714 mv peak video a 140 ire peak to peak convention is established one ntsc ire unit is 7 14mv where 40 ire is equivalent to 286 mv and 100 ire is equivalent to 714 mv note that 0 ire is equivalent to 0 v the black level is equivalent to 53 57 mv 7 5 ire the pal video signal is slightly different in that it swings from 300 mv to 700 mv instead thus one pal ire unit is 7mv where 43 ire

this was the first type of intrusion detection software to have been designed with the original target system being the mainframe computer where outside interaction was infrequent a host based ids is capable of monitoring all or parts of the dynamic behavior and the state of a computer system based on how it is configured besides such activities as dynamically inspecting network packets targeted at this specific host optional component with most software solutions commercially available a hids might detect which program accesses what resources and discover that for example a word processor has suddenly and inexplicably started modifying the system password database similarly a hids might look at the state of a system its stored information whether in ram in the file system log files or elsewhere and check that the contents of these appear as expected e g have not been changed by intruders one can think of a hids as an agent that monitors whether anything or anyone whether internal or external has circumvented the system s security policy many computer users have encountered tools that monitor dynamic system behaviour in the form of anti virus av packages while av programs often also monitor system state they

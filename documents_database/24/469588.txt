the resistance change is a result of the giant magnetoresistive effect the magnetic layers of the device align up or down depending on an external magnetic field in the simplest case a spin valve consists of a non magnetic material sandwiched between two ferromagnets one of which is fixed pinned by an antiferromagnet which acts to raise its magnetic coercivity and behaves as a hard layer while the other is free unpinned and behaves as a soft layer due to the difference in coercivity the soft layer changes polarity at lower applied magnetic field strength than the hard one upon application of a magnetic field of appropriate strength the soft layer switches polarity producing two distinct states a parallel low resistance state and an antiparallel high resistance state spin valves work because of a quantum property of electrons and other particles called spin due to a split in the density of states of electrons at the fermi energy in ferromagnets there is a net spin polarisation an electric current passing through a ferromagnet therefore carries both charge and a spin component in comparison a normal metal has an equal number of electrons with up and down spins so in equilibrium

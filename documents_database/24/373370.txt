their semi major axes range between 16 and 19 gm their inclinations between 35 and 40 and their eccentricities around 0 53 the international astronomical union iau reserves names taken from gallic mythology for these moons similar mean orbital elements led the discoverers to postulate a common origin for the group in a breakup of a larger body the group was later found to be physically homogeneous all satellites displaying light red colour colour indices b v 0 91 and v r 0 48 and similar infrared indices remarkably recent observations revealed that the largest member of the group albiorix displays actually two different colours one compatible with erriapus and tarvos and another less red instead of the common progenitor it was postulated that tarvos and erriapus could be fragments of albiorix leaving a large less red crater such an impact would require a body with the diameter in excess of 1 km and relative velocity close to 5 km s resulting in a large crater with the radius of 12 km numerous very large craters observed on phoebe prove the existence of such collisions in the saturnian system s past the discovery of 20 new moons of saturn was

it is frequently applied in the field of chemical engineering to calculate phase equilibria the concept of nrtl is based on the hypothesis of wilson that the local concentration around a molecule is different from the bulk concentration this difference is due to a difference between the interaction energy of the central molecule with the molecules of its own kind formula 3 and that with the molecules of the other kind formula 4 the energy difference also introduces a non randomness at the local molecular level the nrtl model belongs to the so called local composition models other models of this type are the wilson model the uniquac model and the group contribution model unifac these local composition models are not thermodynamically consistent for a one fluid model for a real mixture due to the assumption that the local composition around molecule i is independent of the local composition around molecule j this assumption is not true as was shown by flemr in 1976 however they are consistent if a hypothetical two liquid model is used for a binary mixture the following function are used formula 5 with formula 6 in here formula 7 and formula 8 are the dimensionless

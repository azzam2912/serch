placed in front of the normal lcd it consists of an opaque layer with a series of precisely spaced slits allowing each eye to see a different set of pixels so creating a sense of depth through parallax in an effect similar to what lenticular printing produces for printed products and lenticular lenses for other displays a disadvantage of the method in its simplest form is that the viewer must be positioned in a well defined spot to experience the 3d effect however recent versions of this technology have addressed this issue by using face tracking to adjust the relative positions of the pixels and barrier slits according to the location of the user s eyes allowing the user to experience the 3d from a wide range of positions another disadvantage is that the horizontal pixel count viewable by each eye is halved reducing the overall horizontal resolution of the image the principle of the parallax barrier was independently invented by auguste berthier who published an article on stereoscopic pictures including his new idea illustrated with a diagram and pictures with purposely exaggerated dimensions of the interlaced image strips and by frederic e ives who made and exhibited a functional

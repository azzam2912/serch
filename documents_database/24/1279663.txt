it operates by closing off the supply of steam early before the piston has travelled through its full stroke this cut off allows the steam to then expand within the cylinder this expanding steam is still sufficient to drive the piston even though its pressure decreases as it expands as less steam is supplied in the shorter time for which the valve is open use of the expansion valve reduces the steam consumed and thus the fuel required the engine on 1875 figures may deliver two thirds of the work for only one third of the steam an expansion valve is a secondary valve within a steam engine they represent an intermediate step between steam engines with non expansive working and later valve gears that could provide for expansion by controlling the motion of a single valve expansion valves were used for stationary engines and marine engines they were not used for locomotives although expansive working was achieved by the use of the later variable expansion valve gears the pressure of the expanded steam is less than that of steam supplied directly from the boiler an engine working with an expansion valve set to an early cut off is thus

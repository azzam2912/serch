the implications for the group with index q 0 is usually that its dimension the number of independent global sections coincides with a holomorphic euler characteristic that can be computed using the hirzebruch riemann roch theorem the statement of kunihiko kodaira s result is that if m is a compact k hler manifold of complex dimension n l any holomorphic line bundle on m that is positive and k is the canonical line bundle then for q 0 here formula 2 stands for the tensor product of line bundles by means of serre duality one also obtains the vanishing of formula 3 for q kodaira nakano vanishing theorem in which formula 4 where l denotes the sheaf of holomorphic n 0 forms on m with values on l is replaced by l the sheaf of holomorphic r 0 forms with values on l then the cohomology group h m l vanishes whenever q r n the kodaira vanishing theorem can be formulated within the language of algebraic geometry without any reference to transcendental methods such as k hler metrics positivity of the line bundle l translates into the corresponding invertible sheaf being ample i e some tensor power gives a

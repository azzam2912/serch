the lack of contradiction can be defined in either semantic or syntactic terms the semantic definition states that a theory is consistent if it has a model i e there exists an interpretation under which all formulas in the theory are true this is the sense used in traditional aristotelian logic although in contemporary mathematical logic the term satisfiable is used instead the syntactic definition states a theory formula 1 is consistent if there is no formula formula 2 such that both formula 2 and its negation formula 4 are elements of the set of consequences of formula 1 let formula 6 be a set of closed sentences informally axioms and formula 7 the set of closed sentences provable from formula 6 under some specified possibly implicitly formal deductive system the set of axioms formula 6 is consistent when formula 10 for no formula formula 2 if there exists a deductive system for which these semantic and syntactic definitions are equivalent for any theory formulated in a particular deductive logic the logic is called complete the completeness of the sentential calculus was proved by paul bernays in 1918 and emil post in 1921 while the completeness of predicate calculus was

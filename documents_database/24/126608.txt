the binary golay code along with the ternary golay code has a particularly deep and interesting connection to the theory of finite sporadic groups in mathematics these codes are named in honor of marcel j e golay whose 1949 paper introducing them has been called by e r berlekamp the best single published page in coding theory there are two closely related binary golay codes the extended binary golay code g sometimes just called the golay code in finite group theory encodes 12 bits of data in a 24 bit word in such a way that any 3 bit errors can be corrected or any 7 bit errors can be detected the other the perfect binary golay code g has codewords of length 23 and is obtained from the extended binary golay code by deleting one coordinate position conversely the extended binary golay code is obtained from the perfect binary golay code by adding a parity bit in standard coding notation the codes have parameters 24 12 8 and 23 12 7 corresponding to the length of the codewords the dimension of the code and the minimum hamming distance between two codewords respectively in mathematical terms the extended binary golay

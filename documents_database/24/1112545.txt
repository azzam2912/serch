the emphasis of the model is on simulating system bus transactions prior to building and testing the actual hardware bfm s are usually defined as tasks in hardware description languages hdls which applies stimulus to the design under test verification via complex waveforms and protocols a bfm is typically written in an hdl language such as verilog vhdl systemc or systemverilog on one side it drives and samples low level signals according to the bus protocol on the other side tasks are available to create and respond to bus transactions bfms are often used as reusable building blocks to create simulation test benches where the signal ports on a design under test are connected to the appropriate bfms in the testbench for the purpose of simulation for instance let s say if you re a design house and you have the requirement of buying an ip from a 3rd party source the 3rd party ip provider might give you a c model for verification whereas the actual ip would only go to the foundry bfms thus are used as substitute models for better ip protection earlier bfm were treated as a non synthesizable entity but over the period of time

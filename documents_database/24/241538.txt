a vibrating structure gyroscope functions much like the halteres of flies insects in the order diptera the underlying physical principle is that a vibrating object tends to continue vibrating in the same plane even if its support rotates the coriolis effect causes the object to exert a force on its support and by measuring this force the rate of rotation can be determined vibrating structure gyroscopes are simpler and cheaper than conventional rotating gyroscopes of similar accuracy inexpensive vibrating structure gyroscopes manufactured with mems technology are widely used in smartphones gaming devices cameras and many other applications consider two proof masses vibrating in plane as in the mems gyro at frequency formula 1 the coriolis effect induces an acceleration on the proof masses equal to formula 2 where formula 3 is a velocity and formula 4 is an angular rate of rotation the in plane velocity of the proof masses is given by formula 5 if the in plane position is given by formula 6 the out of plane motion formula 7 induced by rotation is given by where by measuring formula 7 we can thus determine the rate of rotation formula 4 this type of gyroscope was developed by

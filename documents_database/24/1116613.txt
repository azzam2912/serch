it states that soils and other granular materials if continuously distorted sheared until they flow as a frictional fluid will come into a well defined critical state at the onset of the critical state shear distortions formula 1 occur without any further changes in mean effective stress formula 2 deviatoric stress formula 3 or yield stress formula 4 in uniaxial tension according to the von mises yielding criterion or specific volume formula 5 where however for triaxial conditions formula 10 thus all critical states for a given soil form a unique line called the critical state line csl defined by the following equations in the space formula 13 where formula 16 formula 17 and formula 18 are soil constants the first equation determines the magnitude of the deviatoric stress formula 3 needed to keep the soil flowing continuously as the product of a frictional constant formula 16 capital formula 21 and the mean effective stress formula 2 the second equation states that the specific volume formula 5 occupied by unit volume of flowing particles will decrease as the logarithm of the mean effective stress increases in an attempt to advance soil testing techniques kenneth harry roscoe of cambridge university in

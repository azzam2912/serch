it also served users of the microprocessor as a method to prototype applications in products unlike a general purpose system such as a home computer usually a development board contains little or no hardware dedicated to a user interface it will have some provision to accept and run a user supplied program such as downloading a program through a serial port to flash memory or some form of programmable memory in a socket in earlier systems the reason for the existence of a development board was solely to provide a system for learning to use a new microprocessor not for entertainment so everything superfluous was left out to keep costs down even an enclosure was not supplied nor a power supply this is because the board would only be used in a laboratory environment so it did not need an enclosure and the board could be powered by a typical bench power supply already available to an electronic engineer microprocessor training development kits were not always produced by microprocessor manufacturers many systems that can be classified as microprocessor development kits were produced by third parties one example is the sinclair mk14 which was inspired by the official sc mp development

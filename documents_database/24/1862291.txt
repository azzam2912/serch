this was a complex design featuring contra rotating stages and a bypass fan making it one of the earliest turbofan designs to be produced the end result of the design work was built as the db 007 and began testing on a test bed on 27 may 1943 due to the expected low performance complexity and the good results achieved by much simpler designs work was halted on the db 007 in may 1944 by order of the rlm after initial studies on gas turbines in the late 1920s daimler benz lost interest in them until 1939 with the arrival of karl leist work began immediately on the db 670 aka ztl 5000 a ducted fan with compressor feeding an afterburner driven by a db 604 x 24 engine delivering at a weight of with an expected thrust of at a speed of and altitude of the db 670 was abandoned due to the very low power weight ratio after a brief interlude studying pulse jets leist began work on what was to become the db007 previous design efforts in germany had investigated ducted fans turbofans by pass turbojets and contra rotating compressor spools but leist incorporated both into the

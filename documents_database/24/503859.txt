if a theory has gauge transformations it means that some physical properties of certain equations are preserved under those transformations likewise the gauge covariant derivative is the ordinary derivative modified in such a way as to make it behave like a true vector operator so that equations written using the covariant derivative preserve their physical properties under gauge transformations there are many ways in which to understand the gauge covariant derivative the approach taken in this article is based on the historically traditional notation used in many physics textbooks another approach is to understand the gauge covariant derivative as a kind of connection and more specifically an affine connection the affine connection is interesting because it does not require any concept of a metric tensor to be defined the curvature of an affine connection can be understood as the field strength of the gauge potential when a metric is available then one can go in a different direction and define a connection on a frame bundle this path leads directly to general relativity however it requires a metric which particle physics gauge theories do not have rather than being generalizations of one another affine and metric geometry go off in

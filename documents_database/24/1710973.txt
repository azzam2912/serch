schellackia is transmitted via insect vectors primarily mites and mosquitoes which take up the parasite in blood meals these vectors then subsequently infect reptilian and amphibian which consume the infected insects the parasites deform erythrocytes of the host into crescents and can be visualised using a blood smear the type species schellackia bolivari was described by anton reichenow in 1919 schellackia was first described by anton reichenow in 1919 with the type species schellackia bolivari having been discovered parasitizing the spiny footed lizard acanthodactylus erythrurus and the spanish psammodromus hispanicus within the iberian peninsula at first many difficulties in describing new species were present very few characteristics could be described from blood sporozoites within the primary host with most defining characteristics being restricted to the parasite s endogenous stages within the gut epithelium of the host this led to relatively few described species for a parasite genus that was supposedly very geographically widespread in more recent years however molecular characterisation methods have allowed more precise determination of species identity and their phylogenetic relationship as is typical of apicomplexans schellackia replicates via multiple fission the parasite utilises both merogony asexual and gametogony sexual with both processes occurring within the mucosal epithelium

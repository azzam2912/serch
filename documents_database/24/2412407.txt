its most notable characteristic is their extraordinary specificity they inactivate the ribosomes by cutting a single phosphodiester bond of the rrna that is found in a universally conserved sequence this cleavage leads to cell death by apoptosis however since they are extracellular proteins they must first enter the cells that constitute their target to exert their cytotoxic action this entry constitutes the rate determining step of their action no protein receptor has been found thus in order to penetrate the cells they must take advantage of changes in permeability and the biophysical properties of the membranes produced by phenomena such as tumour transformation or a viral infection this is the reason why sarcin the most representative member of the group was originally discovered as an antitumoural agent unfortunately it turned out not to be as safe as needed and the research in this field was temporarily abandoned one of the determining factors in this process of entry into cells appears to be their ability to interact with phospholipids whose polar headgroup shows a net negative electrical charge today it is known that ribotoxins constitute a broad family produced by many types of fungi with common characteristics that make them optimal

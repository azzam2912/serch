four different insect toxins namely aahit1 aahit2 aahit4 and aahit5 can be distinguished it targets insects except aahit4 which is also toxic to crustaceans and mammals the first three words of androctonus australis hector insect toxin stem from the greek words androctonus and hector and the latin word australis androctonus means man killer whereas hector has the meaning to hold or to possess and australis means south together constituting the southern man killer aahit can be found in the venom of the north african scorpion androctonus australis hector also known as the sahara scorpion there are four different forms of aah insect toxins aahit1 aahit2 aahit4 and aahit5 the amino acid sequence of aahit1 and aahit2 only differs at position 17 and 41 the homology between aahit4 and aahit5 is greater than with the primary structures of aahit1 or aahit2 aahit specifically affects the voltage gated sodium channels vgsc in insects the effect of the toxin is excitatory since it shifts the voltage dependent activation of the sodium channel to lower potentials this mode of action is comparable to those of beta toxins the insect specific trait most likely derives from the presence of a specific structured loop in the

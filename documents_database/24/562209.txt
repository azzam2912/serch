pershan is a prominent american physicist peter pershan earned his b s at polytechnic institute of brooklyn in 1956 and his ph d in physics at harvard university in 1960 for nuclear magnetic resonance under the supervision of nicolaas bloembergen after a short postdoctoral appointment with bloembergen he was appointed an assistant professor at harvard university where he is now a frank b baird jr professor of science at both physics department and division of engineering and applied sciences pershan began his career in nuclear magnetic resonance however before moving on to other things he and bloembergen produced some of the first papers on non linear optics a field for which bloembergen later received nobel prize in physics in 1981 he remained active in this field until the early 1980s when he wrote a book on liquid crystals and moved into the then new field of synchrotron radiation along with jens als nielsen pershan developed the first synchrotron x ray reflectometer for the study of the horizontal free surface of a liquid and carried out the first synchrotron measurements on liquid surfaces at hasylab desy in 1982 the liquid surface spectrometers now at advanced photon source and the national synchrotron

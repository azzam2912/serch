1510 1520 february 23 1572 was a french composer of the renaissance he was a representative of the generation after josquin and mouton and was influential in the late development of the french chanson most likely he was born in melun but he lived most of his life in paris the earliest records of his life date from 1527 when he was in the service of the king in 1530 he was charged with playing ball at notre dame cathedral as well as refusing to go to a service both dangerous irreverences that almost cost him prison time but he was young enough to be forgiven from this event a birthdate between 1510 and 1520 can be inferred in 1536 he became a master of choristers at the sainte chapelle choir and he remained at this post with a few additional benefices for the rest of his life another post he held late in his life concurrently with his activity in paris was as canon at the cathedral in melun he seems to have helped organize many grand entertainments and doubtless composed many of his works for them most likely he was a close friend of the more famous composer

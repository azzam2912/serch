ferrierite mg and ferrierite k are orthorhombic minerals and ferrierite na is monoclinic with highly variable cationic composition na k mg si al o oh 9ho calcium and other ions are often also present they are found in vitreous to pearly often radiating spherical aggregates of thin blade shaped transparent to translucent crystals ferrierite typically occurs as an alteration mineral in basaltic rocks and in tuffaceous sediments in north america it is found at kamloops lake bc canada the original type locality and leavitt lake california ferrierite was named for canadian geologist and mining engineer walter frederick ferrier 1865 1950 synthetic ferrierites have even greater cation variability and have important uses as commercial filters and ion exchange beds ferrierite h can be used as a catalyst in the chemical industry for the acid catalyzed skeletal isomerization of n butenes to isobutene the raw material for production of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe the hydrophobic all silica ferrierite si fer has very high selectivity in the separation of alcohol water mixtures due to the very restrictive shape and space constraints of the fer framework type at high pressure si fer can achieve the separation of an ethanol water liquid mixture into

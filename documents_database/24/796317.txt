food or living space this can be contrasted with mutualism a type of symbiosis competition between members of the same species is called intraspecific competition if a tree species in a dense forest grows taller than surrounding tree species it is able to absorb more of the incoming sunlight however less sunlight is then available for the trees that are shaded by the taller tree thus interspecific competition leopards and lions can also be in interspecific competition since both species feed on the same prey and can be negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food competition is only one of many interacting biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure moreover competition is not always a straightforward direct interaction interspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area if the resource cannot support both populations then lowered fecundity growth or survival may result in at least one species interspecific competition has the potential to alter populations communities and the evolution of interacting species on an individual organism level competition can occur as interference or exploitative competition direct competition has been observed between individuals populations

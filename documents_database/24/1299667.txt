it has a wide spectrum of cytolytic activity it is among other toxins produced by s aureus and is part of the phenol soluble modulin peptide family its alpha helical amphipathic structure gives it detergent like properties allowing it to disrupt and attach to the cytoplasmic membrane of a cell non specifically without a receptor and integrate into the membrane delta toxin degrades the membrane on contact and forms short lived pores causing cell lysis and subsequent cell death s aureus delta toxin is encoded for by the hld gene the hld gene of which the 3 end encodes for delta toxin is involved in the accessory gene regulator agr system this system controls the signaling and creation of cell associated and secreted virulence factors delta toxin is also secreted from s aureus without a signal peptide but the toxin itself has been speculated to make an effective signal peptide the s aureus delta toxin molecule has been speculated to oligomerize and form cation selective ion channels in the membrane for use other than cell lysis by the toxin the channel is proposed to be formed by six delta toxin molecules in a hexagonal arrangement staphylococcus aureus delta toxin is

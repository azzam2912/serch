synthesis gas is a useful product but requires careful handling due to its flammability and the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning the water gas shift reaction can be used to reduce the carbon monoxide while producing additional hydrogen resulting in water gas synthesis gas is made by passing steam over a red hot carbon fuel such as coke the reaction is endothermic so the fuel must be continually re heated to keep the reaction going in order to do this an air stream which alternates with the vapor stream is introduced for the combustion of carbon to take place theoretically to make 6 l of water gas 5 l of air is required or alternatively to prevent contamination with nitrogen energy can be provided by using pure oxygen to burn carbon into carbon monoxide in this case 1 l of oxygen will create 5 3 l of pure water gas the water gas shift reaction was discovered by italian physicist felice fontana in 1780 water gas was made in england from 1828 by blowing steam through white hot coke in 1873 thaddeus s c lowe developed and patented the water gas process by which large amounts of hydrogen gas could

this security issue has been mitigated by emulating a virtual system call but the emulation introduces additional latency vdso uses standard mechanisms for linking and loading i e standard executable and linkable format elf format vdso is a memory area allocated in user space which exposes some kernel functionalities vdso is dynamically allocated offers improved safety through memory space randomization and supports more than 4 system calls vdso links are provided via the glibc library if the kernel does not have vdso support a traditional syscall is made vdso helps to reduce the calling overhead on simple kernel routines and it also can work as a way to select the best system call method on some computer architectures such as ia 32 an advantage over other methods is that such exported routines can provide proper dwarf debug with attributed record format debugging information implementation generally implies hooks in the dynamic linker to find the vdsos

the autoregressive model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on its own previous values and on a stochastic term an imperfectly predictable term thus the model is in the form of a stochastic difference equation together with the moving average ma model it is a special case and key component of the more general arma and arima models of time series which have a more complicated stochastic structure it is also a special case of the vector autoregressive model var which consists of a system of more than one interlocking stochastic difference equation in more than one evolving random variable contrary to the moving average model the autoregressive model is not always stationary as it may contain a unit root the notation formula 1 indicates an autoregressive model of order p the ar p model is defined as where formula 3 are the parameters of the model formula 4 is a constant and formula 5 is white noise this can be equivalently written using the backshift operator b as so that moving the summation term to the left side and using polynomial notation we have an autoregressive model can thus be viewed as the output of an all pole

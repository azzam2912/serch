neurogenic means that the problem originates with a problem at a nerve and claudication from the latin for limp because the patient feels a painful cramping or weakness in the legs nc should therefore be distinguished from vascular claudication which is when the claudication stems from a circulatory problem not a neural problem neurogenic claudication may present in one or both legs and usually presents as some combination of discomfort pain numbness and weakness in the calves buttocks and or thighs in some patients it is precipitated by walking and prolonged standing the pain is classically relieved by a change in position or flexion of the waist although a flexed position may also potentially relieve symptoms resting typically offers the greatest relief of pain therefore patients with neurogenic intermittent claudication have less disability in climbing steps pushing carts and cycling this is because those movements flex the lumbar spine and the vertebral foramen widens the pathophysiology is thought to be ischemia of the lumbosacral nerve roots secondary to compression from surrounding structures hypertrophied facets ligamentum flavum bone spurs scar tissue and bulging or herniated discs in addition to vascular claudication pseudo trochanteric bursitis should be considered in differential diagnosis

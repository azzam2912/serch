this family exhibits a highly conserved structure of alpha helices and a highly conserved 110 amino acid dna binding domain the fox proteins have been shown to play critical roles in the development and formation of many important organ systems foxl2 is responsible in part for the formation of eyelids pituitary and formation and maintenance of ovaries mutations in the foxl2 gene as well as mutations in distal regulatory elements in humans and other organisms lead to the condition blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome bpes of which there are two kinds based on phenotype expressed type i bpes presents with premature ovarian failure pof in addition to a pronounced eyelid malformation type ii bpes lacks the pof condition but retains the eyelid malformation foxl2 is a 376 amino acid protein encoded by a single exon gene of 2 7kb the encoded protein contains a highly conserved 110 amino acid forkhead box dna binding domain for which it was names this forkhead domain consists of a helix turn helix motif made primarily by three alpha helices and two large loops or wings as they are sometimes called one of the interesting features of the forkhead domain is also a 14 amino

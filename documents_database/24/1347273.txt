they are basic summary statistics used in descriptive statistics such as the five number summary and bowley s seven figure summary and the associated box plot the minimum and the maximum value are the first and last order statistics often denoted x and x respectively for a sample size of n if the sample has outliers they necessarily include the sample maximum or sample minimum or both depending on whether they are extremely high or low however the sample maximum and minimum need not be outliers if they are not unusually far from other observations the sample maximum and minimum are the least robust statistics they are maximally sensitive to outliers this can either be an advantage or a drawback if extreme values are real not measurement errors and of real consequence as in applications of extreme value theory such as building dikes or financial loss then outliers as reflected in sample extrema are important on the other hand if outliers have little or no impact on actual outcomes then using non robust statistics such as the sample extrema simply cloud the statistics and robust alternatives should be used such as other quantiles the 10th and 90th percentiles first and

this true sociality in animals in which sterile individuals work to further the reproductive success of others is found in termites ambrosia beetles gall dwelling aphids thrips marine sponge dwelling shrimp synalpheus regalis naked mole rats heterocephalus glaber and the insect order hymenoptera which includes bees wasps and ants the fact that eusociality has evolved so often in the hymenoptera between 8 and 11 times but remains rare throughout the rest of the animal kingdom has made its evolution a topic of debate among evolutionary biologists eusocial organisms at first appear to behave in stark contrast with simple interpretations of darwinian evolution passing on one s genes to the next generation or fitness is a central idea in evolutionary biology current theories propose that the evolution of eusociality occurred either due to kin selection proposed by w d hamilton or by the competing theory of multilevel selection as proposed by e o wilson and colleagues no single trait or model is sufficient to explain the evolution of eusociality and most likely the pathway to eusociality involved a combination of pre conditions ecological factors and genetic influences eusociality can be characterized by four main criteria overlapping generations cooperative brood care philopatry

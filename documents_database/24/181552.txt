it was first published in 1977 by astronomers r brent tully and j richard fisher the luminosity is calculated by multiplying the galaxy s apparent brightness by formula 1 where formula 2 is its distance from us and the spectral line width is measured using long slit spectroscopy several different forms of the tfr exist depending on which precise measures of mass luminosity or rotation velocity one takes it to relate tully and fisher used optical luminosity but subsequent work showed the relation to be tighter when defined using microwave to infrared k band radiation a good proxy for stellar mass and even tighter when luminosity is replaced by the galaxy s total baryonic mass the sum of its mass in stars and gas this latter form of the relation is known as the baryonic tully fisher relation btfr and states that baryonic mass is proportional to velocity to the power of roughly 3 5 4 the tfr can be used to estimate the distance to spiral galaxies by allowing the luminosity of a galaxy to be derived from its directly measurable line width the distance can then be found by comparing the luminosity to the apparent brightness thus the

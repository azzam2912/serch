the most prominent example is photosynthesis although chemosynthesis is another form of carbon fixation that can take place in the absence of sunlight organisms that grow by fixing carbon are called autotrophs autotrophs include photoautotrophs which synthesize organic compounds using the energy of sunlight and lithoautotrophs which synthesize organic compounds using the energy of inorganic oxidation heterotrophs are organisms that grow using the carbon fixed by autotrophs the organic compounds are used by heterotrophs to produce energy and to build body structures fixed carbon reduced carbon and organic carbon are equivalent terms for various organic compounds it is estimated that approximately 258 billion tons of carbon dioxide are converted by photosynthesis annually the majority of the fixation occurs in marine environments especially areas of high nutrients the gross amount of carbon dioxide fixed is much larger since approximately 40 is consumed by respiration following photosynthesis given the scale of this process it is understandable that rubisco is the most abundant protein on earth six autotrophic carbon fixation pathways are known as of 2011 the calvin cycle fixes carbon in the chloroplasts of plants and algae and in the cyanobacteria it also fixes carbon in the anoxygenic photosynthetic in one type

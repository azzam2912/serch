this test has limited value for most people experiencing infertility in this test sperm are incubated with several hamster eggs after seven to twenty hours the number of sperm penetrations per egg is measured the hamster eggs have had the zona pellucida the outer membrane removed hence zona free having all eggs penetrated by multiple sperm is considered to be a positive sign for fertility results suggest that men whose sperm fail the hamster test are a third as fertile than those whose sperm pass donated sperm and intracytoplasmic sperm injection techniques are considered more strongly for those whose sperm fail this test contrary to some assertions by medical professionals if the human sperm penetrates the hamster egg a hybrid embryo is indeed created the resulting hamster hybrid is known as a humster these embryos are typically destroyed before they divide into two cells and are never known to have been implanted in either a hamster or human uterus to develop this test evaluates the acrosome reaction of human spermatozoa however the incidence of acrosome reaction in freely swimming human sperm does not accurately reflect the fertilizing ability of the sperm the practice is made licensable in the united kingdom

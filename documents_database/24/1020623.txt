companies such as iogen poet dupont and abengoa are building refineries that can process biomass and turn it into bioethanol companies such as diversa novozymes and dyadic are producing enzymes that could enable a cellulosic ethanol future the shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players from farmers to biotechnology firms and from project developers to investors as of 2013 the first commercial scale plants to produce cellulosic biofuels have begun operating multiple pathways for the conversion of different biofuel feedstocks are being used in the next few years the cost data of these technologies operating at commercial scale and their relative performance will become available lessons learnt will lower the costs of the industrial processes involved cellulosic ethanol can be produced from a diverse array of feedstocks such as wood pulp from trees or any plant matter instead of taking the grain from wheat and grinding that down to get starch and gluten then taking the starch cellulosic ethanol production involves the use of the whole crop this approach should increase yields and reduce the carbon footprint because the amount of energy intensive fertilisers and fungicides will remain

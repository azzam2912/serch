under suitable assumptions on the priors kriging gives the best linear unbiased prediction of the intermediate values interpolating methods based on other criteria such as smoothness e g smoothing spline need not yield the most likely intermediate values the method is widely used in the domain of spatial analysis and computer experiments the technique is also known as wiener kolmogorov prediction after norbert wiener and andrey kolmogorov the theoretical basis for the method was developed by the french mathematician georges matheron in 1960 based on the master s thesis of danie g krige the pioneering plotter of distance weighted average gold grades at the witwatersrand reef complex in south africa krige sought to estimate the most likely distribution of gold based on samples from a few boreholes the english verb is to krige and the most common noun is kriging both are often pronounced with a hard g following the pronunciation of the name krige the word is sometimes capitalized as kriging in the literature the basic idea of kriging is to predict the value of a function at a given point by computing a weighted average of the known values of the function in the neighborhood of the point

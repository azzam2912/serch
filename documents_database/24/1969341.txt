a lattice path may lie in any lattice in formula 8 but the integer lattice formula 2 is most commonly used an example of a lattice path in formula 10 of length 5 with steps in formula 11 is formula 12 a north east ne lattice path is a lattice path in formula 10 with steps in formula 14 the formula 15 steps are called north steps and denoted by formula 16 s the formula 17 steps are called east steps and denoted by formula 18 s ne lattice paths most commonly begin at the origin this convention allows us to encode all the information about a ne lattice path formula 19 in a single permutation word the length of the word gives us the number of steps of the lattice path formula 3 the order of the formula 16 s and formula 18 s communicates the sequence of formula 19 furthermore the number of formula 16 s and the number of formula 18 s in the word determines the end point of formula 19 if the permutation word for a ne lattice path contains formula 27 formula 16steps and formula 29 formula 18 steps and if the path begins

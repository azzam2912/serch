it asymptomatically infects the parasitic braconid wasp dinocampus coccinellae and has been proposed to be associated with the paralytic effect the wasp has on its host the spotted lady beetle coleomegilla maculata which it turns into a so called zombie bodyguard for its pupa within the family iflaviridae the dcpv genome is most closely related to venturia canescens picorna like virus and nasonia vitripennis virus 1 it has not yet been assigned to a genus dcpv has been found in d coccinellae from canada japan poland and the netherlands dcpv s 10 138 nucleotide linear rna has a single large open reading frame predicted to encode a 3007 residue polyprotein with non structural helicase protease and rna dependent rna polymerase functions in the c terminal portion and four structural proteins vp1 4 in the n terminal portion the 5 non translated region contains cloverleaf and hairpin structures similar to those present in picornaviruses and other picorna like viruses the virus particle is around 27 nm in diameter dcpv has not been detected in d coccinellae eggs after hatching the level of the virus genome increases throughout the larval stages where active viral replication is thought to occur higher levels are

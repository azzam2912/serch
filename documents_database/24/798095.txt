it is designed to do the heavy lifting and tedious tasks that are repetitive and process heavy using microservices a user can reuse manipulate and integrate with warewolf services across locations and with many other systems making automating of manual processes a breeze using drag and drop and custom pre built tools and connectors users can build systems for business integrate with existing systems develop apis and automate business processes efficiently warewolf allows developers to create their microservices in its own graphical user interface gui environment as opposed to coding every detail currently positioned in the niche quadrant on g2crowds best low code platforms warewolf enables front end applications to perform heavy back end tasks warewolf currently services only back end development and focuses on business logic automation business processes and integration in the opinion of the code project the platform comes into category of workflow or node based programming the drag and drop tools in the platform allow for quick configuring of connections and logic flows while the automated process handles web services definitions database calls and taps windows dlls or the command line directly the platform includes a visual debugger which allows the developer to inspect execution streams

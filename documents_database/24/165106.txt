a methyl group is added to gaa from the amino acid methionine by the enzyme gamt forming non phosphorylated creatine this is then released into the blood by the liver where it travels mainly to the muscle cells 95 of the body s creatine is in muscles and to a lesser extent the brain heart and pancreas once inside the cells it is transformed into phosphocreatine by the enzyme complex creatine kinase which makes it able to donate its phosphate group to convert adenosine diphosphate adp into adenosine triphosphate atp this process is an important component of all vertebrates bioenergetic systems for instance while the human body only produces 250g of atp daily it recycles its entire body weight in atp each day through creatine phosphate creatine phosphate can be broken down into creatinine which is then excreted in the urine a 70 kg man contains around 120g of creatine with 40 being the unphosphorylated form and 60 as creatine phosphate of that amount 1 2 is broken down and excreted each day as creatinine phosphocreatine is used intravenously in hospitals in some parts of the world for cardiovascular problems under the name neoton and also used by some professional

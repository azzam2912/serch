the revolutionary frame is an advanced aerofoil cross section using a carbon composite monocoque the use of monocoque frames for bikes was not new but their development was improved through the work of norfolk based designer mike burrows who advanced both the design and build through utilising carbon fibre mouldings burrows s design was initially rejected by british cycling manufacturers however it was to be received more enthusiastically by the british cycling federation the design was considered illegal by the uci therefore the project was prematurely shelved in 1987 three years later in 1990 the union cycliste internationale uci revoked its previous ban on monocoques by this time mike burrows had lost enthusiasm for the concept and was focusing his attention on recumbent bicycles however his mk2 monocoque caught the attention of a keen local cyclist and lotus engineering employee rudy thomann aware of the revocation of the ban thomann took burrows s design to lotus engineering and presented it to his boss roger becker roger could immediately see the potential of the design not only did it offer the opportunity for lotus to utilize its expertise and diversify into a new market but it also offered a moral lift

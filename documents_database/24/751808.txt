finkelstein published by the university of california press in august 2005 finkelstein s doctoral dissertation was to disassemble a book by joan peters from time immemorial 1984 which claimed that palestine had been largely empty in the early 20th century and that both jewish and arab ethnic groups were immigrants finkelstein declared the book a fraud two decades later finkelstein saw the record of the israel palestine conflict as much less complex than previously finkelstein claims that the official zionist exodus version that arab radio broadcasts had instructed the palestinians to flee has been largely swept away he believes that proof of this became available in the 1960s but had little impact in the late 1980s however some studies including some by israelis claimed to dispel much of what finkelstein refers to as the zionist mythology enveloping the origins of the conflict some scholarly debate now focuses on much narrower questions such as whether what in finkelstein s view was ethnic cleansing was the intentional consequence of zionist policy or the unintentional by product of the 1948 arab israeli war the topic remains controversial particularly in israel where mainstream historians continue to dispute the view of israel s 1948 war

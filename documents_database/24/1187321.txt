it was named for the japanese town of yorii location of the discovering observatory yorii orbits the sun in the outer main belt at a distance of 2 3 3 8 au once every 5 years and 4 months 1 960 days its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 25 and an inclination of 6 with respect to the ecliptic it was first identified as at purple mountain observatory in 1966 extending the body s observation arc by 22 years prior to its official discovery observation at yorii yorii has been characterized as a carbonaceous c type asteroid by panstarrs photometric survey in october 2013 american astronomer brian warner obtained a rotational lightcurve of yorii from photometric observations taken at his palmer divide observatory colorado lightcurve analysis gave a well defined rotation period of 6 669 hours with a brightness variation of 0 26 magnitude according to the survey carried out by nasa s wide field infrared survey explorer with its subsequent neowise mission yorii measures between 9 36 and 12 44 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0 091 and 0 104 the collaborative asteroid lightcurve link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of

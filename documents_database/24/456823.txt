the retarded time is the time when the field began to propagate from the point where it was emitted to an observer the term retarded is used in this context and the literature in the sense of propagation delays the calculation of the retarded time t or t is nothing more than a simple speed distance time calculation for em fields if the em field is radiated at position vector r within the source charge distribution and an observer at position r measures the em field at time t the time delay for the field to travel from the charge distribution to the observer is r r c so subtracting this delay from the observer s time t gives the time when the field actually began to propagate the retarded time t which can be rearranged to showing how the positions and times correspond to source and observer another related concept is the advanced time t which takes the same mathematical form as above but with a instead of a and is so called since this is the time the field will advance from the present time t corresponding to retarded and advanced times are retarded and advanced potentials the

mitochondria from donor cells are transported and incorporated into the endogenous mitochondrial network of recipient cells contributing to changes in the bioenergetics profile and in other functional properties of recipient cells horizontal cell to cell transfer of mitochondria and mitochondrial genome can occur among mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo mitochondrial transfer supports the exogenous replacement of damaged mitochondria thereby rescuing mitochondrial defects stem cells immortalized cells or primary cells are usually used as mitochondrial donors in most studies these cells may transfer mitochondria to surrounding cells in their niche thus affecting cell differentiation proliferation tissue homeostasis development and ageing horizontal transfer of mitochondria is mediated by actin rich membrane protrusions named tunneling nanotubes tnts the establishment of a nanotube begins with the formation of a filopodium like membrane protrusion that retracts after reaching the recipient cell leaving an ultrafine structure that is separated from the substrate chemical inhibitors or mechanical stress impairs the formation of tnts and reduces mitochondrial exchange on the other hand certain types of stress agents such as doxorubicin or ethidium bromide increase tnt formation other proposed mechanisms of transfer include membrane microvesicles cell fusion or mitochondrial extrusion the first evidence of functional mitochondrial transfer

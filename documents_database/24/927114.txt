lpboost maximizes a margin between training samples of different classes and hence also belongs to the class of margin maximizing supervised classification algorithms consider a classification function which classifies samples from a space formula 2 into one of two classes labelled 1 and 1 respectively lpboost is an algorithm to learn such a classification function given a set of training examples with known class labels lpboost is a machine learning technique and especially suited for applications of joint classification and feature selection in structured domains as in all boosting classifiers the final classification function is of the form where formula 4 are non negative weightings for weak classifiers formula 5 each individual weak classifier formula 6 may be just a little bit better than random but the resulting linear combination of many weak classifiers can perform very well lpboost constructs formula 7 by starting with an empty set of weak classifiers iteratively a single weak classifier to add to the set of considered weak classifiers is selected added and all the weights formula 8 for the current set of weak classifiers are adjusted this is repeated until no weak classifiers to add remain the property that all classifier weights are

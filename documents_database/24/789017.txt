the presence of pvl is associated with increased virulence of certain strains isolates of staphylococcus aureus it is present in the majority of community associated methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ca mrsa isolates studied and is the cause of necrotic lesions involving the skin or mucosa including necrotic hemorrhagic pneumonia pvl creates pores in the membranes of infected cells pvl is produced from the genetic material of a bacteriophage that infects staphylococcus aureus making it more virulent it was initially discovered by van develde in 1894 due to its ability to lyse leukocytes it was named after sir philip noel panton and francis valentine when they associated it with soft tissue infections in 1932 exotoxins such as pvl constitute essential components of the virulence mechanisms of s aureus nearly all strains secrete lethal factors that convert host tissues into nutrients required for bacterial growth pvl is a member of the synergohymenotropic toxin family that induces pores in the membranes of cells the pvl factor is encoded in a prophage designated as pvl which is a virus integrated into the s aureus bacterial chromosome its genes secrete two proteins toxins designated luks pv and lukf pv 33 and 34 kda in size

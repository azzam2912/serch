compact groups are a natural generalization of finite groups with the discrete topology and have properties that carry over in significant fashion compact groups have a well understood theory in relation to group actions and representation theory in the following we will assume all groups are hausdorff spaces lie groups form a very nice class of topological groups and the compact lie groups have a particularly well developed theory basic examples of compact lie groups include the classification theorem of compact lie groups states that up to finite extensions and finite covers this exhausts the list of examples which already includes some redundancies this classification is described in more detail in the next subsection given any compact lie group g one can take its identity component g which is connected the quotient group g g is the group of components g which must be finite since g is compact we therefore have a finite extension meanwhile for connected compact lie groups we have the following result thus the classification of connected compact lie groups can in principle be reduced to knowledge of the simply connected compact lie groups together with information about their centers for information about the center see

spec benchmarks are widely used to evaluate the performance of computer systems the test results are published on the spec website spec evolved into an umbrella organization encompassing four diverse groups graphics and workstation performance group gwpg the high performance group hpg the open systems group osg and the newest the research group rg membership in spec is open to any interested company or entity that is willing to commit to spec s standards it allows the list of members is available on spec s membership page the benchmarks aim to test real life situations there are several benchmarks testing java scenarios from simple computation specjbb to a full system with java ee database disk and network specjenterprise the spec cpu suites test cpu performance by measuring the run time of several programs such as the compiler gcc the chemistry program gamess and the weather program wrf the various tasks are equally weighted no attempt is made to weight them based on their perceived importance an overall score is based on a geometric mean measuring and comparing the provisioning compute storage and network resources of iaas cloud platforms measuring and comparing combined performance of cpu memory and compiler measuring performance

the study of these traditional reptile orders historically combined with that of modern amphibians is called herpetology because some reptiles are more closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles e g crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards the traditional groups of reptiles listed above do not together constitute a monophyletic grouping or clade consisting of all descendants of a common ancestor for this reason many modern scientists prefer to consider the birds part of reptilia as well thereby making reptilia a monophyletic class including all living diapsids the earliest known proto reptiles originated around 312 million years ago during the carboniferous period having evolved from advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods that became increasingly adapted to life on dry land some early examples include the lizard like hylonomus and casineria in addition to the living reptiles there are many diverse groups that are now extinct in some cases due to mass extinction events in particular the cretaceous paleogene extinction event wiped out the pterosaurs plesiosaurs ornithischians and sauropods as well as many species of theropods including troodontids dromaeosaurids tyrannosaurids and abelisaurids along with many crocodyliformes and squamates e g mosasaurids modern non avian reptiles

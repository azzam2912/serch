the current holocene interglacial began at the end of the pleistocene about 11 700 years ago during the 2 5 million years of the pleistocene numerous glacials or significant advances of continental ice sheets in north america and europe have occurred at intervals of approximately 40 000 to 100 000 years the long glacial periods were separated by more temperate and shorter interglacials during interglacials such as the present one the climate warms and the tundra recedes polewards following the ice sheets forests return to areas that once supported tundra vegetation interglacials are identified on land or in shallow epicontinental seas by their paleontology floral and faunal remains of species pointing to temperate climate and indicating a specific age are used to identify particular interglacials commonly used are mammalian and molluscan species pollen and plant macro remains seeds and fruits however many other fossil remains may be helpful insects ostracods foraminifera diatoms etc recently ice cores and ocean sediment cores provide more quantitative and accurately dated evidence for temperatures and total ice volumes interglacials and glacials coincide with cyclic changes in the earth s orbit three orbital variations contribute to interglacials the first is a change in the earth s

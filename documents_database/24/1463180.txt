margary from lake erhai the type locality of margarya melanioides based on shell and radular morphology tchang tsi 1949 revised this genus for the first time and recognized seven distinct species he created two subgenera of margarya viz tchangmargarya and mabillemargarya the first molecular phylogeny showed that the genus margarya is polyphyletic and divided into three distinct clades combining study of comparative morphology and molecular phylogeny zhang et al revised the systematics of margarya and recognized eight genuine extant species however only four species were found belonging to margarya s str the rest species belonging to distinct genus tchangmargarya or anularya this genus appear to be endemic to dian lake erhai lake cibi lake jianhu lake xihu lake and lugu lake in yunnan province in the china there are 4 extant species and 4 fossil species of margarya s str margarya bicostata and margarya mansuyi are transferred to anularya margarya yangtsunghaiensis is transferred to tchangmargarya species within the genus margarya include 8 species species brought into synonymy the cladogram based on sequences of mitochondrial 16s ribosomal rna and cytochrome c oxidase i coi and nuclear its2 genes showing the phylogenic relationships of the genus margarya indicates that margarya is polyphyletic

at the 2001 census the total population of the community of llay including llay village was 4 905 reducing to 4 814 at the 2011 census prior to the 1960s llay was a coal mining village llay main colliery at one time the largest colliery in wales and after 1952 the deepest pit in the uk was a major employer for the area before its coal reserves were exhausted in 1966 llay first appears in mediaeval records as a hamlet a small settlement without a church of the township and manor of burton it later formed an outlying part of the parish of gresford but the relatively late growth of the village is shown by the fact that the first church service was not held there until 1916 and its church was not completed until 1925 llay was eventually made a separate parish in its own right in 1944 much of the growth of the village is connected with the development of coal mines particularly the llay main colliery it was first established by the industrialist sir arthur markham in 1913 but sinking of the shafts was interrupted by the first world war and by markham s death in 1916

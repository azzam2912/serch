simcyp is based in sheffield uk simcyp s simulators allow in silico prediction of drug absorption distribution metabolism and excretion adme and potential drug drug interactions simcyp s r d activities focus on the development of algorithms along with population and drug databases for modelling and simulation m s of the absorption and disposition of drugs in patients and specific subgroups of patients across different age ranges the simcyp models use experimental data generated routinely during pre clinical drug discovery and development from in vitro enzyme and cellular systems as well as any relevant physico chemical attributes of the drug and dosage forms some details of the scientific background to simcyp approaches can be found in recent publications simcyp originally formed as a spin out company from the university of sheffield uk the company operates the simcyp consortium of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the consortium acts as a steering committee guiding scientific research and development at simcyp there is also close collaboration with regulatory bodies the u s food and drug administration swedish medical products agency nam ecvam and academic centres of excellence worldwide within the framework of the consortium simulator platforms include the simcyp population based adme simulator simcyp

the phenomenon is widely used for elemental analysis and chemical analysis particularly in the investigation of metals glass ceramics and building materials and for research in geochemistry forensic science archaeology and art objects such as paintings and murals when materials are exposed to short wavelength x rays or to gamma rays ionization of their component atoms may take place ionization consists of the ejection of one or more electrons from the atom and may occur if the atom is exposed to radiation with an energy greater than its ionization energy x rays and gamma rays can be energetic enough to expel tightly held electrons from the inner orbitals of the atom the removal of an electron in this way makes the electronic structure of the atom unstable and electrons in higher orbitals fall into the lower orbital to fill the hole left behind in falling energy is released in the form of a photon the energy of which is equal to the energy difference of the two orbitals involved thus the material emits radiation which has energy characteristic of the atoms present the term fluorescence is applied to phenomena in which the absorption of radiation of a specific energy results

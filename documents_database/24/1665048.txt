surface filters normally affect any phonetic combination that is not permitted according to the language s phonetic rules and so preserve the phonotactics of that language they are also often a source of complementary distribution between certain sets of sounds a trivial example of a surface filter is the replacement of sounds foreign to a language with sounds native to the language for example a language that has no front rounded vowels may replace such vowels with either front unrounded or back rounded vowels whenever it borrows a word containing such a vowel strictly speaking that is not a surface filter as it is merely the way in which the phonetics of one language are matched to that of another that example however still illustrates the importance of surface filters in preserving the phonological structure of words within the language usually the term applies only to rules that affect both native and borrowed words one very common example of a surface filter is final obstruent devoicing in which a voiced obstruent at the end of a word is automatically converted to their unvoiced counterpart if that were a regular sound change the devoicing would occur only at a particular point

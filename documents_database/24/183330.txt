it was developed at the university of california berkeley designed by thomas anderson and is used by numerous schools around the world originally written in c for mips nachos runs as a user process on a host operating system a mips simulator executes the code for any user programs running on top of the nachos operating system ports of the nachos code exist for a variety of architectures in addition to the nachos code a number of assignments are provided with the nachos system the goal of nachos is to introduce students to concepts in operating system design and implementation by requiring them to implement significant pieces of functionality within the nachos system in nachos case operating system simulator simply means that you can run an os a guest os on top of another one the host os similar to bochs vmware it features emulation for which are there to run the nachos user space applications that means that you can write programs for nachos compile them with a real compiler an old gcc compiler that produces code for mips and run them the nachos kernel instead is compiled to the platform of the host os and thus runs natively

the compound is a beige solid ntda is most commonly used as a precursor to naphthalenediimides ndis such as napthalenetetracarboxylic diimide a family of compounds with many uses naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride is prepared by oxidation of pyrene typical oxidants are chromic acid and chlorine the unsaturated tetrachloride hydrolyzes to enols that tautomerize to the bis dione which in turn can be oxidized to the tetracarboxylic acid symmetrical naphthalene diimides are synthesized by the condensation reaction of primary amines and the dianhydride unsymmetrical derivatives i e those derived from two different amines are obtained by hydrolysis of one of the two anhydride groups prior to the condensation with the first amine these diimides are members of a broader class of compounds called rylenes oligomers of naphthalene with bonds between the 1 and 1 and 8 and 8 positions the resulting materials have rigidly planar highly conjugated cores they exhibit good processing characteristics for fabrication of soft electronic devices aside from the ndis other members include the diimide derivatives of perylene 3 4 9 10 tetracarboxylic dianhydride and terrylene 3 4 11 12 tetracarboxylic dianhydride naphthalene diimides ndis are often fluorescent although the intensity is sensitive to substituents ndis are also redox active

it was discovered by german french astronomer hermann mayer salomon goldschmidt on october 26 1854 and is named after p m na the roman goddess of fruit trees photometric observations of this asteroid gave a light curve with a synodic rotation period of 9 448 hours the data was used to construct a model for the asteroid revealing it to be an angular object that is spinning about a pole with ecliptic coordinates 58 267 the ratio of the major to minor axes lengths is roughly equal to 1 3 the spectrum of 32 pomona matches an s type in the tholen classification system and is similar to primitive achondrite meteorites measurements of the thermal inertia of 32 pomona give a value of around 20 120 m k s compared to 50 for lunar regolith and 400 for coarse sand in an atmosphere australian amateur astronomer jonathan bradshaw recorded an unusual asteroid occultation by 32 pomona on 16 august 2008 the expected maximum duration of the occultation was 7 1 secs however the video recording shows two separate occultations of equal depth each lasting 1 2 seconds separated by 0 8 secs those durations convert to chord lengths at the

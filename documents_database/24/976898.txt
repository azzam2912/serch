such a quadratic form can given a suitable choice of basis be applied to a vector giving for euclidean spaces implying that the quadratic form is positive definite when is an isotropic quadratic form note that if and then so that is a null vector in a pseudo euclidean space with unlike in a euclidean space there exist vectors with negative magnitude as with the term euclidean space pseudo euclidean space may refer to either an affine space or a vector space though the latter may also be referred to as a pseudo euclidean vector space see point vector distinction the geometry of a pseudo euclidean space is consistent in spite of a breakdown of the some properties of euclidean space most notably that it is not a metric space as explained below the affine structure is unchanged and thus also the concepts line plane and generally of an affine subspace flat as well as line segments a null vector is a vector for which the quadratic form is zero unlike in a euclidean space the vector can be non zero in which case it is orthogonal to itself if the quadratic form is indefinite a pseudo euclidean space has

smith et al 2007 the foundry is concerned with establishing a set of principles for ontology development with the goal of creating a suite of orthogonal interoperable reference ontologies in the biomedical domain the foundry approach has been adopted by the monarch initiative the neuroscience information framework nif standard and by the crop common reference ontologies for plants initiatives the foundry initiative rests on the belief that the value of data is greatly enhanced when it exists in a form that allows it to be integrated with other data one approach to integration is through the annotation of multiple bodies of data using common controlled vocabularies ideally such controlled vocabularies take the form of ontologies which means that they are constructed in such a way as to support logical reasoning over the data annotated in their terms the success of this general approach in helping to tame the explosive proliferation of data in the biomedical domain most conspicuously through the work of the gene ontology consortium has led to the development of certain proposed principles of good practice in ontology development which are now being put into practice within the framework of the open biomedical ontologies consortium through its obo

tetrahedra do not tile space and an upper bound below 100 namely 1 2 6 10 has been reported aristotle claimed that tetrahedra could fill space completely in 2006 conway and torquato showed that a packing fraction about 72 can be obtained by constructing a non bravais lattice packing of tetrahedra with multiple particles with generally different orientations per repeating unit and thus they showed that the best tetrahedron packing cannot be a lattice packing with one particle per repeating unit such that each particle has a common orientation these packing constructions almost doubled the optimal bravais lattice packing fraction 36 73 obtained by hoylman in 2007 and 2010 chaikin and coworkers experimentally showed that tetrahedron like dice can randomly pack in a finite container up to a packing fraction between 75 and 76 in 2008 chen was the first to propose a packing of hard regular tetrahedra that packed more densely than spheres demonstrating numerically a packing fraction of 77 86 a further improvement was made in 2009 by torquato and jiao who compressed chen s structure using a computer algorithm to a packing fraction of 78 2021 in mid 2009 haji akbari et al showed using mc simulations

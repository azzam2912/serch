this is a dna binding winged helix turn helix whth domain of about 65 amino acids present in metalloregulators of the dtxr mntr family the domain is named after corynebacterium diphtheriae dtxr an iron specific diphtheria toxin repressor and bacillus subtilis mntr a manganese transport regulator iron responsive metalloregulators such as dtxr and ider occur in gram positive bacteria of the high gc branch while manganese responsive metalloregulators like mntr are described in diverse genera of gram positive and gram negative bacteria and also in archaea the metalloregulators like dtxr mntr contain the dna binding dtxr type hthdomain usually in the n terminal part the c terminal part contains a dimerisation domain with two metal binding sites although the primary metal binding site is less conserved in the mn ii regulators fe ii regulated proteins contain an sh3 like domain as a c terminal extension which is absent in mn ii regulated mntr metal ion dependent regulators orchestrate the virulence of several important human pathogens the dtxr protein regulates the expression of diphtheria toxin in response to environmental iron concentrations furthermore dtxr and ider control iron uptake homeostasis of manganese which is an essential nutrient is regulated by mntr a

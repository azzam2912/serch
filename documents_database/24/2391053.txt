rise precisely tracks the location of the lander to measure how much mars axis wobbles as it orbits the sun these observations will provide new constraints the core radius and help determine whether the core of mars is mostly liquid and which other elements besides iron may be present this study will also help scientists understand why mars magnetic field is so weak as compared to earth s the mission launched on 5 may 2018 and landed on the surface of mars at elysium planitia on 26 november 2018 the principal investigator for rise is william folkner of jpl who led the 1997 investigation of mars core using the radio link between earth and nasa s mars pathfinder also included the sojourner rover rise uses the spacecraft s radio connection with earth to assess perturbations of mars rotation axis to within 10 centimeters these measurements can provide information about the size and composition of mars core the radio science equipment is largely the same as used for the mars exploration rover mission and it includes two medium gain horn antennas mgas on the lander deck and an x band radio transponder 8 ghz and transmitter inside the lander where electronics

databases have adopted a host of techniques to cope the initial history of database scalability was to provide service on ever smaller computers the first database management systems such as ims ran on mainframe computers the second generation including ingres informix sybase rdb and oracle emerged on minicomputers the third generation including dbase and oracle again ran on personal computers during the same period attention turned to handling more data and more demanding workloads one key software innovation in the late 1980s was to reduce update locking granularity from tables and disk blocks to individual rows this eliminated a critical scalability bottleneck as coarser locks could delay access to rows even though they were not directly involved in a transaction earlier systems were completely insensitive to increasing resources once software limitations had been addressed attention turned to hardware innovation occurred in many areas the first was to support multiprocessor computers this involved allowing multiple processors to handle database requests simultaneously without blocking each other this evolved into support for multi core processors a much more significant change involved allowing distributed transactions to affect data stored on separate computers using the two phase commit protocol establishing the shared nothing architecture still

analogous to a bit a ternary digit is a trit trinary digit one trit is equivalent to log 3 about 1 58496 bits of information although ternary most often refers to a system in which the three digits are all non negative numbers specifically and the adjective also lends its name to the balanced ternary system comprising the digits 1 0 and 1 used in comparison logic and ternary computers representations of integer numbers in ternary do not get uncomfortably lengthy as quickly as in binary for example decimal 365 or senary 1405 corresponds to binary 101101101 nine digits and to ternary 111112 six digits however they are still far less compact than the corresponding representations in bases such as decimalsee below for a compact way to codify ternary using nonary and septemvigesimal as for rational numbers ternary offers a convenient way to represent as same as senary as opposed to its cumbersome representation as an infinite string of recurring digits in decimal but a major drawback is that in turn ternary does not offer a finite representation for nor for etc because 2 is not a prime factor of the base as with base two one tenth decimal senary

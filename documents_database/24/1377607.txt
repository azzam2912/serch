the term was first coined by volker boehmer in a 1994 review to describe the chirality of calixarenes arising from their non planar structure in 3 d space this phenomenon was described as resulting from the absence of a place of symmetry or an inversion center in the molecule as a whole boehmer further explains this phenomenon by suggesting that if an inherently chiral calixarene macrocycle were opened up it would produce an achiral linear molecule there are two commonly used notations to describe a molecules inherent chirality cr cs arising from the notation used for classically chiral compounds with c denoting curvature and p m inherently chiral molecules like their classically chiral counterparts can be used in chiral host guest chemistry enantioselective synthesis and other applications there are naturally occurring inherently chiral molecules as well retinal a chromophore in rhodopsin exists in solution as a racemic pair of enantiomers due to the curvature of an achiral polyene chain after creating a series of traditionally chiral calixarenes through the addition of a chiral substituent group on the top or bottom rim of the macrocycle the first inherently chiral calixarenes were synthesized in 1982 though the molecules were not yet described

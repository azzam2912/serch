he became a student of guido castelnuovo who later became his brother in law and became an important member of the italian school of algebraic geometry he also worked on differential geometry he collaborated with castelnuovo corrado segre and francesco severi he had positions at the university of bologna and then the university of rome la sapienza he lost his position in 1938 when the fascist government enacted the leggi razziali racial laws which in particular banned jews from holding professorships in universities the enriques classification of complex algebraic surfaces up to birational equivalence was into five main classes and was background to further work until kunihiko kodaira reconsidered the matter in the 1950s the largest class in some sense was that of surfaces of general type those for which the consideration of differential forms provides linear systems that are large enough to make all the geometry visible the work of the italian school had provided enough insight to recognise the other main birational classes rational surfaces and more generally ruled surfaces these include quadrics and cubic surfaces in projective 3 space have the simplest geometry quartic surfaces in 3 spaces are now classified when non singular as cases of

cells and tissues of all types use ion fluxes to communicate electrically the charge carrier in bioelectricity is the ion charged atom and an electric current and field is generated whenever a net ion flux occur endogenous electric currents and fields ion fluxes and differences in resting potential across tissues comprise an ancient and highly conserved communicating and signaling system it functions alongside in series and in parallel to biochemical factors transcriptional networks and other physical forces to regulate the cell behavior and large scale patterning during embryogenesis regeneration cancer and many other processes developmental bioelectricity is a sub discipline of biology related to but distinct from neurophysiology and bioelectromagnetics developmental bioelectricity refers to the endogenous ion fluxes transmembrane and transepithelial voltage gradients and electric currents and fields produced and sustained in living cells and tissues this electrical activity is often used during embryogenesis regeneration and cancer it is one layer of the complex field of signals that impinge upon all cells in vivo and regulate their interactions during pattern formation and maintenance figure 1 this is distinct from neural bioelectricity classically termed electrophysiology which refers to the rapid and transient spiking in well recognized excitable cells like neurons and

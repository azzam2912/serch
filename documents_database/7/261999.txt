somites are bilaterally paired blocks of paraxial mesoderm that form along the anterior posterior axis of the developing embryo in segmented animals in vertebrates somites give rise to skeletal muscle cartilage tendons endothelium and dermis in somitogenesis somites form from the paraxial mesoderm a particular region of mesoderm in the neurulating embryo this tissue undergoes convergent extension as the primitive streak regresses or as the embryo gastrulates the notochord extends from the base of the head to the tail with it extend thick bands of paraxial mesoderm as the primitive streak continues to regress somites form from the paraxial mesoderm by budding off rostrally as somitomeres or whorls of paraxial mesoderm cells compact and separate into discrete bodies the periodic nature of these splitting events has led many to say to that somitogenesis occurs via a clock wavefront model in which waves of developmental signals cause the periodic formation of new somites these immature somites then are compacted into an outer layer the epithelium and an inner mass the mesenchyme the somites themselves are specified according to their location as the segmental paraxial mesoderm from which they form it itself determined by position along the anterior posterior axis before somitogenesis

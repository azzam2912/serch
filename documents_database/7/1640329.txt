although it has zero ozone depletion potential it has high global warming potential reported by the united states environmental protection agency epa as 3450 times that of carbon dioxide pentafluoroethane in a near zeotropic mixture with difluoromethane is known as r 410a a common replacement for various chlorofluorocarbons commonly known as freon in new refrigerant systems pentafluoroethane is also used as a fire suppression agent in fire suppression systems hfc 125 ecaro 25 fe 25 naf s 125 is a gaseous fire suppression agent which can be used in clean agent fire suppression systems it is generally used in situations where water from a fire sprinkler would damage expensive equipment or where water based fire protection is impractical such as museums banks clean rooms and hospitals hfc 125 does not deplete ozone odp 0 the hfc 125 clean agent is stored in a pressurized container and introduced into the hazard as a gas the agent is odorless colorless electrically non conductive non corrosive and leaves no residue it is used in occupied enclosed areas that contain high value assets hfc 125 suppresses fire by absorbing heat energy at its molecular level faster than the heat can be generated so the

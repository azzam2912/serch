mosaicism has been reported to be present in as high as 70 of cleavage stage embryos and 90 of blastocyst stage embryos derived from in vitro fertilization genetic mosaicism can result from many different mechanisms including chromosome nondisjunction anaphase lag and endoreplication anaphase lagging is the most common way by which mosaicism arises in the preimplantation embryo mosaicism can also result from a mutation in one cell during development in which the mutation is passed on to only its daughter cells therefore the mutation is only going to be present in a fraction of the adult cells genetic mosaics may often be confused with chimerism in which two or more genotypes arise in one individual similarly to mosaicism in chimerism though the two genotypes arise from the fusion of more than one fertilized zygote in the early stages of embryonic development rather than from a mutation or chromosome loss different types of mosaicism exist such as gonadal mosaicism restricted to the gametes or somatic mosaicism somatic mosaicism occurs when the somatic cells of the body are of more than one genotype in the more common mosaics different genotypes arise from a single fertilized egg cell due to mitotic errors at

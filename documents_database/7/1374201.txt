the original version consisted of alternating conductive and insulating layers of silicone rubber cut crosswise to expose the thin layers they provide high density redundant electrical paths for high reliability connections one of the first applications was connecting thin and fragile glass liquid crystal displays lcds to circuit boards in electronic devices as little current was required because of their flexibility they excel in shock and anti vibration applications they can create a gasket like seal for harsh environments conductor material possibilities include carbon silver and gold the length width and height may be specified as well as the stripe pitch frequently a recess with ribs is specified that captures and provides the elastomer reference surface for alignment while allowing the lateral dimension of the elastomer to increase as it is compressed with a deflection stop to control the final part separation and alignment pins for substrate alignment they are used in two ways a matrix version consists of short fine metallic wires 300 to 2 000 per square centimeter aligned parallel but not touching each other embedded in a rubber sheet the wires can either protrude slightly from the top and bottom of the rubber sheet or be curved

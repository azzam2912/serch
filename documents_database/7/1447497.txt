that has antiamnesic and other effects in animal studies with far greater potency than piracetam a number of related compounds are known such as sunifiram dm 235 and sapunifiram mn 19 unifiram has two enantiomers with the dextro form being the more active isomer it has been shown to reduce the duration of hypnosis induced by pentobarbital without impairing motor coordination no formal human studies with unifiram have been conducted unifiram is not patented and despite the lack of human and long term toxicity studies it is commonly sold online unifiram as well as sunifiram were assayed at a wide panel of sites including the most important receptors ion channels and transporters but showed no affinity for any of the sites they specifically did not bind to the glutamate gaba serotonin dopamine adrenergic histamine acetylcholine or opioid receptors at concentrations of up to 1 m in addition the drugs were tested on recombinant ampa receptors and showed no potentiation of the receptors indicating that they do not act as ampa receptor positive allosteric modulators however they were able to prevent the amnesia induced by the ampa receptor antagonist nbqx in the passive avoidance test suggesting that indirect downstream ampa receptor

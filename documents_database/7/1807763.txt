in all cases the strata are products of terrigenous non marine environments dominated by fluvial depositional and erosional systems rivers and streams the rocks found in and around wichita falls result from southwesterly flowing permian streams that deposited sands in channels and silts and clays on the surrounding floodplains calcium carbonate rich soils concurrently developed adjacent to these streams these were likely buried by further permian sedimentation and then lithified pleistocene erosion removed the younger rocks exposing the current strata exposures of sediments indicate that northeast flowing streams locally deposited silts clays sands and some gravels on the permian rocks these are subsequently modified by modern holocene stream erosion and deposition in the permian geologic period north central texas was a part of the western coastal zone of equatorial pangea a super continental land mass nearby uplifts and mountainous regions such as the muenster arch and red river uplift the wichita arubckle and ouachita mountains developed by the end of the pennsylvanian providing elevated topography to the north and east during the permian the rocks of the permian basin of west texas record a contemporaneous shallow inland sea the resulting topography provided northeast to southwest gradients for stream flow and

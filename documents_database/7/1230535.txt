located approximately away from earth it shines with an apparent visual magnitude 6 41 thus it can be seen by the naked eye under very favourable conditions its spectral classification is b2v meaning that it s a hot main sequence star emitting light approximately with a blackbody spectrum at an effective temperature of 18 090 k in the washington double star catalog hr 8768 has a faint optical companion star with an apparent magnitude of 9 88 from hr 8768 the separation has decreased from when it was discovered as a double in 1828 the two stars share the same hipparcos identifier hip 113802 and have very similar parallaxes and proper motions in 1979 the blue magnitude of hr 8768 was reported to vary by about 0 025 every 28 minutes such variability was not known for any class of variable but the position in the hertzsprung russell diagram at the main sequence low luminosity end of the same instability strip as the cephei stars would make high overtone radial pulsations the likely cause follow up studies failed to find the same rapid variations or any significant variations in brightness however hr 8768 was added to the general catalogue of

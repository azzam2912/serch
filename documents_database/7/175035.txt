an antifreeze mixture is used to achieve freezing point depression for cold environments common antifreezes increase the boiling point of the liquid allowing higher coolant temperature because water has good properties as a coolant water plus antifreeze is used in internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications such as hvac chillers and solar water heaters the purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes commercially both the additive pure concentrate and the mixture diluted solution are called antifreeze depending on the context careful selection of an antifreeze can enable a wide temperature range in which the mixture remains in the liquid phase which is critical to efficient heat transfer and the proper functioning of heat exchangers water was the original coolant for internal combustion engines it is cheap nontoxic and has a high heat capacity it however has only a 100 c liquid range and it expands upon freezing these problems are addressed by the development of alternative coolants with improved properties freezing and boiling points are colligative properties of a solution which depend on the concentration of dissolved substances hence salts lower the melting points of aqueous solutions salts

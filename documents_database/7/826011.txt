these lead compounds undergo more extensive optimization in a subsequent step of drug discovery called lead optimization lo the drug discovery process generally follows the following path that includes a hit to lead stage the hit to lead stage starts with confirmation and evaluation of the initial screening hits and is followed by synthesis of analogs hit expansion typically the initial screening hits display binding affinities for their biological target in the micromolar 10 molar concentration range through limited h2l optimization the affinities of the hits are often improved by several orders of magnitude to the nanomolar 10 m range the hits also undergo limited optimization to improve metabolic half life so that the compounds can be tested in animal models of disease and also to improve selectivity against other biological targets binding that may result in undesirable side effects on average only one in every 5 000 compounds that enters drug discovery to the stage of pre clinical development becomes an approved drug after hits are identified from a high throughput screen the hits are confirmed and evaluated using the following methods following hit confirmation several compound clusters will be chosen according to their characteristics in the previously defined

these single stranded dna or rna are commonly referred to as aptamers although selex has emerged as the most commonly used name for the procedure some researchers have referred to it as saab selected and amplified binding site and casting cyclic amplification and selection of targets selex was first introduced in 1990 in 2015 a special issue was published in the journal of molecular evolution in the honor of quarter century of the selex discovery the process begins with the synthesis of a very large oligonucleotide library consisting of randomly generated sequences of fixed length flanked by constant 5 and 3 ends that serve as primers for a randomly generated region of length n the number of possible sequences in the library is 4 n positions with four possibilities a t c g at each position the sequences in the library are exposed to the target ligand which may be a protein or a small organic compound and those that do not bind the target are removed usually by affinity chromatography or target capture on paramagnetic beads the bound sequences are eluted and amplified by pcr to prepare for subsequent rounds of selection in which the stringency of the elution

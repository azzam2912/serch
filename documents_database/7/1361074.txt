baglioni produced several innovations in the field of both inorganic and organic colloids baglioni is the author of more than 250 publications on books and largely diffused international journals he is also the author of 16 patents for the preparation of aqueous suspensions at high concentration of particulate for the therapy and photodynamic diagnosis of tumors for the conservation of the cultural heritage for the setup of a new process for the treatment of textile industrial waste for production of emulsions from bio crude oil for production of nanoparticles and novel nano coatings via flame spraying and using homogeneous and heterogeneous solutions within the broad field of modern colloid and surface chemistry his research is mainly concentrated into the following areas 1 self assembly of bio inspired surfactants nucleolipid and ascorbic acid derivatives and of biomolecules cyclodextrins 2 core shell nanostructures with tunable magnetic properties 3 inorganic nanophases applied to cultural heritage conservation and to nanocoating of materials building materials textiles etc 4 interaction potentials in protein solutions 5 nanostrucutured surfaces for biosensors application 6 additive effects on microstructure and hydration in cement pastes 7 confined water in inorganic and biological matrices baglioni is currently full professor of physical chemistry

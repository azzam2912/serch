they play a prominent role in quantum statistical mechanics and quantum field theory let formula 1 be a real vector space equipped with a nonsingular real antisymmetric bilinear form formula 2 i e a symplectic vector space the unital algebra generated by elements of formula 1 subject to the relations for any formula 6 in formula 1 is called the canonical commutation relations ccr algebra the uniqueness of the representations of this algebra when formula 1 is finite dimensional is discussed in the stone von neumann theorem if formula 1 is equipped with a nonsingular real symmetric bilinear form formula 2 instead the unital algebra generated by the elements of formula 1 subject to the relations for any formula 6 in formula 1 is called the canonical anticommutation relations car algebra there is a distinct but closely related meaning of ccr algebra called the ccr c algebra let formula 16 be a real symplectic vector space with nonsingular symplectic form formula 2 in the theory of operator algebras the ccr algebra over formula 16 is the unital c algebra generated by elements formula 19 subject to these are called the weyl form of the canonical commutation relations and in particular

was a major modem vendor during the 1980s although never as popular as the big three hayes u s robotics usr and telebit nevertheless microcom holds an important place in modem history for introducing the mnp error correction and compression protocols which were widely used under license by most modem manufacturers in the 1990s the company went public in 1987 compaq purchased publicly outstanding shares of the company in 1997 microcom was founded in 1980 by james m dow from data general in the mid 1980s several companies introduced new modems with various high speed features in order to differentiate themselves from the growing legion of hayes 1200 bit s clones that were flooding into the market developing such a protocol was not all that easy and generally required a fairly powerful and expensive microcontroller to handle the modulation for companies with limited resources entering this market was difficult microcom took another approach addressing the feature gap not through higher speeds but through additional capabilities they developed a series of protocols that implemented simple packet based file transfer protocols suitable for implementation on very simple microcontrollers the differences were primarily in how difficult the protocol was to implement with mnp

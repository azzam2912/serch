they are always restlessly swimming around and can vigorously protect their territory against intruders including divers especially when guarding their eggs during reproduction season their relatively small size makes them much less dangerous than the larger titan triggerfish of the same family both sexes guard territories some maintaining a territory for eight years or longer males holding territories for significantly longer than females a typical male territory may overlap with one to five female territories and their mating system is described as haremic although not much is known about this similar mating systems are seen in other balistidae species if a male or female is removed or disappears their territories are soon taken over by a new fish they reproduce repeatedly over their lifetimes pair spawning takes place around sunrise with the egg masses being attached to sand coral rubble or algae they hatch the same day around sunset although paternal care is normal in teleost fishes with external fertilization it is the mothers in this species that guard and care for eggs until they hatch the mother remains above the eggs for about 12 14 hours fanning the eggs with her pectoral fins to improve aeration for perhaps 30

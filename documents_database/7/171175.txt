it is one of the two components of starch the other being amylose glucose units are linked in a linear way with 1 4 glycosidic bonds branching takes place with 1 6 bonds occurring every 24 to 30 glucose units resulting in a soluble molecule that can be quickly degraded as it has many end points onto which enzymes can attach in contrast amylose contains very few 1 6 bonds or even none at all this causes amylose to be hydrolyzed more slowly but have higher density and be insoluble its counterpart in animals is glycogen which has the same composition and structure but with more extensive branching that occurs every eight to 12 glucose units plants store starch within specialized organelles called amyloplasts when energy is needed for cell work the plant hydrolyzes the starch releasing the glucose subunits humans and other animals that eat plant foods also use amylase an enzyme that assists in breaking down amylopectin starch is made of about 80 85 amylopectin by weight though it varies depending on the source higher in medium grain rice to 100 in glutinous rice waxy potato starch and waxy corn and lower in long grain rice amylomaize and

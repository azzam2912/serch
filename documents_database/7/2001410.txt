low oxygen content prevents the wood from burning at these high temperatures several different technologies are introduced using different media including nitrogen gas steam and hot oil the first technological approach of thermal modification processes of wood is the paper of burmester there are 5 different thermal modification processes thermowood or premium wood in finland retification process retiwood new option wood and les bois perdure in france plato process in netherlands oil heat treatment in germany oht process three of the processes are performed in one step using oil oil heat treatment nitrogen reti wood and steam le bois perdure the thermo wood process consists of drying heat treatment and finally cooling conditioning and takes up to 72 hours the plato process consists of hydrothermolysis dry curing and conditioning and can take up to 7 days the required time depends on wood species width and initial moisture content westwood is the most advanced modern thermo modification process patented in 2004 the process has initially developed for treatment hardwoods which are more complicated compared to softwoods due to thermo chemical reactions appeared in hardwoods during thermo treatment the fully automated westwood control system allows to manage thermo treatment of any hardwoods

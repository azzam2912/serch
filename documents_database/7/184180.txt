they can also be used to read credit debit gift cards because the strip of magnetic tape on the back of a credit card stores data the same way that other magnetic tapes do cassettes reel to reel tapes 8 tracks vhs tapes and even floppy disks and modern hard drive disks all use the same principle of physics to store and read back information the medium is magnetized in a pattern it then moves at a constant speed over an electromagnet since the moving tape is carrying a changing magnetic field with it it induces a varying voltage across the head that voltage can then be amplified and connected to speakers in the case of audio or measured and sorted into 1 s and zeroes in the case of digital data the electromagnetic arrangement of a tape head is generally similar for all types though the physical design varies considerably depending on the application for example videocassette recorders vcr use rotating heads which implement a helical scan whereas most audio recorders have fixed heads a head consists of a core of magnetic material arranged into a doughnut shape or toroid into which a very narrow gap has been let

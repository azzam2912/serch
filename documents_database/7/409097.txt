the basic ionosonde technology was invented in 1925 by gregory breit and merle a tuve and further developed in the late 1920s by a number of prominent physicists including edward victor appleton the term ionosphere and hence the etymology of its derivatives was proposed by robert watson watt an ionosonde consists of the transmitter sweeps all or part of the hf frequency range transmitting short pulses these pulses are reflected at various layers of the ionosphere at heights of 100 400 km and their echos are received by the receiver and analyzed by the control system the result is displayed in the form of an ionogram a graph of reflection height actually time between transmission and reception of pulse versus carrier frequency an ionosonde is used for finding the optimum operation frequencies for broadcasts or two way communications in the high frequency range an ionogram is a display of the data produced by an ionosonde it is a graph of the virtual height of the ionosphere plotted against frequency ionograms are often converted into electron density profiles data from ionograms may be used to measure changes in the earth s ionosphere due to space weather events a chirp transmitter is

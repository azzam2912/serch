the systematic name of this enzyme class is 2 carboxy d arabinitol 1 phosphate 1 phosphohydrolase the best studied 2 carboxy d arabinitol 1 phosphate phosphatase is the enzyme that inactivates the rubisco inhibitor 2 carboxy d arabinitol 1 phosphate ca1p when light levels are high the inactivation occurs after ca1p has been released from rubisco by rubisco activase as ca1p is present in many but not all plants ca1p mediated regulation of rubisco is not universal for all photosynthetic life amino acid sequences of the ca1pase enzymes from wheat french bean tobacco and arabidopsis reveal that the enzymes contain 2 different domains indicating that it is a multifunctional enzyme ca1pase enzyme activity varies between different species due to their regulation by different redox active compounds such as glutathione however it is yet to be determined whether this process occurs in vivo wheat ca1pase heterologously expressed in e coli is also able to dephosphorylate the rubisco inhibitor d glycero 2 3 diulose 1 5 bisphosphate

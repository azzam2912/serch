brun s theorem was proved by viggo brun in 1919 and it has historical importance in the introduction of sieve methods the convergence of the sum of reciprocals of twin primes follows from bounds on the density of the sequence of twin primes let formula 1 denote the number of primes p x for which p 2 is also prime i e formula 1 is the number of twin primes with the smaller at most x then for x 3 we have that is twin primes are less frequent than prime numbers by nearly a logarithmic factor it follows from this bound that the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes converges or stated in other words the twin primes form a small set in explicit terms the sum either has finitely many terms or has infinitely many terms but is convergent its value is known as brun s constant the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the prime numbers diverges implies that there are infinitely many prime numbers because the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes instead converges it is not possible to conclude from this result that there are finitely many or infinitely

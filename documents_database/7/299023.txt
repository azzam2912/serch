while a function definition specifies how the function does what it does the implementation a function prototype merely specifies its interface i e what data types go in and come out of it the term function prototype is particularly used in the context of the programming languages c and c where placing forward declarations of functions in header files allows for splitting a program into translation units i e into parts that a compiler can separately translate into object files to be combined by a linker into an executable or a library modern compilers such as arduino ide don t require function prototypes anymore as these are determined and declared on compilation in a prototype parameter names are optional and in c c have function prototype scope meaning their scope ends at the end of the prototype however the type is necessary along with all modifiers e g if it is a pointer or a const parameter in object oriented programming interfaces and abstract methods serve much the same purpose consider the following function prototype or first of all function prototypes include the function signature the name of the function return type and access specifier in this case the name

the handling of this chemical may incur notable safety precautions it is highly recommend that you seek the material safety datasheet msds for this chemical from a reliable source and follow its directions table data obtained from crc handbook of chemistry and physics 44th ed see also aniline is a benzenoid compound the nh group attached to the benzene ring means that there is a lone pair of electrons that can enter into conjugation with the benzene ring resulting in delocalization in the aniline aniline absorbs in the k 220 250 nm and the b 250 290 nm bands exhibited by benzenoid compounds the k and b bands arise from to transitions as a result of the a group containing multiple bond being attached to the benzene ring when dissolved in ethanol for aniline is 230 nm but in dilute aqueous acid is 203 nm in the latter case the anilinium cation is formed and the lone pair is no longer available for conjugation with the benzene ring consequently the absorption of the molecule shifts to the lower value and behaves like benzene except where noted otherwise data relate to standard ambient temperature and pressure

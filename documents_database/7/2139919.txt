epr uses hypothermia drugs and fluids to buy time for resuscitative surgery if successful epr may someday be deployed in the field so that paramedics can suspend and preserve patients for transport epr is similar to deep hypothermic circulatory arrest dhca in that hypothermia is induced however the purposes and procedures of epr differ from dhca dhca induces hypothermia to aid preplanned surgery whereas epr is an emergency procedure in cases where an emergency department patient is rapidly dying from blood loss and will not otherwise survive long enough for the patient s wounds to be stitched up in epr blood is replaced by a saline solution and the patient is cooled into a suspended state where metabolism is slowed and brain activity ceases this gives the surgeon perhaps an hour to close the wounds before a warming and recirculation procedure is applied human trials began in the 2010s the trial procedure involves rapidly inducing profound hypothermia 10 c with an aortic flush in trauma victims that have suffered cardiac arrest and failed standard resuscitative efforts peter safar the father of cpr and samuel tisherman began researching epr in pittsburgh in the 1980s publishing their first results in 1990 new

the theorem states that if in triangle formula 1 points formula 2 formula 3 and formula 4 lie on segments formula 5 formula 6 and formula 7 then writing formula 8formula 9 formula 10formula 11 and formula 12formula 13 the signed area of the triangle formed by the cevians formula 14 formula 15 and formula 16 is the area of triangle formula 1 times this theorem was given by edward john routh on page 82 of his treatise on analytical statics with numerous examples in 1896 the particular case formula 19 has become popularized as the one seventh area triangle the formula 20 case implies that the three medians are concurrent through the centroid suppose that the area of triangleformula 1 is 1 for triangleformula 22 and lineformula 23 using menelaus s theorem we could obtain thenformula 25 so the area of triangleformula 26 is similarly we could know formula 28 and formula 29 thus the area of triangleformula 30 is the citation commonly given for routh s theorem is routh s treatise on analytical statics with numerous examples volume 1 chap iv in the second edition of 1896 p 82 possibly because that edition has been easier to hand

it is a member of the sp family of zinc finger transcription factors it is highly conserved among bone forming verterbrate species it plays a major role along with runx2 and dlx5 in driving the differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells into osteoblasts and eventually osteocytes sp7 also plays a regulatory role by inhibiting chondrocyte differentiation maintaining the balance between differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells into ossified bone or cartilage mutations of this gene have been associated with multiple dysfunctional bone phenotypes in vertebrates during development a mouse embryo model with sp7 expression knocked out had no formation of bone tissue through the use of gwas studies the sp7 locus in humans has been strongly associated with bone mass density in addition there is significant genetic evidence for its role in diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta oi in humans sp7 has been mapped to 12q13 13 it has 78 homology to another sp family member sp1 especially in the regions which code for the three cys 2 his 2 type dna binding zinc fingers sp7 consists of three exons the first two of which are alternatively spliced encoding a 431 residue isoform and an amino terminus truncated 413 residue short protein

because the latter monomer mainly exists as its tautomer acetaldehyde the copolymer is prepared by polymerization of ethylene and vinyl acetate to give the ethylene vinyl acetate eva copolymer followed by hydrolysis evoh copolymer is defined by the mole ethylene content lower ethylene content grades have higher barrier properties higher ethylene content grades have lower temperatures for extrusion the plastic resin is commonly used as an oxygen barrier in food packaging it is better than other plastics at keeping air out and flavors in is highly transparent weather resistant oil and solvent resistant flexible moldable recyclable and printable its drawback is that it is difficult to make and therefore more expensive than other food packaging instead of making an entire package out of evoh manufacturers keep costs down by coextruding or laminating it as a thin layer between cardboard foil or other plastics it is also used as a hydrocarbon barrier in plastic fuel tanks and pipes because of the high capital cost to build an evoh plant and the complexity of making a food grade product only a few companies produce evoh kuraray produces evoh resin under the name eval with a 10 000 ton plant in okayama japan

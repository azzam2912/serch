given a number base formula 1 a natural number or formula 1 adic number formula 4 with formula 5 digits is an automorphic number if there exists a formula 1 adic number solution of the equation formula 7 such that formula 8 for example with formula 9 there are four 10 adic solutions to formula 10 the last 10 digits of which are thus the automorphic numbers in base 10 are 0 1 5 6 25 76 376 625 9376 in any given base formula 1 there are formula 16 formula 1 adic solutions to formula 10 uniquely determined by their last digit where the prime omega function formula 19 is the number of distinct prime factors in formula 1 this is because in the ring of integers modulo formula 1 there are formula 16 solutions to formula 10 an element formula 24 in formula 25 satisfies the equation formula 10 if and only if formula 27 or formula 28 for all formula 29 since there are two possible values in formula 30 and there are formula 19 such formula 29 there are formula 16 solutions to formula 10 formula 24 and formula 36 are both formula 1 adic solutions

these cells were discovered by torsten wiesel and david hubel in the late 1950s such cells are tuned to different frequencies and orientations even with different phase relationships possibly for extracting disparity depth information and to attribute depth to detected lines and edges this may result in a 3d wire frame representation as used in computer graphics the fact that input from the left and right eyes is very close in the so called cortical hypercolumns is an indication that depth processing occurs at a very early stage aiding recognition of 3d objects later many other cells with specific functions have been discovered a end stopped cells which are thought to detect singularities like line and edge crossings vertices and line endings b bar and grating cells the latter are not linear operators because a bar cell does not respond when seeing a bar which is part of a periodic grating and a grating cell does not respond when seeing an isolated bar using the mathematical gabor model with sine and cosine components phases complex cells are then modeled by computing the modulus of complex gabor responses both simple and complex cells are linear operators and are seen as filters

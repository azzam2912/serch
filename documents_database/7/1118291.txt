for most dating requirements it has been superseded by uranium lead dating u pb dating but in certain specialized situations such as dating meteorites and the age of the earth it is more important than u pb dating there are three stable daughter pb isotopes that result from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in nature they are pb pb and pb pb is the only non radiogenic lead isotope therefore is not one of the daughter isotopes these daughter isotopes are the final decay products of u and th radioactive decay chains beginning from u u andth respectively with the progress of time the final decay product accumulates as the parent isotope decays at a constant rate this shifts the ratio of radiogenic pb versus non radiogenic pb pb pb or pb pb in favor of radiogenic pb or pb this can be expressed by the following decay equations where the subscripts p and i refer to present day and initial pb isotope ratios and are decay constants for u and u and t is the age the concept of common pb pb dating also referred to as whole rock lead isotope dating was deduced through mathematical manipulation

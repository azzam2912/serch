the term adcp is a generic term for all acoustic current profilers although the abbreviation originates from an instrument series introduced by rd instruments in the 1980s the working frequencies range of adcps range from 38 khz to several megahertz the device used in the air for wind speed profiling using sound is known as sodar and works with the same underlying principles adcps contain piezoelectric transducers to transmit and receive sound signals the traveling time of sound waves gives an estimate of the distance the frequency shift of the echo is proportional to the water velocity along the acoustic path to measure 3d velocities at least three beams are required in rivers only the 2d velocity is relevant and adcps typically have two beams in recent years more functionality has been added to adcps notably wave and turbulence measurements and systems can be found with 2 3 4 5 or even 9 beams further components of an adcp are an electronic amplifier a receiver a clock to measure the traveling time a temperature sensor a compass to know the heading and a pitch roll sensor to know the orientation an analog to digital converter and a digital signal processor

programmable thermostats are also known as setback thermostats or clock thermostats heating and cooling losses from a building or any other container become greater as the difference in temperature increases a programmable thermostat allows reduction of these losses by allowing the temperature difference to be reduced at times when the reduced amount of heating or cooling would not be objectionable for example during cooling season a programmable thermostat used in a home may be set to allow the temperature in the house to rise during the workday when no one will be at home it may then be set to turn on the air conditioning before the arrival of occupants allowing the house to be cool upon the arrival of the occupants while still having saved air conditioning energy during the peak outdoor temperatures the reduced cooling required during the day also decreases the demands placed upon the electrical supply grid conversely during the heating season the programmable thermostat may be set to allow the temperature in the house to drop when the house is unoccupied during the day and also at night after all occupants have gone to bed re heating the house prior to the occupants arriving home

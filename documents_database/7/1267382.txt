the consequences of lost circulation can be as little as the loss of a few dollars of drilling fluid or as disastrous as a blowout and loss of life so close monitoring of tanks pits and flow from the well to quickly assess and control lost circulation is taught and practiced if the amount of fluid in the wellbore drops due to lost circulation or any other reason hydrostatic pressure is reduced which can allow a gas or fluid which is under a higher pressure than the reduced hydrostatic pressure to flow into the wellbore another consequence of lost circulation is dry drilling dry drilling occurs when fluid is completely lost from the well bore without actual drilling coming to a stop the effects of dry drilling range from as minor as destroying a bit to as serious as major damage to the wellbore requiring a new well to be drilled dry drilling can also cause severe damage to the drill string including snapping the pipe and the drilling rig itself lost circulation can be divided into the following categories although preferred stopping lost circulation completely is not always possible or required controlled losses allow drilling to continue while keeping

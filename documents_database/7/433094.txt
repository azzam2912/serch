jorgen fogh the application of caco 2 cells in research was pioneered in the late 1980s by ismael hidalgo working in the laboratory of ron borchardt at the university of kansas and tom raub who was at the upjohn company at the time following stints at smithkline beecham and rhone poulenc rorer hidalgo went on to co found a company absorption systems in 1996 where he remains as chief scientist although derived from a colon large intestine carcinoma when cultured under specific conditions the cells become differentiated and polarized such that their phenotype morphologically and functionally resembles the enterocytes lining the small intestine caco 2 cells express tight junctions microvilli and a number of enzymes and transporters that are characteristic of such enterocytes peptidases esterases p glycoprotein uptake transporters for amino acids bile acids carboxylic acids etc when looking at caco 2 cell cultures microscopically it is evident even by visual inspection that the cells are heterogeneous over the years the characteristics of the cells used in different laboratories around the world have diverged significantly which makes it difficult to compare results across labs despite such heterogeneity caco 2 cells have found applications in cell invasion studies viral transfection research

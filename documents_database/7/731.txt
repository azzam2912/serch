each partial is a sine wave of different frequency and amplitude that swells and decays over time due to modulation from an adsr envelope or low frequency oscillator additive synthesis most directly generates sound by adding the output of multiple sine wave generators alternative implementations may use pre computed wavetables or the inverse fast fourier transform the sounds that are heard in everyday life are not characterized by a single frequency instead they consist of a sum of pure sine frequencies each one at a different amplitude when humans hear these frequencies simultaneously we can recognize the sound this is true for both non musical sounds e g water splashing leaves rustling etc and for musical sounds e g a piano note a bird s tweet etc this set of parameters frequencies their relative amplitudes and how the relative amplitudes change over time are encapsulated by the timbre of the sound fourier analysis is the technique that is used to determine these exact timbre parameters from an overall sound signal conversely the resulting set of frequencies and amplitudes is called the fourier series of the original sound signal in the case of a musical note the lowest frequency of its

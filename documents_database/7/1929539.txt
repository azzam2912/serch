the hypothesized mechanism of action by which zinc reduces the severity and or duration of cold symptoms is the suppression of nasal inflammation and the direct inhibition of rhinoviral receptor binding and rhinoviral replication in the nasal mucosa a 2016 meta analysis on zinc acetate lozenges and the common cold found that colds were 2 7 days shorter by zinc lozenge usage this estimate is to be compared with the 7 day average duration of colds in the three trials a 2015 meta analysis on zinc lozenges and the common cold found no difference in the effects of zinc acetate lozenges on diverse respiratory symptoms although zinc lozenges most probably lead to highest concentration of zinc in the pharyngeal region a subsequent meta analysis showed that the effects of high dose zinc acetate lozenges did not significantly differ in their effects on pharyngeal and nasal symptoms the duration of nasal discharge was shortened by 34 nasal congestion by 37 sneezing by 22 scratchy throat by 33 sore throat by 18 hoarseness by 43 and cough by 46 zinc lozenges shortened the duration of muscle ache by 54 but there was no significant effect on the duration of headache and fever

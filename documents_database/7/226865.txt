these nanoshells involve a quasiparticle called a plasmon which is a collective excitation or quantum plasma oscillation where the electrons simultaneously oscillate with respect to all the ions the simultaneous oscillation can be called plasmon hybridization where the tunability of the oscillation is associated with mixture of the inner and outer shell where they hybridize to give a lower energy or higher energy this lower energy couples strongly to incident light whereas the higher energy is an anti bonding and weakly combines to incident light the hybridization interaction is stronger for thinner shell layers hence the thickness of the shell and overall particle radius determines which wavelength of light it couples with nanoshells can be varied across a broad range of the light spectrum that spans the visible and near infrared regions the interaction of light and nanoparticles affects the placement of charges which affects the coupling strength incident light polarized parallel to the substrate gives a s polarization figure 1b hence the charges are further from the substrate surface which gives a stronger interaction between the shell and core otherwise a p polarization is formed which gives a more strongly shifted plasmon energy causing a weaker interaction and coupling

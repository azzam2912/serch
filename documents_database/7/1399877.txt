the company experimented with the use of hydrogen in the divers breathing gas this work with heliox and hydreliox gas mixtures started with hydra i in 1968 it culminated with hydra x hydra 10 in 1992 when comex diver theo mavrostomos achieved a record simulated dive of in an on shore hyperbaric chamber the use of hydrogen for diving was in part driven by the need to overcome the problems of high pressure nervous syndrome hpns however there was another reason for the interest in using hydrogen in a breathing gas in 1987 comex was part of a canadian french consortium that was building the world s first commercial nuclear mini submarine this submarine saga was a prototype intended to be used for oil exploration and development under the arctic ice saga was built on a hull originally constructed by jacques yves cousteau but not completed due to lack of funds saga would have a complete saturation diving system on board the nuclear power plant would be able to produce large volumes of hydrogen and oxygen through the electrolysis of water this would provide plentiful amounts of breathing gas for autonomous diving operations under the arctic ice cap the project

various problems in fluid mechanics can be approximated to hele shaw flows and thus the research of these flows is of importance approximation to hele shaw flow is specifically important to micro flows this is due to manufacturing techniques which creates shallow planar configurations and the typically low reynolds numbers of micro flows the governing equation of hele shaw flows is identical to that of the inviscid potential flow and to the flow of fluid through a porous medium darcy s law it thus permits visualization of this kind of flow in two dimensions let formula 1 formula 2 be the directions parallel to the flat plates and formula 3 the perpendicular direction with formula 4 being the gap between the plates at formula 5 when the gap between plates is asymptotically small the velocity profile in the formula 3 direction is parabolic i e is a quadratic function of the coordinate in this direction the equation relating the pressure gradient to the velocity is where formula 9 is the velocity formula 10 is the local pressure formula 11 is the fluid viscosity this relation and the uniformity of the pressure in the narrow direction formula 3 permits us to

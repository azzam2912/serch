the unifying principle is that the free energy of a system at equilibrium is the minimum possible so that the slope of the free energy with respect to the reaction coordinate is zero this principle applied to mixtures at equilibrium provides a definition of an equilibrium constant applications include acid base host guest metal complex solubility partition chromatography and redox equilibria a chemical system is said to be in equilibrium when the quantities of the chemical entities involved do not and cannot change in time without the application of an external influence in this sense a system in chemical equilibrium is in a stable state the system at chemical equilibrium will be at a constant temperature pressure or volume and composition it will be insulated from exchange of heat with the surroundings that is it is a closed system a change of temperature pressure or volume constitutes an external influence and the equilibrium quantities will change as a result of such a change if there is a possibility that the composition might change but the rate of change is negligibly slow the system is said to be in a metastable state the equation of chemical equilibrium can be expressed symbolically

this is given as a ratio of dead space to tidal volume it differs from anatomical dead space as measured by fowler s method as it includes alveolar dead space the bohr equation is used to quantify the ratio of physiological dead space to the total tidal volume and gives an indication of the extent of wasted ventilation the original formulation by bohr required measurement of the alveolar partial pressure p the modification by enghoff replaced the mixed alveolar partial pressure of co with the arterial partial pressure of that gas the bohr equation with enghoff s modification is commonly stated as follows here formula 3 is the physiological dead space volume and formula 4 is the tidal volume its derivation is based on the fact that only the ventilated gases involved in gas exchange formula 7 will produce co because the total tidal volume formula 8 is made up of formula 9 alveolar volume dead space volume we can substitute formula 7 for formula 11 initially bohr tells us vt vd va the bohr equation helps us find the amount of any expired gas n o etc in this case we will focus on defining fe as the fraction

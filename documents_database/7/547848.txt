using parametric polymorphism a function or a data type can be written generically so that it can handle values identically without depending on their type such functions and data types are called generic functions and generic datatypes respectively and form the basis of generic programming for example a function codice 1 that joins two lists can be constructed so that it does not care about the type of elements it can append lists of integers lists of real numbers lists of strings and so on let the type variable a denote the type of elements in the lists then codice 1 can be typed where codice 4 denotes the type of lists with elements of type a we say that the type of codice 1 is parameterized by a for all values of a note that since there is only one type variable the function cannot be applied to just any pair of lists the pair as well as the result list must consist of the same type of elements for each place where codice 1 is applied a value is decided for a following christopher strachey parametric polymorphism may be contrasted with ad hoc polymorphism in which a single

they get their common name from their habit of swimming rapidly in circles when alarmed and are also notable for their divided eyes which are believed to enable them to see both above and below water the family includes some 700 extant species worldwide in 15 genera plus a few fossil species most species are very similar in general appearance though they vary in size from perhaps 3 mm to 18 mm in length they tend to be flattened and rounded in cross section in plain view as seen from above and in longitudinal section in fact their shape is a good first approximation to an ellipsoid with legs and other appendages fitting closely into a streamlined surface the gyrinidae generally have been regarded as a family in the adephaga but there is a great deal of work underway to clarify the relationships both within the adephaga and within the coleoptera in general within the adephaga there is confusion as well with various rival proposals in contention for example some workers regard the gyrinidae as being closely related to such families as the dytiscidae and various other predacious water beetle families whereas other analyses suggest rather that the gyrinidae are

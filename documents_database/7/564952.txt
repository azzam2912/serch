activities in the field range from small scale youth groups attached to parishes or catholic schools to large international gatherings such as world youth day it is a field which has evolved much over recent decades especially in comparison to more formal methods of education or catechesis within the church nearly all dioceses and a great deal of parishes have some form of youth provision running although a great deal of areas particularly in the developed world are finding youth work both more difficult and rare as the numbers of young people regularly practicing the catholic faith continue to decline in contrast though the new and exciting developments of recent decades and particularly the influence of the new movements within the church are ensuring that youth work continues to be an active and fruitful field in many countries local groups of catholic youth have founded diocesan or national umbrella organizations to foster the exchange between young people and to organize joint activities like camps seminars or pilgrimages typical for the youth work of catholic youth organizations is that their work is not determined by priests or other professionals but that they are self organized and determined by young volunteers however

it is usually assumed that prenyl groups 3 methylbut 2 en 1 yl facilitate attachment to cell membranes similar to lipid anchors like the gpi anchor though direct evidence of this has not been observed prenyl groups have been shown to be important for protein protein binding through specialized prenyl binding domains protein prenylation involves the transfer of either a farnesyl or a geranyl geranyl moiety to c terminal cysteine s of the target protein there are three enzymes that carry out prenylation in the cell farnesyl transferase caax protease and geranylgeranyl transferase i farnesylation is a type of prenylation a post translational modification of proteins by which an isoprenyl group is added to a cysteine residue it is an important process to mediate protein protein interactions and protein membrane interactions farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase i are very similar proteins they consist of two subunits the subunit which is common to both enzymes and the subunit whose sequence identity is just 25 these enzymes recognise the caax box at the c terminus of the target protein c is the cysteine that is prenylated a is any aliphatic amino acid and the identity of x determines which enzyme acts on the protein

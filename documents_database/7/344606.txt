the ignition source of a diesel engine is the heat generated by the compression of the air in the cylinder rather than a spark as in gasoline engines the dieseling phenomenon occurs not just because the compression ratio is sufficient to cause auto ignition of the fuel but also because a hot spot inside the cylinder spark plug electrode combustion chamber valve edge or even excess carbon starts combustion an automobile engine that is dieseling will typically sputter then gradually stop this is normally seen in carbureted engines with many miles on them dieseling is not nearly as common as it once was because it most commonly occurs in engines equipped with carburetors the vast majority of vehicles manufactured after 1987 are fuel injected the injectors and high pressure fuel pump immediately cease supplying fuel to the cylinders when the ignition is switched off if the injector is damaged or dirty a small amount of fuel can enter the chamber and be ignited causing a sputter or two after the engine is switched off until the mass market introduction of fuel injection the industry s remedy for dieseling was to install an electric solenoid into the fuel supply circuit of

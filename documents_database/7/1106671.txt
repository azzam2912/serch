hsf1 is highly conserved in eukaryotes and is the primary mediator of transcriptional responses to proteotoxic stress with important roles in non stress regulation such as development and metabolism human hsf1 consists of several domains which regulate its binding and activity this n terminal domain of approximately 100 amino acids is the most highly conserved region in the hsf protein family and consists of a helix turn helix loop the dbd of each hsf1 monomer recognizes the sequence ngaan on target dna repeated sequences of the ngaan pentamer constitute heat shock elements hses for active hsf1 trimers to bind the two regions responsible for oligomerization between hsf1 monomers are leucine zipper lz domains 1 3 and 4 these regions are also commonly referred to as hr a b and hr c lz1 3 is situated just downstream of the dbd while lz4 is located between the rd and the c terminal tad under non stress conditions spontaneous hsf1 activation is negatively regulated by the interaction between lz1 3 and lz4 when induced by stress the lz1 3 region breaks away from the lz4 region and forms a trimer with other hsf1 lz1 3 domains to form a triple coiled coil

the basic idea is to use mathematical signal processing methods such as fourier analysis in combination with suitable computer hardware to allow for real time measurements of acoustic signal amplitudes as well as their distribution in frequency space the main benefit of this technique is the enhanced signal to noise ratio when it comes to the separation of acoustic emission from a certain source and other unwanted contamination by any kinds of noise the technique is therefore mostly applied in industrial production processes e g cold forming or machining where a 100 percent quality control is required or in condition monitoring for e g quantifying tool wear high frequency impulse measurement is an algorithm for obtaining frequency information of any structure or air borne sound source on the basis of discrete signal transformations this is mostly done using fourier series to quantify the distribution of the energy content of a sound signal in frequency space on the software side the tool used for this is the fast fourier transform fft implementation of this mathematical transformation this allows in combination with specific hardware to directly obtain frequency information so that this is accessible in line e g during a production process

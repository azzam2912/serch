as armenian is the only known language of its branch of the indo european languages the comparative method cannot be used to reconstruct its earlier stages instead a combination of internal and external reconstruction by reconstructions of proto indo european and other branches has allowed linguists to piece together the earlier history of armenian proto armenian as the common ancestor of only one language has no clear definition of the term it is generally held to include a variety of ancestral stages of armenian between proto indo european and the earliest attestations of classical armenian it is thus not a proto language in the strict sense but proto armenian is a term that has become common in the field the earliest testimony of armenian is the 5th century bible translation of mesrop mashtots the earlier history of the language is unclear and the subject of much speculation it is clear that armenian is an indo european language but its development is opaque in any case armenian has many layers of loanwords and shows traces of long language contact with indo aryan mitanni anatolian languages such as luwian and hittite semitic languages such as akkadian and aramaic and the hurrio urartian

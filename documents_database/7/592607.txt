tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by gravitational forces exerted by the moon and sun and the rotation of earth tidal range is not constant but changes depending on the locations of the moon and sun the most extreme tidal range occurs during spring tides when the gravitational forces of both the moon and sun are aligned syzygy reinforcing each other in the same direction new moon or in opposite directions full moon during neap tides when the moon and sun s gravitational force vectors act in quadrature making a right angle to the earth s orbit the difference between high and low tides is smaller neap tides occur during the first and last quarters of the moon s phases the largest annual tidal range can be expected around the time of the equinox if it coincides with a spring tide tidal data for coastal areas is published by national hydrographic services the data is based on astronomical phenomena and is predictable sustained storm force winds blowing from one direction combined with low barometric pressure can increase the tidal range particularly in narrow bays such weather related effects on the tide which can cause ranges in

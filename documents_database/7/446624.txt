these numberings are also called acceptable numberings and acceptable programming systems rogers equivalence theorem shows that all acceptable programming systems are equivalent to each other in the formal sense of numbering theory the formalization of computability theory by kleene led to a particular universal partial computable function e x defined using the t predicate this function is universal in the sense that it is partial computable and for any partial computable function f there is an e such that for all x f x e x where the equality means that either both sides are undefined or both are defined and are equal it is common to write x for e x thus the sequence is an enumeration of all partial computable functions such enumerations are formally called computable numberings of the partial computable functions an arbitrary numbering of partial functions is defined to be an admissible numbering if here the first bullet requires the numbering to be computable the second requires that any index for the numbering can be converted effectively to an index to the numbering and the third requires that any index for the numbering can be effectively converted to an index for the numbering hartley rogers

ior is usually measured with a cue response paradigm in which a person presses a button when they detect a target stimulus following the presentation of a cue that indicates the location in which the target will appear the cue can be exogenous or peripheral or endogenous inhibition of return results from oculomotor activation regardless of whether it was produced by exogenous signals or endogenously although ior occurs for both visual and auditory stimuli ior is greater for visual stimuli and is studied more often than auditory stimuli ior was first described in depth by michael posner and yoav cohen who discovered that contrary to their expectations reaction times rt to detect objects appearing in previously cued locations were initially faster to validly cued location known as the validity effect but then after a period of around 300 ms response times to a previously cued location were longer than to uncued locations specifically ior was described as an inhibitory effect produced by a peripheral or exogenous cue or target in the experiment that demonstrated the paradigm participants were instructed to fixate on a center box that was flanked with a box on its right and left sides each trial began

the difference between the various systems lies in the type of catalyst used to create the polymer but the final polymer properties are similar the reacting system is formulated in such a way that two components need to be mixed at equal volume 1 1 ratio both components contain mainly dcpd with some additional additives the difference between both components is crucial but constitutes only a small fraction of the total formulation the catalyst system is divided into two parts each part going into a separate component when both components are mixed the complete catalyst system is recombined and becomes active this is an important difference from other reaction injection moulding rim systems like polyurethane since the reaction is not stoichiometric the 1 1 ratio for dcpd moulding is not critical since this is not a combination of two different chemical elements to form a specific matrix significant changes in ratio will slow down the system s reactivity because fewer active reaction nuclei are being formed this also changes the final properties somewhat the current industrial pumps used on rim equipment are accurate enough to ensure that the mixing ratio stays within the necessary limits dcpd resins are transformed using

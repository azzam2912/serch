these materials have good abrasion resistance and good aging stability when protected by additives in 2012 more than 5 4 million tonnes of sbr were processed worldwide about 50 of car tires are made from various types of sbr the styrene butadiene ratio influences the properties of the polymer with high styrene content the rubbers are harder and less rubbery sbr is not to be confused with a thermoplastic elastomer made from the same monomers styrene butadiene block copolymer sbr is derived from two monomers styrene and butadiene the mixture of these two monomers is polymerized by two processes from solution s sbr or as an emulsion e sbr e sbr is more widely used e sbr produced by emulsion polymerization is initiated by free radicals reaction vessels are typically charged with the two monomers a free radical generator and a chain transfer agent such as an alkyl mercaptan radical initiators include potassium persulfate and hydroperoxides in combination with ferrous salts emulsifying agents include various soaps by capping the growing organic radicals mercaptans e g dodecylthiol control the molecular weight and hence the viscosity of the product typically polymerizations are allowed to proceed only to ca 70 a method called

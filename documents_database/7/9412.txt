most commonly this relationship is found for a pair of objects the physical principle behind orbital resonance is similar in concept to pushing a child on a swing where the orbit and the swing both have a natural frequency and the other body doing the pushing will act in periodic repetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies i e their ability to alter or constrain each other s orbits in most cases this results in an unstable interaction in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists under some circumstances a resonant system can be stable and self correcting so that the bodies remain in resonance examples are the 1 2 4 resonance of jupiter s moons ganymede europa and io and the 2 3 resonance between pluto and neptune unstable resonances with saturn s inner moons give rise to gaps in the rings of saturn the special case of 1 1 resonance between bodies with similar orbital radii causes large solar system bodies to eject most other bodies sharing their orbits this is part of the much more extensive process

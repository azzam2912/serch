conversely the pumping lemma does not suffice to guarantee that a language is context free there are other necessary conditions such as ogden s lemma or the interchange lemma if a language formula 1 is context free then there exists some integer formula 2 called a pumping length such that every string formula 3 in formula 1 that has a length of formula 5 or more symbols i e with formula 6 can be written as with substrings formula 8 and formula 9 such that below is a formal expression of the pumping lemma formula 14 the pumping lemma for context free languages called just the pumping lemma for the rest of this article describes a property that all context free languages are guaranteed to have the property is a property of all strings in the language that are of length at least formula 5 where formula 5 is a constant called the pumping length that varies between context free languages say formula 3 is a string of length at least formula 5 that is in the language the pumping lemma states that formula 3 can be split into five substrings formula 7 where formula 21 is non empty and

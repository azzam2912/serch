the group is predominantly composed of deep water sandstone and mudstone flysch the sandstone dominated units form the cliffs around the waitemata harbour and rare more resistant conglomerates underlie some of auckland s prominent ridges the waitemata group was deposited within fault controlled basins these were bounded to the north and south by up faulted mesozoic basement sedimentary rocks and volcanic rocks to the east and west the sedimentary source for the group s sandstone is a mix of these basement sediments of the waipapa terrane and the mostly intermediate volcanic rocks the maximum water depth of the waitemata group basin basin was 2 000 m the basal strata kawau subgroup are from the early miocene otaian and range in thickness from 10 45 m these basal lithologies are varied and different from the overlying flyish basin they overly the te kuiti group sediments and the mesozoic basement this subgroup includes the papakura limestone tipakuri sandstone formation and the cape rodney formation greywacke conglomerate and breccia the warkworth subgroup is up to 1000m of inter bedded sandstone and mudstone formed from turbidity currents these accumulated in a bathyal submarine fan the meremere subgroup is finer grained and represents a bathyal

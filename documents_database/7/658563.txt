mordaciidae is made up of three species m praedox m mordax and m lapicida m mordax is a relatively rare parasitic vertebrate and along with the hagfishes is part of the only surviving group of jawless organisms throughout vertebrate evolution it has a thin eel like body up to long with two low dorsal fins on the back half the skin is blue gray or brown its eyes are small and located on the top of its head members of agnatha have been found in the fossil record for approximately five hundred million years and it has been identified as an important group in tracking vertebrate evolution despite being spatially close to the other southern hemisphere family geotriidae which is made up of geotria australis only m mordax has been shown to have key proteins with vastly different amino acid compositions one such study of insulin extracted from organisms of both species indicated that 18 amino acids are different between g australis and m mordax when with northern hemisphere lampreys p marinus and l fluviatilis there is only a four amino acid difference this data indicates that the southern hemisphere lampreys likely diverged evolutionarily a long time before it has

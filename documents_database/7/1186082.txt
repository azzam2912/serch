it was named for jpl project scientist r stephen saunders saunders orbits the sun at a distance of 1 2 3 4 au once every 3 years and 6 months 1 278 days its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 48 and an inclination of 7 with respect to the ecliptic a first precovery was taken at the australian siding spring observatory in 1982 extending the body s observation arc by 7 years prior to its official discovery at palomar it has a minimum orbital intersection distance with earth of which corresponds to 74 3 lunar distances in the smass classification saunders is a sq type which transitions from the common s type to the q type asteroids the collaborative asteroid lightcurve link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0 20 and derives a diameter of 467 meters based on an absolute magnitude of 19 02 in october 1989 the first photometric observations of saunders were made with the eso 1 metre telescope at la silla in chile it gave a rotation period of 6 hours with a brightness variation of 0 3 magnitude another rotational lightcurve was obtained by czech astronomer petr pravec at ond ejov observatory

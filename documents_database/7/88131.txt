all such groups are isomorphic so one often speaks of the trivial group the single element of the trivial group is the identity element and so it is usually denoted as such 0 1 or e depending on the context if the group operation is denoted then it is defined by the similarly defined trivial monoid is also a group since its only element is its own inverse and is hence the same as the trivial group the trivial group should not be confused with the empty set which has no elements and lacking an identity element cannot be a group given any group g the group consisting of only the identity element is a subgroup of g and being the trivial group is called the trivial subgroup of g the term when referred to g has no nontrivial proper subgroups refers to the only subgroups of g being the trivial group e and the group g itself the trivial group is cyclic of order 1 as such it may be denoted z or c if the group operation is called addition the trivial group is usually denoted by 0 if the group operation is called multiplication then 1 can

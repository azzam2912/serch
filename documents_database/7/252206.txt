a 3 manifold can be thought of as a possible shape of the universe just as a sphere looks like a plane to a small enough observer all 3 manifolds look like our universe does to a small enough observer this is made more precise in the definition below a topological space x is a 3 manifold if it is a second countable hausdorff space and if every point in x has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to euclidean 3 space the topological piecewise linear and smooth categories are all equivalent in three dimensions so little distinction is made in whether we are dealing with say topological 3 manifolds or smooth 3 manifolds phenomena in three dimensions can be strikingly different from phenomena in other dimensions and so there is a prevalence of very specialized techniques that do not generalize to dimensions greater than three this special role has led to the discovery of close connections to a diversity of other fields such as knot theory geometric group theory hyperbolic geometry number theory teichm ller theory topological quantum field theory gauge theory floer homology and partial differential equations 3 manifold theory is considered a part of low dimensional topology or

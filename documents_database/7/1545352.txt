it values the aircraft at its marginal cost including only the cost of production and production tools essential for building a single unit it excludes sunk costs such as research and development supplementary costs such as support equipment and future costs such as spares and maintenance there are other possible measures of aircraft cost the flyaway cost can be meaningfully compared to another cost metric the procurement cost the procurement cost often referred to for military aircraft as the weapons system cost is the total price of the aircraft a good way of looking at the difference is the flyaway cost is the cost of making the aircraft but the procurement cost is the cost of buying the aircraft procurement costs may include ancillary equipment costs one time non recurring contract costs and airframe engine and avionics support costs for example the flyaway cost for the boeing f a 18e f super hornet up to 2009 for the 449 units built was us 57 5 million per unit but the procurement cost was 39 8 higher at us 80 4 million per unit the production cost of technologically complicated aircraft will always be higher during the low rate initial production

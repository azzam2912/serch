it is commonly used in conjunction with various other separation processes such as ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis to provide a product stream which is free of undesired contaminants microfiltration usually serves as a pre treatment for other separation processes such as ultrafiltration and a post treatment for granular media filtration the typical particle size used for microfiltration ranges from about 0 1 to 10 m in terms of approximate molecular weight these membranes can separate macromolecules of molecular weights generally less than 100 000 g mol the filters used in the microfiltration process are specially designed to prevent particles such as sediment algae protozoa or large bacteria from passing through a specially designed filter more microscopic atomic or ionic materials such as water ho monovalent species such as sodium na or chloride cl ions dissolved or natural organic matter and small colloids and viruses will still be able to pass through the filter the suspended liquid is passed through at a relatively high velocity of around 1 3 m s and at low to moderate pressures around 100 400 kpa parallel or tangential to the semi permeable membrane in a sheet or tubular form a pump is commonly fitted onto

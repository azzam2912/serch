the non linearity of the superparamagnetic material acts as a frequency mixer with voltage measured at the coil terminals it consists of several frequency components at the initial frequency and at the frequencies of certain linear combinations the frequency shift of the field to be measured allows for detection of a direct current field with a standard coil in 1949 french physicist louis n el 1904 2000 discovered that when they are finely divided ferromagnetic nanoparticles lose their hysteresis below a certain size this phenomenon is known as superparamagnetism the magnetization of these materials is subject to the applied field which is highly non linear this curve is well described by the langevin function but for weak fields it can be simply written as where formula 2 is the susceptibility at zero field and formula 3 is known as the n el coefficient the n el coefficient reflects the non linearity of superparamagnetic materials in low fields if a coil of formula 4 turns with a surface formula 5 through which passes a current of excitation formula 6 is immersed in a magnetic field formula 7 collinear with the axis of the coil a superparamagnetic material is deposited inside the

it is a cell membrane transporter and carries choline into acetylcholine synthesizing neurons hemicholinium 3 is an inhibitor of the cht and can be used to deplete acetylcholine stores while coluracetam is an enhancer of the cht and can increase cholinergic neurotransmission by enhancing acetylcholine synthesis choline is a direct precursor of acetylcholine ach a neurotransmitter of the central and peripheral nervous system that regulates a variety of autonomic cognitive and motor functions slc5a7 is a na and cl dependent high affinity transporter that mediates the uptake of choline for acetylcholine synthesis in cholinergic neurons mutations in the slc5a7 gene have been associated with distal spinal muscular atrophy with vocal cord paralysis distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 7a the cht seems to be a site of action of some neurotoxins found in snake venoms which disrupt peripheral cholinergic transmission by interfering with presynaptic acetylcholine synthesis it is hypothesized that these toxins irreversibly block the cht model organisms have been used in the study of slc5a7 function a conditional knockout mouse line called slc5a7 was generated at the wellcome trust sanger institute male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion additional screens performed in

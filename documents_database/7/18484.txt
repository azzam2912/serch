the phrase was coined in 1982 by alan perlis in the epigrams on programming in any turing complete language it is possible to write any computer program so in a very rigorous sense nearly all programming languages are equally capable showing that theoretical ability is not the same as usefulness in practice turing tarpits are characterized by having a simple abstract machine that requires the user to deal with many details in the solution of a problem at the extreme opposite are interfaces that can perform very complex tasks with little human intervention but become obsolete if requirements change slightly some esoteric programming languages such as brainfuck are specifically referred to as turing tarpits because they deliberately implement the minimum functionality necessary to be classified as turing complete languages using such languages is a form of mathematical recreation programmers can work out how to achieve basic programming constructs in an extremely difficult but mathematically turing equivalent language

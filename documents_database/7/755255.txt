this complex gave rise to the first example of a dihydrogen complex this colorless compound like its chromium and molybdenum analogs is noteworthy as a volatile air stable derivative of tungsten in its zero oxidation state w co is prepared by the reduction of wcl under a pressure of carbon monoxide the compound is relatively air stable it is sparingly soluble in nonpolar organic solvents tungsten carbonyl is widely used in electron beam induced deposition technique it is easily vaporized and decomposed by the electron beam providing a convenient source of tungsten atoms w co adopts an octahedral geometry consisting of six rod like co ligands radiating from the central w atom with dipole moment 0 d all reactions of w co commence with displacement of some co ligands in w co w co behaves similarly to the mo co but tends to form compounds that are kinetically more robust treatment of tungsten hexacarbonyl with sodium cyclopentadienide followed by oxidation of the resulting naw co ch gives cyclopentadienyltungsten tricarbonyl dimer one derivative is the dihydrogen complex w co p ch h three of these co ligands can be displaced by acetonitrile w co has been used to desulfurize organosulfur compounds

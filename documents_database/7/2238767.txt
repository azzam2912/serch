the field is broadly defined and includes foundations in anatomy applied mathematics and pure mathematics including medical imaging neuroscience physics probability and statistics it focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged rather than the medical imaging devices the central focus of the sub field of computational anatomy within medical imaging is mapping information across anatomical coordinate systems most often dense information measured within a magnetic resonance image mri the introduction of flows into ca which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid dynamics exploit the notion that dense coordinates in image analysis follow the lagrangian and eulerian equations of motion in models based on lagrangian and eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms the constraint is associated to topological properties such as open sets being preserved coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping and connected sets remaining connected the use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post christensen s original paper with fast and symmetric methods becoming available the central statistical model of computational anatomy in the context of medical imaging has been the source channel model of shannon theory the source is the deformable template of images formula 1

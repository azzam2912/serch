furthermore mixed invariants between pairs of rank two tensors may also be defined these may be extracted by evaluating the characteristic polynomial directly using the faddeev leverrier algorithm for example the invariants of rank three four and higher order tensors may also be determined a scalar function formula 9 that depends entirely on the principal invariants of a tensor is objective i e independent from rotations of the coordinate system this property is commonly used in formulating closed form expressions for the strain energy density or helmholtz free energy of a nonlinear material possessing isotropic symmetry this technique was first introduced into isotropic turbulence by howard p robertson in 1940 where he was able to derive k rm n howarth equation from the invariant principle george batchelor and subrahmanyan chandrasekhar exploited this technique and developed an extended treatment for axisymmetric turbulence

in the 1990s this design was developed further to become the dcsc also intended for mine countermeasures gas supply is carried in a 5l 200bar aluminium cylinder mounted horizontally at the bottom of the unit with the valve to the diver s left the reserve valve and bypass valve are also on the left the fairing case holding the components is clipped to the tubular harness frame and can be released by pulling a knob on the lower right the scrubber is a radial flow cylindrical design with inward flow it carries a 2 5 kg charge of absorbent the counterlung is a wedge shaped bellows hinged on the lower edge and the angle between the top and bottom covers is proportional to the internal volume the change in top plate angle as the diver breathes controls the gas addition mechanism the top plate of the bellows is ballasted so that the lifting force of the air inside is balanced by the weights when the diver is trimmed horizontally face down the weights create a slight positive pressure relative to ambient this compensates for the depth difference between the counterlung and the diver s lungs reducing the effort required to

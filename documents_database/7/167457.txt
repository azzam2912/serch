contemporary manufacturers kite athletes kite pilots scientists and engineers are expanding the possibilities on board angle of attack mechanisms were used in 2000 altitude record making flight the operators designed adjuster limited kite line tension to not more than 100 pounds by altering the angle of attack of the kite s wing body the kite s line had a control line payout meter that did not function in the record setting flight however some special tether line lower end used some bungee and pulley arrangements to lower the impact of gusts on the long tether control of a kite includes how other aircraft sees the kite system the team placed a radio beacon using two meter frequency detectable for 50 miles on the kite for sight visibility strobe lights were hung from the kite s nose control via use of reels and pulleys become critical when tension is high the team had to repair and replace parts during the flight session auxiliary devices have been invented and used for controlling single line kites devices on board the kite s wing can react to the kite line s tension or to the kite s angle of attack with the ambient stream

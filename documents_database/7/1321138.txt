the voice is a modern language dynamic equivalent translation the new testament was released in november 2011 and the full bible was released in april 2012 the team developing the voice numbered more than 120 scholars authors and artists the team included greek and hebrew scholars biblical scholars poets authors musicians and pastors an interesting feature of this translation was that the team made the unusual decision to render the hebrew tetragrammaton as the eternal rather than a common title such as the lord or a transliteration such as yahweh or jehovah though such a translation rendering is not unique to the voice there are other bible translations such as the moffatt new translation of 1922 that have rendered the tetragrammaton in this manner another distinction is rendering a title such as the word e g john chapter 1 as the voice rather than as the word which is used in most bible translations or the less than common expression logos as used in such translations as the emphatic diaglott a greek english interlinear first published in 1864 by benjamin wilson and the moffatt new translation of 1922 or the use of the anointed one e g matthew 1 1

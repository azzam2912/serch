it is a kind of stroke or other form of arterial thrombosis caused by embolism of a thrombus blood clot air tumor fat or amniotic fluid of venous origin which travels to the arterial side through a lateral opening in the heart such as a patent foramen ovale or arteriovenous shunts in the lungs the opening is typically an atrial septal defect but can also be a ventricular septal defect paradoxical embolisms represent two percent of arterial emboli passage of a clot thrombus from a systemic vein to a systemic artery when clots in systemic veins break off embolize they travel first to the right side of the heart and normally then to the lungs where they lodge causing pulmonary embolism on the other hand when there is a hole at the septum either upper chambers of the heart an atrial septal defect or lower chambers of the heart ventricular septal defects a clot can cross from the right to the left side of the heart then pass into the systemic arteries as a paradoxical embolism once in the arterial circulation a clot can travel to the brain block a vessel there and cause a stroke cerebrovascular accident ct angiography

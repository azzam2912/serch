this standard includes the definition of the coordinate system s fundamental and derived constants the ellipsoidal normal earth gravitational model egm a description of the associated world magnetic model wmm and a current list of local datum transformations the latest revision is wgs 84 also known as wgs 1984 epsg 4326 established in 1984 and last revised in 2004 earlier schemes included wgs 72 wgs 66 and wgs 60 wgs 84 is the reference coordinate system used by the global positioning system the coordinate origin of wgs 84 is meant to be located at the earth s center of mass the uncertainty is believed to be less than 2 cm the wgs 84 meridian of zero longitude is the iers reference meridian 5 3 arc seconds or east of the greenwich meridian at the latitude of the royal observatory the wgs 84 datum surface is an oblate spheroid with equatorial radius a m at the equator and flattening f 1 the refined value of the wgs 84 gravitational constant mass of earth s atmosphere included is gm 10 m s the angular velocity of the earth is defined to be 72 92115 10 rad s this leads to several computed

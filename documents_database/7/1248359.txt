patarin both are digital signature schemes they belong to the group of multivariate cryptography the security of this signature scheme is based on an np hard mathematical problem to create and validate signatures a minimal quadratic equations system must be solved solving equations with variables is an np hard problem which means the problem is almost certainly difficult to solve efficiently in the worst case even when using a quantum computer while the problem is easy if is either much much larger or much much smaller than importantly for cryptographic purposes the problem is thought to be difficult in the average case when and are nearly equal even when using a quantum computer as a result a number of signature schemes have been devised based on multivariate equations with the goal of achieving quantum resistant signatures a signature scheme has a signing key which is kept private and a verification key which is publicly revealed for instance in signature schemes based on rsa the keys are both exponents in the uov scheme and in every other multivariate signature scheme the keys are more complex the mathematical problem is to solve formula 1 equations with formula 2 variables the whole equations

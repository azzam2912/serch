it consists of sedimentary rocks dating from the mississippian period 354 323 million years ago in texas the formation underlies the city of fort worth and underlies 5 000 mi 13 000 km and at least 17 counties as of 2007 some experts suggested that the barnett shale might have the largest producible reserves of any onshore natural gas field in the united states the field is thought to have of recoverable natural gas and of natural gas in place oil also has been found in lesser quantities but sufficient with high oil prices to be commercially viable the barnett shale is known as a tight gas reservoir indicating that the gas is not easily extracted the shale is very impermeable and it was virtually impossible to produce gas in commercial quantities from this formation until oil and gas companies learned how to effectively use massive hydraulic fracturing in the formation the use of horizontal drilling further improved the economics and made it easier to extract gas from under developed areas future development of the field will be hampered in part by the fact that major portions of the field are in urban areas including the rapidly growing dallas fort

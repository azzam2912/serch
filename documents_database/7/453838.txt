it is named after the german surgeon friedrich trendelenburg the trendelenburg sign is said to be positive if when standing on one leg the stance leg the pelvis drops on the side opposite to the stance leg the muscle weakness is present on the side of the stance leg if the patient compensates for this weakness by tilting their trunk thorax to the affected side then the pelvis will be raised rather than dropped on the side opposite to the stance leg ergo in the same situation the patient s hip may be dropped or raised dependent upon whether the patient is actively compensating as above or not compensation shifts the centre of gravity to the affected side and also decreases the angle between the hip adductor muscles and femur both of which decrease the forces needing to be applied by the hip adductor muscles to maintain relevant posture the gluteus medius is very important during the stance phase of the gait cycle to maintain both hips at the same level moreover one leg stance accounts for about 60 of the gait cycle furthermore during the stance phase of the gait cycle there is approximately three times the body weight

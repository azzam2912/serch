it includes any suspended solids e g sediment dissolved chemicals e g caco or biologic material e g diatoms in addition to the water itself synonyms vary by discipline for example a fluvial hydrologist studying natural river systems may define discharge as streamflow whereas an engineer operating a reservoir system might define discharge as outflow which is contrasted with inflow gh dury and mj bradshaw are two hydrologists who devised the models showing the relationship between discharge and other variables in a river the bradshaw model described how pebble size and other variables change from source to mouth while dury considered the relationships between discharge and variables such as stream slope and friction the units that are typically used to express discharge include m s cubic meters per second ft s cubic feet per second or cfs and or acre feet per day for example the average discharge of the rhine river in europe is or per day a commonly applied methodology for measuring and estimating the discharge of a river is based on a simplified form of the continuity equation the equation implies that for any incompressible fluid such as liquid water the discharge q is equal to the

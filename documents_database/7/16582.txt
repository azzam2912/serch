sf and similar systems were used in 20th century carrier systems an sf signaling unit converts dc signaling usually at least in long distance circuits e m signaling to a format characterized by the presence or absence of a single voice frequency tone which is suitable for transmission over an ac path e g a carrier system the sf tone is present in the on hook or idle state and absent during the seized state in the seized state dial pulses are conveyed by bursts of sf tone corresponding to the interruptions in dc continuity created by a rotary dial or other dc dialing mechanism the sf tone may occupy a small portion of the user data channel spectrum e g 1600 hz or 2600 hz sf in band signaling there may be a notch filter at the precise sf frequency either filtering the circuit at all times or only when the circuit is off hook to prevent the user from inadvertently disconnecting a call if the users voice has a sufficiently strong spectral content at the sf frequency a falsing condition known as talk off notoriously this property was exploited by blue boxers and other toll fraudsters the sf

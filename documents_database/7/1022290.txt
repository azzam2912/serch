the first installation designated an fps 17 xw 1 at diyarbakir was originally intended to provide surveillance of the ussr s missile test range at kapustin yar south of stalingrad especially to detect missile launchings the data it produced however exceeded surveillance requirements permitting the derivation of missile trajectories the identification of earth satellite launches the calculation of a satellite s ephemeris position and orbit and the synthesis of booster rocket performance the success achieved by this fixed beam radar led to the co location of a tracking radar an fps 79 beginning in mid 1964 together these radars had the capability for estimating the configuration and dimensions of satellites or missiles and observing the reentry of manned or unmanned vehicles a second fps 17 installation was made at laredo texas which was used primarily as a research and development site the final operational installation was made at shemya island alaska for missile detection experimentation with the detection of missiles by a modified scr 270 radar in 1948 and 1949 at holloman air force base new mexico along with u s experience in the use of high power components on other radars created a basis for believing that a megawatt

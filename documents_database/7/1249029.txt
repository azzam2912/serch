the main applications are in sobolev spaces where spaces of functions that have a noninteger number of derivatives are interpolated from the spaces of functions with integer number of derivatives the theory of interpolation of vector spaces began by an observation of j zef marcinkiewicz later generalized and now known as the riesz thorin theorem in simple terms if a linear function is continuous on a certain space and also on a certain space then it is also continuous on the space for any intermediate between and in other words is a space which is intermediate between and in the development of sobolev spaces it became clear that the trace spaces were not any of the usual function spaces with integer number of derivatives and jacques louis lions discovered that indeed these trace spaces were constituted of functions that have a noninteger degree of differentiability many methods were designed to generate such spaces of functions including the fourier transform complex interpolation real interpolation as well as other tools see e g fractional derivative a banach space is said to be continuously embedded in a hausdorff topological vector space when is a linear subspace of such that the inclusion map from

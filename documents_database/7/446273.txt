it serves as part of a negative feedback loop in signal transduction it is only sensitive to the neurotransmitters or hormones released by the neuron on which the autoreceptor sits similarly a heteroreceptor is sensitive to neurotransmitters and hormones that are not released by the cell on which it sits a given receptor can act as either an autoreceptor or a heteroreceptor depending upon the type of transmitter released by the cell on which it is embedded autoreceptors may be located in any part of the cell membrane in the dendrites the cell body the axon or the axon terminals canonically a presynaptic neuron releases a neurotransmitter across a synaptic cleft to be detected by the receptors on a postsynaptic neuron autoreceptors on the presynaptic neuron will also detect this neurotransmitter and often function to control internal cell processes typically inhibiting further release or synthesis of the neurotransmitter thus release of neurotransmitter is regulated by negative feedback autoreceptors are usually g protein coupled receptors rather than transmitter gated ion channels and act via a second messenger as an example norepinephrine released from sympathetic neurons may interact with the alpha 2a and alpha 2c adrenoreceptors to inhibit further release of norepinephrine

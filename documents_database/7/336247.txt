it is a white solid that is soluble in organic solvents it is used as a ligand in coordination chemistry forming strong complexes with most metal ions phenanthroline may be prepared by two successive skraup reactions of glycerol with o phenylenediamine catalyzed by sulfuric acid and an oxidizing agent traditionally aqueous arsenic acid or nitrobenzene dehydration of glycerol gives acrolein which condenses with the amine followed by a cyclization in terms of its coordination properties phenanthroline is similar to 2 2 bipyridine bipy but binds metals more tightly since the chelating nitrogen donors are preorganized phenanthroline is however a weaker donor than bipy many homoleptic complexes are known particularly well studied is fe phen called ferroin it was used for the photometric determination of fe ii it is used as a redox indicator with standard potential 1 06 v the reduced ferrous form has a deep red colour and the oxidised form is light blue the pink complex ni phen has been resolved into its and isomers copper i forms cu phen which is luminescent the ferroin analogue ru phen has long been known to be bioactive 1 10 phenanthroline is an inhibitor of metallopeptidases with one of the first

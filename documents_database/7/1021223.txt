the main difference between both systems is that igla requires the space station to collaborate in the docking maneuver by reorienting itself to point the docking port to the spacecraft while kurs allows to dock with a fully stationary space station the main reason for this change was that mir was to be a much bigger space station than the older salyut so the propellant consumption would be excessive kurs provided the automated docking system for all russian spacecraft that docked with the mir space station when used for docking the soyuz or progress vehicle broadcasts radar pulses from multiple antennas the variation in strength between the antennas allows the system to compute relative position attitude and approach rate the system is designed for automatic rendezvous and docking but in an emergency cosmonauts may take command of the vehicle either locally or from the international space station after the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 the kurs system became the property of ukraine its manufacturer became a competitor in the space launch business with the russian federal space agency rka due to hard currency problems kiev also raised the price of the kurs system consequently rka sought to phase

in the above example though this would not work because it would make the knowledge base inconsistent in the case where kb p a q a q b kb p b and kb p b so with the closed world assumption kb p a p b q a q b where kb p b in data management completeness is metaknowledge that can be asserted for parts of the kb via completeness assertions as example a knowledge base may contain complete information for predicates r and s while nothing is asserted for predicate t then consider the following queries for query 1 the knowledge base would return a complete answer as only predicates that are themselves complete are intersected for query 2 no such conclusion could be made as predicate t is potentially incomplete

qualitatively it corresponds to a potential which is zero everywhere except at a single point where it takes an infinite value this can be used to simulate situations where a particle is free to move in two regions of space with a barrier between the two regions for example an electron can move almost freely in a conducting material but if two conducting surfaces are put close together the interface between them acts as a barrier for the electron that can be approximated by a delta potential the delta potential well is a limiting case of the finite potential well which is obtained if one maintains the product of the width of the well and the potential constant while decreasing the well s width and increasing the potential this article for simplicity only considers a one dimensional potential well but analysis could be expanded to more dimensions the time independent schr dinger equation for the wave function of a particle in one dimension in a potential is where is the reduced planck constant and is the energy of the particle the delta potential is the potential where is the dirac delta function it is called a delta potential well if

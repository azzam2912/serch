the isoelastic utility function is a special case of hyperbolic absolute risk aversion and at the same time is the only class of utility functions with constant relative risk aversion which is why it is also called the crra utility function it is where formula 2 is consumption formula 3 the associated utility and formula 4 is a constant that is positive for risk averse agents since additive constant terms in objective functions do not affect optimal decisions the term 1 in the numerator can be and usually is omitted except when establishing the limiting case of formula 5 as below when the context involves risk the utility function is viewed as a von neumann morgenstern utility function and the parameter formula 4 is the degree of relative risk aversion the isoelastic utility function is a special case of the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion hara utility functions and is used in analyses that either include or do not include underlying risk there is substantial debate in the economics and finance literature with respect to the empirical value of formula 4 while relatively high values of formula 4 as high as 50 in some models are necessary to explain the behavior

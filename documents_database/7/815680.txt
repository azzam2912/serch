the log works by measuring small electric potentials measured in millivolts between depths with in the borehole and a grounded electrode at the surface conductive bore hole fluids are necessary to create a sp response so the sp log cannot be used in nonconductive drilling muds e g oil based mud or air filled holes the change in voltage through the well bore is caused by a buildup of charge on the well bore walls clays and shales which are composed predominantly of clays will generate one charge and permeable formations such as sandstone will generate an opposite one spontaneous potentials occur when two aqueous solutions with different ionic concentrations are placed in contact through a porous semi permeable membrane in nature ions tend to migrate from high to low ionic concentrations in the case of sp logging the two aqueous solutions are the well bore fluid drilling mud and the formation water connate water the potential opposite shales is called the baseline and typically shifts only slowly over the depth of the borehole the relative salinity of the mud and the formation water will determine the which way the sp curve will deflect opposite a permeable formation generally if

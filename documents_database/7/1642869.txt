more specifically the process of experimentally breaking the tight covariance evident among component traits of a complex phenotype by altering the variance of one trait relative to another typically body size is one of the two traits the measurements of the two traits are plotted against each other and the scaling relationship can be represented as formula 1 manipulations of this sort alter the scaling relationships either by shifting the intercept b slope m or both to create novel variants see allometry for more details these novel variants can then be tested for differences in performance or fitness through careful testing one could sequentially test each component of a trait suite to determine how each part contributes to the function of the entire complex phenotype and ultimately the fitness of the organism this technique allows for comparison within or among biological groups differing in size by adjusting morphology to match one another and comparing their performances allometric engineering has been used to test david lack s hypothesis in the lizard sceloporus occidentalis in this study two populations were engineered to fit the morphology of the other by manipulating egg yolk quantity removing effect of size difference between groups after manipulation

it may also be called a dominating vertex as it forms a one element dominating set in the graph a graph that contains a universal vertex may be called a cone in this context the universal vertex may also be called the apex of the cone however this terminology conflicts with the terminology of apex graphs in which an apex is a vertex whose removal leaves a planar subgraph the stars are exactly the trees that have a universal vertex and may be constructed by adding a universal vertex to an independent set the wheel graphs similarly may be formed by adding a universal vertex to a cycle graph in geometry the three dimensional pyramids have wheel graphs as their skeletons and more generally the graph of any higher dimensional pyramid has a universal vertex as the apex of the pyramid the trivially perfect graphs the comparability graphs of order theoretic trees always contain a universal vertex the root of the tree and more strongly they may be characterized as the graphs in which every connected induced subgraph contains a universal vertex the connected threshold graphs form a subclass of the trivially perfect graphs so they also contain a universal

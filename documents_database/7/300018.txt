some pathologies such as cancer have particularly improved visibility with iodinated contrast the radiodensity of iodinated contrast is 25 30 hounsfield units hu per milligram of iodine per milliliter at a tube voltage of 100 120 kvp iodine based contrast media are usually classified as ionic or non ionic both types are used most commonly in radiology due to their relatively harmless interaction with the body and its solubility contrast media are primarily used to visualize vessels and changes in tissues on radiography and ct contrast media can also be used for tests of the urinary tract uterus and fallopian tubes it may cause the patient to feel as if they have had urinary incontinence it also puts a metallic taste in the mouth of the patient the iodine may be bound either in an organic non ionic compound or an ionic compound ionic agents were developed first and are still in widespread use depending on the requirements but may result in additional complications organic agents which covalently bind the iodine have fewer side effects as they do not dissociate into component molecules many of the side effects are due to the hyperosmolar solution being injected i e they deliver

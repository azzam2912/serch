rise fall times and signal harmonics are related to the output driver the data transfer rates can be dependent on hardware or can be controlled by software and often have to meet a certain protocol impedances trace loading and the various circuit components are hardware related and must be considered from the beginning of the design three basic actions for emission reduction can be defined in the following all components that can be influenced by the software design will be described microcontrollers require a clock source for the switching of the internal transistors almost all controllers require an external crystal or ceramic resonator since the ceramic resonator is potentially sensitive to spikes which can shorten clock periods typically a pierce oscillator configuration is used harmonic frequencies of the clock cause unwanted emissions the circuit internal to the mc in simplified form is a nand gate followed by an inverter the external oscillator is not the only source of emissions the system clock circuits consists of an internal rf divider followed by large amplifiers these amplifiers drive long lines inside the components and might cause interferences the use of internal oscillators instead of external ones should be preferred an additional hardware

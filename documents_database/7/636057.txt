hyperbolic dehn surgery exists only in dimension three and is one which distinguishes hyperbolic geometry in three dimensions from other dimensions such an operation is often also called hyperbolic dehn filling as dehn surgery proper refers to a drill and fill operation on a link which consists of drilling out a neighborhood of the link and then filling back in with solid tori hyperbolic dehn surgery actually only involves filling we will generally assume that a hyperbolic 3 manifold is complete suppose m is a cusped hyperbolic 3 manifold with n cusps m can be thought of topologically as the interior of a compact manifold with toral boundary suppose we have chosen a meridian and longitude for each boundary torus i e simple closed curves that are generators for the fundamental group of the torus let formula 1 denote the manifold obtained from m by filling in the i th boundary torus with a solid torus using the slope formula 2 where each pair formula 3 and formula 4 are coprime integers we allow a formula 5 to be formula 6 which means we do not fill in that cusp i e do the empty dehn filling so m formula

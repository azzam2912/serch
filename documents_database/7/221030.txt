b s haldane in 1957 before the invention of dna sequencing technologies it was not known how much polymorphism dna harbored however alloenzyme studies were beginning to make it clear that substantial polymorphism existed this was puzzling because the amount of polymorphism known to exist seemed to exceed the theoretical limits that haldane calculated that is the limits imposed if polymorphisms present in the population generally influenced an organism s fitness kimura s landmark paper on neutral theory in 1968 built on haldane s work to suggest that most molecular evolution is neutral resolving the dilemma although neutral evolution remains the consensus theory among modern biologists and thus kimura s resolution of haldane s dilemma is widely regarded as correct some biologists argue that adaptive evolution explains a large fraction of substitutions in protein coding sequence and they propose alternative solutions to haldane s dilemma in the introduction to the cost of natural selection haldane writes that it is difficult for breeders to simultaneously select all the desired qualities partly because the required genes may not be found together in the stock but he writes especially in slowly breeding animals such as cattle one cannot cull even half the females

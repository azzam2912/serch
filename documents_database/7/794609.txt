networks of electric clocks connected by wires to a precision master pendulum clock began to be used in institutions like factories offices and schools around 1900 today many radio clocks are synchronised by radio signals or internet connections to a worldwide time system called coordinated universal time utc which is governed by master atomic clocks in many countries a modern atomic version of a master clock is the large clock ensemble found at the u s naval observatory in the days before the availability of highly accurate reference time many master clocks were an accurate electrically maintained pendulum clock thousands of such clocks were installed in schools offices railway networks telephone exchanges and factories all over the world they resembled a longcase clock but had a very robust mechanism and a less ornate case the clock timing signals generated by electrical contacts attached to the mechanism were minute half minute and sometimes one second electrical pulses fed to the controlled equipment on pairs of wires the devices driven could be wall clocks tower clocks factory sirens school bells and occasionally clock chiming mechanisms some types such as the synchronome had optional extra mechanisms to compare the time of the clock

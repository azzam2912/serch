side scan sonar imagery is also a commonly used tool to detect debris items and other obstructions on the seafloor that may be hazardous to shipping or to seafloor installations by the oil and gas industry in addition the status of pipelines and cables on the seafloor can be investigated using side scan sonar side scan data are frequently acquired along with bathymetric soundings and sub bottom profiler data thus providing a glimpse of the shallow structure of the seabed side scan sonar is also used for fisheries research dredging operations and environmental studies it also has military applications including mine detection side scan uses a sonar device that emits conical or fan shaped pulses down toward the seafloor across a wide angle perpendicular to the path of the sensor through the water which may be towed from a surface vessel or submarine or mounted on the ship s hull the intensity of the acoustic reflections from the seafloor of this fan shaped beam is recorded in a series of cross track slices when stitched together along the direction of motion these slices form an image of the sea bottom within the swath coverage width of the beam the sound

the display technology was similar to the tektronix 4010 terminal using a storage tube display to avoid the need for video ram they were all in one designs with the display keyboard cpu and dc300 tape drive in a single desktop case they also included a gpib parallel bus interface for controlling lab and test equipment as well as connecting to external peripherals a simple operating system and basic interpreter were included in rom a key concept of the systems was the use of a storage tube for the display this allowed the screen to retain images drawn to it eliminating the need for a framebuffer computer memory devoted to the display most systems of the era had limited resolution due to the expense of the buffer needed to hold higher resolution images but this was eliminated in the 4050s and allowed the resolution to be as high as the hardware could handle which was ostensibly 1024 by 1024 but limited by the physical layout of the screen to 1024 by 780 it also allowed the machine to dedicate all of its memory to the programs running on it as opposed to partitioning off a section for the buffer the

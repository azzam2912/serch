it was for underwater work rather than for combat diving the main oxygen cylinders are on the diver s back the oxygen cylinders at the front of the diver are for bailout in its basic mode it was an oxygen rebreather but some of the cylinders could be replaced by diluent cylinders for nitrox mode which the navy called mixture and then the set was sometimes called cdmba the royal navy was using nitrox from 1944 but did not reveal its nitrox techniques and in the 1960s and afterwards civilian divers had to retread the same ground and develop nitrox diving independently in later years it was called dssccd from diving set self contained clearance diver the cdba was very popular with the clearance divers it is comfortable since there is no cylinder on the middle of the back no bulky buoyancy compensator and it requires very little weight as the rebreather has a single pendulum breathing tube the diver must breathe deeply to avoid carbon dioxide build up the counterlung is eight litres as with all rebreathers the diver should breathe continuously to keep the gas flowing over the absorbent dives on the unit are limited to 90 minutes

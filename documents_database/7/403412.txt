jan wolff and israel lyon chaikoff at the university of california is a presumed reduction in thyroid hormone levels caused by ingestion of a large amount of iodine in 1948 wolff and chaikoff reported that injection of iodine in rats almost completely inhibited organification thyroglobulin iodination in the thyroid gland however recent research into the study shows that the thyroid hormone levels of the rats were not checked prior to injections patients with graves disease are more sensitive than euthyroid patients and iodine has been used to manage graves disease the wolff chaikoff effect is known as an autoregulatory phenomenon that inhibits organification in the thyroid gland the formation of thyroid hormones inside the thyroid follicle and the release of thyroid hormones into the bloodstream this becomes evident secondary to elevated levels of circulating iodide the wolff chaikoff effect is an effective means of rejecting a large quantity of imbibed iodide and therefore preventing the thyroid from synthesizing large quantities of thyroid hormone excess iodide transiently inhibits thyroid iodide organification in individuals with a normal thyroid the gland eventually escapes from this inhibitory effect and iodide organification resumes however in patients with underlying autoimmune thyroid disease the suppressive action of

although bonobos are not a subspecies of chimpanzee pan troglodytes but rather a distinct species in their own right both species are sometimes referred to collectively using the generalized term chimpanzees or chimps taxonomically the members of the chimpanzee bonobo subtribe panina comprised entirely by the genus pan are collectively termed panins the bonobo is distinguished by relatively long legs pink lips dark face and tail tuft through adulthood and parted long hair on its head the bonobo is found in a area of the congo basin in the democratic republic of the congo central africa the species is omnivorous and inhabits primary and secondary forests including seasonally inundated swamp forests because of political instability in the region and the timidity of bonobos there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat along with the common chimpanzee the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans as the two species are not proficient swimmers the formation of the congo river 1 5 2 million years ago possibly led to the speciation of the bonobo bonobos live south of the river and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee which live north

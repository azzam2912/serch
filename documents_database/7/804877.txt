modern electronic units were patented in 1973 variations and improvements seem to get patented every few years clinical trials were conducted by david avery md in the 1980s at columbia university following a long line of basic laboratory research that showed animals circadian rhythms to be exquisitely sensitive to the dim gradually rising dawn signal at the end of the night there are two types of dawn that have been used effectively in a clinical setting a naturalistic dawn mimicking a springtime sunrise but used in mid winter when it is still dark outside and a sigmoidal shaped dawn 30 minutes to 2 hours when used successfully patients are able to sleep through the dawn and wake up easily at the simulated sunrise after which the day s treatment is over the theory behind dawn simulation is based on the fact that early morning light signals are much more effective at advancing the biological clock than are light signals given at other times of day see phase response curve dawn simulation generally uses light sources that range in illuminance from 100 to 300 lux while bright light boxes are usually in the 10 000 lux range approximately 19 of patients

a microscope which has many knobs to adjust the lenses to obtain a sharp image has little chance of obtaining an optimally functioning image by randomly turning the knobs the chances of a clear image are not so bad if the number of knobs is low but the chances will decrease dramatically if the number of adjustable parameters knobs is larger than two or three fisher introduced a geometric metaphor which eventually became known as fisher s geometric model in his model fisher argues that the functioning of the microscope is analogous to the fitness of an organism the performance of the microscope depends on the state of various knobs that can be manipulated corresponding to distances and orientations of various lenses whereas the fitness of an organism depends on the state of various phenotypic character such as body size and beak length and depth the increase in the fitness of an organism by random changes is then analogous to the attempt to improve the performance of a microscope through randomly changing the positions of the knobs on the microscope the analogy between the microscope and an evolving organism can be formalized by representing the phenotype of an organism as

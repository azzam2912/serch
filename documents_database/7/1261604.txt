it was initially named after the recreational mathematician william kolakoski 1944 97 who discussed it in 1965 but subsequent research has revealed that it first appeared in a paper by rufus oldenburger in 1939 the initial terms of the kolakoski sequence are each symbol occurs in a run a sequence of equal elements of either one or two consecutive terms and writing down the lengths of these runs gives exactly the same sequence conversely one can say that each term of the kolakoski sequence generates a run of one or two future terms the first 1 of the sequence generates a run of 1 i e itself the first 2 generates a run of 22 which includes itself the second 2 generates a run of 11 and so on each number in the sequence is the length of the next run to be generated and the element to be generated alternates between 1 and 2 this animation illustrates the process these self generating properties which remain if the sequence is written without the initial 1 mean that the kolakoski sequence can be described as a fractal or mathematical object that encodes its own representation on other scales bertran steinsky has

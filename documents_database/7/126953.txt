because of this it is also known as algebraic quantum field theory aqft the axioms are stated in terms of an algebra given for every open set in minkowski space and mappings between those let mink be the category of open subsets of minkowski space m with inclusion maps as morphisms we are given a covariant functor formula 1 from mink to uc alg the category of unital c algebras such that every morphism in mink maps to a monomorphism in uc alg isotony the poincar group acts continuously on mink there exists a pullback of this action which is continuous in the norm topology of formula 2 poincar covariance minkowski space has a causal structure if an open set v lies in the causal complement of an open set u then the image of the maps and commute spacelike commutativity if formula 5 is the causal completion of an open set u then formula 6 is an isomorphism primitive causality a state with respect to a c algebra is a positive linear functional over it with unit norm if we have a state over formula 2 we can take the partial trace to get states associated with formula 8

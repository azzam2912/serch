air force on 30 april 1996 the tacit blue technology demonstration program was designed to prove that such an aircraft could continuously monitor the ground situation deep behind the battlefield and provide targeting information in real time to a ground command center in december 1976 darpa and the u s air force initiated the battlefield surveillance aircraft experimental bsax program which was part of a larger air force program called pave mover the bsax program s goal was to develop an efficient stealth reconnaissance aircraft with a low probability of intercept radar and other sensors that could operate close to the forward line of battle with a high degree of survivability tacit blue represented the black component in the larger assault breaker program which intended to validate the concept of massed standoff attacks on advancing armoured formations using smart munitions the pave mover radar demonstrators provided the non stealth portion of the program s targeting system whereas tacit blue was intended to demonstrate a similar but stealth capability while validating a number of innovative stealth technology advances the radar sensor technology developed for tacit blue evolved into the radar now being used by the e 8 joint stars aircraft tacit

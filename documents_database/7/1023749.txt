it is a white solid that is used as a reagent for preparing active esters in peptide synthesis nhs is commonly found in organic chemistry or biochemistry where it is used as an activating reagent for carboxylic acids activated acids basically esters with a good leaving group can react with amines to form amides for example whereas a normal carboxylic acid would just form a salt with an amine a common way to synthesize an nhs activated acid is to mix nhs with the desired carboxylic acid and a small amount of an organic base in an anhydrous solvent a coupling reagent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide dcc or ethyl dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide edc is then added to form a highly reactive activated acid intermediate nhs reacts to form a less labile activated acid the group itself is usually written as suo or osu in chemical notation such an ester with an acid and nhs sometimes called succinate ester is stable enough to be purified and stored at low temperatures in the absence of water and as such is commercially available nhs esters are commonly used for protein modification e g an nhs ester of fluorescein is commercially available and can be added

different toxic lectins are present in seeds of different origin modeccin is found in the roots of the african plant adenia digitata these roots are often mistaken for edible roots which has led to some cases of intoxication sometimes the fruit is eaten or a root extract is drunk as a manner of suicide modeccin consist of two subunits that are bound by a disulfide linkage the intact protein has a molecular weight of approximately 57 63 kda when treated with mercaptoethanol the chains can be dissociated into two subunits subunit a with a mass of 25 28 kda and subunit b with a mass of 31 35 kda the a chain is called the effectomer and possesses ribosomal inactivating properties the b chain contains the carbohydrate binding site and it is termed the haptomer while the intact toxin molecules have potent cytotoxic effects on cells they exhibit no ribosomal inactivating activity on ribosomes in a cell free system by contrast reduction of the toxin with a disulfide reducing agent creates the opposite effects reduced dissociated toxin subunits inhibit ribosomal activity in cell free systems but they have no effect on intact cells the reason for these properties is due

solar telescopes usually detect light with wavelengths in or not far outside the visible spectrum obsolete names for sun telescopes include heliograph and photoheliograph solar telescopes need optics large enough to achieve the best possible diffraction limit but less so for the associated light collecting power of other astronomical telescopes however recently newer narrower filters and higher framerates have also driven solar telescopes towards photon starved operations both the european solar telescope est as well as the advanced technology solar telescope atst have larger apertures not only to increase the resolution but also to increase the light collecting power because solar telescopes operate during the day seeing is generally worse than for night time telescopes because the ground around the telescope is heated which causes turbulence and degrades the resolution to alleviate this solar telescopes are usually built on towers and the structures are painted white the dutch open telescope is built on an open framework to allow the wind to pass through the complete structure and provide cooling around the telescope s main mirror another solar telescope specific problem is the heat generated by the tightly focused sunlight for this reason a heat stop is an integral part of

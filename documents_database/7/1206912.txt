the theory of reciprocal altruism can be used to explain behaviors that are performed by a donor who receives some sort of benefit in the future when no such compensation is received however reciprocity fails to explain altruistic behavior to explain competitive altruism roberts uses the example of preening among birds because certain birds cannot reach parasites on all parts of their bodies particularly their necks they benefit from preening one another for any given bird there is an entire flock of potential preeners who compete in hopes of establishing a beneficial relationship cheaters or those birds that try to be preened without preening others do not compete and thus are excluded from these relationships their fitness is lowered because they are ostracized by members of the flock mcnamara et al quantitatively analyzed this theory like robert axelrod they created a computer program to simulate repeated interactions among individuals the program involved players with two genetically determined traits a cooperative trait and a choosiness trait they found the following results paradoxical trait combinations yield particularly low payoffs individuals with low choosiness but high effort tend to get exploited by their co players individuals with high choosiness but low effort waste

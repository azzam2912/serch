organisms that originate from contaminated areas may already be able to break down waste but perhaps inefficiently and slowly bioaugmentation usually requires studying the indigenous varieties present in the location to determine if biostimulation is possible if the indigenous variety do not have the metabolic capability to perform the remediation process exogenous varieties with such sophisticated pathways are introduced bioaugmentation is commonly used in municipal wastewater treatment to restart activated sludge bioreactors most cultures available contain microbial cultures already containing all necessary microorganisms b licheniformis b thuringiensis p polymyxa b stearothermophilus penicillium sp aspergillus sp flavobacterium arthrobacter pseudomonas streptomyces saccharomyces triphoderma etc activated sludge systems are generally based on microorganisms like bacteria protozoa nematodes rotifers and fungi which are capable of degrading biodegradable organic matter there are many positive outcomes from the use of bioaugmentation such as the improvement in efficiency and speed of the process of breaking down substances and the reduction of toxic particles in an area bioaugmentation is favorable in contaminated soils that have undergone bioremediation but still pose an environmental risk this is because microorganisms that were originally in the environment did not accomplish their task during bioremediation when it came to breaking down chemicals in

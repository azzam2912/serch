the chemical conversion of co already occurs on an industrial scale in the manufacture of solvents such as formic acid but photochemical reduction differs in that it relies on a renewable energy source the sun because co is a greenhouse gas there is environmental interest in producing artificial systems that are efficient photocatalysts but the low conversion rates of current methods have prohibited wide scale industrial application photochemical reduction follows from chemical reduction redox but it differs in that the electrons used for reduction are generated from the photoexcitation of another molecule called a photosensitizer to harness the sun s energy the photosensitizer must be able to absorb light within the visible and ultraviolet spectrum molecular sensitizers that meet this criterion often include a metal center as the d orbital splitting in organometallic species often falls within the energy range of far uv and visible light the reduction process begins with excitation of the photosensitizer as mentioned this causes the movement of an electron from the metal center into the functional ligands this movement is termed a metal to ligand charge transfer mlct back electron transfer from the ligands to the metal after the charge transfer which yields no net

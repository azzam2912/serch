it typically refers to the number of mosfets metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors or mos transistors on an ic chip as all modern ics use mosfets it is the most common measure of ic complexity although the majority of transistors in modern microprocessors are contained in the cache memories which consist mostly of the same memory cell circuits replicated many times the rate at which mos transistor counts have increased generally follows moore s law which observed that the transistor count doubles approximately every two years the largest transistor count in a commercially available microprocessor is 39 54billion mosfets in amd s zen 2 based epyc rome which is a 3d integrated circuit with eight dies in a single package fabricated using tsmc s 7 nm finfet semiconductor manufacturing process the highest transistor count in a graphics processing unit gpu is nvidia s gv100 volta with 21 1billion mosfets manufactured using tsmc s 12 nm finfet process the highest transistor count in any ic chip is samsung s 1tb eufs 3d stacked v nand flash memory chip with 2trillion floating gate mosfets 4bits per transistor as of 2019 the highest transistor count in a non memory chip is a

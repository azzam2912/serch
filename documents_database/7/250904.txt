it is a water quality parameter used to assess the quality of a specimen of any type of water or water body ocean water for example or wastewater after treatment in a wastewater treatment plant it is listed as a conventional pollutant in the u s clean water act total dissolved solids is another parameter acquired through a separate analysis which is also used to determine water quality based on the total substances that are fully dissolved within the water rather than undissolved suspended particles tss was previously called non filterable residue nfr but was changed to tss because of ambiguity in other scientific disciplines tss of a water or wastewater sample is determined by pouring a carefully measured volume of water typically one litre but less if the particulate density is high or as much as two or three litres for very clean water through a pre weighed filter of a specified pore size then weighing the filter again after the drying process that removes all water on the filter filters for tss measurements are typically composed of glass fibres the gain in weight is a dry weight measure of the particulates present in the water sample expressed in

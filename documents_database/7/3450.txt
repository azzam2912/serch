declination s angle is measured north or south of the celestial equator along the hour circle passing through the point in question the root of the word declination latin declinatio means a bending away or a bending down it comes from the same root as the words incline bend toward and recline bend backward in some 18th and 19th century astronomical texts declination is given as north pole distance n p d which is equivalent to 90 declination for instance an object marked as declination 5 would have a npd of 95 and a declination of 90 the south celestial pole would have a npd of 180 declination in astronomy is comparable to geographic latitude projected onto the celestial sphere and hour angle is likewise comparable to longitude points north of the celestial equator have positive declinations while those south have negative declinations any units of angular measure can be used for declination but it is customarily measured in the degrees minutes and seconds of sexagesimal measure with 90 equivalent to a quarter circle declinations with magnitudes greater than 90 do not occur because the poles are the northernmost and southernmost points of the celestial sphere an object at the

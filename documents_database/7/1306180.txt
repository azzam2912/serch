the cause of the cat gap is disputed but may have been caused by changes in the climate global cooling changes in the habitat and environmental ecosystem the increasingly hypercarnivorous trend of the cats especially the nimravids volcanic activity evolutionary changes in dental morphology of the canidae species present in north america or a periodicity of extinctions called van der hammen cycles all modern carnivorans including cats evolved from miacoids which existed from approximately 66 to 33 million years ago there were other earlier cat like species but proailurus meaning before the cat also called leman s dawn cat which appeared about 30 million years ago is generally considered the first true cat the increase in disparity through the early miocene occurs during a time when few feliform fossils have been found in north america the hypercarnivorous nimravid feliforms were extinct in north america after 26 ma and felids did not arrive in north america until the middle miocene with the appearance of pseudaelurus pseudaelurus crossed over to north america by way of the bering land bridge from surviving populations in asia 18 5 million years ago all modern day cats are descended from pseudaelurus nimravids and barbourofelids were saber

by definition it causes an increased concentration of carbon dioxide hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis hypoventilation is not synonymous with respiratory arrest in which breathing ceases entirely and death occurs within minutes due to hypoxia and leads rapidly into complete anoxia although both are medical emergencies hypoventilation can be considered a precursor to hypoxia and its lethality is attributed to hypoxia with carbon dioxide toxicity hypoventilation may be caused by as a side effect of medicines or recreational drugs hypoventilation may become potentially life threatening many different central nervous system cns depressant drugs such as ethanol benzodiazepines barbiturates ghb sedatives and opioids produce respiratory depression when taken in large or excessive doses or mixed with other depressants strong opiates such as fentanyl heroin or morphine barbiturates and certain benzodiazepines short acting ones and alprazolam are known for depressing respiration in an overdose an individual may cease breathing entirely go into respiratory arrest which is rapidly fatal without treatment opioids in overdose or combined with other depressants are notorious for such fatalities respiratory stimulants such as nikethamide were traditionally used to counteract respiratory depression from cns depressant overdose but offered limited effectiveness a new respiratory stimulant drug called bimu8 is being investigated

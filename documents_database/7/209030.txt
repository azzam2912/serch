while a san makes available several devices and or ports to a single device each system connected to the san should only be allowed access to a controlled subset of these devices ports zoning applies only to the switched fabric topology fc sw it does not exist in simpler fibre channel topologies zoning is different from vsans in that each port can be a member of multiple zones but only one vsan vsan similarly to vlan is in fact a separate network separate sub fabric with its own fabric services including its own separate zoning there are two main methods of zoning the two methods being hard and soft that combine with two sets of attributes name and port more recently the differences between the 2 have blurred all modern san switches then enforce soft zoning in hardware the fabric name service allows each device to query the addresses of all other devices soft zoning restricts only the fabric name service to show only an allowed subset of devices therefore when a server looks at the content of the fabric it will only see the devices it is allowed to see however any server can still attempt to contact any

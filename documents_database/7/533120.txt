most codecs are typically implementations of video coding formats the compression may employ lossy data compression so that quality measurement issues become important shortly after the compact disc became widely available as a digital format replacement for analog audio it became feasible to also store and use video in digital form a variety of technologies soon emerged to do so the primary goal for most methods of compressing video is to produce video that most closely approximates the fidelity of the original source while simultaneously delivering the smallest file size possible however there are also several other factors that can be used as a basis for comparison the following characteristics are compared in video codecs comparisons the quality the codec can achieve is heavily based on the compression format the codec uses a codec is not a format and there may be multiple codecs that implement the same compression specification for example mpeg 1 codecs typically do not achieve quality size ratio comparable to codecs that implement the more modern h 264 specification but quality size ratio of output produced by different implementations of the same specification can also vary each compression specification defines various mechanisms by which raw video

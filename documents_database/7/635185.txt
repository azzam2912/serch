slap is an acronym for superior labral tear from anterior to posterior several symptoms are common but not specific the shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint however the socket the glenoid fossa of the scapula is small covering at most only a third of the ball the head of the humerus it is deepened by a circumferential rim of fibrocartilage the glenoidal labrum previously there was debate as to whether the labrum was fibrocartilaginous as opposed to hyaline cartilage found in the remainder of the glenoid fossa previously it was considered a redundant evolutionary remnant but is now considered integral to shoulder stability most agree that the proximal tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle becomes fibrocartilaginous prior to attaching to the superior aspect of the glenoid the long head of the triceps brachii inserts inferiorly similarly together all of those cartilaginous extensions are termed the glenoid labrum a slap tear or lesion occurs when there is damage to the superior uppermost area of the labrum these lesions have come into public awareness because of their frequency in athletes involved in overhead and throwing activities in turn relating to relatively recent description of labral injuries

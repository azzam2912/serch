a slab refers to the subducting lower plate although some would characterize flat slab subduction as any shallowly dipping lower plate as in western mexico flat slab subduction is associated with the pinching out of the asthenosphere an inland migration of arc magmatism magmatic sweep and an eventual cessation of arc magmatism the coupling of the flat slab to the upper plate is thought to change the style of deformation occurring on the upper plate s surface and form basement cored uplifts like the rocky mountains the flat slab also may hydrate the lower continental lithosphere and be involved in the formation of economically important ore deposits during the subduction a flat slab itself may be deformed or buckling causing sedimentary hiatus in marine sediments on the slab the failure of a flat slab is associated with ignimbritic volcanism and the reverse migration of arc volcanism multiple working hypotheses about the cause of flat slabs are subduction of thick buoyant oceanic crust 15 20 km and trench rollback accompanying a rapidly overriding upper plate and enhanced trench suction the west coast of south america has two of the largest flat slab subduction zones flat slab subduction is occurring at 10

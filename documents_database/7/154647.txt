the imbalance of matter baryons and antimatter antibaryons in the observed universe one of the outstanding problems in modern physics is the predominance of matter over antimatter in the universe the universe as a whole seems to have a nonzero positive baryon number density that is matter exists since it is assumed in cosmology that the particles we see were created using the same physics we measure today it would normally be expected that the overall baryon number should be zero as matter and antimatter should have been created in equal amounts this has led to a number of proposed mechanisms for symmetry breaking that favour the creation of normal matter as opposed to antimatter under certain conditions this imbalance would have been exceptionally small on the order of 1 in every 10 particles a small fraction of a second after the big bang but after most of the matter and antimatter annihilated what was left over was all the baryonic matter in the current universe along with a much greater number of bosons experiments reported in 2010 at fermilab however seem to show that this imbalance is much greater than previously assumed in an experiment involving a series of

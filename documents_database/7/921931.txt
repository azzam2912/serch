one commentator has gone so far as to say one of the most important aspects of the history of the british virgin islands is slavery in 1563 before there had been any european settlement in the british virgin islands sir john hawkins visited the islands with a cargo of slaves bound for hispaniola in 1665 the dutch settlers on tortola were attacked by a british privateer john wentworth who is recorded as capturing 67 slaves which were removed to bermuda this is the first record of slaves actually being kept on tortola the first dutch settlers also built slave pens at port purcell and on scrub island in 1690 the brandenburgers built slave pens on peter island however they later abandoned them in favour of an agreement with the danes to set up a trading outpost on st thomas the brandenburgers and dutch were both expelled by the british although the remains of the pens can still be seen in great harbour peter island and on scrub island after the territory came under british control the islands gradually became a plantation economy as tortola and to a lesser extent virgin gorda came to be settled by plantation owners slave labour

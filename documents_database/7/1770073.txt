the trapezoidal rule is an implicit second order method which can be considered as both a runge kutta method and a linear multistep method suppose that we want to solve the differential equation the trapezoidal rule is given by the formula where formula 3 is the step size this is an implicit method the value formula 4 appears on both sides of the equation and to actually calculate it we have to solve an equation which will usually be nonlinear one possible method for solving this equation is newton s method we can use the euler method to get a fairly good estimate for the solution which can be used as the initial guess of newton s method integrating the differential equation from formula 5 to formula 6 we find that the trapezoidal rule states that the integral on the right hand side can be approximated as now combine both formulas and use that formula 9 and formula 10 to get the trapezoidal rule for solving ordinary differential equations it follows from the error analysis of the trapezoidal rule for quadrature that the local truncation error formula 11 of the trapezoidal rule for solving differential equations can be bounded as

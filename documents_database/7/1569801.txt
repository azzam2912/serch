a growth hormone regulating gene from pacific chinook salmon with a promoter gene from ocean pout were added to the atlantic salmon s genes tillmann 2016 bondar 2010 these two genes enable the gm salmon to grow year round instead of only during spring and summer gm salmon are a commercially competitive alternative to wild caught salmon and to fish farming of unmodified salmon the purpose of the modifications is to increase the speed at which the fish grows without affecting its ultimate size or other qualities gm fish grows to market size in 16 to 18 months rather than three years the latter figure refers to fish farmed atlantic salmon whose growth rates had already been improved over wild fish as a result of traditional selective breeding practices aquadvantage salmon were developed in 1989 by the addition of a single copy of the opafp ghc2 construct which consists of a promoter sequence from ocean pout directing production of a growth hormone protein using the coding sequence from chinook salmon the continuous expression of this transgene allows the fish to grow year round instead of only during spring and summer the stability of the new dna construct was tested revealing

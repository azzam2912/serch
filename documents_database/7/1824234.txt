the majority of calcium ions within the cell are bound to intracellular proteins leaving a minority freely dissociated when calcium is added to or removed from the cytoplasm by transport across the cell membrane or sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium buffers minimise the effect on changes in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration by binding calcium to or releasing calcium from intracellular proteins as a result 99 of the calcium added to the cytosol of a cardiomyocyte during each cardiac cycle becomes bound to calcium buffers creating a relatively small change in free calcium the regulation of free calcium is of particular importance in excitable cells like cardiomyocytes and neurons within these cells many intracellular proteins can act as calcium buffers in cardiac muscle cells the most important buffers within the cytoplasm include troponin c serca calmodulin and myosin while the most important within calcium buffer within the sarcoplasmic reticulum is calsequestrin alterations in calcium buffering within the cytosol have been implicated in the tendency to arrhythmias abnormal cardiac rhythms in some genetic mutations known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy genetic mutations affecting calsequestrin are responsible for an autosomal recessive form of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia an inherited cardiac condition that can lead to sudden

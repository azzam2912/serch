its length measures 9 2 mm the 2 whorls of the protoconch are small and depressed helicoid their axis is at right angles to that of the succeeding turn in the first of which they are slightly immersed the 12 whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded and appressed at the summit they are marked by slender curved moderately regular slightly protractive axial ribs of which 16 occur upon the first to fifth 18 upon the sixth 22 upon the seventh and eighth 24 upon the ninth and tenth and 26 upon the penultimate turn the intercostal spaces are moderately impressed terminating a little posterior to the periphery of the whorls the summit of the succeeding turns falls a little anterior to the termination of the intercostal pits and leaves a smooth band in the suture the sutures are moderately constricted the periphery of the body whorl is obtusely angulated the base of the shell is moderately long and weakly rounded the entire surface of the shell is marked by microscopic striations the aperture is large broad subquadrate and somewhat effuse at the junction of the basal and the outer lip the posterior angle is obtuse the outer lip is

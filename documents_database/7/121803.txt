the mastacembeloidei were removed from the perciformes and added to the synbranchiformes after a phylogenetic analysis by johnson and patterson these authors consider the synbranchiformes to be part of a monophyletic group called smegmamorpha also containing mugilimorpha atherinomorpha gasterosteiformes and elassomatidae there are a total of about 99 species divided over 15 genera in three families there are two suborders synbranchoidei and mastacembeloidei or opisthomi the synbranchoidei has one family the synbranchidae four genera and 17 species the mastacembeloidei has two families chaudhuriidae with four genera and five species and mastacembelidae with three genera and about 26 species these eel like fishes range in size from 8 48 inches 20 150 cm although they are eel like they are not related to true eels anguilliformes the premaxillae are present as distinct bones and are nonprotrusible the gills are poorly developed and their openings are usually single small confluent across the breast and restricted to the lower half of the body oxygen is absorbed through the membranes of the throat or intestine the dorsal and anal fins are low and continuous around the tail tip pelvic fins are absent scales are either absent or very small they lack a swim bladder

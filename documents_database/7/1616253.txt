a nanogenerator has three typical approaches piezoelectric triboelectric and pyroelectric nanogenerators both the piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators can convert mechanical energy into electricity however pyroelectric nanogenerators can be used to harvest thermal energy from a time dependent temperature fluctuation a piezoelectric nanogenerator is an energy harvesting device capable of converting external kinetic energy into electrical energy via action by a nano structured piezoelectric material although its definition may include any types of energy harvesting devices using nano structures to convert various types of ambient energy e g solar power and thermal energy it is generally used to indicate kinetic energy harvesting devices utilizing nano scaled piezoelectric material since its first introduction in 2006 although still in the early stages of development the technology has been regarded as a potential breakthrough toward further miniaturization of conventional energy harvesters possibly leading to facile integration with other types of energy harvesters and the independent operation of mobile electronic devices with reduced concern for sources of energy the working principle of nanogenerator will be explained for 2 different cases the force exerted perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the nanowire the working principle for the first case is explained by a vertically grown

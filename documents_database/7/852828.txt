when the predicted ridership falls between the service requirements of a light rail and heavy rail or metro system an mcs project is indicated an mcs may also result when a rapid transit service fails to achieve the requisite ridership due to network inadequacies e g single tracking or changing demographics in contrast with most light rail systems an mcs usually runs on a fully grade separated exclusive right of way in some cases the distance between stations is much longer than typically found on heavy rail networks an mcs may also be suitable for branch line connections to another mode of a heavy capacity transportation system such as an airport or a main route of a metro network the definition of a medium capacity system varies due to its non standardization inconsistencies in international definitions are even reflected within individual countries for example the taiwan ministry of transportation and communications states that each mcs system can board around 6 000 20 000 passengers per hour per direction p h d or pphpd while the taiwan department of rapid transit systems tcg suggests an mcs has a capability of boarding around 20 000 30 000 p h d and a

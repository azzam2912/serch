the work may be virtual computation elements such as threads processes or data flows which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as processors network links or expansion cards a scheduler is what carries out the scheduling activity schedulers are often implemented so they keep all computer resources busy as in load balancing allow multiple users to share system resources effectively or to achieve a target quality of service scheduling is fundamental to computation itself and an intrinsic part of the execution model of a computer system the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have computer multitasking with a single central processing unit cpu a scheduler may aim at one or more of many goals for example maximizing throughput the total amount of work completed per time unit minimizing wait time time from work becoming ready until the first point it begins execution minimizing latency or response time time from work becoming ready until it is finished in case of batch activity or until the system responds and hands the first output to the user in case of interactive activity or maximizing fairness equal cpu time to each process or more generally appropriate times according to the priority

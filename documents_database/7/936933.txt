the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the cyclin dependent kinase family of ser thr protein kinases this protein kinase is highly similar to the gene products of s cerevisiae cdc28 and s pombe cdc2 also known as cdk1 in humans it is a catalytic subunit of the cyclin dependent kinase complex whose activity is restricted to the g1 s phase of the cell cycle where cells make proteins necessary for mitosis and replicate their dna this protein associates with and is regulated by the regulatory subunits of the complex including cyclin e or a cyclin e binds g1 phase cdk2 which is required for the transition from g1 to s phase while binding with cyclin a is required to progress through the s phase its activity is also regulated by phosphorylation multiple alternatively spliced variants and multiple transcription initiation sites of this gene have been reported the role of this protein in g1 s transition has been recently questioned as cells lacking cdk2 are reported to have no problem during this transition original cell culture based experiments demonstrated cell cycle arrest at the g1 s transition resulting from the deletion of cdk2 later experiments showed that

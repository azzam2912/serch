it is an approach to musical composition that is often associated with minimal music as it shares similar characteristics but some commentators prefer to treat phase music as a separate category phasing is a compositional technique in which the same part a repetitive phrase is played on two musical instruments in steady but not identical tempi thus the two instruments gradually shift out of unison creating first a slight echo as one instrument plays a little behind the other then a doubling effect with each note heard twice then a complex ringing effect and eventually coming back through doubling and echo into unison phasing is the rhythmic equivalent of cycling through the phase of two waveforms as in phasing note that the tempi of the two instruments are almost identical so that both parts are perceived as being in the same tempo the changes only separate the parts gradually in some cases especially live performance where gradual separation is extremely difficult phasing is accomplished by periodically inserting an extra note or temporarily removing one into the phrase of one of the two players playing the same repeated phrase thus shifting the phase by a single beat at a time rather

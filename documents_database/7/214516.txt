these structures are 10 km and 6 8 km in diameter and lie about 70 km west of jabal arkanu on the eastern margin of the al kufrah basin it has been argued that both structures were formed by two simultaneous meteorite impacts field investigations by dr p paillou dr a rosenqvist and others reported the presence of impact breccias at the structures bottom shatter cones pointing toward the center of the structures and microscopic planar deformation features pdfs found in quartz grains of sandstones outcropping in these structures based on these reports and other observations it was proposed that both structure are extraterrestrial impact craters that were formed simultaneously as a double impact event less than 140 million years ago jurassic or younger more recently on the basis of field petrographic and textural observations it is argued that these geological structures are not extraterrestrial impact craters field studies of these geological structures found a lack of identifiable shatter cones at both structures instead the striations which were previously reported shatter cones are identified as ventifacts created by wind erosion in sandstones these striations are surficial features that are unrelated to fracturing of the sandstone are consistently oriented with the

most studies utilize animal models that have varying degrees of comparison to the human brain for example small rodents are less comparable than non human primates one of the most definitive ways of determining which sections of the brain contribute to certain behavior or function is to deactivate a section of the brain and observe what behavior is altered investigators have a wide range of options for deactivating neural tissue and one of the more recently developed methods being used is deactivation through cooling cortical cooling refers to the cooling methods restricted to the cerebral cortex where most higher brain processes occur below is a list of current cooling methods their advantages and limitations and some studies that have used cooling to elucidate neural functions there are a few options for cooling neural tissue the chosen method depends on the experimental design including the section of the brain being cooled the section of interest and the volume of that section cryoloops are cooling devices that use 23 gauge stainless steel hypodermic tubing shaped into a loop that can fit into sulci or on the gyri of the section of interest of the cerebral cortex a pump draws methanol from a

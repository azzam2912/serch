it will consist in a 12 month orbital study of the effects of the outer space environment on astrobiologically relevant materials in an external exposure facility on the international space station the project which will be launched sometime in 2016 will examine the evolution of complex organic molecules in outer space as well as the forms in which prebiotic organic compounds has been preserved it will also study the role that solid mineral surfaces play in the photo chemical evolution transport and distribution of organics the principal in investigator is pascale ehrenfreund the objective of oreocube is to investigate the influence of mineralogically relevant inorganic materials on the stability modification and degradation of the organic molecules during long duration radiation exposure on the international space station iss organic compounds thought to be the starting material for prebiotic chemistry could have partly had an extraterrestrial origin this addition could have been done by bombardment by comets and meteorites which contain organic molecules see also pseudo panspermia oreocube is packaged as an identical pair of cubes each weighing uv visible nir spectrometer a 24 sample carousel and integral optics enabling use of the sun as a light source for spectroscopy along with

this era of extinction is believed to have been caused by a relatively steady period of cooling that resulted in the growth of ice sheet volumes globally and the reestablishment of the ice of the east antarctic ice sheet eais cooling that led to the middle miocene disruption has been attributed to co being pulled out of the earth s atmosphere by organic material before becoming caught in different locations like the monterey formation other ideas as to the cause for this cooling are connected to changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation this period was preceded by the miocene climatic optimum a period of relative warmth from 18 to 14 ma one of the primary effects of the climatic cooling that took place during this time period was the growth of the east antarctic ice sheet eais significant sections of ice on the antarctic continent are believed to have started growth at the beginning of the middle miocene disruption and continued to expand until about 10 ma this growth has been attributed primarily to changes in oceanic and atmospheric currents and is considered to have been amplified by a significant drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide ppm atmospheric co fell temporarily

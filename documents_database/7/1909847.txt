the straight dope a newspaper column devoted to exposing myths reported that it is one of the classic urban legends however there have been real life instances where babies have been roasted in some versions the baby is accidentally cooked when miscommunication occurs for example put the turkey in the oven and the baby in the bed is wrongly heard as put the baby in the oven and the turkey in the bed other variants set out that the doer of the deed was drug or alcohol induced or an insane individual in the end the roasted baby is sometimes served as food to be consumed by the parents the person who roasts the baby is usually a babysitter or the baby s sibling in real life there have been documented occurrences of babies being roasted though by family members instead of strange babysitters when virginian elizabeth renee otte roasted her baby in 1999 the incident was cited as causing the legend to become true in november 2006 a second case of real life baby roasting was reported in may 2012 a british citizen was arrested by thai police after being found in possession of six corpses of roasted infants

this gene encodes a 28s subunit protein of the mitochondrial ribosome mitoribosome and plays key roles in translation cellular respiration and apoptosis moreover dap3 is associated with cancer development but has been observed to aid some cancers while suppressing others the dap3 gene encodes a 46 kda protein located in the lower area of the small mitoribosomal subunit this protein contains a p loop motif that binds gtp and a highly conserved 17 residue targeting sequence responsible for its localization to the mitochondria of interest many of the phosphorylation sites on this protein are highly conserved and clustered around gtp binding motifs several splice variants were observed in human ests that differ largely in the 5 utr region pseudogenes for this gene are also found in chromosomes 1 and 2 dap3 is a 28s subunit protein of mitoribosomes and localizes to the mitochondrial matrix as part of the mitoribosome dap3 participates in the translation of the 13 etc complex proteins encoded in the mitochondrial genome and consequently in the regulation of cellular respiration as a member of the death associated protein dap family dap3 can also be found outside of the mitochondria to initiate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through its

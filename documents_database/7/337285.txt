tca is a fungal metabolite of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol which is used as a fungicide it can be found in minute traces on packaging materials stored in the presence of fiberboard treated with trichlorophenol tca is the chemical primarily responsible for cork taint in wines tca has also been implicated as a major component of the rio defect in coffees from central and south america which refers to a taste described as medicinal phenolic or iodine like tca is usually produced when naturally occurring airborne fungi and bacteria usually aspergillus sp penicillium sp actinomycetes botrytis cinerea rhizobium sp or streptomyces are presented with chlorinated phenolic compounds which they then convert into chlorinated anisole derivatives the chlorophenols can originate from various contaminants such as those found in some pesticides and wood preservatives chlorophenols can also be a product of the chlorine bleaching process used to sterilize or bleach wood paper and other materials they can be synthesized by reaction of hypochlorites with lignin they can also migrate from other objects such as shipping pallets treated by chlorophenols the odor of tca is not directly perceived instead the molecule distorts the perception of smell by suppressing olfactory signal transduction the effect

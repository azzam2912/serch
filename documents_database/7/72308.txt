it is used to indicate which protocol is encapsulated in the payload of the frame the same field is also used to indicate the size of some ethernet frames ethertype was first defined by the ethernet ii framing standard and later adapted for the ieee 802 3 standard this field is used by the data link layer to determine which protocol to hand over the payload to on the receiving end in modern implementations of ethernet the field within the ethernet frame used to describe the ethertype also can be used to represent the size of the payload of the ethernet frame historically depending on the type of ethernet framing that was in use on an ethernet segment both interpretations were simultaneously valid leading to potential ambiguity ethernet ii framing considered these octets to represent ethertype while the original ieee 802 3 framing considered these octets to represent the size of the payload in bytes in order to allow ethernet ii and ieee 802 3 framing to be used on the same ethernet segment a unifying standard ieee 802 3x 1997 was introduced that required that ethertype values be greater than or equal to 1536 that value was chosen because

these expressions both make it simple to prove that the laws of classical electromagnetism take the same form in any inertial coordinate system and also provide a way to translate the fields and forces from one frame to another however this is not as general as maxwell s equations in curved spacetime or non rectilinear coordinate systems this article uses the classical treatment of tensors and einstein summation convention throughout and the minkowski metric has the form diag 1 1 1 1 where the equations are specified as holding in a vacuum one could instead regard them as the formulation of maxwell s equations in terms of total charge and current for a more general overview of the relationships between classical electromagnetism and special relativity including various conceptual implications of this picture see classical electromagnetism and special relativity lorentz tensors of the following kinds may be used in this article to describe bodies or particles the signs in the following tensor analysis depend on the convention used for the metric tensor the convention used here is corresponding to the minkowski metric tensor the electromagnetic tensor is the combination of the electric and magnetic fields into a covariant antisymmetric tensor whose

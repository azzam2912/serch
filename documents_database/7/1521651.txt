with four of five convex whorls a very short spire and a large body whorl the sculpture is very finely cancellated or reticulated the whorls are usually rather evenly rounded moderately convex but often have a very slightly marked rounded shoulder the suture is somewhat impressed rather oblique the protoconch is relatively not small with the apex not prominent so that it appears to be obtuse or rounded smooth and glassy the whole surface below the protoconch is covered by fine raised revolving cinguli separated by slight grooves of about the same width and by equally fine slightly sinuous transverse riblets coincident with the lines of growth and receding in a distinct curve on the subsutural band the crossing of these two sets of lines produces a finely cancellated sculpture over the whole surface but the transverse lines are usually more evident on the convexity of the whorls while the spiral lines are more conspicuous anteriorly and on the siphon the aperture is relatively large oblong elliptical slightly obtusely angled posteriorly the sinus is shallow but distinct evenly concave the outer lip is elsewhere evenly convex the siphonal canal is short and broad not constricted at the base by any

for example in a traditional hand excavated water well the level at which the water stabilizes represents the water table or the elevation in the rock where air starts to occupy the rock pores in most situations in the hydrocarbon industry the term is qualified as being an oil water contact abbreviated to owc or a gas water contact gwc often there is also a gas oil contact goc in an oil or gas field hydrocarbons migrate into rocks and can be trapped if there is a permeability barrier to prevent upward escape gas and oil are lighter than water so they will form a bubble at the high end of the trap formed by the impermeable barriers a simple physical model of this would be a coffee cup held upside down underwater with an air bubble occupying the highest portion of the cup s interior the base of the bubble is the water contact capillary action can obscure the true water contact in permeable media like sandstone capillary pressure prevents the hydrocarbons from expelling all of the water in the pores which creates a transition zone between the fully saturated hydrocarbon levels and the fully saturated water levels in

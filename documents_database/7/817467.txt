strain crystallization occurs in natural rubber as well as other elastomers and polymers the phenomenon has important effects on strength and fatigue properties strain crystallization occurs when the chains of molecules in a material become ordered during deformation activities in some polymers and elastomers the three primary factors that affect strain crystallization are the molecular structure of the polymer or elastomer the temperature and the deformation being applied to the material if a polymer s molecular structure is too irregular strain crystallization can not be induced because it is impossible to order the chains of molecules in order to induce strain crystallization the polymer or elastomer is stretched while its temperature is kept above its glass transition temperature it is also necessary for the yield point of the polymer to be exceed by the stretching activity this in turn will ensure that the chains of molecules are straightened in general the greater the deformation applied to the material the higher the rate of crystallization the mechanical properties of materials are greatly affected by the orientation of the crystals in their micro structure the process of strain crystallization directly affects the micro structure of the material by adding crystalline structures strain

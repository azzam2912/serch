it is a member of the rac subfamily of the rho family of small g proteins and is encoded by the gene rhog rhog was first identified as a coding sequence upregulated in hamster lung fibroblasts upon stimulation with serum expression of rhog in mammals is widespread and studies of its function have been carried out in fibroblasts leukocytes neuronal cells endothelial cells and hela cells rhog belongs to the rac subgroup and emerged as a consequence of retroposition in early vertebrates rhog shares a subset of common binding partners with rac cdc42 and rhou v members but a major specificity is its inability to bind to crib domain proteins such as paks like most small g proteins rhog is involved in a diverse set of cellular signalling mechanisms in mammalian cells these include cell motility through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton gene transcription endocytosis neurite outgrowth protection from anoikis and regulation of the neutrophil nadph oxidase as with all small g proteins rhog is able to signal to downstream effectors when bound to gtp guanosine triphosphate and unable to signal when bound to gdp guanosine diphosphate three classes of protein interact with rhog to regulate gtp gdp loading the

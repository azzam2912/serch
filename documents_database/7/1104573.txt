it belongs to the histone deacetylase class of enzymes responsible for the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues at the n terminal region of the core histones h2a h2b h3 and h4 as such it plays an important role in gene expression by facilitating the formation of transcription repressor complexes and for this reason is often considered an important target for cancer therapy though the functional role of the class to which hdac2 belongs has been carefully studied the mechanism by which hdac2 interacts with other histone deacetylases of other classes has yet to be elucidated hdac2 is broadly regulated by protein kinase 2 ck2 and protein phosphatase 1 pp1 but biochemical analysis suggests its regulation is more complex evinced by the coexistence of hdac1 and hdac2 in three distinct protein complexes essentially the mechanism by which hdac2 is regulated is still unclear by virtue of its various interactions though a mechanism involving p300 cbp associated factor and hdac5 has been proposed in the context of cardiac reprogramming generally hdac2 is considered a putative target for the treatment for a variety of diseases due to its involvement in key cell cycle progressions specifically hdac2 has been shown to play

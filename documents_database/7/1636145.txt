these included small platinum spiral loops to replace pipettes and microwell plates instead of test tubes he introduced the idea of using calibrated spiral loops for multiple serial dilution in plastic microwell plates and coined the term micromethods first published in hungarian in 1952 and in english in 1955 for laboratory procedures carried out on a small scale this allowed for the use of very small volumes of blood in virus research and a considerable reduction in the use of costly serums and antigens the original spiral loop was similar to the platinum loop used in bacteriology tak tsy improved it by forming multiple windings in the loop somewhat like the filament of an incandescent light bulb the narrow gaps between the windings drew a constant volume of fluid by capillary action these were calibrated and arranged in arrays enabling efficient dilution procedures the reliability of this microtechnique led to its being adopted as the standard method for serological testing at the communicable disease center tak tsy carried out research on the variability of antigenic structure and the pathology and epidemiology of influenza virus mutations as well as vaccine production and control published in some 50 papers he was head

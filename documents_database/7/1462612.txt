it is one of three forms of learning as defined by the oecd the others being informal learning which typically takes place naturally as part of some other activity and non formal learning which includes everything else such as sports instruction provided by non trained educators without a formal curriculum formal learning theory is the formal study of inductive problems and their intrinsic solvability for both ideal and computable agents modal operator theory has very little to do with formal learning theory especially with respects to research on logical reliability theory was first pursued under the name formal learning theory given to the discipline by osherson et al 1986 this name is somewhat misleading as it suggests a study of how cognizers learn with this in mind kevin kelly renamed the approach computational epistemology 1991 1996 which reflects its historical roots in computability theory while avoiding misinterpretation computer scientists are in the business of recommending and providing programs and algorithms for various empirical purposes from this perspective learning is about reliable convergence to correct answers on various empirical questions thus learning theory is the formal study of inductive problems and their complexity and solvability for both ideal and turing computable

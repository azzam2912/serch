both of these teams play in the same division afc east and as a result play two scheduled games each season both represent the same state new york with the bills having their primary fan base in western new york and the jets in the new york city area they have a long history between each other as they were original members of the american football league in 1960 this rivalry is fueled primarily by the differences between new york city and the rest of new york state and also by the bills claiming to be the only team in new york due to the jets and their nfc counterparts new york giants actually playing their games in east rutherford new jersey a suburb of the city however the two teams have rarely been successful at the same time and as such their rivalry usually lacks the intensity that is present in other rivalries such as the jets rivalry with the patriots and the bills with the dolphins there have only been four seasons in which both the bills and jets finished with winning records regardless the two teams share a bond due to similarities in their team playing styles

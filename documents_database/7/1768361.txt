thus the more complex a dna sequence the richer its oligonucleotide vocabulary whereas repetitious sequences have relatively lower complexities subsequent work improved the original algorithm described in trifonov 1990 without changing the essence of the linguistic complexity approach the meaning of lc may be better understood by regarding the presentation of a sequence as a tree of all subsequences of the given sequence the most complex sequences have maximally balanced trees while the measure of imbalance or tree asymmetry serves as a complexity measure the number of nodes at the tree level is equal to the actual vocabulary size of words with the length in a given sequence the number of nodes in the most balanced tree which corresponds to the most complex sequence of length n at the tree level is either 4 or n i 1 whichever is smaller complexity of a sequence fragment with a length rw can be directly calculated as the product of vocabulary usage measures u vocabulary usage for oligomers of a given size can be defined as the ratio of the actual vocabulary size of a given sequence to the maximal possible vocabulary size for a sequence of that length for example u

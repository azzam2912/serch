it is suspected that the star is hotter larger and more massive than the sun the magnitude is 7 this star is too faint to be in naked eye visibility as of 2005 at least one extrasolar planet has been confirmed to be orbiting the star the first planet discovered hd 50499 b is a gas giant with mass of 1 7 times jupiter it is a long period taking 351 weeks to orbit the star the planet s eccentric orbit passes through the average distance of 574 gm or 18 6 pc the planet was discovered by four team members including steven vogt in 2005 using their radial velocity method which used to measure changes in red and blue shifting of the star that indicate the presence of planets caused by gravitational tug there is also a linear trend in the radial velocities which may indicate an additional outer planet the best two planet model gives a different period and mass for the inner planet 9 8 years and 3 4 jupiter masses with an outer planet of 2 1 jupiter masses in a 37 year orbit however the two planet model does not represent a significant improvement over

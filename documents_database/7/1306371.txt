as a prodrug it exhibits the therapeutic effect upon being metabolized cndac lasts longer in the bloodstream by being metabolized from sapacitibine than by being directly administered the compound interferes with dna synthesis by causing single strand dna breaks due to cndac being incorporated into dna during replication or repair then inducing arrest of the cell division cycle at g2 phase both sapacitabine and its major metabolite cndac have demonstrated potent anti tumor activity in both blood and solid tumors in preclinical studies in a liver metastatic mouse model sapacitabine was shown to be superior to gemcitabine gemzar lilly or 5 fu two widely used nucleoside analogs in delaying the onset and growth of liver metastasis cyclacel has initiated a number of clinical trials to evaluate sapacitabine in both solid and hematological tumors laying the foundation for future phase 2 studies and combination studies with other anti cancer agents three phase 1 studies have been completed which evaluated safety and pharmacokinetics of a variety of dosing schedules in approximately 120 patients with solid tumors sapacitabine is being evaluated as of march 2016 in three different studies a phase 3 trial for elderly patients with aml acute myeloid leukemia a phase

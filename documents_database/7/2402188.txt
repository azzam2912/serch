a 1995 model of earth s dynamo predicted super rotations of up to 3 degrees per year the following year this prediction was supported by observed discrepancies in the time that p waves take to travel through the inner and outer core seismic observations have made use of a direction dependence anisotropy of the speed of seismic waves in the inner core as well as spatial variations in the speed other estimates come from free oscillations of earth the results are inconsistent and the existence of a super rotation is still controversial but it is probably less than 0 1 degrees per year when geodynamo models take into account gravitational coupling between the inner core and mantle it lowers the predicted super rotation to as little as 1 degree per million years for the inner core to rotate despite gravitational coupling it must be able to change shape which places constraints on its viscosity at the center of earth is the core a ball with a mean radius of 3480 kilometres that is composed mostly of iron the outer core is liquid while the inner core with a radius of 1220 km is solid because the outer core has a

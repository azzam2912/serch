then formula 2 is called tale or separable if formula 5 as formula 1 algebras where formula 7 is an algebraically closed extension of formula 1 and formula 9 is an integer equivalently formula 2 is tale if it is isomorphic to a finite product of separable extensions of formula 1 when these extensions are all of finite degree formula 2 is said to be finite tale in this case one can replace formula 7 with a finite separable extension of formula 1 in the definition above a third definition says that an tale algebra is a finite dimensional commutative algebra whose trace form x y tr xy is non degenerate the name tale algebra comes from the fact that a finite dimensional commutative algebra over a field is tale if and only if formula 15 is an tale morphism consider the formula 16 algebra formula 17 this is etale because it is a separable field extension a simple non example is given by formula 18 since formula 19 the category of tale algebras over a field k is equivalent to the category of finite g sets with continuous g action where g is the absolute galois group of k

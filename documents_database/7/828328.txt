they are called sonic or acoustic black holes because these trapped phonons are analogous to light in astrophysical gravitational black holes physicists are interested in them because they have many properties similar to astrophysical black holes and in particular emit a phononic version of hawking radiation the border of a sonic black hole at which the flow speed changes from being greater than the speed of sound to less than the speed of sound is called the event horizon at this point the frequency of phonons approaches zero sonic black holes are possible because phonons in perfect fluids exhibit the same properties of motion as fields such as gravity in space and time for this reason a system in which a sonic black hole can be created is called a gravity analogue nearly any fluid can be used to create an acoustic event horizon but the viscosity of most fluids creates random motion that makes features like hawking radiation nearly impossible to detect the complexity of such a system would make it very difficult to gain any knowledge about such features even if they could be detected many nearly perfect fluids have been suggested for use in creating sonic black

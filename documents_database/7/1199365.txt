the first type seeks to model the experimental data quantitatively i e to reproduce the measurements of current and voltage exactly the renowned hodgkin huxley model of the axon from the loligo squid exemplifies such models although qualitatively correct the h h model does not describe every type of excitable membrane accurately since it considers only two ions sodium and potassium each with only one type of voltage sensitive channel however other ions such as calcium may be important and there is a great diversity of channels for all ions as an example the cardiac action potential illustrates how differently shaped action potentials can be generated on membranes with voltage sensitive calcium channels and different types of sodium potassium channels the second type of mathematical model is a simplification of the first type the goal is not to reproduce the experimental data but to understand qualitatively the role of action potentials in neural circuits for such a purpose detailed physiological models may be unnecessarily complicated and may obscure the forest for the trees the fitzhugh nagumo model is typical of this class which is often studied for its entrainment behavior entrainment is commonly observed in nature for example in the

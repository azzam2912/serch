465 a ring is right hermite if for every two elements a and b of the ring there is an element d of the ring and an invertible 2 by 2 matrix m over the ring such that a b m d 0 the term left hermite is defined similarly matrices over such a ring can be put in hermite normal form by right multiplication by a square invertible matrix p 468 appendix to i 4 calls this property k hermite using hermite instead in the sense given below according to i 4 p 26 a ring is right hermite if any finitely generated stably free right module over the ring is free this is equivalent to requiring that any row vector b b of elements of the ring which generate it as a right module i e br br r can be completed to a not necessarily square invertible matrix by adding some number of rows the criterion of being left hermite can be defined similarly p 528 earlier called a commutative ring with this property an h ring according to 0 4 a ring is hermite if in addition to every stably free left module being free it

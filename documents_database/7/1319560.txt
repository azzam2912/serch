if the cycles of the cover have no vertices in common the cover is called vertex disjoint or sometimes simply disjoint cycle cover in this case the set of the cycles constitutes a spanning subgraph of g a disjoint cycle cover of an undirected graph if it exists can be found in polynomial time by transforming the problem into a problem of finding a perfect matching in a larger graph if the cycles of the cover have no edges in common the cover is called edge disjoint or simply disjoint cycle cover similar definitions exist for digraphs in terms of directed cycles finding a vertex disjoint cycle cover of a directed graph can also be performed in polynomial time by a similar reduction to perfect matching however adding the condition that each cycle should have length at least 3 makes the problem np hard the permanent of a 0 1 matrix is equal to the number of vertex disjoint cycle covers of a directed graph with this adjacency matrix this fact is used in a simplified proof showing that computing the permanent is p complete the problems of finding a vertex disjoint and edge disjoint cycle covers with minimal number

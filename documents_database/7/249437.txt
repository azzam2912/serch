there is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assist an assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ball however the original definition of an assist did not include such situations so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matter only the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal unlike in other sports such as ice hockey a pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the nba but does in fiba play only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is made point guards tend to get the most assists per game apg as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler centers tend to get fewer assists but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assisting being inside the key the center often has the best angles and the best position

it is used in plant biology to characterize the growth environment of plants both light and temperature are important environmental variables that determine the growth and development of plants light is especially important in driving photosynthesis and producing sugars temperature is a strong driver of cell division where available sugars are converted to produce new leaf stem root or reproductive biomass as such both are important factors along with nutrient and water availability in determining the source sink balance of a plant the amount of sugar available for plant in relation to its growth potential the photothermal ratio is a quantitative descriptor that can be used to approximate this balance the photothermal ratio is calculated by dividing the daily light integral photosynthetic photon flux density integrated over a day dli plants are exposed to by a baseline daily temperature t ptr dli t units are therefore mol quanta m day c alternatively the number of degree days have been used rather than t per se with units of the form mol degree day the ptr concept has been introduced in detailed studies of growth and productivity of a particular species for these species a baseline temperature t is chosen for

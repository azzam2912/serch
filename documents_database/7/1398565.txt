fossils have been found in the urumaco formation in urumaco venezuela and the solim es formation of brazil the strata from which remains are found are late miocene in age rather than pliocene as was once thought a possible member of this genus survived into the late holocene in the solomon islands ikanogavialis had a dorsoventrally deep snout and a distinctive notch between the dentary and maxillary alveoli the external nares projected anterodorsally from the rostrum this can be seen as a plesiomorphic characteristic in crocodilians but given that the earliest gavialoids possessed dorsally projecting external nares this feature can be seen as having been a reversal from the gavialoid apomorphy back to the crocodilian plesiomorphy rather than having been directly obtained from an early crocodilian ancestor the type species of ikanogavialis is i gameroi it was named in 1970 from material found from the urumaco formation a pleistocene gavialoid named gavialis papuensis from murua part of the solomon islands bears some vague similarities with ikanogavialis and was referred to the genus in 1999 along with other slender snouted forms from the neogene of south america and africa ikanogavialis may have lived in a coastal paleoenvironment along with other gavialids

while this usually means a running play any offensive play that does not involve a forward pass is a rush also called a run it is usually done by the running back after a handoff from the quarterback although quarterbacks and wide receivers can also rush the quarterback will usually run when a passing play has broken down such as when there is no receiver open to catch the ball and there is room to run down the field a team with a quarterback who is fast and skilled at running may regularly call intentional running plays for that quarterback but this is rare due to the increased risk of injury a wide receiver can act as a rusher on several kinds of plays such as on a reverse on an end around or on a lateral pass behind the line of scrimmage which is a type of screen pass however a wide receiver screen play is usually intended to be a forward pass so that if the receiver drops the ball it is an incomplete pass instead of a fumble a rushing attempt may also be referred to as a carry with any yards gained referred to as rushing

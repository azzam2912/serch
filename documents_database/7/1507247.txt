genes can be regulated by regions far from the promoter such as regulatory elements insulators and boundary elements and transcription factor binding sites tfbs uncovering the interplay between regulatory regions and gene coding regions is essential for understanding the mechanisms governing gene regulation in health and disease maston et al 2006 chia pet can be used to identify unique functional chromatin interactions between distal and proximal regulatory transcription factor binding sites and the promoters of the genes they interact with chia pet can also be used to unravel the mechanisms of genome control during processes such as cell differentiation proliferation and development by creating chia pet interactome maps for dna binding regulatory proteins and promoter regions we can better identify unique targets for therapeutic intervention fullwood yijun 2009 the chia pet method combines chip based methods kuo allis 1999 and chromosome conformation capture 3c to extend the capabilities of both approaches chip sequencing chip seq is a popular method used to identify tfbs while 3c has been used to identify long range chromatin interactions dekker et al 2002 however both suffer from limitations when used independently to identify de novo long range interactions genome wide while chip seq is typically

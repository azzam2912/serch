a roof surface may be either functionally flat or pitched the pitch of a roof is its vertical rise over its horizontal span however most often a ratio of pitch also fraction is slang used for the more useful slope of rise over run of just one side half the span of a dual pitched roof this is the slope of geometry stairways and other construction disciplines or the trigonometric arctangent function of its decimal fraction in the imperial measurement systems pitch is usually expressed with the rise first and run second in the usa run is held to number 12 in the usa the rise is rationalized to a ratio of so many measuring units rise to each 12 measuring units of run e g 3 12 4 12 5 12 places that use metric measurement systems use a degree angle or what fall there is per unit of run and expressed as a 1 in slope a 1 in 1 equals 45 where convenient the least common multiple is used e g a 3 in 4 slope for a 9 in 12 or 1 in 1 1 3 the pitch matters for a variety of reasons including the

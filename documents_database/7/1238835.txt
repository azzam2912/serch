approximately 200 new cases are diagnosed worldwide each year a recent study showed the presence of the dnajb1 prkaca chimeric transcript resulting from a 400kb somatic deletion on chromosome 19 in 100 of the fhccs examined 15 15 this gene fusion has been confirmed in a second study the histopathology of fhcc is characterized by laminated fibrous layers interspersed between the tumor cells cytologically the tumor cells have a low nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm tumors are non encapsulated but well circumscribed when compared to conventional hcc which typically has an invasive border due to lack of symptoms until the tumor is sizable this form of cancer is often advanced when diagnosed symptoms include vague abdominal pain nausea abdominal fullness malaise and weight loss they may also include a palpable liver mass other presentations include jaundice ascites fulminant liver failure encephalopathy gynecomastia males only thrombophlebitis of the lower limbs recurrent deep vein thrombosis anemia and hypoglycemia the usual markers for liver disease aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase are often normal or only slightly elevated fhcc often does not produce alpha fetoprotein afp a widely used marker for conventional hepatocellular carcinoma it is associated with elevated

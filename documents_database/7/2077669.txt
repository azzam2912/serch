this transcription factor is found in adults in the cerebellum kidneys and cerebrum but plays a larger role in development of the fetal head and the female reproductive tract during gestation during development it is found in the anterior visceral endoderm is in tissues formed by the primitive streak and is required in both tissues for head formation lim1 is a member of the lim homeobox gene and encodes a 406 amino acid protein in mice lim 1 acts in the early development of the mesoderm and ectoderm layers of the developing embryo the factor is induced by the increasing concentrations of cerebrus dkk1 and nodal around day 7 9 in the mouse embryo lim 1 contributes to the formation of the anterior portion of the developing head containing the forebrain and midbrain research studies have shown that knocking out lim 1 in mice will cause a range of head deformities including the complete lack of formation of the head lim 1 is also essential for the development of the female reproductive tract as it causes the persistence of the mullerian ducts that will eventually develop into the oviducts uterus cervix and vagina without the expression of lim 1 formation

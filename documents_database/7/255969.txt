these satellites are commonly used for communication purposes such as radio and television networks back haul and direct broadcast traditional global navigation systems do not use geosynchronous satellites but some sbas navigation satellites do a number of weather satellites are also present in geosynchronous orbits not included in the list below are several more classified military geosynchronous satellites such as pan listings are from west to east decreasing longitude in the western hemisphere and increasing longitude in the eastern hemisphere by orbital position starting and ending with the international date line a special case of geosynchronous orbit is the geostationary orbit which is a circular geosynchronous orbit at zero inclination that is directly above the equator a satellite in a geostationary orbit appears stationary always at the same point in the sky to ground observers popularly or loosely the term geosynchronous may be used to mean geostationary specifically geosynchronous earth orbit geo may be a synonym for geosynchronous equatorial orbit or geostationary earth orbit communications satellites are often given geostationary orbits or close to geostationary so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move but can be pointed permanently at the fixed location in the

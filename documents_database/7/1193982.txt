it is associated with ngc 1955 part of the n51 h region the brightness and colour of lh54 425 were measured in 1974 in 1996 m s oey determined that lh54 425 has an apparent visual magnitude of 13 13 and classified it as an o3 class giant a series of photometric and spectroscopic observations carried out by p ostrov between from 1998 to 2001 revealed that lh54 425 varied very slightly with a regular period of 2 2475 days due to distorted stars in a close binary system composed by an o3 class giant and an approximately o5 class companion the masses of the two stars were estimated at and a derivation of the orbit in 2008 using more accurate radial velocity data defined the companions as o3 and o5 main sequence stars with masses of and respectively the binary system has an orbital period of 2 days 5 hours and 56 minutes the two stars are separated by only 15 times the width of the sun or less than twice their own diameters the more massive primary orbits at 200 km s while the secondary moves at 350 km s and the system as a whole is approaching

as a result there have been several studies conducted on the nuclei of kiss neurons in the arcuate arc and anteroventral periventricular avpv parts of the brains of modules such as rats kisspeptins behave as ligands for the g protein coupled receptor gpr54 21 23 which is believed to regulate gnrh and gonadotropin hormone secretion kisspeptins also trigger the release of gnrh lh from the hypothalamus by in an experiment conducted by researchers at the university of washington the national university of c rdoba and the university of maryland it was discovered that female rats have a greater kiss 1 gene expression because they have a more kiss 1 neurons than their male counterparts this conclusion was determined by comparing kiss 1 mrna levels in the avpv and arc in the male and female rats after subjecting them to different hormonal conditions through this it was shown that female rats expressed higher levels of kiss 1 mrna in the avpv however there appeared to be no difference in the kiss 1 expression in the arc between male and female rats their research suggests that sex differences in kiss 1 gene expression in the avpv region of the brain might play

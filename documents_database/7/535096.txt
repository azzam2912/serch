glutathione reductase ec 1 8 1 7 catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide gssg to the sulfhydryl form glutathione gsh which is a critical molecule in resisting oxidative stress and maintaining the reducing environment of the cell glutathione reductase functions as dimeric disulfide oxidoreductase and utilizes an fad prosthetic group and nadph to reduce one molar equivalent of gssg to two molar equivalents of gsh the glutathione reductase is conserved between all kingdoms in bacteria yeasts and animals one glutathione reductase gene is found however in plant genomes two gr genes are encoded drosophila and trypanosomes do not have any gr at all in these organisms glutathione reduction is performed by either the thioredoxin or the trypanothione system respectively glutathione plays a key role in maintaining proper function and preventing oxidative stress in human cells it can act as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals singlet oxygen and various electrophiles reduced glutathione reduces the oxidized form of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase which in turn reduces hydrogen peroxide h2o2 a dangerously reactive species within the cell in addition it plays a key role in the metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics acts as a cofactor in certain detoxifying enzymes participates in transport and

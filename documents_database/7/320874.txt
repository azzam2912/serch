it is different from nanophthalmos in which the eye is small in size but has no anatomical alterations the presence of a small eye within the orbit can be a normal incidental finding but in most cases it is abnormal and results in blindness the incidence is 14 per 100 000 and the condition affects 3 11 of blind children microphthalmia in newborns is sometimes associated with fetal alcohol syndrome or infections during pregnancy particularly herpes simplex virus rubella and cytomegalovirus cmv but the evidence is inconclusive genetic causes of microphthalmia include chromosomal abnormalities trisomy 13 patau syndrome triploid syndrome 13q deletion syndrome and wolf hirschhorn syndrome or monogenetic mendelian disorders the latter may be autosomal dominant autosomal recessive or x linked the following genes have been implicated in microphthalmia many of which are transcription and regulatory factors how these genes result in the eye disorder is unknown but it has been postulated that interference with the process of eye growth after birth may be involved in contrast to anophthalmia absence of eyeball which originates much earlier during foetal development sox2 has been implicated in a substantial number 10 15 of cases and in many other cases failure to develop

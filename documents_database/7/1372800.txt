casing will be installed at various depths while drilling it is held in place by cement which also provides zone isolation casing is run to protect the wellbore from fluids pressures and wellbore stability problems down hole equipment such as centralizers and turbolizers are used to ensure obtaining satisfactory zone isolation float shoes and collars float valves prevent backflow after the cement has been pumped into place devices fitted with hinged collars and bow springs help keep the casing or liner in the center of the wellbore to help ensure efficient placement of a cement sheath around the casing string if casing strings are cemented off center there is a high risk that a channel of drilling fluid or contaminated cement will be left where the casing contacts the formation creating an imperfect seal turbolizers have added fins to stir up the drilling fluid and cement to keep the flow turbulent in order to make sure the cement flows all the way around the casing in order to prevent channeling scratchers use metal wires to scrape mud cake off permeable zones to help obtain a solid cement column there are four types of centralizers bow spring rigid semi rigid and

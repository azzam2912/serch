when a second rat was unable to choose the correct lever the first rat noticed not getting a second reward and produced a round of task related neuron firing that made the second rat more likely to choose the correct lever in 2013 rajesh rao was able to use electrical brain recordings and a form of magnetic stimulation to send a brain signal to andrea stocco on the other side of the university of washington campus in 2015 researchers linked up multiple brains of both monkeys and rats to form an organic computer it is hypothesized that by using brain to brain interfaces btbis a biological computer or brain net could be constructed using animal brains as its computational units initial exploratory work demonstrated collaboration between rats in distant cages linked by signals from cortical microelectrode arrays implanted in their brains the rats were rewarded when actions were performed by the decoding rat which conformed to incoming signals and when signals were transmitted by the encoding rat which resulted in the desired action in the initial experiment the rewarded action was pushing a lever in the remote location corresponding to the position of a lever near a lighted led at

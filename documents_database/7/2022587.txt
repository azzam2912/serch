they are neotropical social wasps known to have the largest colony sizes and nest sizes among social wasps with some colonies exceeding over one million individuals they are predators of land arthropods consuming both insects and spiders alike recent sperm morphology studies have shown that although vespidae belong to the superfamily vespoidea agelaia vicina may be more phylogenetically related to apoidea a vicina is a eusocial swarming member of the subfamily polistinae within the tribe epiponini the genus agelaia includes nine species a flavipennis a areata a angulicollis a cajennensis a fulvofasciata a myrmecophila a pallipes a yepocapa and a panamaensis by analyzing the ultrastructure of a vicina sperm and comparing it to samples from other species within its superfamily vespidae it has been found that a vicina may be more closely linked to apoidea than to vespidae phylogenetically queens of the species are characterized by smaller heads and larger abdomens relative to workers a vicina are known to create outstandingly large nests the combs themselves are generally horizontal and fairly even neither convex nor concave the cells face downward and comb layers are vertically connected by petioles the bottom combs resemble stratified layers while the top combs expand concentrically

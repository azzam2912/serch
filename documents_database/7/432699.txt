the centrifugal force thus generated encourages a successful pour centrifugal casting or centrifuging is used as a means of casting small detailed parts or jewelry an articulated arm is free to spin around a vertical axle which is driven by an electric motor or a spring the entire mechanism is enclosed in a tub or drum to contain hot metal should the mold break or an excess of metal be used single use molds are prepared using the lost wax method a small amount of metal in a crucible a sort of ceramic pan next to the mold is heated with a torch when the metal is molten the arm is released forcing by centrifugal force the metal into the mold the high forces imposed on the metal overcome the viscosity resulting in a finely detailed workpiece a similar advantage may be obtained by vacuum casting or pressure casting for casting of small parts using hot metal a disk shaped mold is contained within a rotating drum and molten metal is poured into the center many machines are available which can perform centrifugal casting and they are relatively simple to construct all that is required is an arm which rotates

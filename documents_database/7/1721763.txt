it employs digital techniques to extract useful information that is carried by an electrical signal in common usage the term is related to both spectrum analyzers and vector signal analyzers while spectrum analyzers measure the amplitude or magnitude of signals a signal analyzer with appropriate software or programming can measure any aspect of the signal such as modulation today s high frequency signal analyzers achieve good performance by optimizing both the analog front end and the digital back end modern signal analyzers use a superheterodyne receiver to downconvert a portion of the signal spectrum for analysis as shown in the figure to the right the signal is first converted to an intermediate frequency and then filtered in order to band limit the signal and prevent aliasing the downconversion can operate in a swept tuned mode similar to a traditional spectrum analyzer or in a fixed tuned mode in the fixed tuned mode the range of frequencies downconverted does not change and the downconverter output is then digitized for further analysis the digitizing process typically involves in phase quadrature i q or complex sampling so that all characteristics of the signal are preserved as opposed to the magnitude only processing of

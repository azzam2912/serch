it is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4 30 and forms a wide optical double with the slightly dimmer centauri based upon an annual parallax shift of 6 98 mas xi centauri lies roughly 470 light years from the sun at that distance the visual magnitude is diminished by an interstellar extinction factor of 0 32 due to intervening dust this system was discovered to be a single lined spectroscopic binary in 1910 by american astronomer joseph haines moore the pair component a orbit each other with a period of 7 6497 days and an eccentricity of 0 35 the primary is a b type star with a stellar classification of b1 5 v or b2 iv depending on the source this indicates it may be a main sequence star or a more evolved subgiant star it has about 8 1 times the mass of the sun and radiates 1 702 times the solar luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 20 790 k a third star component b is a magnitude 9 38 f type main sequence star with a classification of f7 v it has 1 25 times the

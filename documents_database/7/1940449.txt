a git quotient is a categorical quotient any invariant morphism uniquely factors through it taking proj of a graded ring instead of formula 4 one obtains a projective git quotient which is a quotient of the set of semistable points a git quotient is a categorical quotient of the locus of semistable points i e the quotient of the semistable locus since the categorical quotient is unique if there is a geometric quotient then the two notions coincide for example one has for an algebraic group g over a field k and closed subgroup h if x is a complex smooth projective variety and if g is a reductive complex lie group then the git quotient of x by g is homeomorphic to the symplectic quotient of x by a maximal compact subgroup of g kempf ness theorem let g be a reductive group acting on a quasi projective scheme x over a field and l a linearlized ample line bundle on x let be the section ring by definition the semistable locus formula 7 is the complement of the zero set formula 8 in x in other words it is the union of all open subsets formula 9 for

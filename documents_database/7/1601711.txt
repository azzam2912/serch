mir 127 functions to regulate the expression levels of genes involved in lung development placental formation and apoptosis aberrant expression of mir 127 has been linked to different cancers pri mir 127 is derived from a separate but overlapping conserved gene cluster coding for mir 433 127 mir 127 and mir 433 are overlapped in a 5 3 direction although the loci could be found on different chromosomes in different species the structure has been conserved in mammals including human chimpanzee horse dog monkey rat cow and mouse multiple sequence alignments msa between mir 433 and mir127 have shown 95 100 similarity with a conserved distance between mir 433 and mir 127 of 986 to 1007 bp moreover the upstream response elements in the mir 433 127 promoters including estrogen related receptors response element erre have been conserved among above species data have suggested that that mir 433 127 loci may have evolved from a common gene of origin transcription factor binding sites positioned upstream of mirna precursor play a role in regulating transcription activation of mir 127 and mir 433 promoters is mediated by estrogen related receptor gamma errgamma nr3b3 which physically associates with their endogenous promoters inhibition is

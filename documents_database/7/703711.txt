it is classed as a retro movement the reverse of a normal movement backward running is a less natural motion but can be accomplished with some speed with practice it is better to start out backward walking also called retropedaling which is relatively easy and speed up like normal running running up and down hills backwards will add an additional degree of difficulty running backwards up a hill is not very dangerous it will always be at a lower speed due to the enhanced difficulty and if one trips there is less of a distance towards the ground and it is easier to absorb the impact with the arms and buttocks so that the head is not as likely to hit running backwards down a hill is more dangerous and it is advised that someone learn how to drop into a backward roll before attempting it to deal with any resulting tripping or loss of balance in the prone movement although the distance to the ground is greater running downhill backwards the incline makes it much easier to perform rolls in downhill running than when running level ground so it can be done more instinctively this applies to backward running

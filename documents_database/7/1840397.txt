stratospheric sulfur aerosols spread around the globe by the atmospheric circulation producing surface cooling by scattering solar radiation back to space this cooling effect on the ocean surface usually lasts for several years as the lifetime of sulfate aerosols is about 2 3 years however in the subsurface ocean the cooling signal may persist for a longer time and may have impacts on some decadal variabilities such as the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc volcanic aerosols from huge volcanoes veisea surface temperature sst by approximately 0 2 0 3 c milder than global total surface temperature drop which is 0 3 to 0 5 c according to both global temperature records and model simulations it usually takes several years to be back to normal the volcanic cooling signals in ocean heat content can persist for much longer time decadal or mutil decadal time scale far beyond the duration of volcanic forcing several studies have revealed that krakatau s effect in the heat content can be as long as one century relaxation time of the effects recent volcanoes is generally shorter than those before the 1950s for example the recovery time of ocean heat content of pinatubo which caused comparable radiative

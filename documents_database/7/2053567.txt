the constellation will consist of thousands of mass produced small satellites working in combination with ground transceivers spacex also plans to sell some of the satellites for military scientific or exploratory purposes spacex has deployed 62 satellites they plan to deploy 60 more per launch at a rate of one launch every two weeks beginning in november 2019 in total nearly 12 000 satellites will be deployed by the mid 2020s with a possible later extension to 42 000 the initial 12 000 satellites are planned to orbit in three orbital shells first placing approximately 1 600 in a altitude shell then approximately 2 800 k and k band spectrum satellites at and approximately 7 500 v band satellites at commercial operation could begin in 2020 concerns have been raised about the long term danger of space junk resulting from placing thousands of satellites in orbits above 1000 km and a possible impact on astronomy the total cost of the decade long project to design build and deploy the constellation was estimated by spacex in may 2018 to be about product development began in 2015 with the first two prototype test flight satellites launched in february 2018 a second set

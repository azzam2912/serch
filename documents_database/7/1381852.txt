they are studied primarily in algebraic combinatorics and representation theory the two variable kostka polynomials k q t are known by several names including kostka foulkes polynomials macdonald kostka polynomials or q t kostka polynomials here the indices and are integer partitions and k q t is polynomial in the variables q and t sometimes one considers single variable versions of these polynomials that arise by setting q 0 i e by considering the polynomial k t k 0 t there are two slightly different versions of them one called transformed kostka polynomials the one variable specializations of the kostka polynomials can be used to relate hall littlewood polynomials p to schur polynomials s these polynomials were conjectured to have non negative integer coefficients by foulkes and this was later proved in 1978 by alain lascoux and marcel paul sch tzenberger in fact they show that where the sum is taken over all semi standard young tableaux with shape and weight here charge is a certain combinatorial statistic on semi standard young tableaux the macdonald kostka polynomials can be used to relate macdonald polynomials also denoted by p to schur polynomials s where kostka numbers are special values of the

cyclodextrins are produced from starch by enzymatic conversion they are used in food pharmaceutical drug delivery and chemical industries as well as agriculture and environmental engineering cyclodextrins are composed of 5 or more d glucopyranoside units linked 1 4 as in amylose a fragment of starch the largest cyclodextrin contains 32 1 4 anhydroglucopyranoside units while as a poorly characterized mixture at least 150 membered cyclic oligosaccharides are also known typical cyclodextrins contain a number of glucose monomers ranging from six to eight units in a ring creating a cone shape with a hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic exterior cyclodextrins form complexes with hydrophobic compounds alpha beta and gamma cyclodextrin are all generally recognized as safe by the u s fda they have been applied for delivery of a variety of drugs including hydrocortisone prostaglandin nitroglycerin itraconazol chloramphenicol the cyclodextrin confers solubility and stability to these drugs the inclusion compounds of cyclodextrins with hydrophobic molecules are able to penetrate body tissues these can be used to release biologically active compounds under specific conditions in most cases the mechanism of controlled degradation of such complexes is based on ph change of water solutions leading to the loss of hydrogen or ionic bonds

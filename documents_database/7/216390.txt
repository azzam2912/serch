it reduces the size of the file losslessly that is the resulting crushed image will have the same quality as the source image the main purpose of pngcrush is to reduce the size of the png idat data stream by trying various combinations of compression methods and delta filters it can also be used for various manipulations of png images such as changing the bit depth removing unwanted ancillary chunks or adding certain chunks including gama trns iccp and textual chunks the main use of pngcrush is for reducing the size of the image data contained in the idat section the pixel data in a png file is compressed using lz77 algorithm which tries to find repeated byte sequences in the source data and then further compressed with huffman algorithm this combination is referred to as deflate compression before compressing non destructive delta filters are applied on the pixel data there are five possible filter types that can be specified separately on each scan line and several possible strategies for searching lz77 matches thus there are a very large number of different combinations for how the image can be compressed which combination gives the best compression will depend on the

shuffling is often followed by a cut to help ensure that the shuffler has not manipulated the outcome one of the easiest shuffles to accomplish after a little practice is the overhand shuffle johan jonasson wrote the overhand shuffle is the shuffling technique where you gradually transfer the deck from say your right hand to your left hand by sliding off small packets from the top of the deck in detail as normally performed with the pack initially held in the left hand say most of the cards are grasped as a group from the bottom of the pack between the thumb and fingers of the right hand and lifted clear of the small group that remains in the left hand small packets are then released from the right hand a packet at a time so that they drop on the top of the pack accumulating in the left hand the process is repeated several times the randomness of the whole shuffle is increased by the number of small packets in each shuffle and the number of repeat shuffles performed the overhand shuffle offers sufficient opportunity for sleight of hand techniques to be used to affect the ordering of cards

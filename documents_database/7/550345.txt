it was the closest of wath upon dearne s three railway stations to the town centre lying immediately to its north east over the dearne and dove canal bridge the station was closed when local passenger services on the line ended on 29 june 1959 the line continued to be used for freight traffic until 1988 the buildings were in the manchester sheffield and lincolnshire railway s large double pavilion style an indication that rebuilding had taken place in the last quarter of the 19th century the main building with four bays was on the doncaster bound platform the station buildings were not demolished until the area was cleared during road improvement works in 2004 south yorkshire passenger transport executive has a long term aim to re open this line which would probably involve providing a new station in wath however the executive does not have any funding for this and the radical clearance of the old alignment of the railway for re development since the mid 1990s would make this costly and the actual alignment of any new railway difficult to speculate on

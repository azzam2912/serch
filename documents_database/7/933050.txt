the feed water is put into the steam drum from a feed pump in the steam drum the feed water is then turned into steam from the heat after the steam is used it is then dumped to the main condenser from the condenser it is then pumped to the deaerated feed tank from this tank it then goes back to the steam drum to complete its cycle the feed water is never open to the atmosphere this cycle is known as a closed system or rankine cycle during the early development of boilers water treatment was not so much of an issue as temperatures and pressures were so low that high amounts of scale and rust would not form to such a significant extent especially if the boiler was blown down it was general practice to install zinc plates and or alkaline chemicals to reduce corrosion within the boiler many tests had been performed to determine the cause and possible protection from corrosion in boilers using distilled water various chemicals and sacrificial metals silver nitrate can be added to feedwater samples to detect contamination by seawater use of lime for alkalinity control was mentioned as early as 1900 and

it was discovered on 10 may 2007 by the u s palomar observatory in california the team of unaccredited astronomers at palomar consisted of megan e schwamb michael e brown and david l rabinowitz the minor planet orbits the sun at a distance of 38 6 40 6 au once every 249 years and 1 month 90 983 days its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 02 and an inclination of 18 with respect to the ecliptic the first precovery was taken at the australian siding spring observatory during the digitized sky survey in 1984 extending the body s observation arc by 23 years prior to its discovery observation it came to perihelion around 1888 based on an absolute magnitude of 4 5 and assuming a generic albedo for trans neptunian objects of 0 09 it is about in diameter which makes it likely a dwarf planet as of 2014 the minor planet center listed as a plutino a trans neptunian object in 2 3 mean motion resonance with neptune however the deep ecliptic survey currently shows it as a scattered object based on a 10 million year integration of the orbit

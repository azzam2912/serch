the basic mechanism resembles that of spontaneous raman spectroscopy a pump photon of the angular frequency formula 1 which is absorbed by a molecule has some small probability of inducing some vibrational or rotational transition as opposed to inducing a simple rayleigh transition this makes the molecule emit a photon at a shifted frequency however srs as opposed to spontaneous raman spectroscopy is a third order non linear phenomenon involving a second photon the stokes photon of angular frequency formula 2 which stimulates a specific transition when the difference in frequency between both photons formula 3 resembles that of a specific vibrational or rotational transition formula 4 the occurrence of this transition is resonantly enhanced in srs the signal is equivalent to changes in the intensity of the pump and stokes beams employing a pump laser beam of a constant frequency and a stokes laser beam of a scanned frequency or vice versa allows for the unraveling of the spectral fingerprint of the molecule this spectral fingerprint differs from those obtained by other spectroscopy methods such as rayleigh scattering as the raman transitions confer to different exclusion rules than those that apply for rayleigh transitions the phenomenon of srs was

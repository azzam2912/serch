while the sinoatrial node typically regulates the heartbeat during normal sinus rhythm pacs occur when another region of the atria depolarizes before the sinoatrial node and thus triggers a premature heartbeat the exact cause of pacs is unclear while several predisposing conditions exist pacs commonly occur in healthy young and elderly people elderly people that get pacs usually don t need any further attention besides follow ups due to unclear evidence pacs are often completely asymptomatic and may be noted only with holter monitoring but occasionally they can be perceived as a skipped beat or a jolt in the chest in most cases no treatment other than reassurance is needed for pacs although medications such as beta blockers can reduce the frequency of symptomatic pacs hypertension or abnormally high blood pressure often signifies an elevated level of both psychological and physiological stress often hypertension goes hand in hand with various atrial fibrillations including premature atrial contractions pacs additional factors that may contribute to spontaneous premature atrial contractions could be premature atrial contractions are typically diagnosed with an electrocardiogram holter monitor or cardiac event monitor on an electrocardiogram ecg pacs are characterized by an abnormally shaped p wave since the premature

around the youngest stars they are the reservoirs of material out of which planets may form around mature stars they indicate that planetesimal formation has taken place and around white dwarfs they indicate that planetary material survived the whole of stellar evolution such a disc can manifest itself in various ways according to the widely accepted model of star formation sometimes referred to as the nebular hypothesis a young star protostar is formed by the gravitational collapse of a pocket of matter within a giant molecular cloud the infalling material possesses some amount of angular momentum which results in the formation of a gaseous protoplanetary disc around the young rotating star the former is a rotating circumstellar disc of dense gas and dust that continues to feed the central star it may contain a few percent of the mass of the central star mainly in the form of gas which is itself mainly hydrogen the main accretion phase lasts a few million years with accretion rates typically between 10 and 10 solar masses per year rates for typical systems presented in hartmann et al the disc gradually cools in what is known as the t tauri star stage within this

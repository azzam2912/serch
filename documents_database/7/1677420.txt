it is a secreted glycoprotein often found in the plasma its precise function remains to be elucidated however it is thought to have antioxidant properties this particular protein contains two domains the c terminal and n terminal domain the n terminal domain is larger than the c terminal and the n terminal is thought to be glycosylated selp may have antioxidant properties it can attach to epithelial cells and may protect vascular endothelial cells against peroxynitrite toxicity the high selenium content of selp suggests that it may be involved in selenium intercellular transport or storage the promoter structure of bovine selp suggests that it may be involved in countering heavy metal intoxication and may also have a developmental function the n terminal region always contains one sec residue and this is separated from the c terminal region 9 16 sec residues by a histidine rich sequence the large number of sec residues in the c terminal portion of selp suggests that it may be involved in selenium transport or storage however it is also possible that this region has a redox function n terminal domain allows conservation of whole body selenium and appears to supply selenium to the kidney the

secreted chemical substance from a cell or gland in contrast excretion is the removal of certain substances or waste products from a cell or organism the classical mechanism of cell secretion is via secretory portals at the cell plasma membrane called porosomes porosomes are permanent cup shaped lipoprotein structure at the cell plasma membrane where secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intra vesicular contents from the cell secretion in bacterial species means the transport or translocation of effector molecules for example proteins enzymes or toxins such as cholera toxin in pathogenic bacteria for example vibrio cholerae from across the interior cytoplasm or cytosol of a bacterial cell to its exterior secretion is a very important mechanism in bacterial functioning and operation in their natural surrounding environment for adaptation and survival eukaryotic cells including human cells have a highly evolved process of secretion proteins targeted for the outside are synthesized by ribosomes docked to the rough endoplasmic reticulum er as they are synthesized these proteins translocate into the er lumen where they are glycosylated and where molecular chaperones aid protein folding misfolded proteins are usually identified here and retrotranslocated by er associated degradation to the cytosol where they are

the a36 standard was established by the astm international as with most steels a36 has a density of young s modulus for a36 steel is a36 steel has a poisson s ratio of 0 26 and a shear modulus of a36 steel in plates bars and shapes with a thickness of less than has a minimum yield strength of and ultimate tensile strength of plates thicker than 8 in have a yield strength and the same ultimate tensile strength of the electrical resistance of a36 is 0 142 m at 20 c a36 bars and shapes maintain their ultimate strength up to afterward the minimum strength drops off from at at at a36 is produced in a wide variety of forms including a36 is readily welded by all welding processes as a result the most common welding methods for a36 are the cheapest and easiest shielded metal arc welding smaw or stick welding gas metal arc welding gmaw or mig welding and oxyacetylene welding a36 steel is also commonly bolted and riveted in structural applications

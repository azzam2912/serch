the equations are generalisations of those considered in fermat s last theorem the conjecture is that if the sum of some k th powers equals the sum of some other k th powers then the total number of terms in both sums combined must be at least k diophantine equations such as the integer version of the equation a b c that appears in the pythagorean theorem have been studied for their integer solution properties for centuries fermat s last theorem states that for powers greater than 2 the equation a b c has no solutions in non zero integers a b c extending the number of terms on either or both sides and allowing for higher powers than 2 led to leonhard euler to propose in 1769 that for all integers n and k greater than 1 if the sum of n k th powers of positive integers is itself a k th power then n is greater than or equal to k in symbols if formula 1 where n 1 and formula 2 are positive integers then his conjecture was that n k in 1966 a counterexample to euler s sum of powers conjecture was found by leon

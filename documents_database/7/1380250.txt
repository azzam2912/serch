the classical expression for this alignment torque is given by and shows that the torque is proportional to the strengths of the moment and field and to the angle of misalignment between them from classical mechanics torque is defined as the time rate of change of angular momentum formula 5 or stated mathematically absent any other effects this change in angular momentum would be realized through the dipole moment coming into rotation to align with the field however the effect of a torque applied to an electron s magnetic moment must be considered in light of spin orbit interaction because the magnetic moment of an electron is a consequence of its spin and orbit and the associated angular momenta the magnetic moment of an electron is directly proportional to its angular momentum through the gyromagnetic ratio formula 7 such that the gyromagnetic ratio for a free electron has been experimentally determined as this value is very close to that used for fe based magnetic materials taking the derivative of the gyromagnetic ratio with respect to time yields the relationship thus due to the relationship between an electron s magnetic moment and its angular momentum any torque applied to the magnetic

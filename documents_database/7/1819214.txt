a pbc approach focuses on developing strategic performance metrics and directly relating contracting payment to performance against these metrics common metrics include availability reliability maintainability supportability and total cost of ownership the primary means of accomplishing this are through incentivized long term contracts with specific and measurable levels of operational performance defined by the customer and agreed on by contracting parties the incentivized performance measures aim to motivate the supplier to implement enhanced practices that offer improved performance and cost effective this stands in contrast to the conventional transaction based or waterfall approach where payment is related to completion of milestones and project deliverables in pbc since a part or the whole payment is tied to the performance of the provider and the purchaser does not get involved in the details of the process it becomes crucial to define a clear set of requirements to the provider occasionally governments fail to define the requirements clearly this leaves room for providers to either intentionally or unintentionally misinterpret the requirements which creates a game like situation performance based approaches are most widely used the defense industry but can be applied across any spend category pbc is about buying performance not transactional goods

it was a marine invertebrate found on the seabed in shallow seas it probably evolved during the devonian period and it is believed to be the largest brachiopod that has ever existed gigantoproductus giganteus was a large brachiopod that superficially resembled a cockle fossils of this species have been found with widths of over it had a pair of thick dome shaped valves joined together by a hinge the valves had a small number of broad ribs that radiated from a thick umbo and there were large wing shaped ears of calcareous material on either side the valves were held together by a central strong adductor muscle which left a scar on the inside of the valves the ventral valve also known as the pedicle was covered with spines on the outside the inside of this valve was rough being covered by numerous cone shaped protrusions these are visible in an internal mould of the brachiopod a cast fossil which has been formed when a hole in sediment left by the soft tissues of the dead organism was later infiltrated by mineral matter the fossil record suggests that gigantoproductus giganteus was common between about 345 and 328 million years ago

rubisco is the enzyme responsible for photosynthetic carbon fixation and the groe chaperonins enable the adenosine triphosphate atp dependent folding of many other proteins using oxygen 18 lorimer demonstrated the oxygenase activity of rubisco both in vivo and in vitro he further established the novel mechanism for the activation of rubisco by carbon dioxide the formation of a lysyl carbamate in the active site with his colleagues at dupont he employed chemical quench and other techniques to trap and identify the 6 carbon reaction intermediate of the carboxylation reaction and defined the complete stereo chemical course of the reaction in 1989 using an unequivocally unfolded protein and the purified chaperonin proteins groel and groes his group was the first to demonstrate the atp dependent folding of rubisco and many other proteins with devarajan dave thirumalai he performed a bioinformatic analysis to define the structural elements of the substrate proteins that groel recognizes lorimer has also shown that groel can perform work on substrate protein during allosteric transitions he has determined the crystal structure of the functional form the symmetric groel groes2 football and established that the groel rings operate as parallel processing iterative annealing machines lorimer is a member of

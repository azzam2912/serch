in the case of a battery electric vehicle it means the total range per charge for a plug in hybrid phev it means the range of the vehicle in charge depleting mode phevs can travel considerably further in charge sustaining mode which uses both on board fuel and the battery pack calculating aer is made more complicated because of variations in phev design a vehicle like the fisker karma that uses a serial hybrid design has a clear aer similarly a vehicle like the chevrolet volt which disengages the internal combustion engine ice from the drive train while in electric mode has a clear aer however blended mode phevs which use the ice and electric motor in conjunction do not have a clear aer because they use gasoline and grid provided electricity at the same time equivalent aer is the aer of vehicles following this architecture one example of this calculation can be found in argonne national labs report titled test procedures and benchmarking blended type and ev capable plug in hybrid electric vehicles this procedure uses the formula below to calculate an equivalent aer for vehicles that operate in blended mode where gpm designates efficiency in charge depleting mode

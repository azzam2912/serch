particularly in superstring theory the extra dimensions of spacetime are sometimes conjectured to take the form of a 6 dimensional calabi yau manifold which led to the idea of mirror symmetry their name was coined by after who first conjectured that such surfaces might exist and who proved the calabi conjecture calabi yau manifolds are complex manifolds that are generalizations of k3 surfaces in any number of complex dimensions i e any even number of real dimensions they were originally defined as compact k hler manifolds with a vanishing first chern class and a ricci flat metric though many other similar but inequivalent definitions are sometimes used the motivational definition given by shing tung yau is of a compact k hler manifold with a vanishing first chern class that is also ricci flat there are many other definitions of a calabi yau manifold used by different authors some inequivalent this section summarizes some of the more common definitions and the relations between them a calabi yau n fold or calabi yau manifold of complex dimension n is sometimes defined as a compact n dimensional k hler manifold m satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions these conditions imply that the

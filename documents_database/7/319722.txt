in this circuit nmos the gate terminal of the transistor serves as the input the source is the output and the drain is common to both input and output hence its name the analogous bipolar junction transistor circuit is the common collector amplifier this circuit is also commonly called a stabilizer in addition this circuit is used to transform impedances for example the th venin resistance of a combination of a voltage follower driven by a voltage source with high th venin resistance is reduced to only the output resistance of the voltage follower a small resistance that resistance reduction makes the combination a more ideal voltage source conversely a voltage follower inserted between a driving stage and a high load i e a low resistance presents an infinite resistance low load to the driving stage an advantage in coupling a voltage signal to a large load at low frequencies the source follower pictured at right has the following small signal characteristics the variable g that is not listed in the schematic is the transconductance of the device usually given in units of siemens

agmatine is a chemical substance which is naturally created from the chemical arginine agmatine has been shown to exert modulatory action at multiple molecular targets notably neurotransmitter systems ion channels nitric oxide no synthesis and polyamine metabolism and this provides bases for further research into potential applications agmatine was discovered in 1910 by albrecht kossel it took more than 100 years to find the exact functions of the chemical the term stems from a for amino g from guanidine ma from ptomaine in german ine english suffix with insertion of t apparently for euphony a year after its discovery it was found that agmatine could increase blood flow in rabbits however the physiological relevance of these findings were questioned given the high concentrations high m range required in the 1920s researchers in the diabetes clinic of oskar minkowski have shown that agmatine can exert mild hypoglycemic effects in 1994 the discovery of endogenous agmatine synthesis in mammals occurred agmatine biosynthesis by arginine decarboxylation is well positioned to compete with the principal arginine dependent pathways namely nitrogen metabolism urea cycle and polyamine and nitric oxide no synthesis see illustration agmatine metabolic pathways agmatine degradation occurs mainly by hydrolysis catalyzed by agmatinase

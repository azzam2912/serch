however this is not always the case when using modifier keys such as shift or control the user intentionally holds the modifier key s while pressing and releasing another key rapid typists may also sometimes inadvertently press a key before releasing the previous one certain unusual forms of keyboarding require multiple keys to be pressed or held down simultaneously for example braille2000 keying requires as many as six keys to be pressed at once analogous to the six dot keys of a braille typewriter some computer games require multiple keys other than the usual modifier keys to be held down while others are pressed and released in order to perform actions simultaneously a common scenario would be the holding down of two arrow keys in order to move the player in a diagonal direction other scenarios might be pressing a key to interact with an object or item in the game while holding down an arrow key to signify movement certain high end keyboards have n key rollover this means that each key is scanned completely independently by the keyboard hardware so that each keypress is correctly detected regardless of how many other keys are being pressed or held down

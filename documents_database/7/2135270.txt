a changing thermal environment can cause an optic to bend due to either 1 thermal gradients on the optic and a non zero coefficient of thermal expansion or 2 coefficient of thermal expansion gradients in an optic and a temperature change therefore optothermal stability is an issue for optics that are present in a changing thermal environment for example a space telescope will have variable heat loads from changes in spacecraft attitude solar flux planetary albedo and planetary infrared emissions optothermal stability is important when measuring surface figure of optics because thermal changes are typically low frequency diurnal or hvac cycling which makes it difficult to use the same methods used to remove errors due to vibrational disturbances also optothermal stability is important for optical systems which require a high level of stability such as those that use a coronagraph material characterization numbers have been mathematically derived to describe the rate at which a material deforms due to an external thermal input it is important to note the distinction between wavefront stability dynamic and wavefront error static a higher massive optothermal stability mos and optothermal stability os number will result in greater stability as shown in the equation mos increases

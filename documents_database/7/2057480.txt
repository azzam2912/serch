the blade of the sword dates back to the 10th century to the times of st wenceslaus together with the coronation cross it is sometimes considered to be a part of the bohemian crown jewels unlike the proper crown jewels the sword and the cross are permanently displayed as part of the treasury of st vitus cathedral in the holy cross chapel at the prague castle until the 19th century it was believed that the sword was an authentic weapon used by duke wenceslas in the 10th century later the sword was considered to be gothic made in the 14th century probably by charles iv who made the new ceremonial crown which was also dedicated to the main czech patron saint st wenceslaus however a recent detailed technological examination of the sword confirmed that the sword blade was made in the early middle ages probably in the 10th century and the sword thus really could have belonged to st wenceslas the cross on the blade was probably made later in the middle ages and the guard and pommel were added perhaps in the 13th century in the treasure of st vitus cathedral there are preserved also a helmet and mail

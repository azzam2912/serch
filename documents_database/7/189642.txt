it involves the sphere formula 1 a 2 dimensional sphere in formula 2 it states that if a certain countable subset is removed from formula 1 then the remainder can be divided into three disjoint subsets formula 4 and formula 5 such that formula 6 and formula 7 are all congruent in particular it follows that on formula 8 there is no finitely additive measure defined on all subsets such that the measure of congruent sets is equal because this would imply that the measure of formula 7 is simultaneously formula 10 and formula 11 of the non zero measure of the whole sphere the paradox was published in mathematische annalen in 1914 and also in hausdorff s book grundz ge der mengenlehre the same year the proof of the much more famous banach tarski paradox uses hausdorff s ideas the proof of this paradox relies on the axiom of choice this paradox shows that there is no finitely additive measure on a sphere defined on all subsets which is equal on congruent pieces hausdorff first showed in the same paper the easier result that there is no countably additive measure defined on all subsets the structure of the group

thus it can represent a dual of the graph simply by reversing the convention on what is a vertex and what is a face the quad edge structure gets its name from the general mechanism by which they are stored a single edge structure conceptually stores references to up to two faces two vertices and 4 edges the four edges stored are the edges starting with the two vertices that are attached to the two stored faces much like winged edge quad edge structures are used in programs to store the topology of a 2d or 3d polygonal mesh the mesh itself does not need to be closed in order to form a valid quad edge structure using a quad edge structure iterating through the topology is quite easy often the interface to quad edge topologies is through directed edges this allows the two vertices to have explicit names start and end and this gives faces explicit names as well left and right relative to a person standing on start and looking in the direction of end the four edges are also given names based on the vertices and faces start left start right end left and end right a

it primarily exists as a metabolic intermediate in both glycolysis during respiration and the calvin cycle during photosynthesis 1 3bpg is a transitional stage between glycerate 3 phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate during the fixation reduction of co 1 3bpg is also a precursor to 2 3 bisphosphoglycerate which in turn is a reaction intermediate in the glycolytic pathway 1 3 bisphosphoglycerate is the conjugate base of 1 3 bisphosphoglyceric acid it is phosphorylated at the number 1 and 3 carbons the result of this phosphorylation gives 1 3bpg important biological properties such as the ability to phosphorylate adp to form the energy storage molecule atp as previously mentioned 1 3bpg is a metabolic intermediate in the glycolytic pathway it is created by the exergonic oxidation of the aldehyde in g3p the result of this oxidation is the conversion of the aldehyde group into a carboxylic acid group which drives the formation of an acyl phosphate bond this is incidentally the only step in the glycolytic pathway in which nad is converted into nadh the formation reaction of 1 3bpg requires the presence of an enzyme called glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase the high energy acyl phosphate bond of 1 3bpg

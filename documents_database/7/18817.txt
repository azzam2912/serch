this ending implies classification at the class rank rather than as a division although the phylogenetics of this group has become much better understood in recent years there remains some dispute over which rank is most appropriate the chloroplasts are pigmented similarly to those of the heterokonts but the structure of the rest of the cell is different so it may be that they are a separate line whose chloroplasts are derived from similar red algal endosymbionts the cells typically have two slightly unequal flagella both of which are smooth and a unique organelle called a haptonema which is superficially similar to a flagellum but differs in the arrangement of microtubules and in its use the name comes from the greek hapsis touch and nema thread the mitochondria have tubular cristae the best known haptophytes are coccolithophores which make up 673 of the 762 described haptophyte species have an exoskeleton of calcareous plates called coccoliths coccolithophores are some of the most abundant marine phytoplankton especially in the open ocean and are extremely abundant as microfossils forming chalk deposits other planktonic haptophytes of note include chrysochromulina and prymnesium which periodically form toxic marine algal blooms and phaeocystis blooms of which can

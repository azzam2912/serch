sr8 along with other c d box snornas performs 2 o methylation of ribose on a target strand of ribosomal rna targeting is achieved through the c and d box components which are short sections of conserved sequences as well as c d boxes internal equivalents of the c and d boxes these sequences base pair with nucleotides in the target rrna to direct their methylation sr8 rna operates alongside protein components in a ribonucleoprotein rnp complex sr8 is able to guide the methylation of targets found within structured stem loops which implies that a component of the complex is able to unwind such structures sr8 is considered a model c d box srna and has been used in several experiments investigating the nature of c d box snornas and ribonucleoprotein complexes it is particularly useful in studies because the rnp can be entirely constructed in vitro sr8 rna from the hyperthermophile methanocaldococcus jannaschii has been used to elucide the 3 dimensional structure of a c d box rnp the structure was unexpectedly found to be dimeric wherein two rna molecules bind with several proteins in the same complex

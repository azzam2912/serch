the high forms a northeast southwest oriented zone through germany but actual rock outcrops are sparse since paleozoic basement rocks are in most of central germany overlain by younger sedimentary rocks the mid german crystalline high crops out in the odenwald the spessart the northern vosges and some small other massifs the mid german crystalline high forms the northern part of the saxothuringian zone of the hercynian orogeny to the northwest it is bounded by the northern phyllite zone slightly metamorphosed sediments of mid paleozoic age part of the rhenohercynian zone southeast of the mid german high lies a zone where early to mid paleozoic sediments of the saxothuringian basin crop out metamorphosed during the hercynian orogeny supposedly during the mid paleozoic devonian and early carboniferous the mid german crystalline high formed an area were not much deposition took place perhaps an archipelago between two marine or oceanic basins the rhenohercynian basin to the north the saxothuringian basin to the south some authors assume the northern basin s oceanic crust subducted beneath the mid german high the zone consists of proterozoic orthogneisses and early paleozoic volcanic amphibolites with morb protoliths and tuffs and sedimentary pelites calcareous schists and marbles rocks

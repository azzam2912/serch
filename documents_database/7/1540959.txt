generally one of an animal s eyes is sutured shut during a period of high cortical plasticity 4 5 weeks old in mice gordon 1997 this manipulation serves as an animal model for amblyopia a permanent deficit in visual sensation not due to abnormalities in the eye which occurs for example in children who grow up with cataracts even after cataract removal they do not see as well as others david hubel and torsten wiesel who won the nobel prize in physiology for their elucidation of receptive field properties of cells in primary visual cortex first performed the technique in felines cats or kittens although less closely related evolutionarily to humans even than rodents have a remarkably similar visual system to humans they found that ocular dominance columns the orderly clustering of v1 neurons representing visual input from one or both eyes were dramatically disrupted when one eye was sewn shut for 2 months in the normal feline about 85 of cells are responsive to input to both eyes in the monocularly deprived animals no cells receive input from both eyes this physiological change was paralleled by dramatic anatomical changes the layers representing the deprived eye in the lateral geniculate

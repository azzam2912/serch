the points representing the vertices of a graph and the arcs representing its edges are called the vertices and the edges of the topological graph it is usually assumed that any two edges of a topological graph cross a finite number of times no edge passes through a vertex different from its endpoints and no two edges touch each other without crossing a topological graph is also called a drawing of a graph an important special class of topological graphs is the class of geometric graphs where the edges are represented by line segments the term geometric graph is sometimes used in a broader somewhat vague sense the theory of topological graphs is an area of graph theory mainly concerned with combinatorial properties of topological graphs in particular with the crossing patterns of their edges it is closely related to graph drawing a field which is more application oriented and topological graph theory which focuses on embeddings of graphs in surfaces that is drawings without crossings a fundamental problem in extremal graph theory is the following what is the maximum number of edges that a graph of n vertices can have if it contains no subgraph belonging to a given

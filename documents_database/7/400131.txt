according to the manufacturer gold flex offers superior bulletproof protection gold flex is a laminated material consisted of cross laid non woven fibers in a resin matrix because the fibers are laid straight and not in a woven fabric configuration superior bullet penetration resistance is claimed by the manufacturer when an object strikes this material a web of its clusters absorb the impact by a good percentage and minimizes penetration per the manufacturer since this is a straight fibre based creation all fibres on the goldflex works together on the vest or material to stop the impact goldflex gives great resistance to abrasion and resists organic solvents making itself nonconductive low flammable and a great fabric that has an amazing resistance to elevated temperatures its degradation point starts from 500 c and it has no melting point it is sensitive to salts acids and ultraviolet radiation when it comes to the static build up in the body it is prone to it as well 1 protection is also based on the pressure of the impact some of these fabrics are only designed with hand guns in mind basically making anything with a bigger calibre a threat potential one cannot wear

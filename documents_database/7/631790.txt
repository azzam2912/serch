noise caused by other circuit elements is shunted through the capacitor reducing the effect it has on the rest of the circuit an alternative name is bypass capacitor as it is used to bypass the power supply or other high impedance component of a circuit active devices of an electronic system transistors ics vacuum tubes for example are connected to their power supplies through conductors with finite resistance and inductance if the current drawn by an active device changes voltage drops from power supply to device will also change due to these impedances if several active devices share a common path to the power supply changes in the current drawn by one element may produce voltage changes large enough to affect the operation of others voltage spikes or ground bounce for example so the change of state of one device is coupled to others through the common impedance to the power supply a decoupling capacitor provides a bypass path for transient currents instead of flowing through the common impedance the decoupling capacitor works as the device s local energy storage the capacitor is placed between power line and ground to the circuit that current is to be provided according to

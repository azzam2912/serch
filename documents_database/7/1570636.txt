morris lecar neurons exhibit both class i and class ii neuron excitability catherine morris b 24 december 1949 is a canadian biologist she won a commonwealth scholarship to study at cambridge university where she earned her phd in 1977 she became a professor at the university of ottawa in the early 1980s as of 2015 she is an emeritus professor at the university of ottawa harold lecar 18 october 1935 4 february 2014 was an american professor of biophysics and neurobiology at the university of california berkeley he graduated with his phd in physics from columbia university in 1963 the morris lecar experiments relied on the current clamp method established by keynes et al 1973 among the principal assumptions are these the morris lecar model is a two dimensional system of nonlinear differential equations it is considered a simplified model compared to the four dimensional hodgkin huxley model qualitatively this system of equations describes the complex relationship between membrane potential and the activation of ion channels within the membrane the potential depends on the activity of the ion channels and the activity of the ion channels depends on the voltage as bifurcation parameters are altered different classes of neuron behavior

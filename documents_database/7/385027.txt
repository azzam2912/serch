for example in cladistics each position in the sequence might correspond to a property of a species which can either be present or absent the alphabet could then consist of 0 for absence and 1 for presence then the sequence 00110 could mean for example that a species does not have feathers or lay eggs does have fur is warm blooded and cannot breathe underwater another sequence 11010 would mean that a species has feathers lays eggs does not have fur is warm blooded and cannot breathe underwater in phylogenetics sequences are often obtained by firstly obtaining a nucleotide or protein sequence alignment and then taking the bases or amino acids at corresponding positions in the alignment as the characters sequences achieved by this might look like agcggagctta and gccgtagacgc substitution models are used for a number of things most substitution models used to date are neutral independent finite sites models typically a branch length of a phylogenetic tree is expressed as the expected number of substitutions per site if the evolutionary model indicates that each site within an ancestral sequence will typically experience x substitutions by the time it evolves to a particular descendant s sequence then the ancestor

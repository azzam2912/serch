it is understood that a line is determined provided that two distinct points on that line are given or constructed even though no visual representation of the line will be present the theorem can be stated more precisely as though the use of a straightedge can make a construction significantly easier the theorem shows that any set of points that fully defines a constructed figure can be determined with compass alone and the only reason to use a straightedge is for the aesthetics of seeing straight lines which for the purposes of construction is functionally unnecessary the result was originally published by georg mohr in 1672 but his proof languished in obscurity until 1928 the theorem was independently discovered by lorenzo mascheroni in 1797 and it was known as mascheroni s theorem until mohr s work was rediscovered motivated by mascheroni s result in 1822 jean victor poncelet conjectured a variation on the same theme he proposed that any construction possible by straightedge and compass could be done with straightedge alone the one stipulation though is that a single circle with its center identified must be provided the poncelet steiner theorem was proved by jakob steiner eleven years later proving

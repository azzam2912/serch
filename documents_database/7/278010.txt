it refers to the number of knots or knot count per unit of surface area typically either per square inch kpsi or per square centimeter kpsc but also per decimeter or meter kpsd or kpsm number of knots per unit area is directly proportional to the quality of carpet density may vary from 25 to over 1000 kpsi or 4 to over 155 kpsc where 80 kpsi is poor quality 120 to 330 kpsi medium to good and 330 kpsi is very good quality the inverse knot ratio is also used to compare characteristics knot density warp weft while knot ratio warp weft for comparison 100 000 square meter 1 000 square decimeter 65 square inch 179 gereh for two carpets of the same age origin condition and design the one with the higher number of knots will be the more valuable knot density is normally measured in knots per square inch kpsi which is simply the number of vertical knots across one inch of carpet multiplied by the number of horizontal knots in the same area average knot density varies between region and design a rug could have a knot density half that of another yet still be more

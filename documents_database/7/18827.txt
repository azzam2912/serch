most of the manmade objects in outer space are in leo there is a large variety of other sources that define leo in terms of altitude the altitude of an object in an elliptic orbit can vary significantly along the orbit even for circular orbits the altitude above ground can vary by as much as especially for polar orbits due to the oblateness of earth s spheroid figure and local topography while definitions based on altitude are inherently ambiguous most of them fall within the range specified by an orbit period of 128 minutes because according to kepler s third law this corresponds to a semi major axis of for circular orbits this in turn corresponds to an altitude of above the mean radius of earth which is consistent with some of the upper altitude limits in some leo definitions the leo region is defined by some sources as the region in space that leo orbits occupy some highly elliptical orbits may pass through the leo region near their lowest altitude or perigee but are not in an leo orbit because their highest altitude or apogee exceeds sub orbital objects can also reach the leo region but are not in

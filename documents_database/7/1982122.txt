bacmap was originally developed in 2005 to address the challenges of viewing and navigating through the growing numbers of bacterial genomes that were being generated through large scale sequencing efforts since it was first introduced the number of bacterial genomes in bacmap has grown by more than 15x essentially bacmap functions as an on line visual atlas of microbial genomes all of the genome annotations in bacmap were generated through the basys genome annotation system basys is a widely used microbial annotation infrastructure that performs comprehensive bionformatic analyses on raw or labeled bacterial genome sequence data all of the genome chromosome maps in bacmap were constructed using the program known as cgview cgview is a popular visualization program for generating interactive web compatible circular chromosome maps fig 1 each chromosome map in bacmap is extensively hyperlinked and each chromosome image can be interactively navigated expanded and rotated using navigation buttons or hyperlinks all identified genes in a bacmap chromosome map are colored according to coding directions and when sufficiently zoomed in gene labels are visible each gene label on a bacmap genome map is also hyperlinked to a gene card fig 2 the gene cards provide detailed information about the

vehicle setups are variable for a variety of reasons ranging from weather driver rider preference and race track characteristics contrary to common misperceptions setup is not used to maximize the performance of the engine but to optimize it for the track at which it is being used for example motorcycle racers frequently detune their engines to reduce performance and power output so as to ensure the bike accelerates in a predictable manner usually adjustable vehicle parts include shock absorbers and anti roll bar suspension gear ratios and differential tyre pressures and type wing angles wheel toe and camber angle brake bias steering lock and ride height the following trends will apply in most cases but there can be exceptions to some of these generally changes should be made one at a time in small steps in addition lowering the centre of gravity will always help the handling as well as reduce the chance of roll over this can be done to some extent by using plastic windows or none and light roof hood bonnet and boot trunk lid materials by reducing the ground clearance etc increasing the track with reversed wheels will have a similar effect but remember that the

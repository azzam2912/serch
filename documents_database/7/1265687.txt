sometimes referred to as a hum it should not be confused with the anomalous acoustic phenomenon of the same name the term is most commonly used to refer to the dominant background seismic and electromagnetic noise signals on earth which are caused by water waves in the oceans and lakes characteristics of microseism are discussed by bhatt because the ocean wave oscillations are statistically homogenous over several hours the microseism signal is a long continuing oscillation of the ground the most energetic seismic waves that make up the microseismic field are rayleigh waves but love waves can make up a significant fraction of the wave field and body waves are also easily detected with arrays because the conversion from the ocean waves to the seismic waves is very weak the amplitude of ground motions associated to microseisms does not generally exceed 10 micrometers microseisms are very well detected and measured by means of a broad band seismograph and can be recorded anywhere on earth dominant microseism signals from the oceans are linked to characteristic ocean swell periods and thus occur between approximately 4 to 30 seconds microseismic noise usually displays two predominant peaks the weaker is for the larger periods

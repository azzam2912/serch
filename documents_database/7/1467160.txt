in addition the waters of the nile support aquatic ecosystems that are threatened by abstraction and pollution egypt also has substantial fossil groundwater resources in the western desert a key problem of water resources management in egypt is the imbalance between increasing water demand and limited supply in order to ensure future water availability coordination with the nine upstream nile riparian countries is essential the nile basin initiative provides a forum for such cooperation in the 1990s the government launched three mega projects to increase irrigation on new lands they are located in the toshka area the new valley on the fringe of the western nile delta and in the northern sinai these projects all require substantial amounts of water that can only be mobilized through better irrigation efficiency on already irrigated old lands as well as the reuse of drainage water and treated wastewater the history of modern water management in egypt begins with the construction of the old aswan dam in 1902 and barrages on the nile in the 19th and early 20th century the old aswan dam partially stored the waters of the nile to allow the growing of multiple crops per year in the nile delta

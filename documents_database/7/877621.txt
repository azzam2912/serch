in particular the equation is useful for describing turbulence in some tokamaks the equation was introduced in hasegawa and mima s paper submitted in 1977 to physics of fluids where they compared it to the results of the atc tokamak the hasegawa mima equation is a second order nonlinear partial differential equation that describes the electric potential the form of the equation is although the quasi neutrality condition holds the small differences in density between the electrons and the ions cause an electric potential the hasegawa mima equation is derived from the continuity equation the fluid velocity can be approximated by the e cross b drift previous models derived their equations from this approximation the divergence of the e cross b drift is zero which keeps the fluid incompressible however the compressibility of the fluid is very important in describing the evolution of the system hasegawa and mima argued that the assumption was invalid the hasegawa mima equation introduces a second order term for the fluid velocity known as the polarization drift in order to find the divergence of the fluid velocity due to the assumption of large magnetic field the polarization drift is much smaller than the e cross

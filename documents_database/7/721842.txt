the key design feature is the use of parallelograms in the arms which maintains the orientation of the end effector by contrast to stewart platform that can change the orientation of its end effector delta robots have popular usage in picking and packaging in factories because they can be quite fast some executing up to 300 picks per minute the delta robot a parallel arm robot was invented in the early 1980s by a research team led by professor reymond clavel at the cole polytechnique f d rale de lausanne epfl switzerland after a visit to a chocolate maker a team member wanted to develop a robot to place pralines in their packages the purpose of this new type of robot was to manipulate light and small objects at a very high speed an industrial need at that time in 1987 the swiss company demaurex purchased a license for the delta robot and started the production of delta robots for the packaging industry in 1991 reymond clavel presented his doctoral thesis conception d un robot parall le rapide 4 degr s de libert and received the golden robot award in 1999 for his work and development of the delta robot

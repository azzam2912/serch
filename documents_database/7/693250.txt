here a few classes of such matrices are summarized let be the matrix with 1 in the th entry and 0 elsewhere consider the space of d d complex matrices for a fixed d define the following matrices the collection of matrices defined above without the identity matrix are called the generalized gell mann matrices in dimension the symbol utilized in the cartan subalgebra above means matrix direct sum the generalized gell mann matrices are hermitian and traceless by construction just like the pauli matrices one can also check that they are orthogonal in the hilbert schmidt inner product on by dimension count one sees that they span the vector space of complex matrices formula 2 they then provide a lie algebra generator basis acting on the fundamental representation of formula 3 in dimensions 2 and 3 the above construction recovers the pauli and gell mann matrices respectively the pauli matrices formula 4 and formula 5 satisfy the following the so called walsh hadamard conjugation matrix is like the pauli matrices w is both hermitian and unitary formula 8 and w satisfy the relation the goal now is to extend the above to higher dimensions d a problem solved by

generally modern medical professionals have abandoned using the term hysteria to denote a diagnostic category replacing it with more precisely defined categories such as somatization disorder in 1980 the american psychiatric association officially changed the diagnosis of hysterical neurosis conversion type to conversion disorder while the word hysteria originates from the greek word for uterus hystera the word itself is not an ancient one and the term hysterical suffocation meaning a feeling of heat and inability to breathe was instead used in ancient greek medicine the greeks believed that the uterus moves through a woman s body eventually strangling her and inducing disease this suggests an entirely physical cause for the symptoms but by linking them to the uterus suggests that the disorder can only be found in women historically hysteria was thought to manifest itself in women female hysteria with a variety of symptoms including anxiety shortness of breath fainting insomnia irritability nervousness as well as sexually forward behaviour these symptoms mimic symptoms of other more definable diseases and create a case for arguing against the validity of hysteria as an actual disease and it is often implied that it is an umbrella term for an indefinable illness one

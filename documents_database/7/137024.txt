it occurs in the most neutron rich proton deficient nucleides and also from excited states of other nucleides as in photoneutron emission and beta delayed neutron emission as only a neutron is lost by this process the number of protons remains unchanged and an atom does not become an atom of a different element but a different isotope of the same element neutrons are also produced in the spontaneous and induced fission of certain heavy nucleides as a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle nuclei with an excess of protons or neutrons have a higher average energy per nucleon nuclei with a sufficient excess of neutrons have a greater energy than the combination of a free neutron and a nucleus with one less neutron and therefore can decay by neutron emission nuclei which can decay by this process are described as lying beyond the neutron drip line two examples of isotopes that emit neutrons are beryllium 13 decaying to beryllium 12 with a mean life and helium 5 helium 4 in tables of nuclear decay modes neutron emission is commonly denoted by the abbreviation n some nuclides can be induced to eject a neutron by gamma radiation one such nuclide

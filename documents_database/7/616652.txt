it can be accompanied by other symptoms such as ataxia coma and paralysis migraine attacks may be provoked by minor head trauma some cases of minor head trauma in patients with hemiplegic migraine can develop into delayed cerebral edema a life threatening medical emergency clinical overlap occurs in some fhm patients with episodic ataxia type 2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 benign familial infantile epilepsy and alternating hemiplegia of childhood three genetic loci for fhm are known fhm1 which accounts for about 50 of fhm patients is caused by mutations in a gene coding for the p q type calcium channel subunit cacna1a fhm1 is also associated with cerebellar degeneration fhm2 which accounts for less than 25 of cases is caused by mutations in the atpase gene atp1a2 fhm3 is a rare subtype of fhm and is caused by mutations in a sodium channel subunit coding gene scn1a these three subtypes do not account for all cases of fhm suggesting the existence of at least one other locus fhm4 also nonfamilial cases of hemiplegic migraine are seen termed sporadic hemiplegic migraine these cases seem to have the same causes as the familial cases and represent de novo mutations sporadic cases

streaming tv stands in contrast to dedicated terrestrial television delivered by over the air aerial systems cable television and or satellite television systems up until the 1990s it was not thought possible that a television programme could be squeezed into the limited telecommunication bandwidth of a copper telephone cable to provide a streaming service of acceptable quality as the required bandwidth of a digital television signal was around 200mbps which was 2 000 times greater than the bandwidth of a speech signal over a copper telephone wire streaming services were only made possible as a result of two major technological developments discrete cosine transform dct video compression and asymmetric digital subscriber line adsl data transmission dct is a lossy compression technique that was first proposed by nasir ahmed in 1972 and was later adapted into a motion compensated dct algorithm for video coding standards such as the h 26x formats from 1988 onwards and the mpeg formats from 1991 onwards motion compensated dct video compression significantly reduced the amount of bandwidth required for a television signal while at the same time adsl increased the bandwidth of data that could be sent over a copper telephone wire adsl increased the bandwidth

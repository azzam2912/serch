the family g of inner products is called a riemannian metric or riemannian metric tensor these terms are named after the german mathematician bernhard riemann the study of riemannian manifolds constitutes the subject called riemannian geometry a riemannian metric tensor makes it possible to define several geometric notions on a riemannian manifold such as angle at an intersection length of a curve area of a surface and higher dimensional analogues volume etc extrinsic curvature of submanifolds and intrinsic curvature of the manifold itself in 1828 carl friedrich gauss proved his theorema egregium remarkable theorem in latin establishing an important property of surfaces informally the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring distances along paths on the surface that is curvature does not depend on how the surface might be embedded in 3 dimensional space see differential geometry of surfaces bernhard riemann extended gauss s theory to higher dimensional spaces called manifolds in a way that also allows distances and angles to be measured and the notion of curvature to be defined again in a way that was intrinsic to the manifold and not dependent upon its embedding in higher dimensional spaces albert einstein

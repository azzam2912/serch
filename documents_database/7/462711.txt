he was sometimes called the father of high voltage direct current power transmission during his career lamm obtained 150 patents and wrote about 80 technical papers in 1980 the ieee developed the uno lamm award for contributions to the field of high voltage electrical engineering lamm was born in gothenburg on may 22 1904 to fredrik hjalmar lamm and aino maria lovisa wilhelmina wijkander he obtained his master s degree at the royal institute of technology in stockholm in 1927 after a short time in compulsory military service he joined asea the swedish electrical conglomerate initially working in their training program in 1929 he was made manager of the project to develop a high voltage mercury arc valve valves at the time operated only up to about 2500 volts and if higher voltage valves were available they could have practical use in the transmission of large quantities of electric energy over long distances in 1943 lamm obtained his ph d from the royal institute of technology studying part time while developing the mercury arc valve after twenty years or so of development work to produce a valve with the necessary rating for hvdc transmission asea obtained a contract for the

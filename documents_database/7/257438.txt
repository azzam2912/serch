it should not be confused with genetically controlled physical or temporal mechanisms that prevent self pollination such as heterostyly and sequential hermaphroditism dichogamy in plants with si when a pollen grain produced in a plant reaches a stigma of the same plant or another plant with a similar genotype the process of pollen germination pollen tube growth ovule fertilization and embryo development is halted at one of its stages and consequently no seeds are produced si is one of the most important means of preventing inbreeding and promoting the generation of new genotypes in plants and it is considered as one of the causes for the spread and success of angiosperms on the earth the best studied mechanisms of si act by inhibiting the germination of pollen on stigmas or the elongation of the pollen tube in the styles these mechanisms are based on protein protein interactions and the best understood mechanisms are controlled by a single locus termed s which has many different alleles in the species population despite their similar morphological and genetic manifestations these mechanisms have evolved independently and are based on different cellular components therefore each mechanism has its own unique s genes the s locus

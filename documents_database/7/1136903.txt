it allows movement of proteins through this barrier and into the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion most of the proteins needed for mitochondrial function are encoded by the nucleus of the cell the outer membrane of the mitochondrion is impermeable to large molecules greater than 5000 daltons the tom works in conjunction with the translocase of the inner membrane tim to translocate proteins into the mitochondrion many of the proteins in the tom complex such as tomm22 were first identified in neurospora crassa and saccharomyces cerevisiae the complete mitochondrial protein translocase complex includes at least 19 proteins several chaperones four proteins of the outer membrane translocase tom import receptor five proteins of the tom channel complex five proteins of the inner membrane translocase tim and three motor proteins there are various mitochondrial import pathways that exist to facilitate the import of precursor proteins to their destined mitochondrial subcompartments hsp90 aids the delivery of the mitochondrial preprotein to the tom complex in an atp dependent process many precursor proteins those that are destined for the matrix contain amino terminal presequences that carry information required for the targeting of proteins to the mitochondrial matrix these matrix targeting signals generally contain 10 80

molecular pathology shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology molecular biology biochemistry proteomics and genetics and is sometimes considered a crossover discipline it is multi disciplinary in nature and focuses mainly on the sub microscopic aspects of disease a key consideration is that more accurate diagnosis is possible when the diagnosis is based on both the morphologic changes in tissues traditional anatomic pathology and on molecular testing it is a scientific discipline that encompasses the development of molecular and genetic approaches to the diagnosis and classification of human diseases the design and validation of predictive biomarkers for treatment response and disease progression the susceptibility of individuals of different genetic constitution to develop disorders molecular pathology is commonly used in diagnosis of cancer and infectious diseases techniques are numerous but include quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr multiplex pcr dna microarray in situ hybridization in situ rna sequencing dna sequencing antibody based immunofluorescence tissue assays molecular profiling of pathogens and analysis of bacterial genes for antimicrobial resistance integration of molecular pathology and epidemiology led to an interdisciplinary field termed molecular pathological epidemiology mpe

phytoene desaturases are membrane bound enzymes localized in plastids and introduce two double bonds into their colorless substrate phytoene by dehydrogenation and isomerize two additional double bonds this reaction starts a biochemical pathway involving three further enzymes zeta carotene isomerase zeta carotene desaturase and carotene cis trans isomerase called the poly cis pathway and leads to the red colored lycopene the homologous phytoene desaturase found in bacteria and fungi crti converts phytoene directly to lycopene by an all trans pathway pds converts 15 cis phytoene into 9 15 9 tri cis carotene through reduction of the enzymes non covalently bound fad cofactor this conversion introduces two additional double bonds at positions 11 and 11 of the carbon chain and isomerizes two adjacent already existing double bonds at positions 9 and 9 from trans to cis the electrons involved in the reaction are subsequently transferred onto plastoquinone and to plastid terminal oxidase ptox ultimately coupling the desaturation to oxygen reduction disruption of this biosynthesis step results in albinism and stunted plant growth disruption of pds function can be achieved by bleaching herbicides such as norflurazon and fluridone these inhibitors occupy the binding pocket of plastoquinone within the enzyme thus blocking it

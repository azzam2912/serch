species richness is simply a count of species and it does not take into account the abundances of the species or their relative abundance distributions species diversity takes into account both species richness and species evenness depending on the purposes of quantifying species richness the individuals can be selected in different ways they can be for example trees found in an inventory plot birds observed from a monitoring point or beetles collected in a pitfall trap once the set of individuals has been defined its species richness can be exactly quantified provided the species level taxonomy of the organisms of interest is well enough known applying different species delimitations will lead to different species richness values for the same set of individuals in practice people are usually interested in the species richness of areas so large that not all individuals in them can be observed and identified to species then applying different sampling methods will lead to different sets of individuals being observed for the same area of interest and the species richness of each set may be different when a new individual is added to a set it may introduce a species that was not yet represented in the

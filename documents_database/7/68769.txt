we shall prove the five lemma by individually proving each of the two four lemmas to perform diagram chasing we assume that we are in a category of modules over some ring so that we may speak of elements of the objects in the diagram and think of the morphisms of the diagram as functions in fact homomorphisms acting on those elements then a morphism is a monomorphism if and only if it is injective and it is an epimorphism if and only if it is surjective similarly to deal with exactness we can think of kernels and images in a function theoretic sense the proof will still apply to any small abelian category because of mitchell s embedding theorem which states that any small abelian category can be represented as a category of modules over some ring for the category of groups just turn all additive notation below into multiplicative notation and note that commutativity of abelian group is never used so to prove 1 assume that m and p are surjective and q is injective then to prove 2 assume that m and p are injective and is surjective combining the two four lemmas now proves the entire

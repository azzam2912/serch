zvonimir janko found j in 1975 by studying groups with an involution centralizer of the form 2 3 m 2 its existence and uniqueness was shown using computer calculations by simon p norton and others in 1980 it has a modular representation of dimension 112 over the finite field with 2 elements and is the stabilizer of a certain 4995 dimensional subspace of the exterior square a fact which norton used to construct it and which is the easiest way to deal with it computationally and gave computer free proofs of uniqueness and gave a computer free proof of existence by constructing it as an amalgams of groups 2 sl 2 and 2 2 a 2 over a group 2 2 a the schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group are both trivial since 37 and 43 are not supersingular primes j cannot be a subquotient of the monster group thus it is one of the 6 sporadic groups called the pariahs the smallest faithful complex representation has dimension 1333 there are two complex conjugate representations of this dimension the smallest faithful representation over any field is a 112 dimensional representation over the field of 2 elements the smallest permutation

it acts to transport monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine serotonin norepinephrine epinephrine and histamine into the vesicles which release the neurotransmitters into synapses as chemical messages to postsynaptic neurons vmats utilize a proton gradient generated by v atpases in vesicle membranes to power monoamine import pharmaceutical drugs that target vmats have possible applications for many conditions leading to a plethora of biological research these applications include hypertension drug addiction psychiatric disorders parkinson s disease and other neurological disorders many drugs that target vmat act as inhibitors and alter the kinetics of the protein much research regarding the effects of altered vmats on biological systems is still ongoing the two vmat isoforms are monoamines transported by vmats are mainly noradrenaline adrenaline dopamine serotonin histamine and trace amines exogenous substrates include guanethidine and mpp vmat research began in 1958 with the discovery of secretory vesicles by nils ke hillarp in the 1970s scientists such as arvid carlsson recognized the need to understand how transport systems and ion gradients work in different organisms in order to explore new treatment options such as reserpine researchers discovered inhibitors that blocked the uptake of neurotransmitters into vesicles suggesting the existence of vmats a decade later molecular

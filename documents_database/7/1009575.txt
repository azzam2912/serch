the seven vertices and 21 edges of the cs sz r polyhedron form an embedding of the complete graph formula 1 onto a topological torus of the 35 possible triangles from vertices of the polyhedron only 14 are faces the tetrahedron and the cs sz r polyhedron are the only two known polyhedra having a manifold boundary without any diagonals every two vertices of the polygon are connected by an edge so there is no line segment between two vertices that does not lie on the polyhedron boundary that is the vertices and edges of the cs sz r polyhedron form a complete graph if the boundary of a polyhedron with v vertices forms a surface with h holes in such a way that every pair of vertices is connected by an edge it follows by some manipulation of the euler characteristic that this equation is satisfied for the tetrahedron with h 0 and v 4 and for the cs sz r polyhedron with h 1 and v 7 the next possible solution h 6 and v 12 would correspond to a polyhedron with 44 faces and 66 edges but it is not realizable as a polyhedron it is not

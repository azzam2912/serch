termites were once classified in a separate order from cockroaches but recent phylogenetic studies indicate that they evolved from cockroaches during the jurassic or triassic however the first termites possibly emerged during the permian or even the carboniferous about 3 106 species are currently described with a few hundred more left to be described although these insects are often called white ants they are not ants like ants and some bees and wasps from the separate order hymenoptera termites divide labour among castes consisting of sterile male and female workers and soldiers all colonies have fertile males called kings and one or more fertile females called queens termites mostly feed on dead plant material and cellulose generally in the form of wood leaf litter soil or animal dung termites are major detritivores particularly in the subtropical and tropical regions and their recycling of wood and plant matter is of considerable ecological importance termites are among the most successful groups of insects on earth colonising most landmasses except antarctica their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals termite queens have the longest lifespan of any insect in the world with some queens

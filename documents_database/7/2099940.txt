radio coloring was first studied by under a different name labeling it was called radio coloring by frank harary because it models the problem of channel assignment in radio broadcasting while avoiding electromagnetic interference between radio stations that are near each other both in the graph and in their assigned channel frequencies the span of a radio coloring is its maximum label and the radio coloring number of a graph is the smallest possible span of a radio coloring for instance the graph consisting of two vertices with a single edge has radio coloring number 3 it has a radio coloring with one vertex labeled 1 and the other labeled 3 but it is not possible for a radio coloring of this graph to use only the labels 1 and 2 finding a radio coloring with a given or minimum span is np complete even when restricted to planar graphs split graphs or the complements of bipartite graphs however it is solvable in polynomial time for trees and cographs for arbitrary graphs it can be solved in singly exponential time significantly faster than a brute force search through all possible colorings although the radio coloring number of an vertex graph

because of its versatility low weight and high efficiency it can be used in a wide range of applications although it is of special interest to the mobility industry as range extenders for electric vehicles the free piston engine linear generators can be divided in 3 subsystems the fplg has many potential advantages compared to traditional electric generator powered by an internal combustion engine one of the main advantages of the fplg comes from the absence of crankshaft it leads to a smaller and lighter generator with fewer parts this also allows a variable compression and expansion ratios which makes it possible to operate with different kinds of fuel the linear generator also allows the control of the resistance force and therefore a better control of the piston s movement and of the reaction the total efficiency including mechanical and generator of free piston linear generators can be significantly higher than conventional internal combustion engines and comparable to fuel cells the first patents of free piston linear generators date from around 1940 however in the last decades especially after the development of rare earth magnets and power electronics many different research groups have been working in this field these include

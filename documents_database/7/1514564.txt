each individual node holds a specific software subset of the global aggregate operating system each subset is a composite of two distinct service provisioners the first is a ubiquitous minimal kernel or microkernel that directly controls that node s hardware second is a higher level collection of system management components that coordinate the node s individual and collaborative activities these components abstract microkernel functions and support user applications the microkernel and the management components collection work together they support the system s goal of integrating multiple resources and processing functionality into an efficient and stable system this seamless integration of individual nodes into a global system is referred to as transparency or single system image describing the illusion provided to users of the global system s appearance as a single computational entity a distributed os provides the essential services and functionality required of an os but adds attributes and particular configurations to allow it to support additional requirements such as increased scale and availability to a user a distributed os works in a manner similar to a single node monolithic operating system that is although it consists of multiple nodes it appears to users and applications as a single node

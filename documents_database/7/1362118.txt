the process that is used for magnetic separation detaches non magnetic material with those who are magnetic this technique is useful for not all but few minerals such as ferromagnetic materials strongly affected by magnetic fields and paramagnetic materials that are less affected but the effect is still noticeable not all metals are magnetic gold silver and aluminum are some examples a large diversity of mechanical are used to separate magnetic materials during magnetic separation magnets are situated inside two separator drums which bear liquids due to the magnets magnetic particles are being drifted by the movement of the drums this can create a magnetic concentrate e g an ore concentrate michael faraday discovered that when a substance is put in a magnetic environment the intensity of the environment is modified by it with this information he discovered that different materials can be separated with their magnetic properties the table below shows the common ferromagnetic and paramagnetic minerals as well as the field intensity that is required in order to separate those minerals in the 1860s magnetic separation started to become commercialized it was used to separate iron from brass after the 1880s ferromagnetic materials started to be magnetically separated

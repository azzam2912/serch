the principal investigator is roger wiens from los alamos national laboratory supercam is an improved version of the successful chemcam instruments of the curiosity rover that have been upgraded with two different lasers and detectors in april 2018 supercam entered the final stages of assembly and testing the flight model was installed to the rover in june 2019 the rover mission is planned to launch in july 2020 for measurements of chemical composition the instrument suite uses a version of the successful chemcam instruments of the curiosity rover that have been upgraded with two different lasers and detectors supercam s instruments are able to identify the kinds of chemicals that could be evidence of past life on mars supercam is a suite of various instruments and the collection of correlated measurements on a target can be used to determine directly the geochemistry and mineralogy of samples the suite has several integrated instruments raman spectroscopy time resolved fluorescence trf spectroscopy and visible and infrared visir reflectance spectroscopy to provide preliminary information about the mineralogy and molecular structure of samples under consideration as well as being able to directly measure organic compounds the total is four complementary spectrometers making the suite sensitive

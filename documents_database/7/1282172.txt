its general usage is to identify homologous protein or nucleotide sequences and to perform sequence alignments it detects homology by comparing a profile hmm to either a single sequence or a database of sequences sequences that score significantly better to the profile hmm compared to a null model are considered to be homologous to the sequences that were used to construct the profile hmm profile hmms are constructed from a multiple sequence alignment in the hmmer package using the hmmbuild program the profile hmm implementation used in the hmmer software was based on the work of krogh and colleagues hmmer is a console utility ported to every major operating system including different versions of linux windows and mac os hmmer is the core utility that protein family databases such as pfam and interpro are based upon some other bioinformatics tools such as ugene also use hmmer hmmer3 also makes extensive use of vector instructions for increasing computational speed this work is based upon earlier publication showing a significant acceleration of the smith waterman algorithm for aligning two sequences a profile hmm is a variant of an hmm relating specifically to biological sequences profile hmms turn a multiple sequence alignment into

it is a dimensionless expression of the pulsatile flow frequency in relation to viscous effects it is named after john r womersley 1907 1958 for his work with blood flow in arteries the womersley number is important in keeping dynamic similarity when scaling an experiment an example of this is scaling up the vascular system for experimental study the womersley number is also important in determining the thickness of the boundary layer to see if entrance effects can be ignored this number is also referred to as stokes number formula 2 due to the pioneering work done by sir george stokes on the stokes second problem the womersley number usually denoted formula 3 is defined by the relation formula 4 where l is an appropriate length scale for example the radius of a pipe is the angular frequency of the oscillations and are the kinematic viscosity density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid respectively the womersley number is normally written in the powerless form formula 5 in the cardiovascular system the pulsation frequency decreases as the blood is distanced from the origin of pulsation the heart however the womersley number like many characteristic numbers defines a system by order of

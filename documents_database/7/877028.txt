it is an initiator caspase critical to the apoptotic pathway found in many tissues caspase 9 homologs have been identified in all mammals for which they are known to exist such as mus musculus and pan troglodytes caspase 9 belongs to a family of caspases cysteine aspartic proteases involved in apoptosis and cytokine signalling apoptotic signals cause the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activation of apaf 1 apoptosome which then cleaves the pro enzyme of caspase 9 into the active dimer form regulation of this enzyme occurs through phosphorylation by an allosteric inhibitor inhibiting dimerization and inducing a conformational change correct caspase 9 function is required for apoptosis leading to the normal development of the central nervous system without correct function abnormal tissue development can occur leading to abnormal function diseases and premature death certain diseases involving caspase 9 are treated with therapy by targeting this enzyme different protein isoforms of caspase 9 are produced due to alternative splicing similar to other caspases caspase 9 has three domains n terminal pro domain large subunit and a small subunit the n terminal pro domain is also called the long pro domain and this contains the caspase activation domain card

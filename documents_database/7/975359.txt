from 1967 he studied physics at the university of amsterdam both his doctoral research and phd research was with isaac silvera on the subject of bose einstein condensation because of the difficulty of his research subject his promotion took six years instead of four the aim of his phd research was to make a gas of atomic hydrogen which could become the world s first quantum gas this might then be a suitable candidate for a bose einstein condensate bec in order to achieve this state the gas of atomic hydrogen would have to be cooled to only a few kelvins without recombining to molecular hydrogen jook walraven developed a method of evaporative cooling a tank was filled with a gas of atomic hydrogen from which the hottest fastest atoms were removed this resulted in a lower temperature of the whole gas to keep the atomic hydrogen from forming hydrogen molecules the atoms were spin polarized by a 7 tesla magnet in a few years silvera and walraven had achieved the first quantum gas however due to interactions with the wall of the tank the gas did not cool enough to reach the critical temperature at which it condenses into

a program can be said to contain unspecified behavior when its source code may produce an executable that exhibits different behavior when compiled on a different compiler or on the same compiler with different settings or indeed in different parts of the same executable while the respective language standards or specifications may impose a range of possible behaviors the exact behavior depends on the implementation and may not be completely determined upon examination of the program s source code unspecified behavior will often not manifest itself in the resulting program s external behavior but it may sometimes lead to differing outputs or results potentially causing portability problems to enable compilers to produce optimal code for their respective target platforms programming language standards do not always impose a certain specific behavior for a given source code construct failing to explicitly define the exact behavior of every possible program is not considered an error or weakness in the language specification and doing so would be infeasible in the c and c languages such non portable constructs are generally grouped into three categories implementation defined unspecified and undefined behavior the exact definition of unspecified behavior varies in c it is defined as behavior

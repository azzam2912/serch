the scattering length of neutrons varies by element and isotope in a way that appears random whereas the scattering of x rays generally increases with the atomic number the scattering length may be either positive or negative the scattering cross section is equal to the square of the scattering length multiplied by 4 i e the area of a circle with radius twice the scattering length in some cases as with titanium and nickel it is possible to mix isotopes of an element whose lengths are of opposite signs to give a net scattering length of zero in which case coherent scattering will not occur at all however neutrons will still undergo strong incoherent scattering in these materials there is a large difference in scattering length between protium 0 374 and deuterium 0 667 this means that protium the most common isotope of hydrogen is poorly imaged due to its smaller absolute magnitude and because its scattering density tends to cancel that of adjacent carbon nitrogen or oxygen which have positive scattering lengths because of these factors as well as the much larger incoherent scattering cross section of protium ordinary proteins cannot be imaged as well as those that are

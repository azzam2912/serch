generally higher density is more desirable for it allows more data to be stored in the same physical space density therefore has a direct relationship to storage capacity of a given medium density also generally affects the performance within a particular medium as well as price hard disk drives store data in the magnetic polarization of small patches of the surface coating on a disk the maximum areal density is defined by the size of the magnetic particles in the surface as well as the size of the head used to read and write the data in 1956 the first hard drive the ibm 350 had an areal density of 2 000 bit in since then the increase in density has matched moore s law reaching 1 tbit in in 2014 in 2015 seagate introduced a hard drive with a density of 1 34 tbit in more than 600 million times that of the ibm 350 it is expected that current recording technology can feasibly scale to at least 5 tbit in in the near future new technologies like heat assisted magnetic recording hamr and microwave assisted magnetic recording mamr are under development and are expected to allow increases in

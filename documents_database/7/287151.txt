as chlorophyll is responsible for the green color of leaves chlorotic leaves are pale yellow or yellow white the affected plant has little or no ability to manufacture carbohydrates through photosynthesis and may die unless the cause of its chlorophyll insufficiency is treated although some chlorotic plants such as the albino arabidopsis thaliana mutant ppi2 are viable if supplied with exogenous sucrose chlorosis is derived from the greek khloros meaning greenish yellow pale green pale pallid or fresh in viticulture the most common symptom of poor nutrition in grapevines is the yellowing of grape leaves caused by chlorosis and the subsequent loss of chlorophyll this is often seen in vineyard soils that are high in limestone such as the italian wine region of barolo in the piedmont the spanish wine region of rioja and the french wine regions of champagne and burgundy in these soils the grapevine often struggles to pull sufficient levels of iron which is a needed component in the production of chlorophyll chlorosis is typically caused when leaves do not have enough nutrients to synthesise all the chlorophyll they need it can be brought about by a combination of factors including however the exact conditions vary from

it is an obligatory parasite of ants of the genus myrmica the thalli penetrate outer layer of the cuticle and appear on the host body surface little is known about its effect on the host ant but it is usually regarded as a rather neutral symbiont contrarily however a recent study has documented an increased need of drinking water and a shortened life span of infected ants the known host species of rickia wasmannii are various myrmica species the most frequent being myrmica scabrinodis the fungus was reported from many european countries such as austria bulgaria the czech republic france germany hungary italy luxembourg slovakia slovenia spain switzerland and the united kingdom in 2016 pfiegler et al showed that inquiline mites can become infected by r wasmannii which was thought to be restricted to the genus myrmica hymenoptera formicidae this was the first report of r wasmannii from an alternative host in another subphylum chelicerata these authors also found immature fruiting bodies on a larva of microdon myrmicae diptera syrphidae which represents the first report of any rickia species on flies rickia wasmannii is thus capable of infecting alternative unrelated host species as they co occur in the ant nest

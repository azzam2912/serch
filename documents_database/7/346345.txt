it is closely related to the annihilator method but instead of using a particular kind of differential operator the annihilator in order to find the best possible form of the particular solution a guess is made as to the appropriate form which is then tested by differentiating the resulting equation for complex equations the annihilator method or variation of parameters is less time consuming to perform undetermined coefficients is not as general a method as variation of parameters since it only works for differential equations that follow certain forms consider a linear non homogeneous ordinary differential equation of the form the method consists of finding the general homogeneous solution formula 6 for the complementary linear homogeneous differential equation and a particular integral formula 8 of the linear non homogeneous ordinary differential equation based on formula 9 then the general solution formula 3 to the linear non homogeneous ordinary differential equation would be if formula 9 consists of the sum of two functions formula 13 and we say that formula 14 is the solution based on formula 15 and formula 16 the solution based on formula 17 then using a superposition principle we can say that the particular integral formula 8

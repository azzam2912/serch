this approach stands in contrast to traditional centralized machine learning techniques where all data samples are uploaded to one server as well as to more classical decentralized approaches which assume that local data samples are identically distributed federated learning enables multiple actors to build a common robust machine learning model without sharing data thus addressing critical issues such as data privacy data security data access rights and access to heterogeneous data its applications are spread over a number of industries including defense telecommunications iot or pharmaceutics federated learning aims at training a machine learning algorithm for instance deep neural networks on multiple local datasets contained in local nodes without exchanging data samples the general principle consists in training local models on local data samples and exchanging parameters e g the weights of a deep neural network between these local models at some frequency to generate a global model federated learning algorithms may use a central server that orchestrates the different steps of the algorithm and acts as a reference clock or they may be peer to peer where no such central server exists in the non peer to peer case a federated learning process can be broken down in multiple

am3 was launched on february 9 2009 as the successor to socket am2 alongside the initial grouping of phenom ii processors designed for it the sole principal change from am2 to am3 is support for ddr3 sdram like the previous amd socket the am3 processor functional data sheet amd document number 40778 has not been made publicly available the family 10h amd phenom processor product data sheet document 446878 has but contains only a brief list of features of the phenom and does not contain any substantive technical data regarding socket am3 socket am3 breaks compatibility with am2 am2 processors due to a subtle change in key placement the am3 socket has 941 pin contacts in a different layout while am2 processors have 940 pins tom s hardware removed the two obstructing key pins from an am2 phenom processor in order to fit it into an am3 socket the processor did not work in the am3 socket but still worked in an am2 socket suggesting that compatibility issues run deeper than merely the key pins it is likely because the built in memory controller in am2 am2 processors only supports ddr2 unlike am3 processors which support both ddr2 ddr3 memory

it is caused by the fact that the group velocity which is also the wave energy transport velocity changes with water depth under stationary conditions a decrease in transport speed must be compensated by an increase in energy density in order to maintain a constant energy flux shoaling waves will also exhibit a reduction in wavelength while the frequency remains constant in shallow water and parallel depth contours non breaking waves will increase in wave height as the wave packet enters shallower water this is particularly evident for tsunamis as they wax in height when approaching a coastline with devastating results waves nearing the coast change wave height through different effects some of the important wave processes are refraction diffraction reflection wave breaking wave current interaction friction wave growth due to the wind and wave shoaling in the absence of the other effects wave shoaling is the change of wave height that occurs solely due to changes in mean water depth without changes in wave propagation direction and dissipation pure wave shoaling occurs for long crested waves propagating perpendicular to the parallel depth contour lines of a mildly sloping sea bed then the wave height formula 1 at a certain

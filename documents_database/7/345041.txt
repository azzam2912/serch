just as exponential functions provide solutions of scalar linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equations strongly continuous semigroups provide solutions of linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equations in banach spaces such differential equations in banach spaces arise from e g delay differential equations and partial differential equations formally a strongly continuous semigroup is a representation of the semigroup r on some banach space x that is continuous in the strong operator topology thus strictly speaking a strongly continuous semigroup is not a semigroup but rather a continuous representation of a very particular semigroup a strongly continuous semigroup on a banach space formula 1 is a map formula 2 such that the first two axioms are algebraic and state that formula 8 is a representation of the semigroup formula 9 the last is topological and states that the map formula 8 is continuous in the strong operator topology the infinitesimal generator a of a strongly continuous semigroup t is defined by whenever the limit exists the domain of a d a is the set of x x for which this limit does exist d a is a linear subspace and a is linear on this domain the operator a is closed although

ndp is insecure and susceptible to malicious interference it is the intent of send to provide an alternate mechanism for securing ndp with a cryptographic method that is independent of ipsec the original and inherent method of securing ipv6 communications send uses cryptographically generated addresses cga and other new ndp options for the icmpv6 packet types used in ndp send was updated to use the resource public key infrastructure rpki by rfc 6494 and rfc 6495 which define use of a send certificate profile utilizing a modified rfc 6487 rpki certificate profile which must include a single rfc 3779 ip address delegation extension there have been concerns with algorithm agility vis vis attacks on hash functions used by send expressed in rfc 6273 as cga currently uses the sha 1 hash algorithm and pkix certificates and does not provide support for alternative hash algorithms

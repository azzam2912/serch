the vernier is a subsidiary scale replacing a single measured value pointer and has for instance ten divisions equal in distance to nine divisions on the main scale the interpolated reading is obtained by observing which of the vernier scale graduations is co incident with a graduation on the main scale which is easier to perceive than visual estimation between two points such an arrangement can go to higher resolution by using higher scale ratios known as the vernier constant a vernier may be used on circular or straight scales where a simple linear mechanism is adequate examples are calipers and micrometers to measure to fine tolerances on sextants for navigation on theodolites in surveying and generally on scientific instruments the vernier principle of interpolation is also used for electronic displacement sensors such as absolute encoders to measure linear or rotational movement as part of an electronic measuring system calipers without a scale originated in ancient china as early as the xin dynasty ad 9 the secondary scale which contributed extra precision was invented in 1631 by french mathematician pierre vernier 1580 1637 its use was described in detail in english in navigatio britannica 1750 by mathematician and historian john

it is also classified as a type of acute coronary syndrome acs it can be difficult to distinguish unstable angina from non st elevation non q wave myocardial infarction nstemi they differ primarily in whether the ischemia is severe enough to cause sufficient damage to the heart s muscular cells to release detectable quantities of a marker of injury typically troponin t or troponin i unstable angina is considered to be present in patients with ischemic symptoms suggestive of an acs and no elevation in troponin with or without ecg changes indicative of ischemia e g st segment depression or transient elevation or new t wave inversion since an elevation in troponin may not be detectable for up to 12 hours after presentation ua and nstemi are frequently indistinguishable at initial evaluation the pathophysiology of unstable angina is controversial until recently unstable angina was assumed to be angina pectoris caused by disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque with partial thrombosis and possibly embolization or vasospasm leading to myocardial ischemia however sensitive troponin assays reveal rise of cardiac troponin in the bloodstream with episodes of even mild myocardial ischemia since unstable angina is assumed to occur in the setting of acute myocardial

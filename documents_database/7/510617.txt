such a device is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area they form a vital component of security automated lighting control home control energy efficiency and other useful systems an electronic motion detector contains an optical microwave or acoustic sensor and in many cases a transmitter for illumination however a passive sensor senses a signature only from the moving object via emission or reflection i e it can be emitted by the object or by some ambient emitter such as the sun or a radio station of sufficient strength changes in the optical microwave or acoustic field in the device s proximity are interpreted by the electronics based on one of the technologies listed below most low cost motion detectors can detect up to distances of at least specialized systems cost more but have much longer ranges tomographic motion detection systems can cover much larger areas because the radio waves are at frequencies which penetrate most walls and obstructions and are detected in multiple locations not only at the location of the transmitter motion detectors have found wide use in domestic and commercial applications one

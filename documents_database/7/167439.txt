while the attacker has no channel providing access to the plaintext prior to encryption in all practical ciphertext only attacks the attacker still has some knowledge of the plaintext for instance the attacker might know the language in which the plaintext is written or the expected statistical distribution of characters in the plaintext standard protocol data and messages are commonly part of the plaintext in many deployed systems and can usually be guessed or known efficiently as part of a ciphertext only attack on these systems the attack is completely successful if the corresponding plaintexts can be deduced or even better the key the ability to obtain any information at all about the underlying plaintext beyond what was pre known to the attacker is still considered a success for example if an adversary is sending ciphertext continuously to maintain traffic flow security it would be very useful to be able to distinguish real messages from nulls even making an informed guess of the existence of real messages would facilitate traffic analysis in the history of cryptography early ciphers implemented using pen and paper were routinely broken using ciphertexts alone cryptographers developed statistical techniques for attacking ciphertext such as frequency analysis

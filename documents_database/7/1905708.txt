cyclodisparity can result from the eyes torsional rotation cyclorotation or can be created artificially by presenting to the eyes two images that need to be rotated relative to each other for binocular fusion to take place the eyes and visual system can compensate for cyclodisparity up to a certain point if the cyclodisparity is larger than a threshold the images cannot be fused resulting stereoblindness and in double vision in subjects who otherwise have full stereo vision when a human subject is presented with images that have artificial cyclodisparity cyclovergence is evoked that is a motor response of the eye muscles that rotates the two eyes in opposite directions thereby reducing cyclodisparity visually induced cyclovergence of up to 8 degrees has been observed in normal subjects furthermore up to about 8 degrees that can usually be compensated by purely sensory means that is without physical eye rotation this means that the normal human observer can achieve binocular image fusion in presence of cyclodisparity of up to approximately 16 degrees cyclodisparity due to images having been rotated inward can be compensated better when the gaze is directed downwards and cyclodisparity due to an outward rotation can be compensated better when the

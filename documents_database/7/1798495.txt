mini neptunes have thick hydrogen helium atmospheres probably with deep layers of ice rock or liquid oceans made of water ammonia a mixture of both or heavier volatiles theoretical studies of such planets are loosely based on knowledge about uranus and neptune without a thick atmosphere it would be classified as an ocean planet instead an estimated dividing line between a rocky planet and a gaseous planet is around 1 6 2 0 earth radii planets with larger radii and measured masses are mostly low density and require an extended atmosphere to simultaneously explain their masses and radii and observations are showing that planets larger than approximately 1 6 earth radius and more massive than approximately 6 earth masses contain significant amounts of volatiles or h he gas likely acquired during formation such planets appear to have a diversity of compositions that is not well explained by a single mass radius relation as that found for denser rocky planets similar results are confirmed by other studies as for mass the lower limit can vary widely for different planets depending on their compositions the dividing mass can vary from as low as one to as high as 20

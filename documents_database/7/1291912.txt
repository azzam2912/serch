an alternative synthesis is the reaction of sncl with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride with alkali metal fluorides e g kf hexafluorostannates are produced e g ksnf which contain the octahedral snf anion snf behaves as a lewis acid and adducts l snf and l snf have been produced unlike the other tin tetrahalides tin iv chloride tin iv bromide and tin iv iodide which contain tetrahedrally coordinated tin tin iv fluoride contains planar layers of octahedrally coordinated tin where the octahedra share four corners and there are two terminal unshared fluorine atoms trans to one another the melting point of snf is much higher 700 c than the other tin iv halides which are relatively low melting sncl 33 3 c snbr 31 c sni 144 c the structure can also be contrasted with the tetrafluorides of the lighter members of group 14 cf sif and gef which in the solid state form molecular crystals

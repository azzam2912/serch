it enabled slaves to make a down payment and to set the price for their freedom conferring on them the status of coartado which brought extra rights and privileges to the slave the phrase originally comes from the spanish word coartar as meaning to cut off or limit how they would set the price for freedom and cut it off from the rising market price so that the master could not ask for a higher price but by the eighteenth century it had become coartaci n as meaning hindrance or restriction in reference to the action of restricting the slave master s power slavery in spanish america was based on the siete partidas legal code of 1348 while this code made clear that all laws of the world should lead towards freedom it did not directly address manumission under ancient roman laws which influenced the european laws regarding slavery slaves were allowed to buy their own freedom using their peculium as meaning their private proceeds but this was rare the siete partidas did incorporate the rights of slaves to acquire a peculium although the use of these to purchase freedom began as a custom rather a facet of the law

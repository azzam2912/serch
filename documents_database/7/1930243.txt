it is an important technique applied in many fields dealing with raw materials and building materials for process and reuse this technique can achieve 99 high efficiency with its circular movement machines with tumbler screening techniques are commonly used because of its unique rush design high life time utility and the flexible angular velocity the machines can achieve however this type of machine requires low feed flow rate and the particles size for separation have to be controlled within a specific range furthermore the performance of the process also depends on the intensity of the vibration on the other hand the water steam treatment is also an issue of this screening technique since this technique is applied worldwide presently the most effective and environment friendly way for processing of the waste treatment is to classify the products the products are usually split into four categories including organic inorganic hazardous and recyclable nowadays scientists are also research for the new development of the techniques enhance the function of the machines in order to provide the technique into much more field and yields better product the tumbler screening technique is a separation method that applies an elliptical movement in three dimensions which

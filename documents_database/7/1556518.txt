p agardhii is regarded as a type species of the genus like all the oscillatoriales planktothrix species have no heterocyst and no akinetes but are unique because they are planktonic solitary trichome and have gas vacuoles before the work of suda et al some species of the taxon were grouped within the genus oscillatoria a tremendous body of work on planktothrix ecology and physiology has been done by anthony e walsby and the 55 6 kb microcystin synthetase gene have been sequenced p agardhii and p rubescens are commonly observed in lakes of the northern hemisphere where they are known producers of potent hepatotoxins called microcystins like most oscillatoriales planktothrix grows by cell division in a single plane to form long unbranched trichomes also called filaments of length up to 4 mm but unlike other oscillatoriales these trichomes are phototactic and slightly motile typically planktothrix filaments do not have specialized cells such as akinetes or heterocysts and do not produce mucilaginous envelopes except for some rare species but only under stress conditions several species possess constant ratio of their two main photosynthetic pigments i e phycocyanins and phycoerythrins the production of cyanotoxins is facultative and strains that do not produce

this gene is a member of the peptidase m16 family and encodes a protein with a zinc binding motif this protein is located in the mitochondrial matrix and catalyzes the cleavage of the leader peptides of precursor proteins newly imported into the mitochondria though it only functions as part of a heterodimeric complex the mitochondrial processing peptidase subunit beta precursor protein is 54 4 kda in size and composed of 489 amino acids the precursor protein contains a 45 amino acid n terminal fragment as mitochondrion targeting sequence after cleavage the matured pmpcb protein is 49 5 kda in size and has a theoretical pi of 5 76 mitochondrial processing peptidase mpp is a metalloendopeptidase containing two structurally related subunits mitochondrial processing peptidase subunit alpha and subunit beta working in conjunction for its catalytic function containing the catalytic site the beta subunit pmpcb protein cleaves presequences transit peptides from mitochondrial protein precursors and releases of n terminal transit peptides from precursor proteins imported into the mitochondrion typically with arg in position p2 as the beta subunit of mitochondrial processing peptidase pmpcb forms a heterodimer with the subunit mitochondrial processing peptidase subunit alpha in addition pmpcb has been shown to interact

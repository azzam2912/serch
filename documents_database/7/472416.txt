the name is also often used erroneously to describe synthetically grown corundum most true synthetic alexandrite is grown by pulling known as the czochralski method another method is a floating zone this method was developed by an armenian scientist khachatur saakovich bagdasarov of the russian former soviet institute of crystallography in moscow in 1964 and was widely used in production of white yag for spacecraft and submarine illuminators before finding its way into the jewelry market alexandrite crystals grown by floating zone method tend to have less intensity in color than crystals grown by the pulled method flux grown alexandrite is more difficult to identify because the inclusions of undissolved flux can look like natural inclusions alexandrite grown by the flux melt process will contain particles of flux resembling liquid feathers with a refractive index and specific gravity that echo that of the natural material layers of dust like particles parallel to the seed plate and strong banding or growth lines may also be apparent some stones contain groups of parallel negative crystals flux grown alexandrites are more difficult to spot because the colors are convincing and because they are not clean these stones are expensive to make and are

the transition might depend on the past values of the x series similar to the setar models or exogenous variables the model consists of 2 autoregressive ar parts linked by the transition function the model is usually referred to as the star p models proceeded by the letter describing the transition function see below and p is the order of the autoregressive part most popular transition function include exponential function and first and second order logistic functions they give rise to logistic star lstar and exponential star estar models consider a simple ar p model for a time series y where written in a following vector form where star models were introduced and comprehensively developed by kung sik chan and howell tong in 1986 esp p 187 in which the same acronym was used it originally stands for smooth threshold autoregressive for some background history see tong 2011 2012 the models can be thought of in terms of extension of autoregressive models discussed above allowing for changes in the model parameters according to the value of weakly exogenous transition variable z defined in this way star model can be presented as follows where they can be understood as two regime

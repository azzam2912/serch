fgf family members possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities and are involved in a variety of biological processes including embryonic development cell growth morphogenesis tissue repair tumor growth and invasion fibroblast growth factor 10 is a paracrine signaling molecule seen first in the limb bud and organogenesis development fgf10 starts the developing of limbs and its involved in the branching of morphogenesis in multiple organs such as the lungs skin ear and salivary glands during the limb development tbx4 tbx5 stimulate the production of fgf10 in the lateral plate mesoderm where it will create an epithelial mesenchymal fgf signal with fgf8 this positive feedback loop will increase the amount of mesenchyme resulting in a bulge afterwards fgf10 will induce the formation of apical ectodermal ridge aer where the foot and hands will be formed lung development uses the same epithelial mesenchymal signaling from fgf10 in the foregut mesenchyme with fgfr2 in the foregut epithelium fgf10 signaling is required for epithelial branching therefore all branching morphogen organs such as the lungs skin ear and salivary glands required the constant expression of fgf10 this protein exhibits mitogenic activity for keratinizing epidermal cells but essentially no activity for fibroblasts which is similar

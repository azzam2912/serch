woomble notes we moved to mull for the space for the environment but it s actually been the people that have been so important my wife has family there at first i knew no one at all but the songs i ve written have definitely been shaped by the people i ve met sometimes i think it s odd how these songs came together quite quickly then i think well maybe it s not been quick at all maybe it s taken me 34 years to get here and i just didn t realise it the album was recorded over four months at mull s local arts centre an tobar with woomble enlisting thirteen musicians to assist in recording former idlewild bassist gavin fox appears throughout the album alongside phil cunningham lau s aidan o rourke and michael marra all songs written by woomble maclean unless otherwise noted

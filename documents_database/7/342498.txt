instead it often uses signals that indicate completion of instructions and operations specified by simple data transfer protocols this type of circuit is contrasted with synchronous circuits in which changes to the signal values in the circuit are triggered by repetitive pulses called a clock signal most digital devices today use synchronous circuits however asynchronous circuits have the potential to be faster and may also have advantages in lower power consumption lower electromagnetic interference and better modularity in large systems asynchronous circuits are an active area of research in digital logic design digital logic circuits can be divided into combinational logic in which the output signals depend only on the current input signals and sequential logic in which the output depends both on current input and on past inputs in other words sequential logic is combinational logic with memory virtually all practical digital devices require sequential logic sequential logic can be divided into two types synchronous logic and asynchronous logic the term asynchronous logic is used to describe a variety of design styles which use different assumptions about circuit properties these vary from the bundled delay model which uses conventional data processing elements with completion indicated by a locally generated

the chi square distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution and is one of the most widely used probability distributions in inferential statistics notably in hypothesis testing or in construction of confidence intervals when it is being distinguished from the more general noncentral chi square distribution this distribution is sometimes called the central chi square distribution the chi square distribution is used in the common chi square tests for goodness of fit of an observed distribution to a theoretical one the independence of two criteria of classification of qualitative data and in confidence interval estimation for a population standard deviation of a normal distribution from a sample standard deviation many other statistical tests also use this distribution such as friedman s analysis of variance by ranks if z z are independent standard normal random variables then the sum of their squares is distributed according to the chi square distribution with k degrees of freedom this is usually denoted as the chi square distribution has one parameter a positive integer k that specifies the number of degrees of freedom the number of z s the chi square distribution is used primarily in hypothesis testing and to a lesser extent

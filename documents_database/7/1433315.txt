it is a turbid light yellow liquid that is obtained from human blood platelets after freeze thaw cycle s the freeze thaw cycle causes the platelets to lyse releasing a large quantity of growth factors necessary for cell expansion fbs free cell culture media e g with platelet lysate or chemically defined animal component free are used for cell therapy or regenerative medicine they are commercially available in gmp good manufacturing practice quality which is generally basis for regulatory approval platelets have a life span of 5 to 9 days because of this the u s food and drug administration fda expires transfuse able platelets 5 days post collection typically hpl is produced from expired platelets that have been stored in frozen conditions no later than 7 days post collection hpl is created from single or pooled donor donated platelets isolated from whole blood or by apheresis distributed in a standard platelet collection bag there are some differences between hpl manufacturing protocols but they all share the same core of being frozen at very low temperatures and thawed this process may be repeated two or three times to cause complete platelet lysis the resultant hpl can then undergo different manufacturing

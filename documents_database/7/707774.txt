it is the unconformity between this sequence and the preceding kaskaskia that divides the carboniferous into the mississippian and pennsylvanian periods in north america like the kaskaskia sequence absaroka sedimentary deposits were dominated by detrital or siliclastic rocks the first sediments were deposited near the continental margins particularly near the ouachita and appalachian highlands characteristic of the strata from this time are cyclothems alternating marine and non marine strata indicative of changes in sea level probably due to cyclic glaciation in the southern hemisphere in north america the waters of the absaroka sequence regressed westward as the highlands to the east steadily eroded restricted oceanic circulation in the west led to extensive evaporite formation by the end of the period the regression was complete and the marine strata were superseded by extensive red bed deposition these cycles of sea level change have been divided into at least six magnitudes of order each order is a span of years that become smaller the smallest unit is described as a punctuated aggradational cycle pac and represents between 225 000 and 100 000 years of sediment accumulation in the field these units are usually one to five meters thick and contain several different

mathematically an image gradient represents the derivative of an image so the goal of gradient domain processing is to construct a new image by integrating the gradient which requires solving poisson s equation processing images in the gradient domain is a two step process the first step is to choose an image gradient this is often extracted from one or more images and then modified but it can be obtained through other means as well for example some researchers have explored the advantages of users painting directly in the gradient domain while others have proposed sampling a gradient directly from a camera sensor the second step is to solve poisson s equation to find a new image that can produce the gradient from the first step an exact solution often does not exist because the modified gradient field is no longer conservative so an image is found that approximates the desired gradient as closely as possible for image editing purposes the gradient is obtained from an existing image and modified various operators such as finite difference or sobel can be used to find the gradient of a given image this gradient can then be manipulated directly to produce a number

upwind schemes use an adaptive or solution sensitive finite difference stencil to numerically simulate the direction of propagation of information in a flow field the upwind schemes attempt to discretize hyperbolic partial differential equations by using differencing biased in the direction determined by the sign of the characteristic speeds historically the origin of upwind methods can be traced back to the work of courant isaacson and rees who proposed the cir method to illustrate the method consider the following one dimensional linear advection equation which describes a wave propagating along the formula 2 axis with a velocity formula 3 this equation is also a mathematical model for one dimensional linear advection consider a typical grid point formula 4 in the domain in a one dimensional domain there are only two directions associated with point formula 4 left towards negative infinity and right towards positive infinity if formula 3 is positive the travelling wave solution of the equation above propagates towards the right the left side of formula 4 is called upwind side and the right side is the downwind side similarly if formula 3 is negative the travelling wave solution propagates towards the left the left side is called downwind

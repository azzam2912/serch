the most common model of a smoothed earth is an earth ellipsoid or more specifically an earth spheroid i e an ellipsoid of revolution various successively more refined formulas for computing the theoretical gravity are referred to as the international gravity formula the first of which was proposed in 1930 by the international association of geodesy the general shape of that formula is in which is the gravity as a function of the geographic latitude of the position whose gravity is to be determined formula 2 denotes the gravity at the equator as determined by measurement and the coefficients and are parameters that must be selected to produce a good global fit to true gravity using the values of the grs80 reference system a commonly used specific instantiation of the formula above is given by using the appropriate double angle formula in combination with the pythagorean identity this can be rewritten in the equivalent forms up to the 1960s formulas based on the hayford ellipsoid 1924 and of the famous german geodesist helmert 1906 were often used the difference between the semi major axis equatorial radius of the hayford ellipsoid and that of the modern wgs84 ellipsoid is for helmert

the statistical entropy perspective was introduced in 1870 with the work of physicist ludwig boltzmann the macroscopic state of a system is characterized by a distribution on the microstates the entropy of this distribution is given by the gibbs entropy formula named after j willard gibbs for a classical system i e a collection of classical particles with a discrete set of microstates if formula 1 is the energy of microstate i and formula 2 is the probability that it occurs during the system s fluctuations then the entropy of the system is the quantity formula 4 is a physical constant known as boltzmann s constant which like the entropy has units of heat capacity the logarithm is dimensionless as are all logarithms this definition remains meaningful even when the system is far away from equilibrium other definitions assume that the system is in thermal equilibrium either as an isolated system or as a system in exchange with its surroundings the set of microstates with probability distribution on which the sum is done is called a statistical ensemble each type of statistical ensemble micro canonical canonical grand canonical etc describes a different configuration of the system s exchanges with the

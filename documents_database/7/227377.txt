there has been a long standing belief in dermatology that the stratum corneum consisted of dead cells corneocytes devoid of biological activity and function the stratum corneum is now understood to be live tissue that performs protective and adaptive physiological functions including mechanical shear impact resistance water flux and hydration regulation microbial proliferation and invasion regulation initiation of inflammation through cytokine activation and dendritic cell activity and selective permeability to exclude toxins irritants and allergens this layer is composed of 15 20 layers of flattened cells with no nuclei and cell organelles their cytoplasm shows filamentous keratin these corneocytes are embedded in a lipid matrix composed of ceramides cholesterol and fatty acids their properties depend on the component ratio of the three major components the stratum corneum functions to form a barrier to protect underlying tissue from infection dehydration chemicals and mechanical stress desquamation the process of cell shedding from the surface of the stratum corneum balances proliferating keratinocytes that form in the stratum basale these cells migrate through the epidermis towards the surface in a journey that takes approximately fourteen days during cornification the process whereby living keratinocytes are transformed into non living corneocytes the cell membrane is replaced

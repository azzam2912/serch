it is situated at the rutherford appleton laboratory of the science and technology facilities council on the harwell science and innovation campus in oxfordshire united kingdom it uses the techniques of muon spectroscopy and neutron scattering to probe the structure and dynamics of condensed matter on a microscopic scale ranging from the subatomic to the macromolecular hundreds of experiments are performed every year at the facility by researchers from around the world in diverse science areas such as physics chemistry materials engineering earth sciences biology and archaeology neutrons are uncharged constituents of atoms and penetrate materials well deflecting only from the nuclei of atoms the statistical accumulation of deflected neutrons at different positions beyond the sample can be used to find the structure of a material and the loss or gain of energy by neutrons can reveal the dynamic behaviour of parts of a sample for example diffusive processes in solids at isis the neutrons are created by accelerating bunches of protons in a synchrotron then colliding these with a heavy tungsten metal target under a constant cooling load to dissipate the heat from the 160 kw proton beam the impacts cause neutrons to spall off the tungsten atoms and

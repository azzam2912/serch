also called a surge protection device spd or transient voltage surge suppressor tvss this class of device is used to protect equipment in power transmission and distribution systems for consumer equipment protection different products called surge protectors are used the energy criterion for various insulation material can be compared by impulse ratio a surge arrester should have a low impulse ratio so that a surge incident on the surge arrester may be bypassed to the ground instead of passing through the apparatus to protect a unit of equipment from transients occurring on an attached conductor a surge arrester is connected to the conductor just before it enters the equipment the surge arrester is also connected to ground and functions by routing energy from an over voltage transient to ground if one occurs while isolating the conductor from ground at normal operating voltages this is usually achieved through use of a varistor which has substantially different resistances at different voltages surge arresters are not generally designed to protect against a direct lightning strike to a conductor but rather against electrical transients resulting from lightning strikes occurring in the vicinity of the conductor lightning which strikes the earth results in ground currents

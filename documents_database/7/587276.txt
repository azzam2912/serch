it was initially introduced to relieve the general mainframe central processors cps of specific db2 processing loads but currently is used to offload other z os workloads as described below the idea originated with previous special purpose processors the zaap which offloads java processing and the ifl which runs linux and z vm but not other ibm operating systems such as z os dos vse and tpf a system z pu processor unit is characterized as one of these processor types or as a cp central processor or sap system assist processor these processors do not contain microcode or hardware features that accelerate their designated workloads instead by relieving the general cp of particular workloads they often lead to a higher workload throughput at reduced license fees db2 for z os v8 was the first application to exploit the ziip but now there are several ibm and non ibm products and technologies that exploit ziip the ziip requires a system z9 or newer mainframe the z os 1 8 and db2 9 for z os support ziips ibm also offers ptfs for z os 1 6 z os 1 7 and db2 v8 to enable ziip usage db2 9 for

three types of branch attachment are recognized due to differences in the anatomical position of buds that form them two key components contribute to the mechanical strength and toughness of the attachment interlocking wood grain at the top of the attachment and an embedded knot that often lies within the attachment a common malformation of a branch attachment is the inclusion of bark within the join which can weaken the attachment initially branches are mechanically attached to the trunks of trees by forming interlocking wood grain patterns at the top of the joint within what is known as axillary wood fig 1 the axillary wood or xylem formed in this location is denser than in surrounding tissues of the tree s stem or branch the wood grain pattern formed is tortuous and in these tissues there is typically a reduction in vessel length diameter and frequency of occurrence i e more of the xylem consists of fibre cells this specialized xylem tissue axillary wood formed under the branch bark ridge provides unique mechanical properties to the union of the branch to the trunk requiring that wood fibres are stretched along their length the axial strength of the wood in order

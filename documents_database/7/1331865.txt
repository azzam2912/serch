freecad is intended for mechanical engineering product design but also expands to a wider range of uses around engineering such as architecture or electrical engineering users can not only interact with this software because of the free and open source nature of the software users can also extend the functionality of the software using the python programming language freecad is currently in a beta stage of development freecad features tools similar to catia creo solidworks solid edge nx inventor revit and therefore also falls into the category of building info modeling bim mechanical computer aided design mcad plm cax and cae it is intended to be a feature based parametric modeler with a modular software architecture which makes it easy to provide additional functionality without modifying the core system as with many modern 3d cad modelers it will have a 2d component to facilitate 3d to 2d drawing conversion under its current state direct 2d drawing like autocad lt is not the focus for this software neither are animation or 3d model manipulation like blender maya or cinema 4d however the modular nature of freecad will allow the user to adapt its workflow for such environments freecad uses open source

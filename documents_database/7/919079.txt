it is a glucoside of acetone cyanohydrin upon exposure to enzymes and gut flora in the human intestine linamarin and its methylated relative lotaustralin can decompose to the toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide hence food uses of plants that contain significant quantities of linamarin require extensive preparation and detoxification ingested and absorbed linamarin is rapidly excreted in the urine and the glucoside itself does not appear to be acutely toxic consumption of cassava products with low levels of linamarin is widespread in the low land tropics ingestion of food prepared from insufficiently processed cassava roots with high linamarin levels has been associated with dietary toxicity particularly with the upper motor neuron disease known as konzo to the african populations in which it was first described by trolli and later through the research network initiated by hans rosling however the toxicity is believed to be induced by ingestion of acetone cyanohydrin the breakdown product of linamarin dietary exposure to linamarin has also been reported as a risk factor in developing glucose intolerance and diabetes although studies in experimental animals have been inconsistent in reproducing this effect and may indicate that the primary effect is in aggravating existing conditions rather than inducing diabetes

the image viewed is exactly the same as the image on the film which replaces the viewing screen during exposure this type of camera was first developed in the era of the daguerreotype 1840s 1850s and still in use today though with many refinements it comprises a flexible bellows that forms a light tight seal between two adjustable standards one of which holds a lens and the other a viewfinder or a photographic film holder there are three general types the monorail camera the field camera and press or technical cameras the bellows is a flexible accordion pleated box it encloses the space between the lens and film and flexes to accommodate the movements of the standards the front standard is a board at the front of the camera that holds the lens and usually a shutter at the other end of the bellows the rear standard is a frame that holds a ground glass plate used for focusing and composing the image before exposure and is replaced by a holder containing the light sensitive film plate or image sensor for exposure the front and rear standards can move in various ways relative to each other unlike most other camera

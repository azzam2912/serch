thoralf skolem 1922 was the first to discuss the seemingly contradictory aspects of the theorem and to discover the relativity of set theoretic notions now known as non absoluteness although it is not an actual antinomy like russell s paradox the result is typically called a paradox and was described as a paradoxical state of affairs by skolem 1922 p 295 skolem s paradox is that every countable axiomatisation of set theory in first order logic if it is consistent has a model that is countable this appears contradictory because it is possible to prove from those same axioms a sentence that intuitively says or that precisely says in the standard model of the theory that there exist sets that are not countable thus the seeming contradiction is that a model that is itself countable and which therefore contains only countable sets satisfies the first order sentence that intuitively states there are uncountable sets a mathematical explanation of the paradox showing that it is not a contradiction in mathematics was given by skolem 1922 skolem s work was harshly received by ernst zermelo who argued against the limitations of first order logic but the result quickly came to be accepted

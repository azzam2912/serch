more were discovered by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter which was launched in 2009 and found about 70 more the origin of the irregular mare patches is uncertain crater counts which can give an indication of the age of an area by the number of craters upon it indicate that these regions can be as young as a few tens of millions of years old it has been hypothesized by the lro team that they are small volcanic lava flows due to their spectroscopic similarity to other lava flows however other analysts dispute this noting that there are many separate patches instead of one large patch this would require numerous small scale eruptions there is also no indication of flowing as there is in lava in other eruptions on the moon even more important the hypothesis of volcanic action is at odds with the current theory of the moon s geology which states that the moon should have cooled and solidified by about 1 billion years ago precluding further geological action if these features are volcanic in origin it is literally going to make geologists rewrite the textbooks about the moon according to the current scientific theories the moon s small

they include a wide variety of pathogenic genera such as escherichia salmonella vibrio helicobacter yersinia legionellales and many others others are free living nonparasitic and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation carl woese established this grouping in 1987 calling it informally the purple bacteria and their relatives because of the great diversity of forms found in this group it was named after proteus a greek god of the sea capable of assuming many different shapes and is not named after the proteobacteria genus proteus some alphaproteobacteria can grow at very low levels of nutrients and have unusual morphology such as stalks and buds others include agriculturally important bacteria capable of inducing nitrogen fixation in symbiosis with plants the type order is the caulobacterales comprising stalk forming bacteria such as caulobacter the betaproteobacteria are highly metabolically diverse and contain chemolithoautotrophs photoautotrophs and generalist heterotrophs the type order is the burkholderiales comprising an enormous range of metabolic diversity including opportunistic pathogens the gammaproteobacteria are the largest class in terms of species with validly published names the type order is the pseudomonadales which include the genera pseudomonas and the nitrogen fixing azotobacter the deltaproteobacteria include bacteria that are predators on

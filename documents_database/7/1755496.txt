using the pumped storage hydroelectric method the power plant has an installed capacity of to accomplish power generation the power station shifts water between two reservoirs the lower asahi reservoir and the upper seto reservoir construction on both the asahi and seto dams began in 1971 and was complete in 1978 the power station was commissioned in 1980 due to heavy sediment and turbidity in the seto reservoir caused by logging and landslides upstream a sediment bypass tunnel was constructed between 1992 and 1998 the lower reservoir is created by the asahi dam which is a tall and long arch dam on the asahi river of the shingu river system its catchment area covers an area of and the surface of the reservoir covers the lower reservoir s storage capacity is of which is active or usable for pumping up to the lower reservoir creating the upper reservoir in a valley above the lower is the seto dam it is a tall and long rock fill embankment dam with of fill its catchment area covers a much smaller area of and its surface covers the upper reservoir has a storage capacity of of which is useful for power generation down

it is the low pressure dimorph of caalo of which the high pressure dimorph is named dmitryivanovite krotite was reported in 2011 in a calcium aluminium rich inclusion cai in the carbonaceous chondrite meteorite nwa north west africa 1934 which landed in morocco the mineral name was approved by the international mineralogical association ima 2010 038 and honors alexander n krot a researcher in cosmochemistry at the university of hawaii at manoa in honolulu hawaii researchers have found that the mineral which has the same atomic arrangement as a man made component of some types of concrete forms under low pressure at a temperature of at least these conditions of high temperature and low pressure are consistent with a hypothesis that the krotite grains found in the meteorite formed as high temperature condensates from the solar nebula from which the solar system formed approximately 4 6 billion years ago thus they are likely to be among the earliest minerals formed in the solar system the cai containing the krotite was said to resemble a cracked egg because its rim was crosscut by cracks filled with iron and aluminum hydroxides researchers suggest that the mineral assemblage in the cai was at

the complex conjugate of the d matrix is an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian of spherical and symmetric rigid rotors the matrix was introduced in 1927 by eugene wigner stands for darstellung which means representation in german let be generators of the lie algebra of su 2 and so 3 in quantum mechanics these three operators are the components of a vector operator known as angular momentum examples are the angular momentum of an electron in an atom electronic spin and the angular momentum of a rigid rotor in all cases the three operators satisfy the following commutation relations where i is the purely imaginary number and planck s constant has been set equal to one the casimir operator commutes with all generators of the lie algebra hence it may be diagonalized together with this defines the spherical basis used here that is in this basis there is a complete set of kets with where j 0 1 2 1 3 2 2 for su 2 and j 0 1 2 for so 3 in both cases a 3 dimensional rotation operator can be written as where are euler angles characterized by the keywords z y z convention right handed frame

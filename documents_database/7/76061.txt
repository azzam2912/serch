it is transparent to translucent has high indices of refraction and ranges from colorless to yellow green and dark brown see etymology below baddeleyite is a refractory mineral with a melting point of 2700 c hafnium is a substituting impurity and may be present in quantities ranging from 0 1 to several percent it can be found in igneous rocks containing potassium feldspar and plagioclase baddeleyite is commonly not found with zircon zrsio because it forms in silica undersaturated rocks such as mafic rocks this is because when silica is free in the system silica saturated oversaturated zircon is the dominating phase not baddeleyite it belongs to the monoclinic prismatic class of the p2 c crystal system it has been used for geochronology baddeleyite was first found in sri lanka in 1892 it can be found in numerous terrestrial and lunar rocks some of these terrestrial rocks are carbonatite kimberlite alkaline syenite some rocks of layered mafic intrusions diabase dikes gabbroid sills and anorthosite some examples of lunar rocks are tektites meteorites and lunar basalt studies have shown that zircon and baddeleyite can be recovered from some anorthositic rocks in proterozoic anorthosite complexes places where these proterozoic anorthosite complexes can

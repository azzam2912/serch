it was covered the following year by ian matthews for his album stealin home and became a top 20 hit single in february 1979 concurrent with his top 40 success with shake it ian matthews would tell rolling stone i don t think i did anything different to record a hit single i guess it s my reward after all i ve been doing exactly what i want for 14 or 15 years however matthews would later acknowledge that on the single s parent album stealin home i tried to add just a couple of songs that had top 40 potential without compromising the rest of the material and the album did precisely what it was supposed to do it raised my profile without lowering my credibility matthews who had reached 23 on the hot 100 in 1972 fronting the matthews southern comfort single woodstock had as a solo act had one prior hot 100 entry with da doo ron ron also in 1972 also matthews would give credit for the success of shake it to mushroom records who picked up the stealin home album for u s and canadian release i ve had potential hit singles on earlier albums

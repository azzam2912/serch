his main contributions have been to highlight the role of carbonaceous aerosols in atmospheric chemistry heterogeneous bromine reactions and to employ chemical data assimilation for satellite validation and the use of machine learning for remote sensing applications he is author of autochem nasa release software that constitutes an automatic computer code generator and documentor for chemically reactive systems it was designed primarily for modeling atmospheric chemistry and in particular for chemical data assimilation he is author of more than 150 publications receiving more than 3 850 citations autochem has won five nasa awards and has been used to perform long term chemical data assimilation of atmospheric chemistry and in the validation of observations from the nasa aura satellite it has been used in numerous peer reviewed articles david lary completed his education in the united kingdom he received a first class double honors bsc in physics and chemistry from king s college london 1987 with the sambrooke exhibition prize in natural science and a phd in atmospheric chemistry from the university of cambridge department of chemistry while at churchill college 1991 his thesis described the first chemical scheme for the ecmwf numerical weather prediction model he then held post doctoral

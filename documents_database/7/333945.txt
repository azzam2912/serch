it applies to show that the representation theory of some group g is in a qualitative way controlled by that of some other compact group k an important example is that in which g is the complex general linear group and k the unitary group acting on vectors of the same size from the fact that the representations of k are completely reducible the same is concluded for those of g at least in finite dimensions the relationship between g and k that drives this connection is traditionally expressed in the terms that the lie algebra of k is a real form of that of g in the theory of algebraic groups the relationship can also be put that k is a dense subset of g for the zariski topology the trick works for reductive lie groups of which an important case are semisimple lie groups the complete reducibility of finite dimensional linear representations of compact groups or connected semisimple lie groups and complex semisimple lie algebras goes sometimes under the name of weyl s theorem a related result that the universal cover of a compact semisimple lie group is also compact also goes by the same name adolf hurwitz

kervran was born in quimper finist re brittany and received a degree as an engineer in 1925 in world war ii he was part of the french resistance kervran proposed that nuclear transmutation occurs in living organisms which he called biological transmutation he made this claim after doing an experiment with chickens where they were generating calcium in their egg shells while there was no calcium in their food or soil he had no known scientific explanation for it such transmutations are not possible according to mainstream physics chemistry and biology proponents of biological transmutations fall outside mainstream physics and are not part of the scientific discourse in the 1960s louis kervran claimed to have conducted experiments and studies demonstrating violations of the law of conservation of mass by biological systems according to which the amount of each chemical element is preserved in all chemical reactions specifically he claimed that organisms can transmute potassium into calcium by nuclear fusion in the course of making an egg shell since biological systems do not contain mechanisms to produce the speed temperature and pressure necessary for such reactions even for extremely short periods of time this contradicts basic physical laws kervran said that

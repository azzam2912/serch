in terms of apparent brightness it was the second brightest supernova of any kind fainter only than sn 1987a of the 20th century it was observed for nearly 700 days and it became the prototype object for the development of theoretical understanding of type ia supernovae the supernova was discovered by charles kowal about 56 arc seconds west and 85 arc seconds south of the center of ngc 5253 the position in the periphery of the galaxy aided observation minimizing interference by background objects well positioned for southern hemisphere observers it was quite observable from northern hemisphere observatories as well attempts made to observe it in x rays with uhuru and oso 7 and to detect gamma rays from it via cherenkov radiation showers gave at best equivocal results photometric and spectroscopic measurements were made in the visible and near infrared by many observers extending to about 700 days after maximum light interstellar absorption lines of ionized calcium due to gas both in our galaxy and ngc 5253 were observed allowing an estimate of the interstellar extinction the extended length of the observed light curve found a remarkably uniform 0 01 magnitudes per day decline starting about 60 days after

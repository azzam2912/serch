the ophthalmic nerve is a sensory nerve mostly carrying general somatic afferent fibers that transmit sensory information to the cns from structures of the eyeball the skin of the upper face and anterior scalp the lining of the upper part of the nasal cavity and air cells and the meninges of the anterior cranial fossa some of ophthalmic nerve branches also convey parasympathetic fibers the frontal branch passes through the orbit superiorly then reenters the frontal bone briefly before exiting above the orbit through the superior orbital fissure and the supraorbital notch to provide sensory innervation for the skin of the forehead and scalp the lacrimal nerve passes through the orbit superiorly to innervate the lacrimal gland the nasociliary branch gives off several sensory branches to the orbit and then continues out through the anterior ethmoidal foramen where it enters the nasal cavity and provides innervation for much of the anterior nasal mucosa it also gives off a branch which exits through the nasal bones to form the external nasal nerve the ophthalmic nerve is joined by filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic and communicates with the oculomotor trochlear and abducent nerves it gives off a recurrent meningeal

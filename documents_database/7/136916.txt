additional efficiency can be gained from regenerative braking which allows kinetic energy to be recovered during braking to put power back on the line newer electric locomotives use ac motor inverter drive systems that provide for regenerative braking electric locomotives are quiet compared to diesel locomotives since there is no engine and exhaust noise and less mechanical noise the lack of reciprocating parts means electric locomotives are easier on the track reducing track maintenance power plant capacity is far greater than any individual locomotive uses so electric locomotives can have a higher power output than diesel locomotives and they can produce even higher short term surge power for fast acceleration electric locomotives are ideal for commuter rail service with frequent stops electric locomotives are used on freight routes with consistently high traffic volumes or in areas with advanced rail networks power plants even if they burn fossil fuels are far cleaner than mobile sources such as locomotive engines the power can also come from clean or renewable sources including geothermal power hydroelectric power nuclear power solar power and wind turbines the chief disadvantage of electrification is the high cost for infrastructure overhead lines or third rail substations and control systems

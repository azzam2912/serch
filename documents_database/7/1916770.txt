these states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques some condensed matter theorists including subir sachdev hope that the ads cft correspondence will make it possible to describe these systems in the language of string theory and learn more about their behavior so far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator a superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss crossing lasers these atoms initially behave as a superfluid but as experimentalists increase the intensity of the lasers they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state during the transition the atoms behave in an unusual way for example the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on planck s constant the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics which does not enter into the description of

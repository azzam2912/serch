to function properly an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents known as pathogens from viruses to parasitic worms and distinguish them from the organism s own healthy tissue in many species there are two major subsystems of the immune system the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system both subsystems use humoral immunity and cell mediated immunity to perform their functions in humans the blood brain barrier blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier and similar fluid brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system however multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants such as plants and invertebrates these mechanisms include phagocytosis antimicrobial peptides called defensins and the complement system jawed vertebrates including humans have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently adaptive or acquired

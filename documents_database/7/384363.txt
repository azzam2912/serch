mathematically clipping can be described using the terminology of constructive geometry a rendering algorithm only draws pixels in the intersection between the clip region and the scene model lines and surfaces outside the view volume aka frustum are removed clip regions are commonly specified to improve render performance a well chosen clip allows the renderer to save time and energy by skipping calculations related to pixels that the user cannot see pixels that will be drawn are said to be within the clip region pixels that will not be drawn are outside the clip region more informally pixels that will not be drawn are said to be clipped in two dimensional graphics a clip region may be defined so that pixels are only drawn within the boundaries of a window or frame clip regions can also be used to selectively control pixel rendering for aesthetic or artistic purposes in many implementations the final clip region is the composite or intersection of one or more application defined shapes as well as any system hardware constraints in one example application consider an image editing program a user application may render the image into a viewport as the user zooms and scrolls to

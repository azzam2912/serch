using arthropods in a corpse or at a crime scene investigators can determine whether toxins were present in a body at the time of death this technique is a major advance in forensics previously such determinations were impossible in the case of severely decomposed bodies devoid of intoxicated tissue and bodily fluids ongoing research into the effects of toxins on arthropod development has also allowed better estimations of postmortem intervals drugs can have a variety of effects on development rates of arthropods morphine heroin cocaine and methamphetamine are commonly involved in cases where forensic entomology is used the stages of growth for insects provides a basis for determining a cause in altered cycles in a specific species an altered stage in development can often indicate toxins in the carrion on which the insects are feeding beetles order coleoptera and beetle feces are often used in entomotoxicology but the presence of toxins is often the result of the beetles feeding on fly larvae that have been feeding on the carrion containing toxic substances flies order diptera are the most commonly used insect in entomotoxicology through the study of sarcophaga curranea tibialis larvae barbiturates were found to increase the length of the

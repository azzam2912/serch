a henb performs the same function of an enodeb but is optimized for deployment for smaller coverage than macro enodeb such as indoor premises and public hotspots home node b is 3g umts counterpart of the henb within an henb access network there are three new network elements the home enodeb the security gateway segw and the home enodeb gateway or henb gw home enodeb henb a henb provides lte radio coverage for lte handsets henbs incorporate the capabilities of a standard enodeb security gateway segw installed in an operator s network the security gateway establishes ipsec tunnels with henbs using ikev2 signaling for ipsec tunnel management ipsec tunnels are responsible for delivering all voice messaging and packet data services between henb and the core network the segw forwards traffic to henb gw henb gateway henb gw it is an optional network element ne installed within an operator s network if it is present it is placed between the henb and the mme and it aggregates traffic from a large number of henbs back into an existing core service network through the standard s1 interface there are three architectural variations as described in 3gpp tr23 830 the variations are driven

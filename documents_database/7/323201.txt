found in all temperate to tropical oceans yet rarely seen the oarfish family contains three species in two genera one of these the giant oarfish regalecus glesne is the longest bony fish alive growing up to in length the common name oarfish is thought to be in reference either to their highly compressed and elongated bodies or to the now discredited belief that the fish row themselves through the water with their pelvic fins the family name regalecidae is derived from the latin regalis meaning royal the occasional beachings of oarfish after storms and their habit of lingering at the surface when sick or dying make oarfish a probable source of many sea serpent tales although the larger species are considered game fish and are fished commercially to a minor extent oarfish are rarely caught alive their flesh is not well regarded for eating due to its gelatinous consistency the dorsal fin originates from above the relatively large eyes and runs the entire length of the fish of the approximately 400 dorsal fin rays the first 10 to 13 are elongated to varying degrees forming a trailing crest embellished with reddish spots and flaps of skin at the ray tips

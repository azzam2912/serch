most biologists regard this taxon as extinct but the name is sometimes used in the classification of lampreys because lampreys were once thought to be related to cephalaspids if lampreys are included they would extend the known range of the group from the silurian and devonian periods to the present day cephalaspidomorphi were like most contemporary fishes very well armoured the head shield was particularly well developed protecting the head gills and the anterior section of the viscera the body was in most forms well armoured as well the head shield had a series of grooves over the whole surface forming an extensive lateral line organ the eyes were rather small and placed on the top of the head there was no jaw proper the mouth opening was surrounded by small plates making the lips flexible but without any ability to bite no internal skeleton is known outside of the head shield if they had a vertebral column at all it would have been cartilage rather than bone likely the axial skeleton consisted of an unsegmented notochord a fleshy appendage emerged laterally on each side behind the head shield functioning as pectoral fins the tail had a single wrap around

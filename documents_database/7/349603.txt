the technique can provide information about the structure crystal orientation phase or strain in the material traditionally these types of studies have been carried out using x ray diffraction xrd neutron diffraction and or electron diffraction in a transmission electron microscope for an ebsd measurement a flat polished crystalline specimen is placed in the sem chamber at a highly tilted angle 70 from horizontal towards the diffraction camera to increase the contrast in the resultant electron backscatter diffraction pattern the phosphor screen is located within the specimen chamber of the sem at an angle off approximately 90 to the pole piece and is coupled to a compact lens which focuses the image from the phosphor screen onto the ccd camera in this configuration some of the electrons which enter the sample backscatter and may escape as these electrons leave the sample they may exit at the bragg condition related to the spacing of the periodic atomic lattice planes of the crystalline structure and diffract these diffracted electrons can escape the material and some will collide and excite the phosphor causing it to fluoresce inside the sem the electron beam is focussed onto the surface of a crystalline sample the electrons

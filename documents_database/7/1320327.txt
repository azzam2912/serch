they are generally designed to transmit on international distress frequencies maritime systems have been standardized under the global maritime distress safety system the use of radio to aid in rescuing survivors of accidents at sea came to the forefront after the sinking of the rms titanic in 1912 lifeboats were equipped with spark gap transmitters such as the marconi type 241 c 1920 these operated using morse code on 500 khz the international distress frequency at the time this frequency had the advantage of long range due to ground wave propagation and was constantly monitored by all large ships at sea after the titanic s sinking however due to its wavelength of 600 meters a long antenna was required to achieve good range long wires on the order of 1 4 wavelength held up by kites or balloons were often used spark gap continued to be used in lifeboats long after the technology was banned for general communication during world war ii germany developed a hand crank 500 khz rescue radio the notsender emergency transmitter ns2 it used two vacuum tubes and was crystal controlled the radio case curved inward in the middle so that a user seated in an

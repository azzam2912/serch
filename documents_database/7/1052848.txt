in general the collision of high energy particles can produce jets of elementary particles that emerge from these collisions collisions of ultra relativistic heavy ion particle beams create a hot and dense medium comparable to the conditions in the early universe and then these jets interact strongly with the medium leading to a marked reduction of their energy this energy reduction is called jet quenching in the context of high energy hadron collisions quarks and gluons are collectively called partons the jets emerging from the collisions originally consist of partons which quickly combine to form hadrons a process called hadronization only the resulting hadrons can be directly observed the hot dense medium produced in the collisions is also composed of partons it is known as a quark gluon plasma qgp in this realm the laws of physics that apply are those of quantum chromodynamics qcd high energy nucleus nucleus collisions make it possible to study the properties of the qgp medium through the observed changes in the jet fragmentation functions as compared to the unquenched case according to qcd high momentum partons produced in the initial stage of a nucleus nucleus collision will undergo multiple interactions inside the collision region

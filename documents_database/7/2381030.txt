in contrast most prokaryotic cells contain circular chromosomes where the dna is arranged in one large circular molecule however linear chromosomes are not limited to eukaryotic organisms some prokaryotic organisms do have linear chromosomes as well such as borrelia burgdorferi it is possible to take a prokaryotic cell with a circular chromosome linearize the chromosome and still have a viable organism linear chromosomes have a few advantages and disadvantages to circular chromosomes one reason that many organisms have evolved to having linear chromosomes is the size of their genome linear chromosomes make it easier for transcription and replication of large genomes if an organism had a very large genome arranged in a circular chromosome it would have the potential problems when unwinding due to torsional strain as mentioned before linear chromosomes are not perfect and have their disadvantages the biggest being the terminal ends of the chromosomes or telomeres generally telomeres tend to be unstable and lead to mutations or tumors additionally due to the methods of dna replication the ends of the telomeres will not completely be replicated and will be lost which is known as the end replication problem most eukaryotic cells are able to prevent crucial dna

generally increases in per capita income tend to decrease the poverty rate hence the elasticity is positive standard estimates of gep for developing countries range from 1 5 to 5 with an average estimate of around 3 this implies that a 1 increase in per capita income is associated with a 3 decrease in the poverty rate proportion of people living on less than 1 per day this implies that economic growth is fundamental to reducing poverty rates particularly in low income countries however the gep also depends on other variables among them the initial level of income inequality countries with a more equal distribution of income as measured for example by the gini index experience a greater reduction in the poverty rate for a given increase in per capita income the gep ranges from slightly less than 1 for very unequal countries to as high as 6 for very equal countries this suggests that in poor countries that also have a very unequal distribution of income economic reforms aimed at reducing inequality may be a prerequisite for pro growth policies to make a substantial impact on poverty levels on the other hand for poor countries which already have an

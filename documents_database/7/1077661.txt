it is a lost minor planet that has only been observed six times on the nights of 3 4 april 1995 by david jewitt and jun chen at the mauna kea observatory hawaii using the uh88 telescope and has not been observed ever since the object is estimated to have been discovered right at perihelion closest approach to the sun on the night of discovery the object is estimated to have been moving away from earth at with the uncertainty in the velocity being an unrealistic 80 the speed of light the nominal orbit of 1995 gj suggests it orbits the sun at a distance of 39 46 au once every 281 years with an assumed eccentricity of 0 09 and an inclination of 23 with respect to the ecliptic but 1995 gj has the highest possible orbital uncertainty and thus very large uncertainties in the orbital elements with only a 1 day observation arc the orbit is so poorly constrained as to be almost worthless the eccentricity is listed as even though realistically it will be less than 1 otherwise known for their low inclinations this cubewano may be the first of its kind to have an inclination greater

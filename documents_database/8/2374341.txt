its manufacture involves the synthesis of polyurethanes having carboxylic acid functionality or nonionic hydrophiles like peg incorporated into or pendant from the polymer backbone there has been a general trend towards converting existing resin systems to waterborne for ease of use and environmental considerations particularly their development was driven by increased demand for solventless systems since the manufacture of coatings and adhesives entailed the increasing release of solvents into the atmosphere from numerous sources the problem has always been that polyurethanes in water are not stable reacting to produce a urea and carbon dioxide many papers have been published on the subject for environmental reasons there is even a push to have pud available both water based and bio based puds are used because of the general desire to formulate coatings adhesives sealants and elastomers based on water rather than solvent and because of the perceived or assumed benefits to the environment the techniques and manufacturing processes have changed over the years from those described in the first papers journal articles and patents that were published there are a number of techniques available depending on what type of species is required an ion may be formed which can be an

xpress includes a general purpose non linear solver xpress nonlinear including a successive linear programming algorithm slp first order method and artelys knitro second order methods xpress was originally developed by dash optimization and was acquired by fico in 2008 its initial authors were bob daniel and robert ashford the first version of xpress could only solve lps support for mips was added in 1986 being released in 1983 xpress was the first commercial lp and mip solver running on pcs in 1992 an xpress version for parallel computing was published which was extended to distributed computing five years later xpress was the first mip solver to cross the billion decision variable threshold by introducing 64 bit indexing in 2010 since 2014 xpress features the first commercial implementation of a parallel dual simplex method linear and quadratic programs can be solved via the primal simplex method the dual simplex method or the barrier interior point method all mixed integer programming variants are solved by a combination of the branch and bound method and the cutting plane method infeasible problems can be analyzed via the iis irreducible infeasible subset method xpress provides a built in tuner for automatic tuning of control

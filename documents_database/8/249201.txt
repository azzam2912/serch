the kinetochore assembles on the centromere and links the chromosome to microtubule polymers from the mitotic spindle during mitosis and meiosis its proteins also help to hold the sister chromatids together and play a role in chromosome editing details of the specific areas of origin are unknown monocentric organisms including vertebrates fungi and most plants have a single centromeric region on each chromosome which assembles a single localized kinetochore holocentric organisms such as nematodes and some plants assemble a kinetochore along the entire length of a chromosome kinetochores start control and supervise the striking movements of chromosomes during cell division during mitosis which occurs after chromosomes are duplicated in s phase two sister chromatids are held together by a centromere each chromatid has its own kinetochore which face in opposite directions and attach to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle apparatus following the transition from metaphase to anaphase the sister chromatids separate from each other and the individual kinetochores on each chromatid drive their movement to the spindle poles that will define the two new daughter cells the kinetochore is therefore essential for the chromosome segregation that is classically associated with mitosis and meiosis the kinetochore contains two regions even

while the constituents can often be modeled as having isotropic behaviour the microstructure characteristics shape orientation varying volume fraction of heterogeneous materials often leads to an anisotropic behaviour anisotropic material models are available for linear elasticity in the nonlinear regime the modeling is often restricted to orthotropic material models which does not capture the physics for all heterogeneous materials micromechanics goal is to predict the anisotropic response of the heterogeneous material on the basis of the geometries and properties of the individual phases a task known as homogenization micromechanics allows to predicting multi axial properties that are often difficult to measure experimentally a typical example is the out of plane properties for unidirectional composites the main advantage of micromechanics is to perform virtual testing in order to reduce the cost of an experimental campaign indeed an experimental campaign of heterogeneous material is often expensive and involve a larger number of permutations constituent material combinations fiber and particle volume fractions fiber and particle arrangements and processing histories once the constituents properties are known all these permutations can be simulated through virtual testing using micromechanics there is several ways to obtain the material properties of each constituents by identifying the behaviour based

deception technology products can detect analyze and defend against zero day and advanced attacks often in real time they are automated accurate and provide insight into malicious activity within internal networks which may be unseen by other types of cyber defense deception technology enables a more proactive security posture by seeking to deceive the attackers detect them and then defeat them allowing the enterprise to return to normal operations existing defense in depth cyber technologies have struggled against the increasing wave of sophisticated and persistent human attackers these technologies seek primarily to defend a perimeter but both firewalls and end point security cannot defend a perimeter with 100 certainty cyber attackers can penetrate these networks and move unimpeded for months stealing data and intellectual property heuristics may find an attacker within the network but often generate so many alerts that critical alerts are missed since 2014 attacks have accelerated and there is evidence that cyber attackers are penetrating traditional defenses at a rapidly increasing rate deception technology considers the human attacker s point of view and method for exploiting and navigating networks to identify and exfiltrate data it integrates with existing technologies to provide new visibility into the internal networks

sars belongs to the class ii amino acyl trna family and is found in all humans its encoded enzyme seryl trna synthetase is involved in protein translation and is related to several bacterial and yeast counterparts mutations in sars have been associated with several conditions including hupra syndrome since the 1960s seryl trna synthetases have been described in various eukaryotic species in both biochemical and structural analyses it was not until 1997 that human sars and its enzyme product were isolated and expressed in escherichia coli by a team from the european molecular biology laboratory in france the human sars gene is located on the plus strand of chromosome 1 from base pair 109 213 893 to base pair 109 238 182 seryl trna synthetase is made up of 514 amino acid residues as weighs 58 777 da it exists as a homodimer of two identical subunits with the trna molecule binding across the dimer by similarity it has two distinct domains sars and it s enzyme product seryl trna synthetase are involved in protein translation specifically seryl trna synthetase catalyses the transfer of l serine to trna ser the cytosolic enzyme recognises its cognate trna species and binds with

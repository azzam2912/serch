this method is used when and is derived from the general method above where x and x are amplitudes of any two successive peaks for system where formula 9 not too close to the critically damped regime where formula 10 the method of fractional overshoot can be useful for damping ratios between about 0 5 and 0 8 the fractional overshoot os is where x is the amplitude of the first peak of the step response and x is the settling amplitude then the damping ratio is

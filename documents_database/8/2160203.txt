four conductors are used to carry the two legs of the balanced line all four conductors must be an equal distance from a common point usually the center of a cable the four conductors are arranged in a four pointed star forming a square opposite points of the star are connected together at each end of the cable to form each leg of the balanced circuit star quad cables often use filler elements to hold the conductor centers in a symmetric four point arrangement about the cable axis all points of the star must lie at equal distances from the center of the star when opposite points are connected together they act as if they are one conductor located at the center of the star this configuration places the geometric center of each of the two legs of the balanced circuit in the center of the star to a magnetic field both legs of the balanced circuit appear to be in the exact center of the star this means that both legs of the balanced circuit will receive exactly the same interference from the magnetic field and a common mode interference signal will be produced this common mode interference signal

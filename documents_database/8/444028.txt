they were established in 1693 by giovanni domenico cassini a prominent scientist of his time refinements of these laws to include physical librations have been made and they have been generalized to treat other satellites and planets in the case of the moon its rotational axis always points some 1 5 degrees away from the north ecliptic pole the normal to the moon s orbital plane and its rotational vector are always on opposite sides of the ecliptic plane therefore both the normal to the orbital plane and the moon s rotational axis precess around the ecliptic pole with the same period the period is about 18 6 years and the motion is retrograde a system obeying these laws is said to be in a cassini state that is an evolved rotational state where the spin axis orbit normal and normal to the laplace plane are coplanar while the obliquity remains constant the laplace plane is defined as the plane about which a planet or satellite orbit precesses with constant inclination cassini state 1 is defined as the situation in which both the spin axis and the orbit normal axis are on the same side of the normal to the

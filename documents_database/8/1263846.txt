in breast cancer patients for example automated tissue image analysis may be used to test for high levels of proteins known to be present in more aggressive forms of breast cancers automated tissue imaging analysis can significantly reduce uncertainty in characterizing tumors compared to evaluations done by histologists or improve the prediction rate of recurrence of some cancers as it is a digital system suitable for networking it also facilitates cooperative efforts between distant sites systems for automatically analyzing tissue samples also reduce costs and save time high performance ccd cameras are used for acquiring the digital images coupled with advanced widefield microscopes and various algorithms for image restoration this approach can provide better results than confocal techniques at comparable speeds and lower costs the united states food and drug administration classifies these systems as medical devices under the general instrumentation category of automatic test equipment atis have seven basic processes sample preparation image acquisition image analysis results reporting data storage network communication and self system diagnostics and realization of these functions highly accurate hardware and well integrated complex and expensive software specimen preparation is critical for evaluating the tumor in the automated system in the first part of the

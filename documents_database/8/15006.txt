observing objects that are neither black nor ravens may formally increase the likelihood that all ravens are black even though intuitively these observations are unrelated this problem was proposed by the logician carl gustav hempel in the 1940s to illustrate a contradiction between inductive logic and intuition hempel describes the paradox in terms of the hypothesis via contraposition this statement is equivalent to in all circumstances where 2 is true 1 is also true and likewise in all circumstances where 2 is false i e if a world is imagined in which something that was not black yet was a raven existed 1 is also false given a general statement such as all ravens are black a form of the same statement that refers to a specific observable instance of the general class would typically be considered to constitute evidence for that general statement for example is evidence supporting the hypothesis that all ravens are black the paradox arises when this same process is applied to statement 2 on sighting a green apple one can observe by the same reasoning this statement is evidence that 2 if something is not black then it is not a raven but since as

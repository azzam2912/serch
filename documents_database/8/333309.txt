it is only found as a dilute gas phase when concentrated or condensed it converts to so disulfur dioxide it has been detected in space but is rarely encountered intact otherwise the so molecule has a triplet ground state similar to o i e each molecule has two unpaired electrons the s o bond length of 148 1 pm is similar to that found in lower sulfur oxides e g so s o 148 pm but is longer than the s o bond in gaseous so 146 pm so 143 1 pm and so 142 pm the molecule is excited with near infrared radiation to the singlet state with no unpaired electrons the singlet state is believed to be more reactive than the ground state triplet state in the same way that singlet oxygen is more reactive than the triplet oxygen production of so as a reagent in organic syntheses has centred on using compounds that extrude so examples include the decomposition of the relatively simple molecule ethylene episulfoxide as well as more complex examples such as a trisulfide oxide chso the so molecule is thermodynamically unstable converting initially to so so inserts into alkenes alkynes and dienes producing molecules

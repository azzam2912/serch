as a result the flame speed is limited by the rate of diffusion diffusion flames tend to burn slower and to produce more soot than premixed flames because there may not be sufficient oxidizer for the reaction to go to completion although there are some exceptions to the rule the soot typically produced in a diffusion flame becomes incandescent from the heat of the flame and lends the flame its readily identifiable orange yellow color diffusion flames tend to have a less localized flame front than premixed flames the contexts for diffusion may vary somewhat for instance a candle uses the heat of the flame itself to vaporize its wax fuel and the oxidizer oxygen diffuses into the flame from the surrounding air while a gaslight flame or the safety flame of a bunsen burner uses fuel already in the form of a vapor diffusion flames are often studied in counter flow also called opposed jet burners their interest is due to possible application in the flamelet model for turbulent combustion furthermore they provide a convenient way to examine strained flames and flames with holes these are also known under the name of edge flames characterized by a local extinction

neural network control basically involves two steps it has been shown that a feedforward network with nonlinear continuous and differentiable activation functions have universal approximation capability recurrent networks have also been used for system identification given a set of input output data pairs system identification aims to form a mapping among these data pairs such a network is supposed to capture the dynamics of a system for the control part deep reinforcement learning has shown its ability to control complex systems bayesian probability has produced a number of algorithms that are in common use in many advanced control systems serving as state space estimators of some variables that are used in the controller the kalman filter and the particle filter are two examples of popular bayesian control components the bayesian approach to controller design often requires an important effort in deriving the so called system model and measurement model which are the mathematical relationships linking the state variables to the sensor measurements available in the controlled system in this respect it is very closely linked to the system theoretic approach to control design

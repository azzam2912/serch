he began by observing the natural prey catching behavior of the common european toad bufo bufo ewert s work with toads yielded several important discoveries ewert 1974 2004 in general his research revealed the specific neural circuits for recognition of complex visual stimuli specifically he identified two main regions of the brain the tectum and the thalamic pretectal region that were responsible for discriminating prey from non prey and revealed the neural pathways that connected them furthermore he found that the neural mechanisms are plastic and adaptable to varying environments and conditions carew 2000 zupanc 2004 the common toad responds to a moving insect or worm with a series of prey catching reactions 1 orienting towards prey 2 stalking up to prey 3 binocular fixation 4 snapping 5 swallowing and 6 mouth wiping with forelimb ewert 1974 this series of movement constitutes a stimulus response chain where each reaction of the toad provides the stimulus constellation for the next response first if an object is recognized as prey and thus catches the toad s attention the toad will orient towards the stimulus by turning its body to face it then it approaches the prey binocularly focusing intently on it during

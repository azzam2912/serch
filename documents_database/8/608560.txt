vought already had a two seat observation plane the uo 1 basically a ve with additional fuselage streamlining and a wright j 3 radial engine this was made into a fighter simply by covering over the front cockpit of the observation plane mounting machine guns in that area and upgrading to a 220 hp wright r 790 whirlwind with a supercharger with the help of the supercharger the newly designated fu 1 was able to reach a speed of 147 mph at 13 000 ft the fu 1s were delivered to vf 2b based in san diego california with their float gear mounted one was assigned to each of the battleships of the pacific fleet where they were launched from catapults they spent eight months in this role but as the squadron went to aircraft carrier operations the further aft cockpit proved to have a visibility problem when maneuvering around a carrier deck in response the forward cockpit was re opened the resulting aircraft being designated fu 2 by this time they were obsolescent and the two seaters served primarily as trainers and utility aircraft

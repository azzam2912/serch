cancer systems biology represents the application of systems biology approaches to the analysis of how the intracellular networks of normal cells are perturbed during carcinogenesis to develop effective predictive models that can assist scientists and clinicians in the validations of new therapies and drugs tumours are characterized by genomic and epigenetic instability that alters the functions of many different molecules and networks in a single cell as well as altering the interactions with the local environment cancer systems biology approaches therefore are based on the use of computational and mathematical methods to decipher the complexity in tumorigenesis as well as cancer heterogeneity cancer systems biology encompasses concrete applications of systems biology approaches to cancer research notably a the need for better methods to distill insights from large scale networks b the importance of integrating multiple data types in constructing more realistic models c challenges in translating insights about tumorigenic mechanisms into therapeutic interventions and d the role of the tumor microenvironment at the physical cellular and molecular levels cancer systems biology therefore adopts a holistic view of cancer aimed at integrating its many biological scales including genetics signaling networks epigenetics cellular behavior mechanical properties histology pre clinical manifestations and epidemiology

systemic gdf11 treatment improves vasculature in the hippocampus and cortex of old mice resulting in enhanced neurogenesis also systematic replenishment of gdf11 improved the survival and morphology of cells and improved glucose metabolism in both non genetic and genetic mouse models of type 2 diabetes gdf11 triggers a calorie restriction like phenotype without affecting appetite or gdf15 levels in the blood restores the insulin igf 1 signaling pathway and stimulates adiponectin secretion from white adipose tissue by direct action on adipocytes while repairing neurogenesis in the aged brain gdf11 is a regulator of skin biology and has significant effects on the production of procollagen i and hyaluronic acid gdf11 also activates the smad2 3 phosphorylation pathway in skin endothelial cells and improves skin vasculature supplementation of systemic gdf11 levels which normally decline with age by heterochronic parabiosis or systemic delivery of recombinant protein reversed functional impairments and restored genomic integrity in aged muscle stem cells satellite cells increased gdf11 levels in aged mice also improved muscle structural and functional features and increased strength and endurance exercise capacity treatment of old mice to restore gdf11 to youthful levels recapitulated the effects of parabiosis and reversed age related hypertrophy revealing a therapeutic

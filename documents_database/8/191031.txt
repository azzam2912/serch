along with parch marks soil marks and frost marks can reveal buried archaeological sites not visible from the ground crop marks appear due to the principle of differential growth one of the factors controlling the growth of vegetation is the condition of the soil a buried stone wall for example will affect crop growth above it as its presence channels water away from its area and occupies the space of the more fertile soil conversely a buried ditch with a fill containing more organic matter than the natural earth provides much more conducive conditions and water will naturally collect there nourishing the plants growing above the differences in conditions will cause some plants to grow more strongly and therefore taller and others less strongly and therefore shorter some species will also react through differential ripening of their fruits or their overall colour particularly effective crops that exhibit differential growth include cereal crops peas and potatoes differential growth will naturally follow any features buried below although the growth differences may appear small close up from the air the pattern they make is more visible as the small changes can be seen as marked differences in tone or colour in the context

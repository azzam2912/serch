it is a scalar quantity depending upon three spatial variables and is typically denoted as either r or n r the density is determined through definition by the normalized n electron wavefunction which itself depends upon 4 n variables 3 n spatial and n spin coordinates conversely the density determines the wave function modulo a phase factor providing the formal foundation of density functional theory the electronic density corresponding to a normalized n electron wavefunction with r and s denoting spatial and spin variables respectively is defined as where the operator corresponding to the density observable is in hartree fock and density functional theories the wave function is typically represented as a single slater determinant constructed from n orbitals with corresponding occupations n in these situations the density simplifies to from its definition the electron density is a non negative function integrating to the total number of electrons further for a system with kinetic energy t the density satisfies the inequalities for finite kinetic energies the first stronger inequality places the square root of the density in the sobolev space h r together with the normalization and non negativity this defines a space containing physically acceptable densities as the second

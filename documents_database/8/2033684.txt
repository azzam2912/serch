the principal investigator of the moxie instrument is michael hecht from the massachusetts institute of technology mit the niels bohr institute at the university of copenhagen is collaborating with mit to develop this prototype if successful the technology can be scaled up as a means of producing oxygen for propellant oxidant in a mars ascent vehicle mav for a sample return the main objective of this experiment is to produce molecular oxygen o from the atmospheric carbon dioxide co present in the atmosphere at 96 scientists will record the efficiency of the o production rate and the resulting oxygen and carbon monoxide will be vented out after measurements are done to achieve this objective the moxie instrument has a goal of producing 22 g of oxygen o per hour with 99 6 purity during 50 sols martian days nasa officials stated that if moxie worked efficiently they could land a 100 times larger moxie based instrument on mars along with a radioisotope thermoelectric generator over the course of some years the generator would power the system which would produce up to two kilograms of oxygen per hour and fill an oxygen reservoir that could be used for a sample return

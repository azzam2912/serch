miniaturization however has increased dissipated power per unit area and made it a key limiting factor in integrated circuit performance temperature increase becomes relevant for relatively small cross sections wires where it may affect normal semiconductor behavior besides since the generation of heat is proportional to the frequency of operation for switching circuits fast computers have larger heat generation than slow ones an undesired effect for chips manufacturers this article summaries physical concepts that describe the generation and conduction of heat in an integrated circuit and presents numerical methods that model heat transfer from a macroscopic point of view at macroscopic level fourier s law states a relation between the transmitted heat per unit time per unit area and the gradient of temperature where formula 2 is the thermal conductivity w m k electronic systems work based on current and voltage signals current is the a flow of charged particles through the material and these particles electrons or holes interact with the lattice of the crystal losing its energy which is released in form of heat joule heating is a predominant mechanism for heat generation in integrated circuits and is an undesired effect in most of the cases for an

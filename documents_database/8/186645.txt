it is related to the gate turn off gto thyristor it was jointly developed by mitsubishi and abb like the gto thyristor the igct is a fully controllable power switch meaning that it can be turned both on and off by its control terminal the gate gate drive electronics are integrated with the thyristor device an igct is a special type of thyristor it is made of the integration of the gate unit with the gate commutated thyristor gct wafer device the close integration of the gate unit with the wafer device ensures fast commutation of the conduction current from the cathode to the gate the wafer device is similar to a gate turn off thyristor gto they can be turned on and off by a gate signal and withstand higher rates of voltage rise dv dt such that no snubber is required for most applications the structure of an igct is very similar to a gto thyristor in an igct the gate turn off current is greater than the anode current this results in a complete elimination of minority carrier injection from the lower pn junction and faster turn off times the main differences are a reduction in cell

it can be used as a rule of thumb for estimating a changing quantity where both the quantity and the steps are easily divisible by 12 typical uses are predicting the height of the tide or the change in day length over the seasons the rule states that over the first period the quantity increases by 1 12 then in the second period by 2 12 in the third by 3 12 in the fourth by 3 12 fifth by 2 12 and at the end of the sixth period reaches its maximum with an increase of 1 12 the steps are 1 2 3 3 2 1 giving a total change of 12 12 over the next six intervals the quantity reduces in a similar manner by 1 2 3 3 2 1 twelfths in many parts of the world the tides approximate to a semi diurnal sine curve that is there are two high and two low tides per day as an estimate then each period equates to an hour with the tide rising by 1 2 or 3 twelfths of its total range in each hour in places where there is only one high and one low

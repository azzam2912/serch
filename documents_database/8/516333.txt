all measurements are subject to uncertainty and a measurement result is complete only when it is accompanied by a statement of the associated uncertainty such as the standard deviation by international agreement this uncertainty has a probabilistic basis and reflects incomplete knowledge of the quantity value it is a non negative parameter the measurement uncertainty is often taken as the standard deviation of a state of knowledge probability distribution over the possible values that could be attributed to a measured quantity relative uncertainty is the measurement uncertainty relative to the magnitude of a particular single choice for the value for the measured quantity when this choice is nonzero this particular single choice is usually called the measured value which may be optimal in some well defined sense e g a mean median or mode thus the relative measurement uncertainty is the measurement uncertainty divided by the absolute value of the measured value when the measured value is not zero the purpose of measurement is to provide information about a quantity of interest a measurand for example the measurand might be the size of a cylindrical feature the volume of a vessel the potential difference between the terminals of a battery

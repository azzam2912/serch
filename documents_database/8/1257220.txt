they lived between the early jurassic and the late cretaceous the following cladogram simplified after an analysis presented by marco brandalise de andrade and colleagues in 2011 goniopholidids are known across laurasia ranging from north america europe and china from the middle jurassic and reaching thailand by the early cretaceous compared to modern crocodilians goniopholids are very unusual in several respects they possessed two rows of rectangular interlocking osteoderms like those of terrestrial crocodilymorphs like atoposaurids that are relatively simple do not extend far in their necks as opposed to the ornate armours of modern crocodilians likewise unlike modern crocodilians but like many extinct forms like phytosaurs they have ventral osteoderms as well their forelimbs are also proportionally very long particularly in the humeri and wrist bones being as long or longer than the hindlimbs the opposite of the condition seen in modern crocodilians some like anteophthalmosuchus also have forwardly oriented eyes as opposed to the dorsally oriented eyes seen in modern forms these suggest multiple biomechanical differences from modern species

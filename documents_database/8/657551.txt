these markings may be found on transformer cases beside terminals winding leads nameplates schematic and wiring diagrams the convention is that current entering a transformer at the end of a winding marked with a dot will tend to produce current exiting other windings at their dotted ends maintaining proper polarity is important in power system protection measurement and control systems a reversed instrument transformer winding may defeat protective relays give inaccurate power and energy measurements or result in display of negative power factor reversed connections of paralleled transformer windings will cause circulating currents or an effective short circuit in signal circuits reversed connections of transformer windings can result in incorrect operation of amplifiers and speaker systems or cancellation of signals that are meant to add leads of primary and secondary windings are said to be of the same polarity when instantaneous current entering the primary winding lead results in instantaneous current leaving the secondary winding lead as though the two leads were a continuous circuit in the case of two windings wound around the same core in parallel for example the polarity will be the same on the same ends a sudden instantaneous current in the first coil will induce

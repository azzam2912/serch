president franklin d roosevelt on april 10 1940 following the invasions of denmark and norway by nazi germany one of the primary concerns of the u s government in the early years of world war ii was to prevent the nazis from using the financial resources of the united states to finance their military campaigns and occupation costs the task of enforcing this goal by controlling financial assets fell to the us treasury department and president roosevelt enabled its actions by issuing executive order 8389 on april 10 1940 which froze norwegian and danish assets in the united states as precedent roosevelt invoked an act of october 6 1917 and executive order 6560 of january 15 1934 in doing so roosevelt not only offered symbolic support to the occupied nations of europe but also guaranteed future practical assistance by assuring that the assets of such states would be returned once the aggressors were defeated the order initially ruling only on norwegian and danish assets was later amended to include those of most european states with the notable exemption of great britain the subsequent amendments were filed under separate order numbers after the occupation and annexation of the baltic states estonia

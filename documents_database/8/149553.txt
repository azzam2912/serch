h tellegen as a hypothetical fifth linear element after the resistor capacitor inductor and ideal transformer unlike the four conventional elements the gyrator is non reciprocal gyrators permit network realizations of two or more port devices which cannot be realized with just the conventional four elements in particular gyrators make possible network realizations of isolators and circulators gyrators do not however change the range of one port devices that can be realized although the gyrator was conceived as a fifth linear element its adoption makes both the ideal transformer and either the capacitor or inductor redundant thus the number of necessary linear elements is in fact reduced to three circuits that function as gyrators can be built with transistors and op amps using feedback an important property of a gyrator is that it inverts the current voltage characteristic of an electrical component or network in the case of linear elements the impedance is also inverted in other words a gyrator can make a capacitive circuit behave inductively a series lc circuit behave like a parallel lc circuit and so on it is primarily used in active filter design and miniaturization an ideal gyrator is a linear two port device which

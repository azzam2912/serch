the bounds are important tools in the design and analysis of certain methods in telecommunication engineering particularly in coding theory the bounds were originally published in a 1974 paper by l r welch if formula 1 are unit vectors in formula 2 define formula 3 where formula 4 is the usual inner product on formula 2 then the following inequalities hold for formula 6 if formula 8 then the vectors formula 9 can form an orthonormal set in formula 2 in this case formula 11 and the bounds are vacuous consequently interpretation of the bounds is only meaningful if formula 12 this will be assumed throughout the remainder of this article the first welch bound corresponding to formula 13 is by far the most commonly used in applications its proof proceeds in two steps each of which depends on a more basic mathematical inequality the first step invokes the cauchy schwarz inequality and begins by considering the formula 14 gram matrix formula 15 of the vectors formula 9 i e the trace of formula 15 is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues because the rank of formula 15 is at most formula 20 and it is a positive semidefinite

for the ech nerve of an open cover one can show that if the space formula 1 is compact and if every intersection of open sets in the cover is contractible then one can contract these sets and get a simplicial set that is weakly equivalent to formula 1 in a natural way for the tale topology and other sites these conditions fail the idea of a hypercover is to instead of only working with formula 3 fold intersections of the sets of the given open cover formula 4 to allow the pairwise intersections of the sets in formula 5 to be covered by an open cover formula 6 and to let the triple intersections of this cover to be covered by yet another open cover formula 7 and so on iteratively hypercoverings have a central role in tale homotopy and other areas where homotopy theory is applied to algebraic geometry such as motivic homotopy theory the original definition given for tale cohomology by jean louis verdier in sga4 expose v sec 7 thm 7 4 1 to compute sheaf cohomology in arbitrary grothendieck topologies for the tale site the definition is the following let formula 1 be a scheme

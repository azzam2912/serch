the field is broadly defined and includes foundations in biology applied mathematics statistics biochemistry chemistry biophysics molecular biology genetics genomics computer science and evolution computational biology is different from biological computing which is a subfield of computer science and computer engineering using bioengineering and biology to build computers but is similar to bioinformatics which is an interdisciplinary science using computers to store and process biological data computational biology which includes many aspects of bioinformatics is the science of using biological data to develop algorithms or models to understand biological systems and relationships until recently biologists did not have access to very large amounts of data this data has now become commonplace particularly in molecular biology and genomics researchers were able to develop analytical methods for interpreting biological information but were unable to share them quickly among colleagues bioinformatics began to develop in the early 1970s it was considered the science of analyzing informatics processes of various biological systems at this time research in artificial intelligence was using network models of the human brain in order to generate new algorithms this use of biological data to develop other fields pushed biological researchers to revisit the idea of using computers to evaluate

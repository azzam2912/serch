aire is a transcription factor expressed in the medulla inner part of the thymus it is part of the mechanism which eliminates self reactive t cells that would cause autoimmune disease it exposes t cells to normal healthy proteins from all parts of the body and t cells that react to those proteins are destroyed each t cell recognizes a specific antigen when it is presented in complex with a mhc molecule by an antigen presenting cell this recognition is accomplished by the t cell receptors expressed on the cell surface t cells receptors are generated by randomly shuffled gene segments which results in a highly diverse population of t cells each with a unique antigen specificity subsequently t cells with receptors that recognize the body s own proteins need to be eliminated while still in the thymus through the action of aire medullary thymic epithelial cells mtec express major proteins from elsewhere in the body so called tissue restricted antigens tra and t cells that respond to those proteins are eliminated through cell death apoptosis thus aire drives negative selection of self recognizing t cells when aire is defective t cells that recognize antigens normally produced by the body

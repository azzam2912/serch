most chemical reactions are stepwise that is they take more than one elementary step to complete an intermediate is the reaction product of each of these steps except for the last one which forms the final product reactive intermediates are usually short lived and are very seldom isolated also owing to the short lifetime they do not remain in the product mixture for example consider this hypothetical stepwise reaction the reaction includes these elementary steps the chemical species x is an intermediate the iupac gold book defines an intermediate as a molecular entity atom ion molecule with a lifetime appreciably longer than a molecular vibration that is formed directly or indirectly from the reactants and reacts further to give either directly or indirectly the products of a chemical reaction the lifetime condition distinguishes true chemically distinct intermediates from vibrational states or such transition states which by definition have lifetimes close to that of molecular vibration and thus intermediates correspond to potential energy minima of depth greater than available thermal energy arising from temperature rt where r is gas constant and t is temperature many intermediates are short lived and highly reactive thus having a low concentration in the reaction mixture

it is based on a 32 bit architecture that runs up to eight concurrent threads with built in analog to digital converters adc oscillator and power supplies it will be available from autumn 2013 running at 500 mhz each thread can run at up to 125 mhz the xs1 ana comprises a single or dual tile processor each with a switch digital i o ports and set of analogue input channels the execution core has a data path a memory and register banks for eight threads the switches of two or more xs1 ana xcore una and xcore xs1 l processors can be connected using one or more links whereupon threads on all of the tiles can communicate with each other by exchanging messages through the switches the xcore xs1 instruction set architecture supports 12 general purpose registers per thread a standard 3 operand instruction set is used for programming the thread the processor can perform input and output directly from the instruction set using in and out instructions complex interfaces are designed by programming a sequence of in and out instructions the xcore xs1 instruction set architecture has a built in scheduler that deschedules threads that wait for an

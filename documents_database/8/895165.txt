i love you is a 1971 american comedy drama film directed and written by steven hilliard stern and starring peter kastner the style of the film is like many others of its era taking its cues from the graduate and the raunchiness of the early 1970s as kastner plays a youthful tv commercials producer whose quest in life is to bed as many women as possible while trying to remain faithful to his childhood sweetheart who remains in tow awaiting the day they will marry the film was released to little or no fanfare and remains today a curious relic from the early 1970s it is extremely hard to find as it was never released on vhs and has not been released on dvd as of december 2018 it runs on the fox movie channel from time to time but it is an edited version it runs 89 minutes excising 10 minutes from the original theater release print howard thompson of the new york times was positive writing with young mr kastner appealingly front and center the movie skips along jauntily wisely and amusingly reined in by a snug cluster of key performances and the pointed tart dialogue gene siskel

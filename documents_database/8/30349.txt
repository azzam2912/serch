it is the simplest beta keto acid and like other members of this class it is unstable the methyl and ethyl esters which are quite stable are produced on a large scale industrially as precursors to dyes acetoacetic acid is a weak acid under typical physiological conditions acetoacetic acid exists as its conjugate base acetoacetate acetoacetate is produced in the mitochondria of the liver from acetoacetyl coenzyme a coa first another acetyl group is added from acetyl coa to form 3 hydroxy 3 methylgluteryl coa then an acetyl coa is lost from this yielding acetoacetate the initial acetoacetate can come from the last cycle in the beta oxidation of a fatty acid or it can be synthesized from two acetyl coa molecules catalyzed by thiolase in mammals acetoacetate produced in the liver along with the other two ketone bodies is released into the bloodstream as an energy source during periods of fasting exercise or as a result of type 1 diabetes mellitus first a coa group is enzymatically transferred to it from succinyl coa converting it back to acetoacetyl coa this is then broken into two acetyl coa molecules by thiolase and these then enter the citric acid cycle heart

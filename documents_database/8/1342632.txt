such terminals will have the capability to adapt to the context they operate in through possibly power and rate control as well as channel selection software agents embedded in these terminals will potentially be selfish meaning they will only try to maximize the throughput connectivity of the terminal they function for as opposed to maximizing the welfare total capacity of the system they operate in thus the potential interactions among them can be modeled through non cooperative games the researchers in this field often strive to determine the stable operating points of systems composed of such selfish terminals and try to come up with a minimum set of rules etiquette so as to make sure that the optimality loss compared to a cooperative centrally controlled setting is kept at a minimum game theory is the study of strategic decision making more formally it is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision makers an alternative term suggested as a more descriptive name for the discipline is interactive decision theory game theory is mainly used in economics political science and psychology as well as logic and biology the subject first addressed zero sum games such that

it seems counterintuitive both that there could be a person who is causing the others to drink or that there could be a person such that all through the night that one person were always the last to drink the first objection comes from confusing formal if then statements with causation see correlation does not imply causation or relevance logic for logics which demand relevant relationships between premise and consequent unlike classical logic assumed here the formal statement of the theorem is timeless eliminating the second objection because the person the statement holds true for at one instant is not necessarily the same person it holds true for at any other instant the formal statement of the theorem is where d is an arbitrary predicate and p is an arbitrary nonempty set the proof begins by recognizing it is true that either everyone in the pub is drinking or at least one person in the pub is not drinking consequently there are two cases to consider a slightly more formal way of expressing the above is to say that if everybody drinks then anyone can be the witness for the validity of the theorem and if someone does not drink

more specifically it is oxygen deficiency in arterial blood hypoxemia has many causes often respiratory disorders and can cause tissue hypoxia as the blood is not supplying enough oxygen to the body hypoxemia refers to the low level of oxygen in blood and the more general term hypoxia is an abnormally low oxygen content in any tissue or organ or the body as a whole hypoxemia can cause hypoxia hypoxemic hypoxia but hypoxia can also occur via other mechanisms such as anemia hypoxemia is usually defined in terms of reduced partial pressure of oxygen mm hg in arterial blood but also in terms of reduced content of oxygen ml oxygen per dl blood or percentage saturation of hemoglobin the oxygen binding protein within red blood cells with oxygen which is either found singly or in combination while there is general agreement that an arterial blood gas measurement which shows that the partial pressure of oxygen is lower than normal constitutes hypoxemia there is less agreement concerning whether the oxygen content of blood is relevant in determining hypoxemia this definition would include oxygen carried by hemoglobin the oxygen content of blood is thus sometimes viewed as a measure of tissue delivery

for example filters are used to separate roughness and waviness from the primary profile or to create a multiscale decomposition in order to identify the scale at which a phenomenon occurs historically the first roughness measuring instruments stylus profilometer used to have electronic filters made of capacitors and resistors that filtered out low frequencies in order to retain frequencies that represent roughness later digital filters replaced analog filters and international standards such as iso 11562 for the gaussian filter were published today a full set of filters is described in the iso 16610 standard series this standard is part of the gps standards on geometrical product specification and verification developed by iso tc 213 iso 16610 is composed of two families of documents one for profiles open and closed and one for surfaces a general introduction is provided in profile filters are defined for open profiles measured along a line by profilometers and expressed as z f x as well as for closed profiles measured around a circular component by roundness instruments and expressed as radius f angle most of these standards were first published as a technical specification ts and later converted to international standards or withdrawn parts related

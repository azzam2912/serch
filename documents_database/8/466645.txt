iatrogenic causes account for approximately 56 of esophageal perforations usually due to medical instrumentation such as an endoscopy or paraesophageal surgery in contrast the term boerhaave syndrome is reserved for the 10 of esophageal perforations which occur due to vomiting spontaneous perforation of the esophagus most commonly results from a full thickness tear in the esophageal wall due to a sudden increase in intraesophageal pressure combined with relatively negative intrathoracic pressure caused by straining or vomiting effort rupture of the esophagus or boerhaave s syndrome other causes of spontaneous perforation include caustic ingestion pill esophagitis barrett s esophagus infectious ulcers in patients with aids and following dilation of esophageal strictures in most cases of boerhaave s syndrome the tear occurs at the left postero lateral aspect of the distal esophagus and extends for several centimeters the condition is associated with high morbidity and mortality and is fatal without treatment the occasionally nonspecific nature of the symptoms may contribute to a delay in diagnosis and a poor outcome spontaneous effort rupture of the cervical esophagus leading to localized cervical perforation may be more common than previously recognized and has a generally benign course preexisting esophageal disease is not a prerequisite for

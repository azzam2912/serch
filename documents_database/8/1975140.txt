this process relies on the key interaction between the integrin 4 7 and the addressin madcam 1 on the surfaces of the appropriate cells additionally this interaction is strengthened by the presence of ccr9 a chemokine receptor which interacts with teck vitamin a derived retinoic acid regulates the expression of these cell surface proteins t cells are produced in the thymus and upon leaving they migrate to and around the lymphoid organs of the body including lymph nodes in the paracortex of the lymphoid nodes they are exposed to professional antigen presenting cells apcs such as dendritic cells dcs specific interactions between the na ve t cells and their cognate antigens result in t cell activation the activated t cells immunoblasts undergo clonal expansion before acquiring effector functions the activated t cells then emigrate from the lymph nodes via the efferent lymphatic vessel and migrate around the body in the blood in certain circumstances some activated t cells show a preference for patrolling certain tissues this has been termed lymphocyte homing gut specific homing is the preferential movement of activated t cells to the intestine and the gut in this way t cells are effectively recruited to form part of

it consists of four or five amino acid residues with either serine or threonine as the first residue residue i it is defined by two internal hydrogen bonds one is between the side chain oxygen of residue i and the main chain nh of residue i 2 or i 3 the other is between the main chain oxygen of residue i and the main chain nh of residue i 3 or i 4 two websites are available for finding and examining st motifs in proteins motivated proteins and pdbemotif when one of the hydrogen bonds is between the main chain oxygen of residue i and the side chain nh of residue i 3 the motif incorporates a beta turn when one of the hydrogen bonds is between the side chain oxygen of residue i and the main chain nh of residue i 2 the motif incorporates an st turn as with st turns a significant proportion of st motifs occur at the n terminus of an alpha helix with the serine or threonine as the n cap residue they have thus often been described as helix capping features a related motif is the asx motif which has aspartate or asparagine

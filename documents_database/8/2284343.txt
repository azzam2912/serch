it is a special plane section of the quadric as this circle is the intersection with the quadric of the plane containing the circle any plane section of a sphere is a circular section if it contains at least 2 points any quadric of revolution contains circles as sections with planes that are orthogonal to its axis it does not contain any other circles if it is not a sphere more hidden are circles on other quadrics such as tri axial ellipsoids elliptic cylinders etc nevertheless it is true that equivalently all quadric surfaces contain circles except parabolic and hyperbolic cylinders and hyperbolic paraboloids if a quadric contains a circle then every intersection of the quadric with a plane parallel to this circle is also a circle provided it contains at least two points except for spheres the circles contained in a quadric if any are all parallel to one of two fixed planes which are equal in the case of a quadric of revolution circular sections are used in crystallography the circular sections of a quadric may be computed from the implicit equation of the quadric as it is done in the following sections they may also be characterised

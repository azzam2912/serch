the first is one of the variants of the free radical theory of aging it was formulated by j michel in 1980 and was developed in the works of a v linnan 1989 the second was proposed by a n lobachev in 1978 mitochondrial free radical theory of aging mfrta proposes that free radicals produced by mitochondrial activity damage cellular components leading to aging mitochondria are cell organelles which function to provide the cell with energy by producing atp adenosine triphosphate during atp production electrons can escape the mitochondrion and react with water producing reactive oxygen species ros for short ros can damage macromolecules including lipids proteins and dna which is thought to facilitate the process of ageing in the 1950s denham harman proposed the free radical theory of ageing which he later expanded to the mfrta when studying the mutations in antioxidants which remove ros results were inconsistent however it has been observed that overexpression of antioxidant enzymes in yeast worms flies and mice were shown to increase lifespan mitochondria are thought to be organelles that developed from endocytosed bacteria which learned to coexist inside our cells these bacteria maintained their own dna the mitochondrial dna mtdna which codes

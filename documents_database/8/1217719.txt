essentially an enlarged version of the earlier westinghouse j30 the j34 produced 3 000 pounds of thrust twice as much as the j30 later models produced as much as 4 900 lb with the addition of an afterburner it first flew in 1947 the j46 engine was developed as a larger more powerful version of westinghouse s j34 engine about 50 larger built in an era of rapidly advancing gas turbine engine technology the j34 was largely obsolete before it saw service and often served as an interim engine for instance the douglas x 3 stiletto was equipped with two j34 engines when the intended westinghouse j46 engine proved to be unsuitable the stiletto was developed to investigate the design of an aircraft at sustained supersonic speeds however equipped with the j34 instead of its intended engines it was seriously underpowered and could not exceed mach 1 in level flight developed during the transition from piston engined aircraft to jets the j34 was sometimes fitted to aircraft as a supplement to other powerplants as with the lockheed p 2 neptune and douglas skyrocket fitted with radial piston engines and a rocket engine respectively the afterburner was developed by solar aircraft

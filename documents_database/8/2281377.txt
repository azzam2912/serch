it is found in the indian ocean and the red sea and is unusual among sea anemones in that it can divide itself in two transversely anthopleura stellula is unusual among sea anemones in that it can divide by transverse fission this is not a common method of asexual reproduction among these sea anemones but tends to occur as a reaction to stress such as when an anemone is experiencing a lowering of the salinity the fission involves the animal forming a transverse constriction before dividing in two the oral portion growing a new pedal disc and the basal portion growing a new oral disc and pharynx there are a few other sea anemones such as gonactinia prolifera that can divide in this way and all are rather small primitive sea anemones with simple internal structures internal reorganisation often starts before the fission process commences during the fission process an indentation occurs halfway down the column new tentacles begin to develop below the constriction and the two portions separate research has shown that a decrease in salinity encourages fission while an increase prevents it happening when a stellula was placed in an aquarium with the gem anemone aulactinia verrucosa and

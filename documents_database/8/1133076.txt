this protein promotes mitochondrial homeostasis and survival of cells under stress and is involved in inflammatory and hypoxia related diseases including atherosclerosis ischemic heart disease and alzheimer s disease as well as cancer the protein encoded by this gene is 10 4 kda mitochondrial inner membrane protein with two transmembrane domains at the n and c terminals these two domains are arranged such that the n and c terminals face outward into the intermembrane space while the rest of the protein loops inside the matrix though the n terminal domain is not necessary to direct the localization of higd1a it is required for the survival of the protein the gene higd1a is an isoform of himp1 b via alternative splicing higd1a primarily functions in mitochondrial homeostasis and thus cell survival when under conditions of stress such as hypoxia and glucose deprivation for instance higd1a promotes survival of pancreatic and cells under stress higd1a has also been found in other parts of the brain heart liver and kidney where it enhances the survival of these organs in macrophages higd1a prevents apoptosis by inhibiting cytochrome c release and caspase activity higd1a is also involved in mitochondrial fusion by regulating opa1 activity its

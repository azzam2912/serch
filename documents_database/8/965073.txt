the former are particles whose rest mass is zero or negligible compared to their energy and therefore move at the speed of light or very close to it the latter are particles whose kinetic energy is much lower than their rest mass and therefore move much slower than the speed of light the intermediate case is not treated well analytically if the universe is expanding adiabatically then it will satisfy the first law of thermodynamics formula 1 where formula 2 is the total heat which is assumed to be constant formula 3 is the internal energy of the matter and radiation in the universe formula 4 is the pressure and formula 5 the volume one then finds an equation for the energy density formula 6 and so formula 7 where in the last equality we used the fact that the total volume of the universe is proportional to formula 8 formula 9 being the scale factor of the universe in fact this equation can be directly obtained from the equations of motion governing the friedmann lema tre robertson walker metric by dividing the equation above with formula 10 and identifying formula 11 the energy density we get one of the

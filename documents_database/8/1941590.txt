grammar of a regular language from a given set of example strings although mark e gold has shown that not every regular language can be learned this way see language identification in the limit approaches have been investigated for a variety of subclasses they are sketched in this article for learning of more general grammars see grammar induction a regular language is defined as a finite or infinite set of strings that can be described by one of the mathematical formalisms called finite automaton regular grammar or regular expression all of which have the same expressive power since the latter formalism leads to shortest notations it shall be introduced and used here given a set of symbols a k a alphabet a regular expression can be any of for example using 0 1 the regular expression 0 1 0 1 denotes the set of all binary numbers with one or two digits leading zero allowed while 1 0 1 0 denotes the infinite set of all even binary numbers no leading zeroes given a set of strings also called positive examples the task of regular language induction is to come up with a regular expression that denotes a set containing

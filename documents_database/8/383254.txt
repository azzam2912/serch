for example an animal might first learn to associate a bell with food first order conditioning but then learn to associate a light with the bell second order conditioning honeybees show second order conditioning during proboscis extension reflex conditioning in the soc procedure there are three phases in the first training phase a conditioned stimulus cs1 is followed by an unconditioned stimulus us in the second phase a second order conditioned stimulus cs2 is presented along with cs1 finally in the test phase cs2 is presented alone to the subjects while their responses are recorded theoretical models for how second order conditioning soc works have a basis in associative learning theories there are four broad models based on the associations formed during soc the first model suggests that the second order stimulus cs2 and the conditioned response cr form a direct link which is strengthened by the presence of the first order stimulus cs1 the second model suggests that in successful soc an associative representation of each stimulus is created the presentation of the cs2 would evoke a representation of the cs1 which would evoke a representation of the unconditioned stimulus us thus leading to the cr the third model

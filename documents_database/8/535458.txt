it is more common in infants with low birth weight lbw and those who receive prolonged mechanical ventilation to treat respiratory distress syndrome rds it results in significant morbidity and mortality the definition of bpd has continued to evolve primarily due to changes in the population such as more survivors at earlier gestational ages and improved neonatal management including surfactant antenatal glucocorticoid therapy and less aggressive mechanical ventilation currently the description of bpd includes the grading of its severity into mild moderate and severe this correlates with the infant s maturity growth and overall severity of illness the new system offers a better description of underlying pulmonary disease and its severity feeding problems are common in infants with bpd often due to prolonged intubation such infants often display oral tactile hypersensitivity also known as oral aversion physical findings prolonged high oxygen delivery in premature infants causes necrotizing bronchiolitis and alveolar septal injury with inflammation and scarring this results in hypoxemia today with the advent of surfactant therapy and high frequency ventilation and oxygen supplementation infants with bpd experience much milder injury without necrotizing bronchiolitis or alveolar septal fibrosis instead there are usually uniformly dilated acini with thin alveolar septa and

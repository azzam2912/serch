the endoskeleton develops within the skin or in the deeper body tissues the vertebrate endoskeleton is basically made up of two types of tissues bone and cartilage during early embryonic development the endoskeleton is composed of notochord and cartilage the notochord in most vertebrates is replaced by the vertebral column and cartilage is replaced by bone in most adults in three phyla and one subclass of animals endoskeletons of various complexity are found chordata echinodermata porifera and coleoidea an endoskeleton may function purely for support as in the case of sponges but often serves as an attachment site for muscle and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces a true endoskeleton is derived from mesodermal tissue such a skeleton is present in echinoderms and chordates the poriferan skeleton consists of microscopic calcareous or siliceous spicules or a spongin network the coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense there a mollusk exoskeleton evolved into several sorts of internal structure the cuttlebone of cuttlefish being the best known version yet they do have cartilaginous tissue in their body even if it is not mineralized especially in the head where it forms a primitive cranium the endoskeleton gives shape support

signal timing involves deciding how much green time the traffic signal provides to an intersection approach how long the pedestrian walk signal should be and numerous other factors to understand basic signal timing fundamentals one must also understand the different modes of operation of the signal controller which controls the signal traffic signals may be placed into two broad groups by their method of operation they can be either pre timed or actuated pre timed signals provide each intersection approach a fixed amount of time on a round robin basis serving each approach consecutively and repeating the pattern no movements are skipped an actuated traffic signal relies on some mechanism for detecting vehicles as they approach the intersection where detection has occurred green time is provided to that approach approaches with no detection are skipped these two schemes are also referred to as interval based and phase based signal timing the national electrical manufacturers association nema has defined a standard scheme by which each intersection movement may be serviced without allowing conflicting movements to enter the intersection simultaneously this scheme is commonly referred to as the nema phasing diagram one of the most frequently used method of detection is induction

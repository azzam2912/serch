the standardization process began in 1977 while the seven layer osi model is often used as a reference for teaching and documentation the protocols originally conceived for the model did not gain popularity and only x 400 x 500 and is is have achieved lasting impact the goal of an open standard protocol suite instead has been met by the internet protocol suite maintained by the internet engineering task force ietf the osi protocol stack is structured into seven conceptual layers the layers form a hierarchy of functionality starting with the physical hardware components to the user interfaces at the software application level each layer receives information from the layer above processes it and passes it down to the next layer each layer adds encapsulation information header to the incoming information before it is passed to the lower layer headers generally include address of source and destination error control information protocol identification and protocol parameters such as flow control options and sequence numbers this layer deals with the physical plugs and sockets and electrical specification of signals only this is the medium over which the digital signals are transmitted it can be twisted pair coaxial cable optical fiber wireless or

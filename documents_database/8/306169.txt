a 3 km wide summit caldera tops the volcano and is elongated in east west direction this orientation is shared with calderas on other volcanoes in marie byrd land and reflects regional tectonic stress the slopes of the volcano feature parasitic vents and glacial corries and are much steeper north of the volcano than south of it most of the mountain is covered by ice and its eastern sector may be a crater that the mountain is mostly ice covered makes it difficult to determine its composition the origin of the elongated shape of the volcano and the volcanological relation between the parasitic cinder cones and the main volcanic pile its volume may be about the plateau and parasitic cones are formed by hawaiite and the few outcrops on the main volcano by benmoreite and comendite they contain phenocrysts of olivine plagioclase pyroxene and titanaugite in the former and of clinopyroxene feldspar and olivine an age of 9 1 million years ago has been obtained on a basaltic lava flow beneath the volcano and it has been inferred that the basal plateau formed between 10 1 and 9 1 million years ago the massif is younger with ages ranging from

indian journalist vinayak chatterjee describes it as one of the lesser known and even lesser used methods of public procurement for core and social infrastructure projects a swiss challenge system is a bidding process designed to elicit private sector initiative in core sector projects it s an offer made by the original proponent to the government ensuring his process to be best in terms of effectiveness including both the factors cost and time by his initiative as a result of his own innovative approach or on the demand of the government to perform certain task the swiss challenge system like the bonus system further allows third parties to make better offers challenges for a project during a designated period with simple objective to discourage frivolous project or to avoid exaggerated project development costs then accordingly the original proponent gets the right to counter match any superior offers given by the third party there are two different patterns which the commissioning entity may adopt however it has been observed that in both bonus and swiss challenge systems it is not easy to find the right balance between incentives to propose beneficial projects and incentives for third parties to submit counter proposals

the sensor transduces an input electrical signal into a mechanical wave which unlike an electrical signal can be easily influenced by physical phenomena the device then transduces this wave back into an electrical signal changes in amplitude phase frequency or time delay between the input and output electrical signals can be used to measure the presence of the desired phenomenon the basic surface acoustic wave device consists of a piezoelectric substrate with an input interdigitated transducer idt on one side of the surface of the substrate and an output idt on the other side of the substrate the space between the idts across which the surface acoustic wave propagates is known as the delay line the signal produced by the input idt a physical wave moves much slower than its associated electromagnetic form causing a measurable delay surface acoustic wave technology takes advantage of the piezoelectric effect in its operation most modern surface acoustic wave sensors use an input interdigitated transducer idt to convert an electrical signal into an acoustic wave the sinusoidal electrical input signal creates alternating polarity between the fingers of the interdigitated transducer between two adjacent sets of fingers polarity of the fingers will be switched e

the method uses rolling circle replication to amplify small fragments of genomic dna into dna nanoballs fluorescent nucleotides bind to complementary nucleotides and are then polymerized to anchor sequences bound to known sequences on the dna template the base order is determined via the fluorescence of the bound nucleotides this dna sequencing method allows large numbers of dna nanoballs to be sequenced per run at lower reagent costs compared to other next generation sequencing platforms however a limitation of this method is that it generates only short sequences of dna which presents challenges to mapping its reads to a reference genome after purchasing complete genomics the beijing genomics institute bgi refined dna nanoball sequencing to sequence nucleotide samples on their own platform dna nanoball sequencing involves isolating dna that is to be sequenced shearing it into small 100 350 base pair bp fragments ligating adapter sequences to the fragments and circularizing the fragments the circular fragments are copied by rolling circle replication resulting in many single stranded copies of each fragment the dna copies concatenate head to tail in a long strand and are compacted into a dna nanoball the nanoballs are then adsorbed onto a sequencing flow cell the

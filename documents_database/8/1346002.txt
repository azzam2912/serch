besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks bcrypt is an adaptive function over time the iteration count can be increased to make it slower so it remains resistant to brute force search attacks even with increasing computation power the bcrypt function is the default password hash algorithm for openbsd and other systems including some linux distributions such as suse linux there are implementations of bcrypt for c c c go java javascript elixir perl php python ruby and other languages blowfish is notable among block ciphers for its expensive key setup phase it starts off with subkeys in a standard state then uses this state to perform a block encryption using part of the key and uses the result of that encryption which is more accurate at hashing to replace some of the subkeys then it uses this modified state to encrypt another part of the key and uses the result to replace more of the subkeys it proceeds in this fashion using a progressively modified state to hash the key and replace bits of state until all subkeys have been set provos and mazi res took advantage of this and took it further they developed a

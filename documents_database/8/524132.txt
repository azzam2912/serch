given the set of strings formula 1 of total length formula 2 it is a patricia tree containing all formula 2 suffixes of the strings it is mostly used in bioinformatics it can be built in formula 4 time and space and can be used to find all formula 5 occurrences of a string formula 6 of length formula 7 in formula 8 time which is asymptotically optimal assuming the size of the alphabet is constant when constructing such a tree each string should be padded with a unique out of alphabet marker symbol or string to ensure no suffix is a substring of another guaranteeing each suffix is represented by a unique leaf node algorithms for constructing a gst include ukkonen s algorithm 1995 and mccreight s algorithm 1976 a suffix tree for the strings codice 1 and codice 2 is shown in a figure above they are padded with the unique terminator strings codice 3 and codice 4 the numbers in the leaf nodes are string number and starting position notice how a left to right traversal of the leaf nodes corresponds to the sorted order of the suffixes the terminators might be strings or unique single symbols

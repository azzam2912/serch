as originally planned this was a highly ambitious scheme as its name suggests but only the central section between chesterfield market place and lincoln together with a branch from langwith junction to the outskirts of sheffield were ever built the section between chesterfield and langwith junction by then renamed shirebrook north was closed to passenger traffic by british railways in december 1951 bolsover south and scarcliffe stations were closed completely the section from chesterfield market place through the tunnel to arkwright town was singled but remained open to goods traffic until march 1957 after which the tunnel became redundant tracks through the tunnel were duly lifted and the tunnel itself was infilled in the 1970s the tunnel s eastern approach cutting duckmanton cutting remained in use by trains serving arkwright colliery they had to run into the cutting then reverse into the colliery and vice versa on exit in 1981 this complicated and therefore costly arrangement was ended by re routing the tracks away from duckmanton junction to run directly into the colliery making the approach cutting redundant for railway purposes so the tracks were duly lifted the colliery closed in 1988 this previously insignificant cutting subsequently gained international recognition

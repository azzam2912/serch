the first leaf sensor was developed by leafsens an israeli company granted a us patent for a mechanical leaf thickness sensing device in 2001 leafsen has made strides incorporating their leaf sensory technology into citrus orchards in israel a solid state smart leaf sensor technology was developed by the university of colorado at boulder for nasa in 2007 it was designed to help monitor and control agricultural water demand agrihouse received a national science foundation nsf sttr grant in conjunction with the university of colorado to further develop the solid state leaf sensor technology for precision irrigation control in 2007 a phase i research grant from the national science foundation in 2007 showed that the leaf sensor technology has the potential to save between 30 and 50 of irrigation water by reducing irrigation from once every 24 hours to about every 2 to 2 5 days by sensing impending water deficit stress leaf sensor technology developed by agrihouse indicates water deficit stress by measuring the turgor pressure of a leaf which decreases dramatically at the onset of leaf dehydration early detection of impending water deficit stress in plants can be used as an input parameter for precision irrigation control by

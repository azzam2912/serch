they were introduced by who named them after kurt hensel azumaya originally allowed henselian rings to be non commutative but most authors now restrict them to be commutative some standard references for hensel rings are and in this article rings will be assumed to be commutative though there is also a theory of non commutative henselian rings a local ring r with maximal ideal m is called henselian if hensel s lemma holds this means that if p is a monic polynomial in r x then any factorization of its image p in r m x into a product of coprime monic polynomials can be lifted to a factorization in r x a local ring is henselian if and only if every finite ring extension is a product of local rings a henselian local ring is called strictly henselian if its residue field is separably closed a field with valuation is said to be henselian if its valuation ring is henselian a ring is called henselian if it is a direct product of a finite number of henselian local rings henselian rings are the local rings of points with respect to the nisnevich topology so the spectra of these rings

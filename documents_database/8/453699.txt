called respectively right and left residuals these operations coincide when the monoid is commutative the general concept was introduced by morgan ward and robert p dilworth in 1939 examples some of which existed prior to the general concept include boolean algebras heyting algebras residuated boolean algebras relation algebras and mv algebras residuated semilattices omit the meet operation for example kleene algebras and action algebras in mathematics a residuated lattice is an algebraic structure l l i such that in iii the greatest y being a function of z and x is denoted x z and called the right residual of z by x think of it as what remains of z on the right after dividing z on the left by x dually the greatest x is denoted z y and called the left residual of z by y an equivalent more formal statement of iii that uses these operations to name these greatest values is iii for all x y z in l y x z x y z x z y as suggested by the notation the residuals are a form of quotient more precisely for a given x in l the unary operations x and x are

published in 2001 by chatto and windus it is set at the beginning of the twentieth century in rural england and concerns fox hunting george lupus is master of quarr hunt and his four children also love the thrill of the hunt but their passion is not shared by dorothy wife and mother on george s untimely death dorothy attempts to disband the hunt but she does not reckon on the determination of her children to maintain the tradition reviews differ widely spectator opined a subtle brilliant and paradoxical novel no one has ever written better than she does here about the english upper class cult of fox hunting pre 1914 and the telegraph was similarly effusive it is a beautiful resonant book about a hidden world the charm of this strange haunting novel lies in her extraordinary ability not merely to describe but to convey the very texture of whatever she is writing about she inhabits not just human skins but those of horse hound and fox at times she even contrives to become the landscape across which all these creatures enact their drama of pursuit and concludes it is a piece of virtuosity that should be required reading

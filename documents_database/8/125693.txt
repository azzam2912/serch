state functions do not depend on the path by which the system arrived at its present state a state function describes the equilibrium state of a system and thus also describes the type of system for example a state function could describe an atom or molecule in a gaseous liquid or solid form a heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture and the amounts of energy required to create such systems or change them into a different equilibrium state for example internal energy enthalpy and entropy are state quantities because they describe quantitatively an equilibrium state of a thermodynamic system irrespective of how the system arrived in that state in contrast mechanical work and heat are process quantities or path functions because their values depend on the specific transition or path between two equilibrium states heat in certain discrete amounts can describe a certain state function such as enthalpy but in general does not truly describe the system unless it is defined as the state function of a certain system and thus enthalpy is described by an amount of heat this can also apply to entropy when heat is compared to temperature the mode of description breaks down for quantities exhibiting hysteresis effects

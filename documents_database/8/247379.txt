the jevons paradox is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics however governments and environmentalists generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising in 1865 the english economist william stanley jevons observed that technological improvements that increased the efficiency of coal use led to the increased consumption of coal in a wide range of industries he argued that contrary to common intuition technological progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption the issue has been re examined by modern economists studying consumption rebound effects from improved energy efficiency in addition to reducing the amount needed for a given use improved efficiency also lowers the relative cost of using a resource which increases the quantity demanded this counteracts to some extent the reduction in use from improved efficiency additionally improved efficiency increases real incomes and accelerates economic growth further increasing the demand for resources the jevons paradox occurs when the effect from increased demand predominates and improved efficiency increases the speed at which resources are used considerable debate exists about the size of the rebound in energy efficiency and the relevance of the jevons paradox to energy conservation some

formula 1 r the valuation ring and p the maximal ideal for formula 2 we denote by formula 3 the valuation of z formula 4 and formula 5 for a uniformizing parameter of r furthermore let formula 6 be a schwartz bruhat function i e a locally constant function with compact support and let formula 7 be a character of formula 8 in this situation one associates to a non constant polynomial formula 9 the igusa zeta function where formula 11 and dx is haar measure so normalized that formula 12 has measure 1 showed that formula 13 is a rational function in formula 14 the proof uses heisuke hironaka s theorem about the resolution of singularities later an entirely different proof was given by jan denef using p adic cell decomposition little is known however about explicit formulas there are some results about igusa zeta functions of fermat varieties henceforth we take formula 16 to be the characteristic function of formula 12 and formula 7 to be the trivial character let formula 19 denote the number of solutions of the congruence then the igusa zeta function is closely related to the poincar series by

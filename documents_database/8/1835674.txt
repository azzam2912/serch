the no load is represented by the open circuit which is represented on the right side of the figure as the hole or incomplete part of the circuit the secondary of the transformer is left open circuited a wattmeter is connected to the primary an ammeter is connected in series with the primary winding a voltmeter is optional since the applied voltage is the same as the voltmeter reading rated voltage is applied at primary if the applied voltage is normal voltage then normal flux will be set up since iron loss is a function of applied voltage normal iron loss will occur hence the iron loss is maximum at rated voltage this maximum iron loss is measured using the wattmeter since the impedance of the series winding of the transformer is very small compared to that of the excitation branch all of the input voltage is dropped across the excitation branch thus the wattmeter measures only the iron loss this test only measures the combined iron losses consisting of the hysteresis loss and the eddy current loss although the hysteresis loss is less than the eddy current loss it is not negligible the two losses can be separated by

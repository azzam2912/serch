the lake may be connected or disjoint and it may also have zero area orbits that are initialized inside the lake are either eventually captured by zero captured by another point inside the unit circle or may oscillate through a set of values indefinitely without ever converging to a fixed point these points are described as being inside the lake inside points are often detected for the purposes of using a different coloring method in fractal rendering software by this definition the points of the mandelbrot set form a fractal lake which is why the mandelbrot set is also sometimes known as the mandelbrot lake or the lake of the mandelbrot fractal many complex valued functions with an attractor at the origin define a fractal when this aspect of their orbits behavior is categorized some of the orbits are attracted to the origin some are periodic some are attracted to other attractors including possibly an attractor at infinity for a given function there is a julia fractal for each point on the complex plane the julia sets that correspond to points inside the mandelbrot set are connected those that correspond to points outside of the mandelbrot set are disconnected

the arm11 core family consists of arm1136j f s arm1156t2 f s arm1176jz f s and arm11mpcore since arm11 cores were released from 2002 to 2005 they are no longer recommended for new ic designs instead arm cortex a and arm cortex r cores are preferred the arm11 microarchitecture announced 29 april 2002 introduced the armv6 architectural additions which had been announced in october 2001 these include simd media instructions multiprocessor support and a new cache architecture the implementation included a significantly improved instruction processing pipeline compared to previous arm9 or arm10 families and is used in smartphones from apple nokia and others the initial arm11 core arm1136 was released to licensees in october 2002 the arm11 family are currently the only armv6 architecture cores there are however armv6 m cores cortex m0 and cortex m1 addressing microcontroller applications arm11 cores target more demanding applications in terms of instruction set arm11 builds on the preceding arm9 generation it incorporates all arm926ej s features and adds the armv6 instructions for media support simd and accelerating irq response microarchitecture improvements in arm11 cores include jtag debug support for halting stepping breakpoints and watchpoints was simplified the embeddedice module was replaced with an

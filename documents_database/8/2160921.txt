although the m48 and m77 snps have long been considered to be phylogenetically equivalent marking the same clade of the human y dna phylogeny the c3c2 b90 clade has been found to be positive for the m48 mutation but negative for the m77 mutation c b91 is a subclade of c b90 that has been found in koryaks it subsumes the c b92 and c b94 subclades karmin et al 2015 have found y dna belonging to c b92 in two koryaks who they have estimated to share a most recent common ancestor 594 95 ci 285 939 years before present the two koryaks in c b92 have been estimated to share a most recent common ancestor with a koryak who belongs to the c b94 subclade 3 812 95 ci 3 005 4 654 years before present c b93 is a subclade of c b90 that has been found in 7 7 4 52 of a sample of ulchi and in one evenk it has been estimated to share a most recent common ancestor with c b91 of the koryaks 4 992 95 ci 4 188 5 732 years before present karmin et al 2015 have estimated the coalescence

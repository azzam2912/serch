movius in 1948 to demonstrate a technological difference between the early prehistoric tool technologies of the east and west of the old world movius had noticed that assemblages of palaeolithic stone tools from sites east of northern india never contained handaxes and tended to be characterized by less formal implements known as chopping tools the most noticeable difference were the lack of acheulean mode 2 tools in east asia these were sometimes as extensively worked as the acheulean tools from further west but could not be described as true handaxes movius then drew a line on a map of india to show where the difference occurred dividing the tools of africa europe and western and southern asia from those of eastern and south eastern asia movius also proposed that the lack of middle paleolithic tools in east asia could be due to a techno cultural connection between acheulean and levallois traditions in tool manufacture similarly research in 2006 showed that there are significantly fewer handaxe sites in east asia than in east africa and india fossil evidence also suggests a difference in the evolutionary development of the people who made the two different tool types across the movius line and

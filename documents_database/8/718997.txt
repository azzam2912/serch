it is a nucleoside analogue which exhibits low toxicity and good selectivity because penciclovir is absorbed poorly when given orally by mouth it is more often used as a topical treatment it is the active ingredient in the cold sore medications denavir ndc 0135 0315 52 vectavir and fenivir famciclovir is a prodrug of penciclovir with improved oral bioavailability penciclovir was approved for medical use in 1996 in herpes labialis the duration of healing pain and detectable virus is reduced by up to one day compared with the total duration of 2 3 weeks of disease presentation penciclovir is inactive in its initial form within a virally infected cell a viral thymidine kinase adds a phosphate group to the penciclovir molecule this is the rate limiting step in the activation of penciclovir cellular human kinases then add two more phosphate groups producing the active penciclovir triphosphate this activated form inhibits viral dna polymerase thus impairing the ability of the virus to replicate within the cell the selectivity of penciclovir may be attributed to two factors first cellular thymidine kinases phosphorylate the parent form significantly less rapidly than does the viral thymidine kinase so the active triphosphate is present at much

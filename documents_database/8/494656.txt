there are one triangle two squares and one hexagon on each vertex it has schl fli symbol of rr 3 6 john conway calls it a rhombihexadeltille it can be considered a cantellated by norman johnson s terminology or an expanded hexagonal tiling by alicia boole stott s operational language there are 3 regular and 8 semiregular tilings in the plane there is only one uniform coloring in a rhombitrihexagonal tiling naming the colors by indices around a vertex 3 4 6 4 1232 with edge colorings there is a half symmetry form 3 3 orbifold notation the hexagons can be considered as truncated triangles t 3 with two types of edges it has coxeter diagram schl fli symbol s 3 6 the bicolored square can be distorted into isosceles trapezoids in the limit where the rectangles degenerate into edges a triangular tiling results constructed as a snub triangular tiling there is one related 2 uniform tiling having hexagons dissected into 6 triangles the rhombitrihexagonal tiling is related to the truncated trihexagonal tiling by replacing some of the hexagons and surrounding squares and triangles with dodecagons the tiling can be replaced by circular edges centered on the hexagons as a

the cohesive forces that bind the molecules together are van der waals forces dipole dipole interactions quadrupole interactions interactions hydrogen bonding halogen bonding london dispersion forces and in some molecular solids coulombic interactions van der waals dipole interactions quadrupole interactions interactions hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding 2 127 kj mol are typically much weaker than the forces holding together other solids metallic metallic bonding 400 500 kj mol ionic coulomb s forces 700 900 kj mol and network solids covalent bonds 150 900 kj mol intermolecular interactions typically do not involve delocalized electrons unlike metallic and certain covalent bonds exceptions are charge transfer complexes such as the tetrathiafulvane tetracyanoquinodimethane ttf tcnq a radical ion salt these differences in the strength of force i e covalent vs van der waals and electronic characteristics i e delocalized electrons from other types of solids give rise to the unique mechanical electronic and thermal properties of molecular solids for instance molecular solids such as coronene have low conductivity 1 x 10 to 1 x 10 cm making them poor electrical conductors as mentioned there are exceptions such as ttf tcnq 5 x 10 cm but it still substantially less than the conductivity of copper

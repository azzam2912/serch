at high levels of disturbance due to frequent forest fires or human impacts like deforestation all species are at risk of going extinct according to idh theory at intermediate levels of disturbance diversity is thus maximized because species that thrive at both early and late successional stages can coexist idh is a nonequilibrium model used to describe the relationship between disturbance and species diversity idh is based on the following premises first ecological disturbances have major effects on species richness within the area of disturbance second interspecific competition results from one species driving a competitor to extinction and becoming dominant in the ecosystem third moderate ecological scale disturbances prevent interspecific competition disturbances act to disrupt stable ecosystems and clear species habitat as a result disturbances lead to species movement into the newly cleared area once an area is cleared there is a progressive increase in species richness and competition takes place again once disturbance is removed species richness decreases as competitive exclusion increases gause s law also known as competitive exclusion explains how species that compete for the same resources cannot coexist in the same niche each species handles change from a disturbance differently therefore idh can be described as

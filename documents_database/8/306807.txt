like elias gamma coding and elias delta coding it works by prefixing the integer with a representation of its order of magnitude in a universal code unlike those other two codes however elias omega recursively encodes that prefix thus they are sometimes known as recursive elias codes omega coding is used in applications where the largest encoded value is not known ahead of time or to compress data in which small values are much more frequent than large values to code a number n to decode an elias omega coded integer omega codes can be thought of as a number of groups a group is either a single 0 bit which terminates the code or two or more bits beginning with 1 which is followed by another group the first few codes are shown below included is the so called implied distribution describing the distribution of values for which this coding yields a minimum size code see relationship of universal codes to practical compression for details the encoding for 1 googol 10 is 11 1000 101001100 15 bits of length header followed by the 333 bit binary representation of 1 googol which is 10010 01001001 10101101 00100101 10010100 11000011 01111100

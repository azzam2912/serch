it is different from mostow rigidity and weaker but holds more frequently than superrigidity the first such theorem was proven by atle selberg for co compact discrete subgroups of the unimodular groups formula 1 shortly afterwards a similar statement was proven by eugenio calabi in the setting of fundamental groups of compact hyperbolic manifolds finally the theorem was extended to all co compact subgroups of semisimple lie groups by andr weil the extension to non cocompact lattices was made later by howard garland and madabusi santanam raghunathan the result is now sometimes referred to as calabi weil or just weil rigidity let formula 2 be a group generated by a finite number of elements formula 3 and formula 4 a lie group then the map formula 5 defined by formula 6 is injective and this endows formula 7 with a topology induced by that of formula 8 if formula 2 is a subgroup of formula 4 then a deformation of formula 2 is any element in formula 7 two representations formula 13 are said to be conjugated if there exists a formula 14 such that formula 15 for all formula 16 see also character variety the simplest statement is when

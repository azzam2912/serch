in the region between 75 w and 55 w it is subject to meanders and is frequently accompanied by eddies the northern edge of the current is marked by a sharp fall in temperature this is also the case at much greater depths so that the warm current is pressed up against a wall of cold water called the north wall monthly charts of the path of the north wall of the gulf stream have been available from surface aircraft and satellite observations since 1966 and these have been used in several studies of the path s variability in 1980 taylor and stephens 2 constructed a measure of the latitude of the current the gulf stream south wall gsnw index by extracting and analysing time series of the latitude at six longitudes between 79 w and 65 w a series of data that continues to the present day there have been other subsequent studies in 1994 drinkwater et al examined the latitude of the north wall from the 1970s to 1992 at each degree of longitude from 50 to 75 w and miller analysed the onshore offshore position of the north wall at 10 cross isobath transects equally spaced between

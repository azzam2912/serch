for we should hardly be successful in looking for the subsequent enlargement of the group for a theory based on a narrower group the poincar group the transformation group of special relativity being orthogonal the inverse of a transformation equals its transpose introducing discrete reflections this in turn violates einstein s dictum for a group no less general than that of the continuous transformations of the four coordinates specifically any pair of euler angles and are not independent nor are any pair of boosts v c and v c available parameters are thus reduced from the 16 needed to express all transformations in a curved spacetime per the general principle of relativity x x to the 10 of the poincar group mendel sachs in the 1960s found the transformation group that einstein had sought the einstein group the einstein group can be obtained by factorizing the squared spacetime invariant interval into a quaternion valued form and its conjugate ds ds where and q x is a four vector of hermitian quaternions note that the einstein group approaches but never reaches the poincare group as the flat spacetime special relativity limit is approached

this compound has frequently been used as a biomarker for the presence of marine algal matter in the environment and is one of the ingredients for e number e499 brassicasterol has a low water solubility and as a consequence a high octanol water partition coefficient this means that in most environmental systems brassicasterol will be associated with the solid phase in anaerobic sediments and soils brassicasterol is stable for many hundreds of years enabling it to be used as an indicator of past algal production see below since the molecule has a hydroxyl oh group it is frequently bound to other lipids including glycerols most analytical methods therefore utilise a strong alkali koh or naoh to saponify the ester linkages typical extraction solvents include 6 koh in methanol the free sterols are then separated from the polar lipids by partitioning into a less polar solvent e g hexane prior to analysis the hydroxyl group is frequently derivatised with bstfa bis trimethyl silyl trifluoroacetamide to replace the hydrogen with the less exchangeable trimethylsilyl tms group instrumental analysis is frequently conducted on gas chromatograph gc with either a flame ionisation detector fid or mass spectrometer ms the mass spectrum for the tms

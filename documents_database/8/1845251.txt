as two expanses of sea ice converge toward another one of them slides smoothly on top of the other it is overthrusted along a given distance resulting in a local increase in ice thickness the term finger rafting refers to the systematic alternation of interlocking overthrusts and underthrusts involved in this process such a pattern derives its name from its resemblance to the interlocking of fingers rafting also called telescoped ice is most noticeable when it involves new and young ice but also occurs in ice of all thicknesses the process of finger rafting as such is commonly observed inside a lead once a thin layer of ice at the nilas stage has formed although this ice is typically very weak it is unable to support its own weight outside the water it contains a lot of brine and is also relatively warm since being that thin its temperature is near that of the water rafting is accompanied with rapid draining of the brine inside the overlying ice sheet this brine acts as a lubricant significantly reducing the friction between the two sheets during overthrusting such a mechanism and the fact that the upper surface of nilas is already slippery

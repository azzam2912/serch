this mathematical game was used as an introductory game in the book winning ways for your mathematical plays known for its simplicity and the elegance of its rules toads and frogs is useful to illustrate the main concepts of combinatorial game theory in particular it is not difficult to evaluate simple games involving only one toad and one frog by constructing the game tree of the starting position however the general case of evaluating an arbitrary position is known to be np hard there are some open conjectures on the value of some remarkable positions toads and frogs is played on a 1 n strip of squares at any time each square is either empty or occupied by a single toad or frog although the game may start at any configuration it is customary to begin with toads occupying consecutive squares on the leftmost end and frogs occupying consecutive squares on the rightmost end of the strip on his turn left may move a toad one square to the right if it is empty alternatively if a frog occupies the space immediately to a toad s right and the space immediately right of the frog is empty left may move

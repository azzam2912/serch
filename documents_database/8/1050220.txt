the measurement is usually made by external ultrasound and occasionally by internal invasive ultrasound catheters measurements of the total wall thickness of blood vessels can also be done using other imaging modalities imt is used to detect the presence of atherosclerosis in humans and more contentiously to track the regression arrest or progression of atherosclerosis ultrasound imt measurements were first proposed and validated in vitro by paolo pignoli in 1984 and further details were subsequently published in a highly cited article the use of imt as a non invasive tool to track changes in arterial walls has increased substantially since the mid 1990s although imt is predictive of future cardiovascular events the usefulness of measuring change in imt over time is disputed as meta analyses have not found that change in imt is predictive of cardiovascular events as such the use of change in imt as a surrogate endpoint measure of drug efficacy in clinical trials or in clinical management of cardiovascular disease is debated imt is occasionally used in clinical practice but its role is not clear after systematically reviewing the evidence base the united states preventive services task force found no support for its routine use in stratification

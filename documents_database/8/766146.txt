embolomeres first evolved from reptile like amphibians in the early carboniferous mississippian they were strongly specialized semiaquatic predators with long bodies for eel like undulating swimming embolomeres are characterized by their vertebral centra which are formed by two cylindrical segments the pleurocentrum at the rear and intercentrum at the front these segments are equal in size most other tetrapods have pleurocentra and intercentra which are drastically different in size and shape embolomeres were among the earliest large carnivorous tetrapods with members such as the crocodilian like proterogyrinus appearing in the mid carboniferous period however they declined in diversity during the permian period although the most common embolomere known archeria did live during this time embolomeres likely went extinct shortly after the time of archeria but their possible descendant taxa the chroniosuchians survived the permian triassic extinction event that wiped out around 90 of all life on earth the order embolomeri was first named by edward drinker cope in 1884 during his revision of batrachian amphibian evolution embolomeri was differentiated from several other newly named amphibian orders such as rachitomi by the presence of intercentra and pleurocentra of the same size and shape that being large cylinders at the time embolomere

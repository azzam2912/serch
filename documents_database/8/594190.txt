it is related to but simpler than the schlieren and schlieren photography methods that perform a similar function shadowgraph is a type of flow visualisation in principle we cannot directly see a difference in temperature a different gas or a shock wave in the transparent air however all these disturbances refract light rays so they can cast shadows the plume of hot air rising from a fire for example can be seen by way of its shadow cast upon a nearby surface by the uniform sunlight some aquatic predators detect their transparent prey by way of their shadows cast upon the ocean floor it was robert hooke who first scientifically demonstrated the sunlight shadowgraph and jean paul marat who first used it to study fire a modern account of shadowgraphy is given by gary s settles applications of shadowgraphy in science and technology are very broad it is used in aeronautical engineering to see the flow about high speed aircraft and missiles as well as in combustion research ballistics explosions and in the testing of glass ideal for identification of flow patterns according to f j weinberg the result of applying the shadowgraph technique should be known as a shadowgram

it is controlled by all russian scientific research institute for physical engineering and radiotechnical metrology and operated by russian television and radio broadcasting network transmitting frequencies are 4 996 mhz with 5 kw and on 9 996 and 14 996 mhz with 8 kw the frequencies are very close to those of wwv and wwvh because of this rwm is very difficult to receive in north america with simple receivers of low selectivity due to interference from these said stations the mode of transmission is n0n and a1a cw between 0 and 8 minutes past the hour rwm transmits a straight unmodulated carrier wave at 9 minutes past rwm identifies itself in morse code between 10 and 20 minutes past the hour rwm transmits a pulse of carrier every second with the difference between ut1 and utc in units of one fiftieth of a second encoded onto the once per second pulses between 20 and 30 minutes past the hour rwm transmits 10 carrier pulses each second this transmission cycle is repeated every half hour rwm does not transmit the time of day only standard time intervals the 1 hz pulses begin on the second and are doubled a second

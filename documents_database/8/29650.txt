it includes the renderman shading language as pixar s technical specification for a standard communications protocol or interface between modeling programs and rendering programs capable of producing photorealistic quality images rispec is a similar concept to postscript but for describing 3d scenes rather than 2d page layouts thus modelling programs which understand the renderman interface protocol can send data to rendering software which implements the renderman interface without caring what rendering algorithms are utilized by the latter the interface was first published in 1988 version 3 0 and was designed to be sufficiently future proof to encompass advances in technology for a significant number of years the current revision is 3 2 1 released in november 2005 what set the rispec apart from other standards of the time was that it allowed using high level geometric primitives like quadrics or bicubic patches to specify geometric primitives implicitly rather than relying on a modeling application to generate polygons approximating these shapes explicitly beforehand another novelty introduced by the rispec at the time was the specification of a shading language the renderman shading language allows material definitions of surfaces to be described not only by adjusting a small set of parameters but

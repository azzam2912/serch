the riot shotgun is used by military personnel for guard duty and was at one time used for riot control and is commonly used as a door breaching and patrol weapon by law enforcement personnel as well as a home defense weapon by civilians guns of this type are often labeled as breaching shotguns tactical shotguns or special purpose shotguns to denote the larger scope of their use however these are largely marketing terms the primary characteristic of a riot shotgun is a short barrel generally 14 to 20 long 18 is the shortest length available in the u s that is not subject to additional federal batfe regulation though such restrictions are rarely a problem for police departments and thus shorter barrel shotguns are not uncommon among police which makes the shotgun more compact and easier to handle easier to stow inside a police vehicle and more suitable for quick aiming at close stationary targets generally they have an open cylinder bore choke to permit the shot to spread quickly and to allow use with other types of projectiles and they may be equipped with bead rifle or ghost ring sights riot guns are most often pump action due

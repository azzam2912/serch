aging is associated with many changes in the central nervous system such as mild atrophy of the cortex that is considered non pathological aging is also associated with many neurological and neurodegenerative disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis dementia mild cognitive impairment parkinson s disease and creutzfeldt jakob disease neurogenesis occurs very little in adults only occurring in the hypothalamus and striatum to a small extent in a process called adult neurogenesis the volume of the brain actually decrease roughly 5 per decade after forty it is currently unclear why brain volume decreases with age however a few causes may include cell death decreased cell volume and changes in synaptic structure the changes in brain volume is heterogenous across regions with prefrontal cortex receiving the most significant reduction in volume followed in order by the striatum the temporal lobe cerebellar vermis cerebellar hemispheres and the hippocampus however one review found that the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex remained relatively free of atrophy which is consistent with the finding of emotional stability occurring with non pathological aging enlargement of the ventricles sulci and fissures are also common in non pathological aging changes may also be associated with neuroplasticity synaptic functionality and

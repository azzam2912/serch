it is alternately defined by or the first version avoids the singularity which occurs when the gradient vanishes while the second version is homogeneous of order zero in the gradient verbally the second version is the second derivative in the direction of the gradient in the case of the infinity laplace equation formula 5 the two definitions are equivalent while the equation involves second derivatives usually generalized solutions are not twice differentiable as evidenced by the well known aronsson solution formula 6 for this reason the correct notion of solutions is that given by the viscosity solutions viscosity solutions to the equation formula 5 are also known as infinity harmonic functions this terminology arises from the fact that the infinity laplace operator first arose in the study of absolute minimizers for formula 8 and it can be viewed in a certain sense as the limit of the p laplacian as formula 9 more recently viscosity solutions to the infinity laplace equation have been identified with the payoff functions from randomized tug of war games the game theory point of view has significantly improved the understanding of the partial differential equation itself a defining property of the usual formula 10 harmonic

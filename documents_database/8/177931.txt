this slip angle results in a force the cornering force which is in the plane of the contact patch and perpendicular to the intersection of the contact patch and the midplane of the wheel this cornering force increases approximately linearly for the first few degrees of slip angle then increases non linearly to a maximum before beginning to decrease the slip angle formula 4 is defined as formula 5 a non zero slip angle arises because of deformation in the tire carcass and tread as the tire rotates the friction between the contact patch and the road results in individual tread elements finite sections of tread remaining stationary with respect to the road if a side slip velocity u is introduced the contact patch will be deformed when a tread element enters the contact patch the friction between the road and the tire causes the tread element to remain stationary yet the tire continues to move laterally thus the tread element will be deflected sideways while it is equally valid to frame this as the tire wheel being deflected away from the stationary tread element convention is for the co ordinate system to be fixed around the wheel mid plane

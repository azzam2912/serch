the game board is the set of all edges of a complete graph on n vertices the winning sets are all the cliques on k vertices there are several variants of this game the clique game in its strong positional variant was first presented by paul erd s and john selfridge who attributed it to simmons they called it the ramsey game since it is closely related to ramsey s theorem see below ramsey s theorem implies that whenever we color a graph with 2 colors there is at least one monochromatic clique moreover for every integer k there exists an integer r k k such that in every graph with formula 1 vertices any 2 coloring contains a monochromatic clique of size at least k this means that if formula 1 the clique game can never end in a draw a strategy stealing argument implies that the first player can always force at least a draw therefore if formula 1 maker wins by substituting known bounds for the ramsey number we get that maker wins whenever formula 4 on the other hand the erdos selfridge theorem implies that breaker wins whenever formula 5 beck improved these bounds as follows

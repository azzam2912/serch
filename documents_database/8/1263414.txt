the design was nominally developed by north american aviation naa although it was a purely nasa internal design unlike the eventual space shuttle design that emerged the dc 3 was a fully reusable launch vehicle two stage to orbit design with a smaller payload capacity of about 12 000 lbs and limited maneuverability its inherent strengths were good low speed handling during landing and a low risk development that was relatively immune to changes in weight and balance work on the dc 3 program ended when the us air force joined the shuttle program and demanded a much greater cross range maneuverability than the dc 3 could deliver they also expressed serious concerns about its stability during re entry naa eventually won the shuttle orbiter contract based on a very different design from another team at msc in the mid 1960s the us air force conducted a series of classified studies on next generation space transportation systems among their many goals the new launchers were intended to support a continued manned military presence in space and so needed to dramatically lower the cost of launches and increase launch rates selecting from a series of proposals the air force concluded that

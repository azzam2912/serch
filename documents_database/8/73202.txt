this constant expresses an ambiguity inherent in the construction of antiderivatives if a function formula 1 is defined on an interval and formula 2 is an antiderivative of formula 1 then the set of all antiderivatives of formula 1 is given by the functions formula 5 where c is an arbitrary constant meaning that any value for c makes formula 5 a valid antiderivative the constant of integration is sometimes omitted in lists of integrals for simplicity the derivative of any constant function is zero once one has found one antiderivative formula 2 for a function formula 1 adding or subtracting any constant c will give us another antiderivative because formula 9 the constant is a way of expressing that every function with at least one antiderivative has an infinite number of them let formula 10 and formula 11 be two everywhere differentiable functions suppose that formula 12 for every real number x then there exists a real number c such that formula 13 for every real number x to prove this notice that formula 14 so f can be replaced by f g and g by the constant function 0 making the goal to prove that an everywhere differentiable

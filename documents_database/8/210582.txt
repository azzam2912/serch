the basic idea can be summarized by the concept of life and death is a consequence of two basic go rules because of these rules some groups can never be captured alive while others can t avoid capture dead see the diagram on the right and suppose white tries to capture the black groups the black group surrounding c and d can never be captured and is called alive the group can live because it has two separated inner liberties where white can t play a group such as b that cannot become alive is called dead groups that are neither alive nor dead are called unsettled liberties inside a group are called eyes in the previous example a b c and d are eyes an eye may be a single empty intersection or more of them in the diagram on the left the intersections marked e form a single eye and f forms another eye the group has two separated eye spaces even though white can make a move in these eyes black could eventually capture the white stones and each eye would thereby be reduced to a single intersection an inner liberty where the opponent can still play

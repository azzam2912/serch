they have a large surface area relative to their size and high catalytic activity the exact physical and chemical properties of zinc oxide nanoparticles depend on the different ways they are synthesized some possible ways to produce zno nano particles are laser ablation hydrothermal methods electrochemical depositions sol gel method chemical vapor deposition thermal decomposition combustion methods ultrasound microwave assisted combustion method two step mechanochemical thermal synthesis anodization co precipitation electrophoretic deposition and precipitation processes using solution concentration ph and washing medium zno is a wide bandgap semiconductor with an energy gap of 3 37 ev at room temperature zno nanoparticles are believed to be one of the three most produced nanomaterials along with titanium dioxide nanoparticles and silicon dioxide nanoparticles the most common use of zno nanoparticles is in sunscreen they are used because they absorb ultraviolet light but are small enough to be transparent to visible light they are also being investigated to kill harmful microorganisms in packaging and in uv protective materials such as textiles many companies do not label products that contain nanoparticles making it difficult to make statements about production and pervasiveness in consumer products since zno nanoparticles are a relatively new material there is

the name is based on the derivation which uses a first order taylor series and the first and second moments of the input variables consider the objective function formula 1 where the input vector formula 2 is a realization of the random vector formula 3 with probability density function formula 4 as formula 3 is randomly distributed also formula 6 is randomly distributed following the fosm method the mean value of formula 6 is approximated by the variance of formula 6 is approximated by where formula 11 is the length dimension of formula 2 and formula 13 is the partial derivative of formula 6 at the mean vector formula 15 with respect to the i th entry of formula 2 more accurate second order second moment approximations are also available the objective function is approximated by a taylor series at the mean vector formula 15 the mean value of formula 6 is given by the integral inserting the first order taylor series yields the variance of formula 6 is given by the integral according to the computational formula for the variance this can be written as inserting the taylor series yields the following abbreviations are introduced in the following the

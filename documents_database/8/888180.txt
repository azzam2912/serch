the result is a smooth spectral continuum see figure 1 for a typical example there is no consensus on how much broadening constitutes a supercontinuum however researchers have published work claiming as little as 60 nm of broadening as a supercontinuum there is also no agreement on the spectral flatness required to define the bandwidth of the source with authors using anything from 5 db to 40 db or more in addition the term supercontinuum itself did not gain widespread acceptance until this century with many authors using alternative phrases to describe their continua during the 1970s 1980s and 1990s during the last decade the development of supercontinua sources has emerged as a research field this is largely due to new technological developments which have allowed more controlled and accessible generation of supercontinua this renewed research has created a variety of new light sources which are finding applications in a diverse range of fields including optical coherence tomography frequency metrology fluorescence lifetime imaging optical communications gas sensing and many others the application of these sources has created a feedback loop whereby the scientists utilising the supercontinua are demanding better customisable continua to suit their particular applications this has driven researchers

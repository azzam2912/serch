typically they are effusive eruptions with basaltic magmas of low viscosity low content of gases and high temperature at the vent very small amounts of volcanic ash are produced this type of eruption occurs most often at hotspot volcanoes such as k lauea on hawaii s big island and in iceland though it can occur near subduction zones e g medicine lake volcano in california united states and rift zones another example of hawaiian eruptions occurred on the island of surtsey in iceland from 1964 to 1967 when molten lava flowed from the crater to the sea hawaiian eruptions may occur along fissure vents such as during the eruption of mauna loa in 1950 or at a central vent such as during the 1959 eruption in k lauea iki crater which created a lava fountain 580 meters 1 900 ft high and formed a 38 meter cone named puu puai in fissure type eruptions lava spurts from a fissure on the volcano s rift zone and feeds lava streams that flow downslope in central vent eruptions a fountain of lava can spurt to a height of 300 meters or more heights of 1600 meters were reported for the 1986 eruption

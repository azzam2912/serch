generally such a chip combines the functions of many separate older simpler chips into one this is done to reduce required circuit board space power consumption and most importantly production costs for complete systems the first msx engine chip the t7775 operated next to a standard zilog z80 clone chip the main cpu of the system but most later versions of the engine also included the z80 clone cpu in a same single chip package the s 1990 is a special case as it s not really an msx engine but a chip that was used as glue logic between the msx engine and an external r800 cpu the t9769 is used in msx 2 computers while in msx 1 computers mostly the t7775 and t7937 are used you can also find the s 1985 and s 3527 in these systems after the msx 2 generation from msx2 onwards toshiba took over the complete production of msx engine chips the last generation of msx the turbo r used the nec s 1990 turbor bus controller together with a r800 cpu msx engine chips from yamaha were mostly used in msx computers from sony and philips while the toshiba chips were

mst sends a magnetic signal from the device to the payment terminal s card reader it emulates swiping a physical card without having to upgrade the terminal s software or hardware to support more advanced technology such as contactless payments hence in contrast to payments using near field communication mst technology is compatible with nearly all payment terminals that possess a magnetic stripe reader mst is designed to transmit from within of the magnetic card reader outside of physical transmission there are no changes to the magnetic stripe card system i e reception processing information content and cryptographic protocols however the information being transmitted being dynamic may allow tokenization mst was originally developed by looppay which was acquired by samsung in 2015 and incorporated into its samsung pay service in 2017 lg launched its competing lg pay service which uses a similar technology called wireless magnetic communication wmc because both mst and wmc mimic unencrypted magnetic stripe technology in order to be compatible with older credit card terminals the wireless transmissions are not encrypted and therefore might not be considered secure

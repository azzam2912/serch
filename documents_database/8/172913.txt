system identification also includes the optimal design of experiments for efficiently generating informative data for fitting such models as well as model reduction a dynamical mathematical model in this context is a mathematical description of the dynamic behavior of a system or process in either the time or frequency domain examples include one of the many possible applications of system identification is in control systems for example it is the basis for modern data driven control systems in which concepts of system identification are integrated into the controller design and lay the foundations for formal controller optimality proofs system identification techniques can utilize both input and output data e g eigensystem realization algorithm or can include only the output data e g frequency domain decomposition typically an input output technique would be more accurate but the input data is not always available the quality of system identification depends on the quality of the inputs which are under the control of the systems engineer therefore systems engineers have long used the principles of the design of experiments in recent decades engineers have increasingly used the theory of optimal experimental design to specify inputs that yield maximally precise estimators one could build

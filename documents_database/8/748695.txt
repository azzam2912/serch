let be a model indicator and formula 2 the parameter space whose number of dimensions formula 3 depends on the model formula 4 the model indication need not be the stationary distribution is the joint posterior distribution of formula 5 that takes the values formula 6 the proposal formula 7 can be constructed with a mapping formula 8 of formula 9 and formula 10 where formula 10 is drawn from a random component formula 12 with density formula 13 on formula 14 the move to state formula 15 can thus be formulated as the function must be one to one and differentiable and have a non zero support so that there exists an inverse function that is differentiable therefore the formula 20 and formula 21 must be of equal dimension which is the case if the dimension criterion is met where formula 23 is the dimension of formula 10 this is known as dimension matching if formula 25 then the dimensional matching condition can be reduced to with the acceptance probability will be given by where formula 29 denotes the absolute value and formula 30 is the joint posterior probability where formula 32 is the normalising constant there is an

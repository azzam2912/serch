a loose association of supervillains is active in new york annoying the kingpin of crime and threatening the heroes for hire agency s client mh4 lone wolves was written by bruce nesmith and was published by tsr inc in 1984 as a 16 page book a large color map and an outer folder marcus l rowland reviewed lone wolves for white dwarf 69 rating it 6 10 overall he commented that lone wolves was apparently designed for just the opposite effect compared to the secret wars adventure it isn t a mega adventure and the heroes won t save the world or the universe but every episode crawls with chances to make contacts learn more about the underworld and perform feats of deduction and detection rowland concludes that the exact motives for the odd series of crimes are fairly enigmatic and even after re reading the adventure twice a little unconvincing however the slightly chaotic overall effect does reflect the fairly peculiar attitudes of supervillains with a slightly tighter plot this would be an extremely enjoyable scenario as it is it can still be the basis for an excellent adventure but the referee should consider altering a few details

p38 mapks are also known as stress activated serine threonine specific kinases sapks in addition to mapk14 for p38 mapk the p38 mapk family has three additional members including mapk11 mapk12 and mapk13 which encodes p38 mapk p38 mapk and p38 mapk isoforms respectively p38 mapk was originally identified as a tyrosine phosphorylated protein detected in activated immune cell macrophages with an essential role in inflammatory cytokine induction such as tumor necrotic factor tnf however p38 mapk mediated kinase activity has been implicated in many tissues beyond immune systems p38 mapk is mainly activated through mapk kinase kinase cascades and exerts its biological function via downstream substrate phosphorylation p38 mapk is implicated in diverse cellular function from gene expression to programmed cell death through a network of signaling molecules and transcription factors pharmacological and genetic inhibition of p38 mapk not only revealed its biological significance in physiological function but also the potential of targeting p38 mapk in human diseases such as immune disorder and heart failure mapk14 is a 41 kda protein composed of 360 amino acids the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the map kinase family map kinases act as an integration point for multiple

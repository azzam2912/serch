the study of symplectic manifolds is called symplectic geometry or symplectic topology symplectic manifolds arise naturally in abstract formulations of classical mechanics and analytical mechanics as the cotangent bundles of manifolds for example in the hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics which provides one of the major motivations for the field the set of all possible configurations of a system is modeled as a manifold and this manifold s cotangent bundle describes the phase space of the system symplectic manifolds arise from classical mechanics in particular they are a generalization of the phase space of a closed system in the same way the hamilton equations allow one to derive the time evolution of a system from a set of differential equations the symplectic form should allow one to obtain a vector field describing the flow of the system from the differential dh of a hamiltonian function h so we require a linear map or equivalently an element of letting denote a section of the requirement that be non degenerate ensures that for every differential dh there is a unique corresponding vector field v such that since one desires the hamiltonian to be constant along flow lines one should have which implies

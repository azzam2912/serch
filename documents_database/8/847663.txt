programmable matter is thus linked to the concept of a material which inherently has the ability to perform information processing programmable matter is a term originally coined in 1991 by toffoli and margolus to refer to an ensemble of fine grained computing elements arranged in space their paper describes a computing substrate that is composed of fine grained compute nodes distributed throughout space which communicate using only nearest neighbor interactions in this context programmable matter refers to compute models similar to cellular automata and lattice gas automata the cam 8 architecture is an example hardware realization of this model this function is also known as digital referenced areas dra in some forms of self replicating machine science in the early 1990s there was a significant amount of work in reconfigurable modular robotics with a philosophy similar to programmable matter as semiconductor technology nanotechnology and self replicating machine technology have advanced the use of the term programmable matter has changed to reflect the fact that it is possible to build an ensemble of elements which can be programmed to change their physical properties in reality not just in simulation thus programmable matter has come to mean any bulk substance which can

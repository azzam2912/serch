it was the last film that zinnemann directed douglas meredith a middle aged scottish doctor is on vacation in the alps in 1932 with a young woman kate whom he introduces as his wife douglas has brought kate to the alps for a mountain climbing trip douglas and kate are absorbed with a psychological melancholy through flashbacks it is revealed that kate has been in love with douglas since she was a young girl and that she had seduced him away from another woman the flashbacks also reveal that kate is actually his niece but then in their mountain retreat a handsome climbing guide appears and develops an attraction for kate a love triangle ensues but in the end during a mountaineering trip only one man comes down safely while the other falls to his death either one s demise means enormous tears for kate but which one survives the film was a critical and commercial disaster zinnemann remarked i m not saying it was a good picture but there was a degree of viciousness in the reviews the pleasure some people took in tearing down the film really hurt he never made another film

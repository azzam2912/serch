the first hot neptune to be discovered with certainty was gliese 436 b in 2007 an exoplanet about 33 light years away recent observations have revealed a larger potential population of hot neptunes in the milky way than was previously thought hot neptunes may have formed either in situ or ex situ because of their close proximity to their parent star hot neptunes have a much greater rate and chance of transiting their star as seen from a farther outlying point than planets of the same mass in larger orbits this increases the chances of discovering them by transit based observation methods transiting hot neptunes include gliese 436 b and hat p 11b gliese 436 b also known as gj 436b was the first hot neptune to be discovered with certainty in 2007 the exoplanet mu arae c or hd 160691 c discovered in 2004 might also be a hot neptune but it has not been determined definitively another may be kepler 56b which has a mass somewhat larger than neptune s and orbits its star at 0 1 au closer than mercury orbits the sun the first theoretical study of how hot neptunes could form was carried out in

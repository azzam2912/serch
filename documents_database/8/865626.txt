they are not to be confused with the 2007 film invasion of the pod people though they share similar themes the pod people are a race of nomadic extraterrestrial parasites originating from a now dying planet realizing that it was only a matter of time before the planet s resources would be completely depleted the pods somehow evolved the ability to defy gravity and leave their planet s atmosphere in the search of a new world to colonize for millennia the pods floated in space like spores propelled by the solar winds some occasionally landing on inhabited planets once there they would replace the dominant species by spawning emotionless replicas the original bodies would then disintegrate into dust once the duplication process was completed they would then consume all of the planet s resources only to then leave in search of yet another new world such a consumption was apparently the fate of the civilizations that once inhabited mars and the moon the pods sole purpose in life was that of individual survival with no attention given to the civilizations they conquered or the resources they squandered the duplicates had lifespans of only five years and could not sexually reproduce

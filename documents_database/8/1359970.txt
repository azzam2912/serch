in other words a sawtooth is a pattern with population that reaches new heights infinitely often but also infinitely often drops below some fixed value their name comes from the fact that their plot of population versus generation number looks roughly like an ever increasing sawtooth wave for instance in rule 90 a one dimensional elementary cellular automaton the population size starting from a single live cell follows gould s sequence which has a self similar sawtooth pattern on each step whose number is a power of two the population crashes from a high of the step number plus one to a low of only two live cells as the population grows with this pattern its live cells trace out the rows of a sierpinski triangle the sawtooth shape of this pattern can be used to recognize physical processes that behave similarly to rule 90 in rule 90 and in many cellular automata such as highlife the sawtooth pattern is based on the existence of a small replicator which in rule 90 consists of a single live cell in conway s game of life replicators are large and difficult to construct instead the first sawtooth in life was constructed by

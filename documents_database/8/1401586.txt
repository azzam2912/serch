palustris is found extensively in nature and has been isolated from swine waste lagoons earthworm droppings marine coastal sediments and pond water although purple non sulfur bacteria are normally photoheterotrophic r palustris can flexibly switch among any of the four modes of metabolism that support life photoautotrophic photoheterotrophic chemoautotrophic and chemoheterotrophic r palustris is usually found as a wad of slimy masses and cultures appear from pale brown to peach colored etymologically rhodum is a greek noun meaning rose pseudes is the greek adjective for false and monas refers to a unit in greek therefore rhodopseudomonas which implies a unit of false rose describes the appearance of the bacteria palustris is latin for marshy and indicates the common habitat of the bacterium r palustris can grow with or without oxygen or it can use light inorganic or organic compounds for energy it can also acquire carbon from either carbon dioxide fixation or green plant derived compounds finally r palustris is also capable of fixing nitrogen for growth this metabolic versatility has raised interest in the research community and it makes this bacterium suitable for potential use in biotechnological applications efforts are currently being made to understand how this organism adjusts

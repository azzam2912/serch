it is named after andr marie amp re 1775 1836 french mathematician and physicist considered the father of electrodynamics the international system of units defines the ampere in terms of other base units by measuring the electromagnetic force between electrical conductors carrying electric current the earlier cgs measurement system had two different definitions of current one essentially the same as the si s and the other using electric charge as the base unit with the unit of charge defined by measuring the force between two charged metal plates the ampere was then defined as one coulomb of charge per second in si the unit of charge the coulomb is defined as the charge carried by one ampere during one second new definitions in terms of invariant constants of nature specifically the elementary charge took effect on 20 may 2019 the ampere is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be 1 602 176 634 10 when expressed in the unit c which is equal to a s where the second is defined in terms of the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium133 atom the si unit of charge the coulomb is

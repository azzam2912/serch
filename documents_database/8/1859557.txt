from a sample preparation point of view it may refer to some of the following as well as other genetic neuron labeling techniques in broad sense neuron tracing is more often related to digital reconstruction of a neuron s morphology from imaging data of above samples digital reconstruction or tracing of neuron morphology is a fundamental task in computational neuroscience it is also critical for mapping neuronal circuits based on advanced microscope images usually based on light microscopy e g laser scanning microscopy bright field imaging or electron microscopy or other methods due to the high complexity of neuron morphology and often seen heavy noise in such images as well as the typically encountered massive amount of image data it has been widely viewed as one of the most challenging computational tasks for computational neuroscience many image analysis based methods have been proposed to trace neuron morphology usually in 3d manually semi automatically or completely automatically there are normally two processing steps generation and proof editing of a reconstruction the need to describe or reconstruct a neuron s morphology probably began already in early days when neurons were labeled or visualized using golgi s methods many of the known neuron

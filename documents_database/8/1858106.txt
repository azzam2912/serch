unlike traditional computer forensics which relies on digital artifacts stochastic forensics does not require artifacts and can therefore recreate activity which would otherwise be invisible its chief application is the investigation of insider data theft stochastic forensics was invented in 2010 by computer scientist jonathan grier to detect and investigate insider data theft insider data theft has been notoriously difficult to investigate using traditional methods since it does not create any artifacts such as changes to the file attributes or windows registry consequently industry demanded a new investigative technique since its invention stochastic forensics has been used in real world investigation of insider data theft been the subject of academic research and met with industry demand for tools and training stochastic forensics is inspired by the statistical mechanics method used in physics classical newtonian mechanics calculates the exact position and momentum of every particle in a system this works well for systems such as the solar system which consist of a small number of objects however it cannot be used to study things like a gas which have intractably large numbers of molecules statistical mechanics however doesn t attempt to track properties of individual particles but only the properties which

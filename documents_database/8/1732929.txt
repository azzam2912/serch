they can support technologies from hp or third parties the claimed capacity is the equivalent of up to 10 000 square feet of typical data center capacity depending on the model depending on the model they use either chilled water cooling or a combination of direct expansion air cooling the pod 40c was launched in 2008 this 40 foot modular data center has a maximum power capacity up to 27 kw per rack the pod 40c supports 3 500 compute nodes or 12 000 lff hard drives hp has claimed this offers the computing equivalent of 4 000 square foot of traditional data center space the pod 20c was launched in 2010 this modular data center is housed in a 20 foot container this version houses 10 industry standard 50u racks of hardware the pod uses an efficient cooling design of variable speed fans hot and cold aisle containment and close coupled cooling to maximize capacity and efficiency the pod 20c can operate at a power usage effectiveness of 1 25 pods can maintain cold aisle temperatures higher than typical brick and mortar data centers the temperature of the cold aisle in traditional data centers is typically 68 to 72

this concept arises frequently in thermodynamics in thermodynamics a change in the thermodynamic state of a system and all of its surroundings cannot be precisely restored to its initial state by infinitesimal changes in some property of the system without expenditure of energy a system that undergoes an irreversible process may still be capable of returning to its initial state however the impossibility occurs in restoring the environment to its own initial conditions an irreversible process increases the entropy of the universe because entropy is a state function the change in entropy of the system is the same whether the process is reversible or irreversible the second law of thermodynamics can be used to determine whether a process is reversible or not intuitively a process is reversible if there is no dissipation for example joule expansion is irreversible because initially the system is not uniform initially there is part of the system with gas in it and part of the system with no gas for dissipation to occur there needs to be such a non uniformity this is just the same as if in a system one section of the gas was hot and the other cold then dissipation would

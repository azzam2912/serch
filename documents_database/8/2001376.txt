this allows the processor to meet the instantaneous performance needs of the operation being performed while minimizing power draw heat generation and noise avoidance amd powertune aims to solve thermal design power and performance constraints besides the reduced energy consumption amd powertune helps to lower the noise levels created by the cooling in desktop computers and extends battery life in mobile devices amd powertune is the successor to amd powerplay support for powerplay was added to the linux kernel driver amdgpu on november 11 2015 as a lecture from ccc in 2014 shows amd s x86 64 smu firmware is executed on some latticemico32 and powertune was modeled using matlab this is similar to nvidia s pdaemon the rtos responsible for power on their gpus amd powertune was introduced in the terascale 3 vliw4 with radeon hd 6900 in dec 15 2010 and has been available in different development stages on radeon and amd firepro branded products ever since over the years reviews which document the development of amd powertune have been published by anandtech an additional technology named amd zerocore power has been available since the radeon hd 7000 series implementing the graphics core next microarchitecture the pointlessness of

it means that individuals with similar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern some examples of similar phenotypes are body size skin coloration or pigmentation and age assortative mating can increase genetic relatedness within the family and is the inverse of disassortative mating disassortative mating also known as negative assortative mating or heterogamy means that individuals with dissimilar genotypes or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random mating disassortative mating reduces the genetic similarities within the family positive assortative mating occurs more frequently than negative assortative mating in both cases the nonrandom mating pattern result in a typical deviation from the hardy weinberg principle which states that genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences such as mate choice in this case several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of assortative mating assortative mating has evolved from a combination of different factors which vary across different species assortative mating with respect to body size can arise as a consequence of intrasexual competition in some species size is correlated with fecundity in females

schnorr is a large prime order subgroup of formula 1 the multiplicative group of integers modulo formula 2 for some prime formula 2 to generate such a group generate formula 2 formula 5 formula 6 such that with formula 2 formula 5 prime then choose any formula 10 in the range formula 11 until you find one such that this value is a generator of a subgroup of formula 1 of order formula 5 schnorr groups are useful in discrete log based cryptosystems including schnorr signatures and dsa in such applications typically formula 2 is chosen to be large enough to resist index calculus and related methods of solving the discrete log problem perhaps 1024 to 3072 bits while formula 5 is large enough to resist the birthday attack on discrete log problems which works in any group perhaps 160 to 256 bits because the schnorr group is of prime order it has no non trivial proper subgroups thwarting confinement attacks due to small subgroups implementations of protocols that use schnorr groups must verify where appropriate that integers supplied by other parties are in fact members of the schnorr group formula 18 is a member of the group if formula

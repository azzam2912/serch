any set that receives a classification is called arithmetical the arithmetical hierarchy is important in recursion theory effective descriptive set theory and the study of formal theories such as peano arithmetic the tarski kuratowski algorithm provides an easy way to get an upper bound on the classifications assigned to a formula and the set it defines the hyperarithmetical hierarchy and the analytical hierarchy extend the arithmetical hierarchy to classify additional formulas and sets the arithmetical hierarchy assigns classifications to the formulas in the language of first order arithmetic the classifications are denoted formula 1 and formula 2 for natural numbers n including 0 the greek letters here are lightface symbols which indicates that the formulas do not contain set parameters if a formula formula 3 is logically equivalent to a formula with only bounded quantifiers then formula 3 is assigned the classifications formula 5 and formula 6 the classifications formula 1 and formula 2 are defined inductively for every natural number n using the following rules also a formula 1 formula is equivalent to a formula that begins with some existential quantifiers and alternates formula 22 times between series of existential and universal quantifiers while a formula 2 formula is

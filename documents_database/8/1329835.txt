plant tissue culture is widely used to produce clones of a plant in a method known as micropropagation different techniques in plant tissue culture may offer certain advantages over traditional methods of propagation including plant tissue culture relies on the fact that many plant cells have the ability to regenerate a whole plant totipotency single cells plant cells without cell walls protoplasts pieces of leaves stems or roots can often be used to generate a new plant on culture media given the required nutrients and plant hormones preparation of plant tissue for tissue culture is performed under aseptic conditions under hepa filtered air provided by a laminar flow cabinet thereafter the tissue is grown in sterile containers such as petri dishes or flasks in a growth room with controlled temperature and light intensity living plant materials from the environment are naturally contaminated on their surfaces and sometimes interiors with microorganisms so their surfaces are sterilized in chemical solutions usually alcohol and sodium or calcium hypochlorite before suitable samples known as explants are taken the sterile explants are then usually placed on the surface of a sterile solid culture medium but are sometimes placed directly into a sterile liquid medium particularly

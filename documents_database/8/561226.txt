he was noted for introducing the constant pressure engine that is the basis for the gas turbine and which is now referred to as the brayton cycle in 1872 george brayton patented a constant pressure internal combustion engine initially using vaporized gas but later using liquid fuels such as kerosene and oil known as brayton s ready motor the engine used one cylinder for compression a receiver reservoir and a separate power expander cylinder in which the products of combustion expanded for the power stroke the significant difference from other piston driven internal combustion engines is that the two cylinders are arranged so that the fuel air mixture burns progressively at constant pressure as it is transferred from the compressor cylinder and reservoir to the working expansion cylinder in the original version a gas air mixture was created by a vapor carburetor then compressed and stored in a reservoir where it was ignited and then introduced into an expansion cylinder a metal gauze mesh was used to prevent the combustion running back to the reservoir however at times the mesh failed leading to flash back or explosion in 1874 brayton filed a patent for a liquid fuel injection system in

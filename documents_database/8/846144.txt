from the 1930s onward a number of fans and scholars have attempted to create a chronological timeline into which the numerous conan the barbarian stories by robert e howard and later writers could be placed going beyond a simple fan activity these efforts have had a significant impact on the development of the popular conception of the character of conan as well as economic consequences on the conan franchise as paolo bertetti observes the focus on the creation of a character chronology outside of the work of the original author begins a process that tends to transform the character into a social object of inter individual construction and public debate rendering it independent of texts in which it was born and in the case of conan this has led to the exploitation of the character for commercial reasons and perhaps encouraged and justified the proliferation of pastiche stories and novels over the years a number of factors have prevented the establishment of a consensus on order of the conan stories most notably the fact that howard himself apparently had little more than a general idea of the character s career path and intentionally wrote the stories out of chronological sequence

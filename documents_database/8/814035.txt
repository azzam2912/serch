over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year and cement kilns are the heart of this production process their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant as the main energy consuming and greenhouse gas emitting stage of cement manufacture improvement of kiln efficiency has been the central concern of cement manufacturing technology a typical process of manufacture consists of three stages in the second stage the rawmix is fed into the kiln and gradually heated by contact with the hot gases from combustion of the kiln fuel successive chemical reactions take place as the temperature of the rawmix rises alite is the characteristic constituent of portland cement typically a peak temperature of 1400 1450 c is required to complete the reaction the partial melting causes the material to aggregate into lumps or nodules typically of diameter 1 10 mm this is called clinker the hot clinker next falls into a cooler which recovers most of its heat and cools the clinker to around 100 c at which temperature it can be conveniently conveyed to storage the cement kiln system is designed to accomplish these processes portland cement clinker was first made in 1825 in a modified

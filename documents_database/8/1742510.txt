the mm stands for majorize minimization or minorize maximization depending on whether the desired optimization is a maximization or a minimization mm itself is not an algorithm but a description of how to construct an optimization algorithm the expectation maximization algorithm can be treated as a special case of the mm algorithm however in the em algorithm conditional expectations are usually involved while in the mm algorithm convexity and inequalities are the main focus and it is easier to understand and apply in most cases the historical basis for the mm algorithm can be dated back to at least 1970 when ortega and rheinboldt were performing studies related to line search methods the same concept continued to reappear in different areas in different forms in 2000 hunter and lange put forth mm as a general framework recent studies have applied the method in a wide range of subject areas such as mathematics statistics machine learning and engineering the mm algorithm works by finding a surrogate function that minorizes or majorizes the objective function optimizing the surrogate function will drive the objective function upward or downward until a local optimum is reached taking the minorize maximization version let formula 1 be

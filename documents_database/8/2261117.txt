openio leverages open source software developed since 2006 which is based on a grid technology that enables dynamic behaviors and supports heterogenous hardware in october 2017 openio completed a 5 million funding round openio is a software defined object storage solution that supports s3 and can be deployed on premises cloud hosted or at the edge on any hardware mix it has been designed from the beginning for performance and cost efficiency at any scale and it has been optimized for big data hpc and ai openio stores objects within in a flat structure within a massively distributed directory with indirections this allows the data query path to be independent of the number of nodes and the performance not to be affected by the growth of the capacity servers are organized as a grid of nodes massively distributed where each node takes part in directory and storage services which ensures that there is no single point of failure and that new nodes are automatically discovered and immediately available without the need to rebalance data the software is built on top of consciousgrid a technology that ensures optimal data placement based on real time metrics and allows the addition or removal

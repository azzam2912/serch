the cuntz algebras provided the first concrete examples of a separable infinite simple c algebra every simple infinite c algebra contains for any given n a subalgebra that has formula 1 as quotient let n 2 and h be a separable hilbert space consider the c algebra formula 3 generated by a set of isometries i e formula 5 acting on h satisfying theorem the concrete c algebra formula 3 is isomorphic to the universal c algebra formula 8 generated by n generators s s subject to relations s s 1 for all i and ss 1 the proof of the theorem hinges on the following fact any c algebra generated by n isometries s s with orthogonal ranges contains a copy of the uhf algebra formula 9 type n namely formula 9 is spanned by words of the form the subalgebra formula 9 being approximately finite dimensional has a unique c norm the subalgebra formula 9 plays role of the space of fourier coefficients for elements of the algebra a key technical lemma due to cuntz is that an element in the algebra is zero if and only if all its fourier coefficients vanish using this one can show

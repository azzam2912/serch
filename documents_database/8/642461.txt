dennis gabor invented holography in 1948 when he tried to improve resolution in electron microscope the first attempts to perform holography with electron waves were made by haine and mulvey in 1952 they recorded holograms of zinc oxide crystals with 60 kev electrons demonstrating reconstructions with approximately 1 nm resolution in 1955 g m llenstedt and h d ker invented an electron biprism thus enabling the recording of electron holograms in off axis scheme there are many different possible configurations for electron holography with more than 20 documented in 1992 by cowley usually high spatial and temporal coherence i e a low energy spread of the electron beam are required to perform holographic measurements electron holography with high energy electrons 80 200 kev can be realized in a transmission electron microscope tem in an off axis scheme electron beam is split into two parts by very thin positively charged wire positive voltage deflects the electron waves so that they overlap and produce an interference pattern of equidistantly spaced fringes reconstruction of off axis holograms is done numerically and it consists of two mathematical transformations first a fourier transform of the hologram is performed the resulting complex image consists of the

when mehmed pasha died in june 1775 the sultan s rule was not returned to northern albania he was succeeded by his young son mahmud pasha in the 1780s his rebellious character brought him into conflict with the ottomans this conflict is regarded in albanian historiography as a bid to create an independent principality however the immediate cause of the conflict with the ottomans was his clash with the tosk pashas of southern albania namely ali pasha and ahmet kurt pasha his major quarrels were with montenegro which he attacked in 1785 during his attacks in montenegro he even burned cetinje and plundered region including the library and treasury of the re evi i monastery during his conflict with the southern albanian pashas he was approached by the austrians and russians who wanted to use him against the ottomans they offered to convert kara mahmud pasha to christianity thus recognizing him as king of albania he accepted the proposal however upon learning that they wanted to hand his lands to montenegro he rejected their offers in 1788 and beheaded the delegation sending their heads as trophies to the ottoman sultan who pardoned him for his quarrels with the local pashas

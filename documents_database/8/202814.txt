such a partial order can also be called consistently or coherently complete visser 2004 p 182 since any upper bound of a set can be interpreted as some consistent non contradictory piece of information that extends all the information present in the set hence the presence of some upper bound in a way guarantees the consistency of a set bounded completeness then yields the existence of a least upper bound of any consistent subset which can be regarded as the most general piece of information that captures all the knowledge present within this subset this view closely relates to the idea of information ordering that one typically finds in domain theory formally a partially ordered set p is bounded complete if the following holds for any subset s of p bounded completeness has various relationships to other completeness properties which are detailed in the article on completeness in order theory note also that the term bounded poset is sometimes used to refer to a partially ordered set that has both a least and a greatest element hence it is important to distinguish between a bounded complete poset and a bounded complete partial order cpo for a typical example of a

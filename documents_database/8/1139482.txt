it is part of a family of six set1 like h3k4 methyltransferases that also contains kmt2a or mll1 kmt2b or mll2 kmt2c or mll3 kmt2f or set1a and kmt2g or set1b kmt2d is a large protein over 5 500 amino acids in size and is widely expressed in adult tissues the protein co localizes with lineage determining transcription factors on transcriptional enhancers and is essential for cell differentiation and embryonic development it also plays critical roles in regulating cell fate transition metabolism and tumor suppression mutations in kmt2d have been associated with kabuki syndrome congenital heart disease and various forms of cancer in mice kmt2d is coded by the kmt2d gene located on chromosome 15f1 its transcript is 19 823 base pairs long and contains 55 exons and 54 introns in humans kmt2d is coded by the kmt2d gene located on chromosome 12q13 12 its transcript is 19 419 base pairs long and contains 54 exons and 53 introns kmt2d is homologous to trithorax related trr which is a trithorax group protein the mouse and human kmt2d proteins are 5 588 and 5 537 amino acids in length respectively both species of the protein weigh about 600 kda kmt2d contains

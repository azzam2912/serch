the solid plane region the bounding circuit or the two together may be called a polygon the segments of a polygonal circuit are called its edges or sides and the points where two edges meet are the polygon s vertices singular vertex or corners the interior of a solid polygon is sometimes called its body an n gon is a polygon with n sides for example a triangle is a 3 gon a simple polygon is one which does not intersect itself mathematicians are often concerned only with the bounding polygonal chains of simple polygons and they often define a polygon accordingly a polygonal boundary may be allowed to cross over itself creating star polygons and other self intersecting polygons a polygon is a 2 dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions there are many more generalizations of polygons defined for different purposes the word polygon derives from the greek adjective pol s much many and g n a corner or angle it has been suggested that g nu knee may be the origin of gon polygons are primarily classified by the number of sides see the table below polygons may be characterized by their

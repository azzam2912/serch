the main difference between 1d and 2d adaptive filters is that the former usually take as inputs signals with respect to time what implies in causality constraints while the latter handles signals with 2 dimensions like x y coordinates in the space domain which are usually non causal moreover just like 1d filters most 2d adaptive filters are digital filters because of the complex and iterative nature of the algorithms the topic of 2d adaptive filters is very important in electrical engineering and signal processing since these filters have the ability to take into account the nonstationary statistical properties of 2d signals adaptive filters find applications in areas such as noise cancellation signal prediction equalization and echo cancellation examples of applications of 2d adaptive filters include image denoising motion tracking ofdm channel estimation magnetic recording equalization 2d adaptive filters can be used to identify systems the system function of the unknown system is given by formula 1 and formula 2 is the system function of the 2d adaptive filter when its output comes to steady the error signal formula 3 between the unknown system output formula 4 and the adaptive filter output formula 5 is minimized if the unknown system

to date flight data related to potential back injuries have focused on spine elongation and the well established effects of mechanical unloading on intervertebral discs sixty eight percent of early astronauts through 1991 who have flown in space have reported generalized back pain the pain is considered most painful during early flight and lessens as the flight progresses possible causes of back pain in flight may be associated with regardless of the cause astronauts may be at an increased risk of intervertebral disc injury or damage when the swollen discs are subjected to excessive forces or torques while working on planetary surfaces exploration missions on planetary surfaces may also introduce habitability issues that could induce excessive torsional stress an established risk factor for herniation of anulus fibrosus currently there is minimal in and post flight data that would characterize the changes in intervertebral discs in crewmembers to assess how these changes would predispose the discs to injury under re loading herniated nucleus pulposus is known to occur in aviators exposed to high g force environments and has occurred in astronauts after a mission the relative risk rate of intervertebral disc damage has only recently been researched but there is currently

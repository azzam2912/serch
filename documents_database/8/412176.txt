these characters allow any polynomial chemical and certain other equations to be represented in plain text without using any form of markup like html or tex the world wide web consortium and the unicode consortium have made recommendations on the choice between using markup and using superscript and subscript characters when used in mathematical context mathml it is recommended to consistently use style markup for superscripts and subscripts however when super and sub scripts are to reflect semantic distinctions it is easier to work with these meanings encoded in text rather than markup for example in phonetic or phonemic transcription the intended use when these characters were added to unicode was to allow chemical and algebra formulas and phonetics to be written without markup but produce true superscripts and subscripts thus h o using a subscript character is supposed to be identical to ho with subscript markup in reality most fonts that include these characters ignore the unicode definition and design the digits for mathematical numerator and denominator glyphs which are smaller than normal characters but are aligned with the cap line and the baseline respectively when used with the solidus these glyphs are useful for making arbitrary diagonal fractions

generally speaking trajectory optimization is a technique for computing an open loop solution to an optimal control problem it is often used for systems where computing the full closed loop solution is either impossible or impractical although the idea of trajectory optimization has been around for hundreds of years calculus of variations brachystochrone problem it only became practical for real world problems with the advent of the computer many of the original applications of trajectory optimization were in the aerospace industry computing rocket and missile launch trajectories more recently trajectory optimization has also been used in a wide variety of industrial process and robotics applications trajectory optimization first showed up in 1697 with the introduction of the brachystochrone problem find the shape of a wire such that a bead sliding along it will move between two points in the minimum time the interesting thing about this problem is that it is optimizing over a curve the shape of the wire rather than a single number the most famous of the solutions was computed using calculus of variations in the 1950s the digital computer started to make trajectory optimization practical for solving real world problems the first optimal control approaches grew

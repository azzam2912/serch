on average half the key space must be searched to find the solution another desirable attribute is that the key must be selected truly randomly from all possible key permutations should this not be the case and the attacker is able to determine some factor that may influence how the key was selected the search space and hence also the search time can be significantly reduced humans do not select passwords randomly therefore attackers frequently try a dictionary attack before a brute force attack as this approach can often produce the correct answer in far less time than a systematic brute force search of all possible character combinations if a key were eight bits one byte long the keyspace would consist of 2 or 256 possible keys advanced encryption standard aes can use a symmetric key of 256 bits resulting in a key space containing 2 or 1 1579 10 possible keys in the des block cipher 56 bit key is used resulting in a relatively small key space of size 2 or 7 2058 x 10 which as was demonstrated in 1998 can be searched exhaustively in 56 hours with a desktop computer

it is part of new zealand s uncodified constitution in 1985 a white paper entitled a bill of rights for new zealand was tabled in parliament by the then minister of justice hon geoffrey palmer the paper proposed a number of controversial features which sparked widespread debate the bill then went to the justice and law reform select committee which recommended that new zealand was not yet ready for a bill of rights in the form proposed by the white paper the committee recommended that the bill of rights be introduced as an ordinary statute which would not have the status of superior or entrenched law in its current form the bill of rights is similar to the canadian bill of rights passed in 1960 the act does create an atmosphere change in new zealand law in that it provides judges the means to interpret around other acts to ensure enlarged liberty interests the bill of rights has a liberty maximising clause much like the ninth amendment to the united states constitution and this provides many opportunities for creative interpretation in favour of liberties and rights the act applies only to acts done by the three branches of government the

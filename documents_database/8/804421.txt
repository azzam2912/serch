although nanotechnology is a relatively recent development in scientific research the development of its central concepts happened over a longer period of time the emergence of nanotechnology in the 1980s was caused by the convergence of experimental advances such as the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 and the discovery of fullerenes in 1985 with the elucidation and popularization of a conceptual framework for the goals of nanotechnology beginning with the 1986 publication of the book engines of creation the field was subject to growing public awareness and controversy in the early 2000s with prominent debates about both its potential implications as well as the feasibility of the applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology and with governments moving to promote and fund research into nanotechnology the early 2000s also saw the beginnings of commercial applications of nanotechnology although these were limited to bulk applications of nanomaterials rather than the transformative applications envisioned by the field the earliest evidence of the use and applications of nanotechnology can be traced back to carbon nanotubes cementite nanowires found in the microstructure of wootz steel manufactured in ancient india from the time period of 600 bc and exported globally although nanoparticles

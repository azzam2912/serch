the biosyntheses of polyketides share striking similarities with fatty acid biosynthesis the pks genes for a certain polyketide are usually organized in one operon or in gene clusters pkss can be classified into three groups with the following subdivisions each type i polyketide synthase module consists of several domains with defined functions separated by short spacer regions the order of modules and domains of a complete polyketide synthase is as follows in the order n terminus to c terminus domains the polyketide chain and the starter groups are bound with their carboxy functional group to the sh groups of the acp and the ks domain through a thioester linkage r c o oh hs protein r c o s protein ho the acp carrier domains are similar to the pcp carrier domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases and some proteins combine both types of modules the growing chain is handed over from one thiol group to the next by trans acylations and is released at the end by hydrolysis or by cyclization alcoholysis or aminolysis starting stage elongation stages termination stage polyketide synthases are an important source of naturally occurring small molecules used for chemotherapy for example many of the commonly

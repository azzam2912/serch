at a stagnation point the fluid velocity is zero and all kinetic energy has been converted into pressure energy isentropically in an incompressible flow stagnation pressure is equal to the sum of the free stream dynamic pressure and free stream static pressure stagnation pressure is sometimes referred to as pitot pressure because it is measured using a pitot tube the magnitude of stagnation pressure can be derived from a simplified form of bernoulli equation for incompressible flow where at a stagnation point the speed of the fluid is zero if the gravity head of the fluid at a particular point in a fluid flow is zero then the stagnation pressure at that particular point is equal to total pressure however in general total pressure differs from stagnation pressure in that total pressure equals the sum of stagnation pressure and gravity head in compressible flow the stagnation pressure is equal to total pressure only if the fluid entering the stagnation point is brought to rest isentropically for many purposes in compressible flow the stagnation enthalpy or stagnation temperature plays a role similar to the stagnation pressure in incompressible flow stagnation pressure is the static pressure a gas retains when brought to

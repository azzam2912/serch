fastsoft was acquired by akamai technologies in 2012 fasttcp is compatible with existing tcp algorithms requiring modification only to the computer which is sending data the name fast is a recursive acronym for fast aqm scalable tcp where aqm stands for active queue management and tcp stands for transmission control protocol the role of congestion control is to moderate the rate at which data is transmitted according to the capacity of the network and the rate at which other users are transmitting like tcp vegas fast tcp uses queueing delay instead of loss probability as a congestion signal most current congestion control algorithms detect congestion and slow down when they discover that packets are being dropped so that the average sending rate depends on the loss probability this has two drawbacks first low loss probabilities are required to sustain high data rates in the case of tcp reno very low loss probabilities are required but even new congestion avoidance algorithms such as h tcp bic tcp and hstcp require loss rates lower than those provided by most wireless wide area networks moreover packet loss only provides a single bit of information about the congestion level whereas delay is a continuous

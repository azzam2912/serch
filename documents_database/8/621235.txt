the panel may be folded to conserve space the term dipole derives from the fact that the polar response consists of two lobes with equal radiation forwards and backwards and none perpendicular to the axis by comparison a monopole response consists of one lobe this can be useful in reducing the stimulation of resonant room modes at low frequencies it also results in high frequencies being reflected from any rear wall which can enhance the naturalness of the sound in typical listening rooms by creating more diffuse reverberation though in theory it could detract from stereo localization for this reason dipole speakers are often used as surround channel speakers where a diffuse sound is desired to create ambience a dipole speaker works by creating air movement as sound pressure waves directly from the front and back surfaces of the driver rather than by impedance matching one or both outputs to the air as a result diaphragm motion is constrained primarily by the driver s restoring force e g diaphragm suspension and not by acoustic loading from an enclosure this implies that cone motion will be larger at the same output level than in a more usual enclosure and that power

active processes are placed in an array called a run queue or runqueue the run queue may contain priority values for each process which will be used by the scheduler to determine which process to run next to ensure each program has a fair share of resources each one is run for some time period quantum before it is paused and placed back into the run queue when a program is stopped to let another run the program with the highest priority in the run queue is then allowed to execute processes are also removed from the run queue when they ask to sleep are waiting on a resource to become available or have been terminated in the linux operating system prior to kernel 2 6 23 each cpu in the system is given a run queue which maintains both an active and expired array of processes each array contains 140 one for each priority level pointers to doubly linked lists which in turn reference all processes with the given priority the scheduler selects the next process from the active array with highest priority when a process quantum expires it is placed into the expired array with some priority when

a cornish and r a fisher who first described the technique in 1937 for a random variable x with mean variance and cumulants its value y at quantile p can be estimated as formula 1 where where he is the n probabilists hermite polynomial the values and are the random variable s skewness and excess kurtosis respectively the value s in each set of brackets are the terms for that level of polynomial estimation and all must be calculated and combined for the cornish fisher expansion at that level to be valid let x be a random variable with mean 10 variance 25 skew 5 and excess kurtosis of 2 we can use the first two bracketed terms above which depend only on skew and kurtosis to estimate quantiles of this random variable for the 95th percentile the value for which the standard normal cumulative distribution function is 0 95 is 1 644854 which will be x the w weight can be calculated as or about 2 55621 so the estimated 95th percentile of x is 10 5 2 55621 or about 22 781 for comparison the 95th percentile of a normal random variable with mean 10 and variance 25

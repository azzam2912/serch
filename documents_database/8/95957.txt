on the former he contended that return on capital arises from the roundabout nature of production a steel ladder for example will be produced and brought to market only if the demand supports the digging of iron ore the smelting of steel the machines that press that steel into ladder shape the machines that make and help maintain those machines etc advocates of the labour theory of value point out that every step in that process however roundabout involves labor but b hm bawerk said that what they missed was the process itself the roundaboutness which necessarily involves the passage of time roundabout processes b hm bawerk maintained lead to a price that pays for more than labor value this makes it unnecessary to postulate exploitation in order to understand the return on capital although how the length of the production process in and of itself produces value remains unclear as if b hm bawerk s idea were correct the more inefficient a capitalist manufacturer the longer their production process and the more profit they would accrue when in fact the additional costs they incur through their inefficient production process would prevent them from selling their output at the market

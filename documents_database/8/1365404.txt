this organism is a unicellular flagellated eukaryote that was first discovered in substrate samples from the great barrier reef carpediemonas can be found in anaerobic intertidal sediment where it feeds on bacteria a feature of this species is the presence of a feeding groove a characteristic of the excavates like most other metamonads carpediemonas does not rely on an aerobic mitochondria to produce energy instead it contains hydrogenosomes that are used to produce atp this organism has two flagella a posterior one used for feeding on the substrate and an anterior one that moves in a slower sweeping motion carpediemonas is assigned to the fornicates where similar carpediemonas like organisms are used in researching the evolution within excavates although carpediemonas is a member of the metamonads it is unusual in the sense that it is free living and has three basal bodies the name carpediemonas originates from three latin roots with carpe meaning seize die meaning the day and the suffix of monas indicating a unicellular organism the organism was named after carpe diem meaning to seize the day in honour of the wife of one of the authors who had recently died carpediemonas was first discovered by larsen and

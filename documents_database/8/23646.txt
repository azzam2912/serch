electromagnetic transmission includes light emissions traveling in a straight line the rays or waves may be diffracted refracted reflected or absorbed by the atmosphere and obstructions with material and generally cannot travel over the horizon or behind obstacles in contrast to line of sight propagation at low frequency below approximately 3 mhz due to diffraction radio waves can travel as ground waves which follow the contour of the earth this enables am radio stations to transmit beyond the horizon additionally frequencies in the shortwave bands between approximately 1 and 30 mhz can be reflected back to earth by the ionosphere called skywave or skip propagation thus giving radio transmissions in this range a potentially global reach however at frequencies above 30 mhz vhf and higher and in lower levels of the atmosphere neither of these effects are significant thus any obstruction between the transmitting antenna transmitter and the receiving antenna receiver will block the signal just like the light that the eye may sense therefore since the ability to visually see a transmitting antenna disregarding the limitations of the eye s resolution roughly corresponds to the ability to receive a radio signal from it the propagation characteristic at these frequencies

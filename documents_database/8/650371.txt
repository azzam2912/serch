it is the hottest part of the sun and of the solar system it has a density of 150 g cm 150 times the density of liquid water at the center and a temperature of 15 million kelvins 15 million degrees celsius 27 million degrees fahrenheit the core is made of hot dense plasma ions and electrons at a pressure estimated at 265 billion bar 3 84 trillion psi or 26 5 petapascals ppa at the center due to fusion the composition of the solar plasma drops from 68 70 hydrogen by mass at the outer core to 33 hydrogen at the core sun center the core inside 0 20 of the solar radius contains 34 of the sun s mass but only 3 4 of the sun s volume inside the 0 24 solar radius is the core which generates 99 of the fusion power of the sun there are two distinct reactions in which four hydrogen nuclei may eventually result in one helium nucleus the proton proton chain reaction which is responsible for most of the sun s released energy and the cno cycle the sun at the photosphere is about 73 74 by mass hydrogen which is

its dimension is n n 1 2 where the dimension of v is 2n it may be identified with the homogeneous space where u n is the unitary group and o n the orthogonal group following vladimir arnold it is denoted by n the lagrangian grassmannian is a submanifold of the ordinary grassmannian of v a complex lagrangian grassmannian is the complex homogeneous manifold of lagrangian subspaces of a complex symplectic vector space v of dimension 2 n it may be identified with the homogeneous space of complex dimension n n 1 2 where sp n is the compact symplectic group the stable topology of the lagrangian grassmannian and complex lagrangian grassmannian is completely understood as these spaces appear in the bott periodicity theorem formula 1 and formula 2 they are thus exactly the homotopy groups of the stable orthogonal group up to a shift in indexing dimension in particular the fundamental group of formula 3 is infinite cyclic with a distinguished generator given by the square of the determinant of a unitary matrix as a mapping to the unit circle its first homology group is therefore also infinite cyclic as is its first cohomology group arnold showed that this

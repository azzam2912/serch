derlin 1 is located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum er and is involved in retrotranslocation of specific misfolded proteins and in er stress derlin 1 is widely expressed in thyroid fat bone marrow and many other tissues the protein belongs to the derlin family proteins also called derlins consisting of derlin 1 derlin 2 and derlin 3 that are components in the endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation erad pathway the derlins mediate degradation of misfolded lumenal proteins within er and are named der for their degradation in the er derlin 1 is a mammalian homologue of the yeast der1 protein a protein involved in the yeast erad pathway moreover derlin 1 is a member of the rhomboid like clan of polytopic membrane proteins overexpression of derlin 1 are associated with many cancers including colon cancer breast cancer bladder cancer and non small cell lung cancer in 2004 the derl1 gene was discovered independently by two research groups when they were exploring the machinery of retrotranslocation in the er in the cell one evidence for the existence of derl1 was provided by professor tom a rapoport and his research group at harvard medical school boston massachusetts another evidence of

for example the resource may belong to two shareholders such that alice holds 8 13 and george holds 5 13 this leads to the criterion of weighted proportionality wpr there are several weights formula 1 that sum up to 1 and every partner formula 2 should receive at least a fraction formula 1 of the resource by their own valuation in contrast in the simpler proportional cake cutting setting the weights are equal formula 4 for all formula 2 several algorithms can be used to find a wpr division suppose all the weights are rational numbers with common denominator formula 6 so the weights are formula 7 with formula 8 for each player formula 2 create formula 10 clones with the same value measure the total number of clones is formula 6 find a proportional cake allocation among them finally give each partner formula 2 the pieces of his formula 10 clones if there are only two partners then the above procedure can be simplified let alice cut the cake to formula 6 pieces equal in her eyes let george select the formula 15 most valuable pieces in his eyes and let alice take the remaining formula 16 pieces this

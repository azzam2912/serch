the work contains newcomb s mathematical development of the position of the earth in the solar system which is constructed from classical celestial mechanics as well as centuries of astronomical measurements the bulk of the work however is a collection of tabulated precomputed values that provide the position of the sun at any point in time newcomb s tables were the basis for practically all ephemerides of the sun published from 1900 through 1983 including the annual almanacs of the u s naval observatory and the royal greenwich observatory the tables are seldom used now since the astronomical almanac for 1984 they have been superseded by more accurate numerically integrated ephemerides developed at jet propulsion laboratory based on much more accurate observations than were available to newcomb also the tables did not account for the effects of general relativity which was unknown at the time nevertheless his tabulated values remain accurate to within a few seconds of arc to this day newcomb s work was no small accomplishment especially considering that it predated the advent of digital computers by more than a half century emphasis is often placed on the tables themselves rather than the underlying theory the latter may

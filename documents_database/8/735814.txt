whereas the cycloconverter switches among a variety of staggered input phases to piece together an extremely jagged output signal the tap converter synthesizes a much smoother signal by switching among a variety of obviously synchronized transformer output taps both linear spacing and power of two style vernier spacing can be employed in establishing the tap positions e g a four tap transformer can provide taps at 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 linear or 0 0625 0 125 0 25 and 0 5 vernier the limitations of the vernier in this case that the maximum obtainable amplitude is 0 9375 are less discernible as more taps are added by employing a scott transformer input connection in order to provide a quadrature phase an even smoother output waveform can be obtained prototypes of the device were constructed and field tested under a variety of conditions nominally as a variable speed constant frequency vscf power source for military aircraft and ornate computer models were constructed for exploring more ornery considerations such as flux leakage hysteresis and practical thyristor characteristics all of this work was performed at new york s cooper union for the advancement of science and art as of

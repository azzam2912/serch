the most well known example is the solution introduced in secondary school of the quadratic equation where a 0 there exist more complicated algebraic solutions for the general cubic equation and quartic equation the abel ruffini theorem states that the general quintic equation lacks an algebraic solution and this directly implies that the general polynomial equation of degree n for n 5 cannot be solved algebraically however for n 5 some polynomial equations have algebraic solutions for example the equation formula 3 can be solved as formula 4 see for various other examples in degree 5 variste galois introduced a criterion allowing one to decide which equations are solvable in radicals see radical extension for the precise formulation of his result algebraic solutions form a subset of closed form expressions because the latter permit transcendental functions non algebraic functions such as the exponential function the logarithmic function and the trigonometric functions and their inverses

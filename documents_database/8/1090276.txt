nutations are due to the unequal rate of growth of different sides of the organ an inequality which so far as is known at present c 1915 is dependent upon internal unknown causes and is not called forth by the action of external stimuli the word is often used in a broad sense in the phrase nutational movement to include all the movements in plants caused by growth in contrast to variation movements or movements produced by reversible turgor changes simple nutation occurs in dorsiventral organs such as flat leaves both foliage and floral the movements are only in one plane depending upon the unequal growth of the opposite sides when young the growth of the foliage leaves is most rapid upon their outer dorsal face in consequence of which the leaf applies itself to the axis arches over the apex and with its neighbors forms a compact bud later growth becomes more rapid on the inner ventral face the bud opens and the leaves straighten out similar inequality of growth but more sharply localized leads to the folding and rolling of the leaf in the bud like movements of radial organs such as stems cylindrical leaves and roots have

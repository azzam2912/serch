il 23 is produced by dendritic cells and macrophages interleukin 23 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of an il 12p40 subunit that is shared with il 12 and the il 23p19 subunit a functional receptor for il 23 the il 23 receptor has been identified and is composed of il 12r 1 and il 23r il 23 is an important part of the inflammatory response against infection it promotes upregulation of the matrix metalloprotease mmp9 increases angiogenesis and reduces cd8 t cell infiltration into tumours il 23 mediates its effects on both innate and adaptive arms of the immune system that express the il 23 receptor t17 cells represent the most prominent t cell subset that responds to il 23 although il 23 has been implicated in inhibiting the development of regulatory t cell development in the intestine t17 cells produce il 17 a proinflammatory cytokine that enhances t cell priming and stimulates the production of other proinflammatory molecules such as il 1 il 6 tnf alpha nos 2 and chemokines resulting in inflammation the expression of il23a is decreased after ahr knockdown in thp 1 cells and primary mouse macrophages knockout mice deficient in either p40 or p19 or

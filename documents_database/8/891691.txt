this was partly due to the scarcity of high quality silk strings and partly due to the newer strings greater durability and louder tone silk strings are made by gathering a prescribed number of strands of silk thread then twisting them tightly together the twisted cord of strings is then wrapped around a frame and immersed in a vat of liquid composed of a special mixture of natural glue ingredients include bletilla striata and isinglass that binds the strands together the strings is taken out and left to dry before being cut into the appropriate length the top thicker strings i e strings one to four are further wrapped in a thin silk thread coiled around the core to make it smoother according to ancient manuals there are three distinctive gauges of thickness that one can make the strings the first is taigu great antiquity which is the standard gauge the zhongqing middle clarity is thinner whilst the jiazhong added thickness is thicker according to the yugu zhai qinpu zhongqing is the best however these three gauges have practical relevance as thinner strings sound better on thicker instruments and vice versa compensating for the thickness of the instrument and thus

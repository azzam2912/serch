the noun triviality usually refers to a simple technical aspect of some proof or definition the origin of the term in mathematical language comes from the medieval trivium curriculum the antonym nontrivial is commonly used by mathematicians to indicate a statement or theorem that is not obvious or easy to prove in mathematics the term trivial is frequently used for objects for examples groups or topological spaces that have a very simple structure examples are as follows trivial can also be used to describe solutions to an equation that have a very simple structure but for the sake of completeness cannot be omitted these solutions are called the trivial solutions for example consider the differential equation where y f x is a function whose derivative is y the trivial solution is while a nontrivial solution is the differential equation formula 4 with boundary conditions formula 5 is important in math and physics for example describing a particle in a box in quantum mechanics or standing waves on a string it always has the solution formula 6 this solution is considered obvious and is called the trivial solution in some cases there may be other solutions sinusoids which are called nontrivial

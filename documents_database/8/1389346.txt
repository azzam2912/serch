oil recycling also benefits the environment increased opportunities for consumers to recycle oil lessens the likelihood of used oil being dumped on lands and in waterways for example one gallon of motor oil dumped into waterways has the potential to pollute one million gallons of water recycled motor oil can be combusted as fuel usually in plant boilers space heaters or industrial heating applications such as blast furnaces and cement kilns when used motor oil is burned as fuel it must be burned at high temperatures to avoid gaseous pollution alternatively waste motor oil can be distilled into diesel fuel or marine fuel in a process similar to oil re refining but without the final hydrotreating process the lubrication properties of motor oil persist even in used oil and it can be recycled indefinitely used oil re refining is the process of restoring used oil to new oil by removing chemical impurities heavy metals and dirt used industrial and automotive oil is recycled at re refineries the used oil is first tested to determine suitability for re refining after which it is dehydrated and the water distillate is treated before being released into the environment dehydrating also removes the residual

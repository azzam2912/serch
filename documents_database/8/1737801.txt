it was circumscribed by paul f cannon in 1994 for a group of grass associated fungi centered on magnaporthe nakataea magnaporthaceae have a harpophora like asexual morphology and are often associated with roots of grasses or cereals important pathogens from the magnaporthaceae include nakataea oryzae gaeumannomyces graminis magnaporthiopsis poae and magnaporthe rhizophila type genus nakataea hara magnaporthe r a krause r k webster type species nakataea oryzae catt j luo n zhang magnaporthaceae that reproduce sexually have perithecial ascomata that are immersed in host tissue frequently with long necks asci are cylindrical and stain positive in meltzer s reagent ascospores are curved to sigmoid and contain septa they show variability in their morphology and can be filiform gaeumannomyces or fusiform nakataea magnaporthe the colour of ascospores is hyaline to olivaceous asexual morphs have hyaline to pale brown conidia which are septate to aseptate straight or curved and variable in shape magnaporthaceae used to be the only family within the order magnaporthales which are closely related to the orders diaporthales and ophiostomatales phylogenetic analysis showed that three clear clades could be distinguished within the magnaporthales the magnaporthaceae are sister to pyriculariaceae and ophioceraceae the family magnaporthaceae was originally described with six

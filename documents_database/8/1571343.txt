only one was produced but this machine continues to fly in a research program into laminar flow over wings the leichflugtechnik union lfu was a consortium formed by the b lkow p tzer and rhein flugzeugbau companies specifically to produce an aircraft built entirely of glass reinforced plastic grp the result the lfu 205 was one of the first all grp light aircraft the lfu 205 is a single engined low winged monoplane of conventional appearance apart from slight 7 forward sweep on the moderately tapered wing this carries fowler flaps along the whole trailing edge inboard of the frise ailerons the tail surfaces are also straight tapered with the vertical surfaces slightly swept the tailplane is a single piece all moving surface there are two pairs of side by side seats under a large curved rearward sliding canopy fuselage and flying surfaces are monocoque structures using a grp sandwich with a smooth outer surface bonded to a corrugated inner skin the latter formed from parallel 10 mm 0 4 in tubes wrapped in glass fibre the corrugations run chordwise rib like in the wings and tail and circumferentially in the fuselage the tail structures have a foam plastic core

the ppv and npv describe the performance of a diagnostic test or other statistical measure a high result can be interpreted as indicating the accuracy of such a statistic the ppv and npv are not intrinsic to the test they depend also on the prevalence the ppv can be derived using bayes theorem although sometimes used synonymously a positive predictive value generally refers to what is established by control groups while a post test probability refers to a probability for an individual still if the individual s pre test probability of the target condition is the same as the prevalence in the control group used to establish the positive predictive value the two are numerically equal in information retrieval the ppv statistic is often called the precision the positive predictive value ppv is defined as where a true positive is the event that the test makes a positive prediction and the subject has a positive result under the gold standard and a false positive is the event that the test makes a positive prediction and the subject has a negative result under the gold standard the ideal value of the ppv with a perfect test is 1 100 and the

williams in 1985 in the study of premixed turbulent combustion the equation is derived based on the level set method the equation was studied by george h markstein earlier in a restrictive form the g equation reads as where the flame location is given by formula 5 which can be defined arbitrarily such that formula 6 is the region of burnt gas and formula 7 is the region of unburnt gas the normal vector to the flame is formula 8 the burning velocity of the stretched flame can be derived by subtracting suitable terms from the unstretched flame speed for small curvature and small strain as given by where the g equation has an exact expression for a simple slot burner consider a two dimensional planar slot burner of slot width formula 16 with a premixed reactant mixture is fed through the slot with constant velocity formula 17 where the coordinate formula 18 is chosen such that formula 19 lies at the center of the slot and formula 20 lies at the location of the mouth of the slot when the mixture is ignited a flame develops from the mouth of the slot to certain height formula 21 with a

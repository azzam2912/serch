granville 530 u s 57 2000 is a case in which the supreme court of the united states citing a constitutional right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children struck down a washington state law that allowed any third party to petition state courts for child visitation rights over parental objections the court held that the interest of parents in the care custody and control of their children is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this court that fundamental right is implicated in grandparent visitation cases and as such it struck down the washington visitation statute because it unconstitutionally infringed on the right state courts considering non parent visitation petitions must apply a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children troxel requires that state courts must give special weight to a fit parent s decision to deny non parent visitation as well as other decisions made by a parent regarding the care and custody of their children the plurality held that choices parents make about the upbringing of children are among associational rights sheltered by the fourteenth amendment against the state s unwarranted usurpation disregard or disrespect this principle

it is found as an accessory pigment in the chloroplasts of brown algae and most other heterokonts giving them a brown or olive green color fucoxanthin absorbs light primarily in the blue green to yellow green part of the visible spectrum peaking at around 510 525 nm by various estimates and absorbing significantly in the range of 450 to 540 nm carotenoids are pigments produced by plants and algae and play a role in light harvesting as part of the photosynthesis process xanthophylls are a subset of carotenoids identified by the fact that they are oxygenated either as hydroxyl groups or as epoxide bridges this makes them more water soluble than carotenes like beta carotene fucoxanthin is a xanthophyll that contributes more than 10 of the estimated total production of carotenoids in nature it is an accessory pigment found in the chloroplasts of many brown macroalgae such as fucus spp and the golden brown unicellular microalgae the diatoms it absorbs blue and green light at bandwidth 450 540 nm imparting a brownish olive color to algae fucoxanthin has a highly unique structure that contains both an epoxide bond and hydroxyl groups along with an allenic bond carbon carbon double bond

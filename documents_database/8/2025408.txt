the experiment is based on the size constancy besides localization and recognition there is another function of our sensory system the size of the objects remain constant in spite of the changes of the image perceived our retina thanks to evolution we experience the objects as they really are and not as our eyes perceives them we usually perceive object as being relatively constant irrespective of the light conditions our point of view or the distance between the object and us our cars do not seem to be bigger even if we are approaching them their form do not become more distorted their colour does not change even if we apply artificial lighting this phenomenon is called perceptual constancy the most studied constancy is the size constancy or the phenomenon as when we perceive the constant size of the objects independently to their distance as an object moves farther away their perceived size usually does not decrease as we are looking at them hold a coin in front of you 30 centimeters away from you and then move it at arm s length does the coin seem smaller obviously not but the size of the retinal image of the coin

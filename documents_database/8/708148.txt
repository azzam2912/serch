urocortin ii is a 38 amino acid peptide that is a member of the crf family of peptides unlike urocortin i urocortin ii is highly selective for the crf2 receptor and does not show affinity for the crf binding protein urocortin ucn ii also known as stresscopin related peptide is a 38 amino acid member of the mammalian corticotropin releasing hormone crh peptide family which also includes crh ucn i and ucn iii crh mainly binds to type 1 crh receptors crh1 while ucn ii and iii bind primarily to type 2 crh receptors and ucn i binds to both crh2 each of these hormones has distinctive distribution patterns in the central nervous system and the periphery suggesting each peptide may have distinct behavioral and physiological effects although all have been associated with anxiety in general agonism of crh1 receptors is posited to be anxiogenic and agonism of crh2 receptors is posited to be anxiolytic urocortin ii has been shown to have anorexigenic effects and hypotensive effects similar to urocortin but does not induce secretion of acth the activation of camp pka by ucn2 gives similar effects to the adrenergic pathway ucn2 increases left ventricular function independent of the adrenergic

the project searched particularly for gas giants with short orbits around metal rich stars to find how the metallicity of the star and the mass of the planet are related radial velocity observations had been taken by the n2k program using the magellan telescopes magellan inamori kyocera echelle spectrograph mike at las campanas observatory in chile since 2004 based on these observations the stars hd 154672 and hd 205739 were among those flagged as potential planetary host stars the two stars were identified originally as having short orbit hot jupiter planets but 3 5 years of additional observations revealed that the planetary candidates orbits were far longer than initially anticipated hd 154672 b s discovery was reported in the astronomical journal by the american astronomical society appearing in the journal on october 7 2008 alongside the planet hd 205739 b the two planets were the first to be discovered by the n2k program that worked out of the magellan telescopes hd 154672 b was later observed by a different team of astronomers investigating the role of metallicity or the amount of metal present in a star in the formation of planets six radial velocity measurements of the host star collected

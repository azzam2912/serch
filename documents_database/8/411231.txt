these sequences are derived from dna fragments of bacteriophages that have previously infected the prokaryote and are used to detect and destroy dna from similar phages during subsequent infections hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral i e anti phage defense system of prokaryotes cas9 or crispr associated protein 9 is an enzyme that uses crispr sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of dna that are complementary to the crispr sequence cas9 enzymes together with crispr sequences form the basis of a technology known as crispr cas9 that can be used to edit genes within organisms this editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research development of biotechnology products and treatment of diseases the crispr cas system is a prokaryotic immune system that confers resistance to foreign genetic elements such as those present within plasmids and phages that provides a form of acquired immunity rna harboring the spacer sequence helps cas crispr associated proteins recognize and cut foreign pathogenic dna other rna guided cas proteins cut foreign rna crispr are found in approximately 50 of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90 of sequenced archaea the discovery of clustered dna

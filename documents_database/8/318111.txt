in this way they bring about an integration between the nervous system and the endocrine system a process known as neuroendocrine integration an example of a neuroendocrine cell is a cell of the adrenal medulla innermost part of the adrenal gland which releases adrenaline to the blood the adrenal medullary cells are controlled by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system these cells are modified postganglionic neurons autonomic nerve fibers lead directly to them from the central nervous system the adrenal medullary hormones are kept in vesicles much in the same way neurotransmitters are kept in neuronal vesicles hormonal effects can last up to ten times longer than those of neurotransmitters sympathetic nerve fiber impulses stimulate the release of adrenal medullary hormones in this way the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system and the medullary secretions function together the major center of neuroendocrine integration in the body is found in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland here hypothalamic neurosecretory cells release factors to the blood some of these factors releasing hormones released at the hypothalamic median eminence control the secretion of pituitary hormones while others the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin are released directly into the blood apud cells

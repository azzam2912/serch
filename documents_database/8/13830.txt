scalars are often taken to be real numbers but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers rational numbers or generally any field the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements called axioms listed below in for specifying that the scalars are real or complex numbers the terms real vector space and complex vector space are often used euclidean vectors are an example of a vector space they represent physical quantities such as forces any two forces of the same type can be added to yield a third and the multiplication of a force vector by a real multiplier is another force vector in the same vein but in a more geometric sense vectors representing displacements in the plane or in three dimensional space also form vector spaces vectors in vector spaces do not necessarily have to be arrow like objects as they appear in the mentioned examples vectors are regarded as abstract mathematical objects with particular properties which in some cases can be visualized as arrows vector spaces are the subject of linear algebra and are well characterized by their dimension which roughly speaking specifies the number of independent directions in the

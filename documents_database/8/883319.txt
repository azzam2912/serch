modern hard disk drives come with 8 to 256 mib of such memory and solid state drives come with up to 4 gb of cache memory since the late 1980s nearly all disks sold have embedded microcontrollers and either an ata serial ata scsi or fibre channel interface the drive circuitry usually has a small amount of memory used to store the data going to and coming from the disk platters the disk buffer is physically distinct from and is used differently from the page cache typically kept by the operating system in the computer s main memory the disk buffer is controlled by the microcontroller in the hard disk drive and the page cache is controlled by the computer to which that disk is attached the disk buffer is usually quite small ranging between 8 and 256 mib and the page cache is generally all unused main memory while data in the page cache is reused multiple times the data in the disk buffer is rarely reused in this sense the terms disk cache and cache buffer are misnomers the embedded controller s memory is more appropriately called disk buffer note that disk array controllers as opposed to disk

the microdisplays are used in near to eye nte applications for the military training and simulation medical imagery virtual reality and high definition image processing industries the slms are used for structured light projection in 3d optical metrology and 3d super resolution microscopy headquartered in dalgety bay scotland forthdd also operates sales offices in the united states germany and japan and a customer support office in germany previously funded by venture capitalists in january 2011 forthdd was acquired by kopin corporation a nasdaq listed company based in taunton massachusetts usa forthdd s microdisplays and slms are based on a proprietary high speed ferroelectric liquid crystal on silicon lcos platform protected by a number of patents for the generation of colour and greyscale forthdd s microdisplays use a process called time domain imaging tdi this process involves rendering the red green and blue colour components which make up an image sequentially over time at high speed this happens so fast that the human visual system integrates the components into a single full colour image this enables the microdisplays to use the same pixel mirror for all three colour components and avoids the artifacts associated with sub pixels lcos technology history the

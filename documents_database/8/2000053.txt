it has a maximum magnitude of 8 342 too faint to be seen with the unaided eye varying by 0 0342 of a magnitude over roughly 23 hours it has been classified as a by draconis variable and is one of the closest and hence brightest pre main sequence stars to earth based upon an annual parallax shift of 19 42 0 98 milliarcseconds as measured by the hipparcos satellite this system is from earth with a margin of error of pz telescopii has an effective surface temperature of around 5338 k the sun has an approximate surface temperature of 5778 k a mass around 1 13 times and diameter 1 23 times that of the sun it has a debris disk calculated to span from a radius of 35 to 165 astronomical units au as well as a substellar companion with 36 times the mass of jupiter orbiting at a distance of 16 au discovered in 2008 the companion currently known as pz tel b is thought to be a brown dwarf however it is possible though very unlikely that it is an extremely large jupiter like planet in which case it would be pz tel b and the

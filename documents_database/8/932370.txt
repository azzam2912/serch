the problem was posed by robert p dilworth and for many years it was one of the most famous and long standing open problems in lattice theory it had a deep impact on the development of lattice theory itself the conjecture that every distributive lattice is a congruence lattice is true for all distributive lattices with at most compact elements but f wehrung provided a counterexample for distributive lattices with compact elements using a construction based on kuratowski s free set theorem we denote by con a the congruence lattice of an algebra a that is the lattice of all congruences of a under inclusion the following is a universal algebraic triviality it says that for a congruence being finitely generated is a lattice theoretical property lemma a congruence of an algebra a is finitely generated if and only if it is a compact element of con a as every congruence of an algebra is the join of the finitely generated congruences below it e g every submodule of a module is the union of all its finitely generated submodules we obtain the following result first published by birkhoff and frink in 1948 theorem birkhoff and frink 1948 the congruence

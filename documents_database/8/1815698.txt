with a main tuning control that covered a wide range of frequencies for example 10 14 megahertz in a few turns of the tuning knob a very small motion might change the tuning by tens of kilohertz and would make accurate tuning to any particular frequency difficult a calibrated bandspread tuning control allows the main tuning to be set to a predefined spot on the control and the bandspread allows tuning of a particular frequency within some restricted range of the main tuning control one method of adding a bandspread control was to put a relatively small value variable tuning capacitor and dial directly in parallel with the main tuning variable capacitor or connected to a tap on the coil of the tuned circuit the smaller capacitor would have much less effect on the resonant frequency than the main capacitor allowing fine discrimination of the tuned frequency a second method mechanical bandspread was a second tuning knob connected through a gear train to the main tuning knob each turn of the bandspread dial moved the main dial through a small part of its range improving the precision of tuning bandspread controls were found on communications receivers amateur radio receivers and

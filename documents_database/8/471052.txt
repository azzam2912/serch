it allowed raf night fighters to attack their german counterparts disrupting their attempts to attack the raf s bomber force the first serrate systems were developed from the ai mk iv radar systems which just happened to have antennas almost perfectly suited to receiving the lichtenstein signals serrate simply disconnected the display from its own transmitter and receiver and connected it to one tuned to the lichtenstein this produced a display indicating the direction to the german aircraft but not the range when the operator felt the range to be suitable the display was reconnected to the mk iv s own electronics to provide both ranging and directional information during the last moments of the attack serrate operations began by no 141 squadron raf on the night of 7 september 1943 179 operational sorties yielded 14 claimed fighters shot down for 3 losses after that point the luftwaffe realized what was happening and quickly introduced new versions of their radars working on different frequencies unlike the earlier sets which just happened to operate on frequencies very close to the british radars the new sets required entirely new detectors which took some time to develop new versions of serrate were introduced

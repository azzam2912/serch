like other members of this order p pacifica is a rod shaped gram negative bacterium that can move by gliding and can form aggregates of cells called fruiting bodies the species was first described in 2003 based on two strains isolated from samples collected from the pacific coast of japan p pacifica cells are straight rod shaped and have blunt ends like other myxobacteria groups of cells can form round fruiting bodies the species is an obligate aerobe and a chemoorganotroph cells are motile and move by gliding the species is mesophilic and grew best under laboratory conditions in a temperature range of 15 32c a neutral to slightly basic ph and salinity similar to that of seawater making it slightly halophilic p pacifica cells require sodium to grow as expected for marine bacteria p pacifica is the type species and only member of the genus plesiocystis both first described in the same 2003 study based on comparisons of the p pacifica 16s rrna genetic sequence to those of other similar organisms it is most closely related to bacteria of the genus nannocystis specifically nannocystis exedens the genus name plesiocystis derives from the greek words plesion neighbor and cystis bladder

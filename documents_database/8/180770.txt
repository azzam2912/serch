the trunk is the most important part of the tree for timber production trunks occur both in true woody plants as well as non woody plants such as palms and other monocots though the internal physiology is different in each case in all plants trunks thicken over time due to formation of secondary growth or in monocots pseudo secondary growth trunks can be vulnerable to damage including sunburn trunks which are cut down in logging are generally called logs and if cut to a specific length bolts the term log is informally used in english to describe any felled trunk not rooted in the ground a stump is the part of a trunk remaining in the ground after the tree has been felled the trunk consists of five main parts the bark inner bark cambium sapwood and heartwood from the outside of the tree working in the first layer is the bark this is the protective outermost layer of the trunk under this is the inner bark which is made of the phloem the phloem is how the tree transports nutrients from the roots to the shoots and vice versa the next layer is the cambium a very thin layer

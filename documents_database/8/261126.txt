the primary active component is calcium carbonate additional chemicals vary depending on the mineral source and may include calcium oxide unlike the types of lime called quicklime calcium oxide and slaked lime calcium hydroxide powdered limestone does not require lime burning in a lime kiln it only requires milling the effects of agricultural lime on soil are lime may occur naturally in some soils but may require addition of sulfuric acid for its agricultural benefits to be realized gypsum is also used to supply calcium for plant nutrition the concept of corrected lime potential to define the degree of base saturation in soils became the basis for procedures now used in soil testing laboratories to determine the lime requirement of soils other forms of lime have common applications in agriculture and gardening including dolomitic lime and hydrated lime dolomitic lime may be used as a soil input to provide similar effects as agricultural lime while supplying magnesium in addition to calcium in livestock farming hydrated lime can be used as a disinfectant measure producing a dry and alkaline environment in which bacteria do not readily multiply in horticultural farming it can be used as an insect repellent without causing harm

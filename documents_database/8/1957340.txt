the two authors argue the case for outer space being the main source for these pathogens or at least their causative agents the claim connecting terrestrial disease and extraterrestrial pathogens was rejected by the scientific community fred hoyle and chandra wickramasinghe spent over 20 years investigating the nature and composition of interstellar dust though many hypotheses regarding this dust had been postulated by various astronomers since the middle of the 19th century all were found to be wanting as and when new data on the gas and dust clouds became available probably polymers chandra wickramasinghe proposed the existence of polymeric composition based on the molecule formaldehyde hco in 1974 wickramasinghe first proposed the hypothesis that some dust in interstellar space was largely organic containing carbon and nitrogen and followed this up with other research confirming the hypothesis wickramasinghe also proposed and confirmed the existence of polymeric compounds based on the molecule formaldehyde hco fred hoyle and wickramasinghe later proposed the identification of bicyclic aromatic compounds from an analysis of the ultraviolet extinction absorption at 2175a thus demonstrating the existence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in space hoyle and wickramasinghe went further and speculated that the overall spectroscopic data of cosmic

it is also sometimes referred to as the self energy of the gauge boson photon after developments in radar equipment for world war ii resulted in higher accuracy for measuring the energy levels of the hydrogen atom i i rabi made measurements of the lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron these effects corresponded to the deviation from the dirac equation predicted value of two of the spectroscopic electron g factor values later hans bethe theoretically calculated those shifts in the hydrogen energy levels due to vacuum polarization on his return train ride from the shelter island conference to cornell the effects of vacuum polarization have been routinely observed experimentally since then as very well understood background effects vacuum polarization referred to below as the one loop contribution occurs with leptons electron positron pairs or quarks the former leptons first observed in 1940s but also more recently observed in 1997 using the tristan particle accelerator in japan the latter quarks along with multiple quark gluon loop contributions from the early 1970s to mid 1990s using the vepp 2m particle accelerator at the budker institute of nuclear physics in siberia in russia and many other accelerator laboratories

the resonance is disturbed by the addition or removal of a small mass due to oxide growth decay or film deposition at the surface of the acoustic resonator the qcm can be used under vacuum in gas phase gas sensor first use described by king and more recently in liquid environments it is useful for monitoring the rate of deposition in thin film deposition systems under vacuum in liquid it is highly effective at determining the affinity of molecules proteins in particular to surfaces functionalized with recognition sites larger entities such as viruses or polymers are investigated as well qcm has also been used to investigate interactions between biomolecules frequency measurements are easily made to high precision discussed below hence it is easy to measure mass densities down to a level of below 1 g cm in addition to measuring the frequency the dissipation factor equivalent to the resonance bandwidth is often measured to help analysis the dissipation factor is the inverse quality factor of the resonance q w f see below it quantifies the damping in the system and is related to the sample s viscoelastic properties quartz is one member of a family of crystals that experience the

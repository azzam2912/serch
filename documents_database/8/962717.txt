the result is named after the hungarian mathematicians andr s pr kopa and l szl leindler let 0 negative real valued measurable functions defined on n dimensional euclidean space r suppose that these functions satisfy for all x and y in r then recall that the essential supremum of a measurable function f r r is defined by this notation allows the following essential form of the pr kopa leindler inequality let 0 absolutely integrable functions let then s is measurable and the essential supremum form was given in its use can change the left side of the inequality for example a function g that takes the value 1 at exactly one point will not usually yield a zero left side in the non essential sup form but it will always yield a zero left side in the essential sup form it can be shown that the usual pr kopa leindler inequality implies the brunn minkowski inequality in the following form if 0 bounded measurable subsets of r such that the minkowski sum 1 a b is also measurable then where denotes n dimensional lebesgue measure hence the pr kopa leindler inequality can also be used to prove the brunn

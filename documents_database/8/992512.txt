quillen adjunctions are named in honor of the mathematician daniel quillen given two closed model categories c and d a quillen adjunction is a pair of adjoint functors with f left adjoint to g such that f preserves cofibrations and trivial cofibrations or equivalently by the closed model axioms such that g preserves fibrations and trivial fibrations in such an adjunction f is called the left quillen functor and g is called the right quillen functor it is a consequence of the axioms that a left right quillen functor preserves weak equivalences between cofibrant fibrant objects the total derived functor theorem of quillen says that the total left derived functor is a left adjoint to the total right derived functor this adjunction lf rg is called the derived adjunction if f g is a quillen adjunction as above such that with c cofibrant and d fibrant is a weak equivalence in d if and only if is a weak equivalence in c then it is called a quillen equivalence of the closed model categories c and d in this case the derived adjunction is an adjoint equivalence of categories so that is an isomorphism in ho d if and only

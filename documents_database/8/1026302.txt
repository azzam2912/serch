for certain problems where the output size varies widely for example from linear in the size of the input to quadratic in the size of the input analyses that take the output size explicitly into account can produce better runtime bounds that differentiate algorithms that would otherwise have identical asymptotic complexity a simple example of an output sensitive algorithm is given by the division algorithm division by subtraction which computes the quotient and remainder of dividing two positive integers using only addition subtraction and comparisons this algorithm takes q time and so can be fast in scenarios where the quotient q is known to be small in cases where q is large however it is outperformed by more complex algorithms such as long division convex hull algorithms for finding the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane require n log n time for n points even relatively simple algorithms like the graham scan achieve this lower bound if the convex hull uses all n points this is the best we can do however for many practical sets of points and in particular for random sets of points the number of points h in the convex hull

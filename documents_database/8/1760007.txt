a vntr is a variable number tandem repeat this method is well known in forensic science since it is the basis of dna fingerprinting in humans when applied to bacteria it contributes to forensic microbiology through which the source of a particular strain might eventually be traced back making it a useful technique for outbreak surveillance in a typical mlva a number of well selected and characterised in terms of mutation rate and diversity loci are amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr so that the size of each locus can be measured usually by electrophoresis of the amplification products together with reference dna fragments a so called dna size marker different electrophoresis equipment can be used depending on the required size estimate accuracy and the local laboratory set up from basic agarose gel electrophoresis up to the more sophisticated and high throughput capillary electrophoresis devices from this size estimate the number of repeat units at each locus can be deduced the resulting information is a code which can be easily compared to reference databases once the assay has been harmonised and standardised mlva has become a major first line typing tool in a number of pathogens where such an harmonisation

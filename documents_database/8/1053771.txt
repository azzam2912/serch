this parasite is most common in the middle east and has a wide host range including many economically important crops selective control of egyptian broomrape is extremely difficult because the close association between host crop and parasite limits the use of most mechanical and herbicidal approaches a single egyptian broomrape plant is capable of producing hundreds of thousands of extremely small 0 15 0 5 mm long seeds these seeds dispersed by the wind animals or by more artificial means such as farm machinery survive in the soil and have the ability to remain viable in the soil for more than 15 years when the seeds are dropped they are dormant they require after ripening or further ripening after the seed has fallen from the plant which is completed by the time the dry season has ended as the rainy season begins the seeds imbibe water and move into a conditioning phase which lasts 1 3 weeks depending on whether the temperature remains optimal between 60 and 70 f at this point the seeds only need a chemical signal from the roots of a host plant to germinate the seeds can remain in this conditioned state for several months if

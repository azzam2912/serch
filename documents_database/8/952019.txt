the dual polytope is an 8 hypercube or octeract this configuration matrix represents the 8 orthoplex the rows and columns correspond to vertices edges faces cells 4 faces 5 faces 6 faces and 7 faces the diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole 8 orthoplex the nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column s element occur in or at the row s element formula 1 the diagonal f vector numbers are derived through the wythoff construction dividing the full group order of a subgroup order by removing individual mirrors there are two coxeter groups associated with the 8 cube one regular dual of the octeract with the c or 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 symmetry group and a half symmetry with two copies of 7 simplex facets alternating with the d or 3 symmetry group a lowest symmetry construction is based on a dual of an 8 orthotope called an 8 fusil cartesian coordinates for the vertices of an 8 cube centered at the origin are every vertex pair is connected by an edge except opposites it is used in its alternated form 5 with the 8 simplex to form the 5

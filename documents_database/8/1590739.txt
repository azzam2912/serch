erebine moths are found on all continents except antarctica but reach their greatest diversity in the tropics while the exact number of species belonging to the erebinae is not known the subfamily is estimated to include around 10 000 species some well known erebinae include underwing moths catocala and witch moths thermesiini many of the species in the subfamily have medium to large wingspans 7 to 10 cm 3 to 4 inches up to nearly 30 cm in the white witch moth thysania agrippina which has the widest wingspan of all lepidoptera erebine caterpillars feed on a broad range of plants many species feed on grasses and legumes and a few are pests of castor bean sugarcane rice as well as pistachios and blackberries erebine moths possess a number of adaptations for predator defense most erebinae such as zale have mottled drably colored hindwings to better blend in with grass and tree trunks in some erebinae such as catocala cryptically colored forewings conceal brightly colored hindwings which are suddenly revealed when the moth is disturbed from rest the sudden exposure of these bright colors is thought to startle vertebrate predators giving the moths extra time to escape like other noctuoidea

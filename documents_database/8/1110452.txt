increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word for example consider a case where an 8 bit processor must add two 16 bit integers the processor must first add the 8 lower order bits from each integer then add the 8 higher order bits requiring two instructions to complete a single operation a 16 bit processor would be able to complete the operation with single instruction originally all electronic computers were serial single bit computers the first electronic computer that was not a serial computer the first bit parallel computer was the 16 bit whirlwind from 1951 from the advent of very large scale integration vlsi computer chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986 advancements in computer architecture were done by increasing bit level parallelism as 4 bit microprocessors were replaced by 8 bit then 16 bit then 32 bit microprocessors this trend generally came to an end with the introduction of 32 bit processors which were a standard in general purpose computing for two decades 64 bit architectures were introduced to the mainstream with

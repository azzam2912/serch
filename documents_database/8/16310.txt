prominent multiplexing methods of the carrier signal are time division multiplexing tdm and frequency division multiplexing fdm a cable television system is an example of frequency division multiplexing many television programs are carried simultaneously on the same coaxial cable by sending each at a different frequency multiple layers of multiplexing may ultimately be performed upon a given input signal for example in the public switched telephone network many telephone calls are sent over shared trunk lines by time division multiplexing for long distance calls several of these channels may be sent over a communications satellite link by frequency division multiplexing at a given receiving node specific channels may be demultiplexed individually the purpose of carrier systems is to save money by carrying more traffic on less infrastructure 19th century telephone systems operating at baseband could only carry one telephone call on each wire hence routes with heavy traffic needed many wires in the 1920s frequency division multiplexing could carry several circuits on the same balanced wires and by the 1930s l carrier and similar systems carried hundreds of calls at a time on coaxial cables capacity of these systems increased in the middle of the century while in the 1950s

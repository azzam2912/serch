at a very basic level hydraulics is the liquid counterpart of pneumatics which concerns gases fluid mechanics provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics which focuses on the applied engineering using the properties of fluids in its fluid power applications hydraulics is used for the generation control and transmission of power by the use of pressurized liquids hydraulic topics range through some parts of science and most of engineering modules and cover concepts such as pipe flow dam design fluidics and fluid control circuitry the principles of hydraulics are in use naturally in the human body within the vascular system and erectile tissue free surface hydraulics is the branch of hydraulics dealing with free surface flow such as occurring in rivers canals lakes estuaries and seas its sub field open channel flow studies the flow in open channels the word hydraulics originates from the greek word hydraulikos which in turn originates from hydor greek for water and aulos meaning pipe early uses of water power date back to mesopotamia and ancient egypt where irrigation has been used since the 6th millennium bc and water clocks had been used since the early 2nd millennium bc other early examples of water power include

a root of degree 2 is called a square root and a root of degree 3 a cube root roots of higher degree are referred by using ordinal numbers as in fourth root twentieth root etc the computation of a th root is a root extraction for example any non zero number considered as a complex number has different complex th roots including the real ones at most two the th root of 0 is zero for all positive integers since in particular if is even and is a positive real number one of its th roots is real and positive one is negative and the others when are non real complex numbers if is even and is a negative real number none of the th roots is real if is odd and is real one th root is real and has the same sign as while the other roots are not real finally if is not real then none of its th roots is real roots of real numbers are usually written using the radical symbol or radix with formula 2 denoting the positive square root of if is positive and formula 3 denoting the real th root if

usually cobalt sulfate refers to the hydrate coso7ho which is one of the most commonly available salts of cobalt cobalt ii sulfate heptahydrate appears as red monoclinic crystals that liquify around 100 c and become anhydrous at 250 c it is soluble in water slightly soluble in ethanol and especially soluble in methanol the salts are paramagnetic it forms by the reaction of metallic cobalt its oxide hydroxide or carbonate with aqueous sulfuric acid the hexahydrate is a metal aquo complex consisting of octahedral co ho ions associated with sulfate anions cobalt is obtained from ores via the sulfate in many cases hydrated cobalt ii sulfate is used in the preparation of pigments as well as in the manufacture of other cobalt salts cobalt pigment is used in porcelains and glass cobalt ii sulfate is used in storage batteries and electroplating baths sympathetic inks and as an additive to soils and animal feeds for these purposes the cobalt sulfate is produced by treating cobalt oxide with sulfuric acid cobalt is essential for most higher forms of life but more than a few milligrams each day is harmful rarely have poisonings resulted from cobalt compounds upon inhalation of salts there is

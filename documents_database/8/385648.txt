there are numerous methods for removing gases from liquids gases are removed for various reasons chemists remove gases from solvents when the compounds they are working on are possibly air or oxygen sensitive air free technique or when bubble formation at solid liquid interfaces becomes a problem the formation of gas bubbles when a liquid is frozen can also be undesirable necessitating degassing beforehand the solubility of gas obeys henry s law that is the amount of a dissolved gas in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure therefore placing a solution under reduced pressure makes the dissolved gas less soluble sonication and stirring under reduced pressure can usually enhance the efficiency this technique is often referred to as vacuum degasification specialized vacuum chambers called vacuum degassers are used to degas materials through pressure reduction generally speaking an aqueous solvent dissolves less gas at higher temperature and vice versa for organic solvents provided the solute and solvent do not react consequently heating an aqueous solution can expel dissolved gas whereas cooling an organic solution has the same effect ultrasonication and stirring during thermal regulation are also effective this method needs no special apparatus and is easy to conduct in

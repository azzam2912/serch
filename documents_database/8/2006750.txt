the centaur is characterized as a transparent overdrive meaning it adds gain to the signal without significantly altering the tone of the guitar about 8 000 units were built between 1994 and 2000 guitarists praised the clear uncolored tone of the boosted signal the circuit had unique characteristics most noticeably the use of an ic max1044 voltage converter the voltage converter drives 18 volts to the operational amplifier which is the core of the circuit at this voltage the response of the amplifier is different than at 9 volt since its slew rate depends on the voltage supply the higher the voltage supply the higher the order of harmonics the operational amplifier will generate and the more metallic the sound depending on the settings of the control knobs the pedal can act mostly as a clean boost adding mostly volume and minimal coloring to the sound this can be used to drive the input valve stage of the amplifier to use the characteristic distortion sound of an overdriven guitar amp alternatively or additionally the controls can be set to distort the sound signal in the pedal where two germanium diodes can perform waveform clipping see clipping audio the gain knob

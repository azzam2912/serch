virtual mechanical components such as springs ropes and motors are combined with objects in a 2d working space after the software is run the program will simulate the interaction of the model s parts and can also graph the movement and force on any element in the project it is useful for basic physics simulations and can be quite a powerful dynamic geometric analytical tool once you learn it one drawback is that the basic commands like those for pulley and rope simulations appear to be limited to the string through a hole type but such limitations are quickly overtaken using the internal formula and scripting features of the software wm was developed from a program called interactive physics the fundamental difference between the two is that wm will read dxf files which can be converted to objects inside wm and the way back therefore being the conversion of interactive physics to the engineering and industrial world the 3d version of working model is developed with the commercial name simwise motion also by design simulation technologies and works as a stand alone solution or an add on for cad products like autodesk inventor solidedge solidworks catia alibre design pro e

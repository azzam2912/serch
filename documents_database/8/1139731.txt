this gene was identified based on its homology to the gene encoding the ring3 brd2 protein a serine threonine kinase the gene localizes to 9q34 a region which contains several major histocompatibility complex mhc genes brd3 is a member of the bromodomain and extra terminal motif bet protein family like other bet family members it contains two tandem homologous bromodomains and an extra terminal motif brd3 similar to brd2 does not have a long c terminal domain as bet family proteins brd4 and brdt do like other bet protein family members brd3 associates with acetylated lysine residues on histones and transcription factors brd3 has been implicated in nucleosome remodeling in the context of transcription brd2 and brd3 perform overlapping cellular functions chromosomal translocation of brd3 with the nut gene has been implicated in nut midline carcinoma brd3 nut driven cancers are histopathologically indistinguishable from brd4 nut driven cancers likely because these translocations involve the n terminal portion bromodomain containing portion of these proteins which are highly conserved depletion of brd3 slows growth in cancer models including prostate cancer and medulloblastoma the effect of brd3 depletion is milder than that of other bet proteins brd2 and brd4 when each is tested

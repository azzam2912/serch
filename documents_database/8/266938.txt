partial skeletons of nine individuals have been recovered including one complete skull referred to as lb1 these remains have been the subject of intense research to determine whether they represent a species distinct from modern humans the dominant consensus is that these remains do represent a distinct species due to genetic and anatomical differences this hominin had originally been considered remarkable for its survival until relatively recent times only 12 000 years ago however more extensive stratigraphic and chronological work has pushed the dating of the most recent evidence of its existence back to 50 000 years ago the homo floresiensis skeletal material is now dated from 60 000 to 100 000 years ago stone tools recovered alongside the skeletal remains were from archaeological horizons ranging from 50 000 to 190 000 years ago fossil teeth and a partial jaw from hominins assumed to be ancestral to h floresiensis were discovered in 2014 and described in 2016 these remains are from a site on flores called mata menge about 74 km from liang bua they date to about 700 000 years ago and are even smaller than the later fossils the discoverers mike morwood et al 2004 proposed that a

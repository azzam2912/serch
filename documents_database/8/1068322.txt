it has been developed at inria france for several decades mostly by pierre boullier but has become free software since 2007 only syntax is distributed under the cecill license syntax handles most classes of deterministic unambiguous grammars lr lalr rlr as well as general context free grammars the deterministic version has been used in operational contexts e g ada and is currently used both in the domain of compilation the non deterministic features include an earley parser generator used for natural language processing parsers generated by syntax include powerful error recovery mechanisms and allow the execution of semantic actions and attribute evaluation on the abstract tree or on the shared parse forest the current version of syntax version 6 0 beta includes also parser generators for other formalisms used for natural language processing as well as bio informatics these formalisms are context sensitive formalisms tag rcg or formalisms that rely on context free grammars and are extended thanks to attribute evaluation in particular for natural language processing lfg a nice feature of syntax compared to lex yacc is its built in algorithm for automatically recovering from lexical and syntactic errors by deleting extra characters or tokens inserting missing characters or

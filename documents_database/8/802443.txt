these substitution models differ in terms of the parameters used to describe the rates at which one nucleotide replaces another during evolution these models are frequently used in molecular phylogenetic analyses in particular they are used during the calculation of likelihood of a tree in bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches to tree estimation and they are used to estimate the evolutionary distance between sequences from the observed differences between the sequences these models are phenomenological descriptions of the evolution of dna as a string of four discrete states these markov models do not explicitly depict the mechanism of mutation nor the action of natural selection rather they describe the relative rates of different changes for example mutational biases and purifying selection favoring conservative changes are probably both responsible for the relatively high rate of transitions compared to transversions in evolving sequences however the kimura k80 model described below only attempts to capture the effect of both forces in a parameter that reflects the relative rate of transitions to transversions evolutionary analyses of sequences are conducted on a wide variety of time scales thus it is convenient to express these models in terms of the instantaneous rates of change between different

ostwald ripening is generally found in water in oil emulsions while flocculation is found in oil in water emulsions this thermodynamically driven spontaneous process occurs because larger particles are more energetically favored than smaller particles this stems from the fact that molecules on the surface of a particle are energetically less stable than the ones in the interior consider a cubic crystal of atoms all the atoms inside are bonded to 6 neighbors and are quite stable but atoms on the surface are only bonded to 5 neighbors or fewer which makes these surface atoms less stable large particles are more energetically favorable since continuing with this example more atoms are bonded to 6 neighbors and fewer atoms are at the unfavorable surface as the system tries to lower its overall energy molecules on the surface of a small particle energetically unfavorable with only 3 or 4 or 5 bonded neighbors will tend to detach from the particle as per the kelvin equation and diffuse into the solution when all small particles do this it increases the concentration of free molecules in solution when the free molecules in solution are supersaturated the free molecules have a tendency to condense on

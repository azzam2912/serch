in the geometric setting it is a statement about the triviality of vector bundles on affine space the theorem states that every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free geometrically finitely generated projective modules over the ring formula 1 correspond to vector bundles over affine space formula 2 where free modules correspond to trivial vector bundles this correspondence from modules to algebraic vector bundles is given by the globalisation or twiddlification functor sending formula 3 cite hartshorne ii 5 page 110 affine space is topologically contractible so it admits no non trivial topological vector bundles a simple argument using the exponential exact sequence and the d bar poincar lemma shows that it also admits no non trivial holomorphic vector bundles jean pierre serre in his 1955 paper faisceaux alg briques coh rents remarked that the corresponding question was not known for algebraic vector bundles it is not known whether there exist projective a modules of finite type which are not free here formula 4 is a polynomial ring over a field that is formula 4 formula 6 to serre s dismay this problem quickly became known as serre s conjecture serre wrote i objected as often as

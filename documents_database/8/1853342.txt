macdonald is a theoretical condensed matter physicist and the sid w richardson foundation regents chair professor of physics at the university of texas at austin he completed a b s in physics at st francis xavier university in 1973 and his ph d at the university of toronto in 1978 he previously worked at the ottawa laboratory of the national research council of canada and indiana university macdonald s area of interest is on how electron electron interactions affect electronic properties in condensed matter systems he previously worked on density functional theory and the quantum hall effect and most recently has focused on the spin hall effect magnetic insulators magnetic semiconductors and spin orbit interactions in a 2011 paper he identified the possibility that the tunneling energy required for electrons to move between two graphene layers should shrink as the angle between the sheets approaches 1 1 degrees from each other a prediction that was subsequently proven to be true and has inspired investigations into twistronics at this angle bilayer graphene exhibits the property of superconductivity which could lead to more efficient electric power transmission levitating trains cheaper medical imaging mri and more powerful quantum computers macdonald s work has

it is also referred to as architecture or computer architecture a realization of an isa is called an implementation an isa permits multiple implementations that may vary in performance physical size and monetary cost among other things because the isa serves as the interface between software and hardware software that has been written for an isa can run on different implementations of the same isa this has enabled binary compatibility between different generations of computers to be easily achieved and the development of computer families both of these developments have helped to lower the cost of computers and to increase their applicability for these reasons the isa is one of the most important abstractions in computing today an isa defines everything a machine language programmer needs to know in order to program a computer what an isa defines differs between isas in general isas define the supported data types what state there is such as the main memory and registers and their semantics such as the memory consistency and addressing modes the instruction set the set of machine instructions that comprises a computer s machine language and the input output model an instruction set architecture is distinguished from a microarchitecture

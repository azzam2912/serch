it is intended to demonstrate a new nontoxic spacecraft propellant system methane and oxygen and an autonomous landing and hazard detection technology the prototype planetary lander is capable of autonomous flight including vertical takeoff and landings the vehicles are nasa designed robotic landers that will be able to land and take off with of cargo on the moon the prospect is an engine that runs reliably on propellants that are not only cheaper and safer here on earth but could also be potentially manufactured on the moon and mars see in situ resource utilization the alpha prototype lander was manufactured and assembled at nasa s johnson space center jsc and armadillo aerospace s facility near dallas the prototype lander is a spacecraft that is about in diameter weighs approximately and consists of four silver spherical propellant tanks topped by avionics boxes and a web of wires the project is trying out cost and time saving lean development engineering practices other project activities include appropriate ground operations flight operations range safety and the instigation of software development procedures landing pads and control centers were also constructed from the project start in july 2010 about 14 million was spent on materials in

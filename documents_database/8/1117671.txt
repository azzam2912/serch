sometime after its initial discovery the blt2 receptor was shown to bind and become activated by several other arachidonic acid metabolites one of which 12 hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid 12 hht has 10 to 100 fold higher affinity for it than does ltb4 12 hht fails to bind or activate blt1 receptors while blt2 receptors have some actions similar to blt1 receptors they have other actions which clearly oppose those of blt1 in regulating inflammation and allergic responses blt2 receptors also have actions that extend beyond those of blt1 receptors laboratory animal and other pre clinical studies suggest that blt2 receptors may be involved not only in inflammation and allergy but also in human cancer blt2 is a cell surface receptor that functions by recognizing binding and mediating responses to a particular set of messenger molecules or ligands these messenger ligands are any one of a range of structurally different arachidonic acid metabolites made and released by nearby cells to act as paracrine signals for coordinating responses between cells or autocrine signals for modulating their parent cells responses several years after their identification of a leukotriene b4 ltb4 receptor termed blt1 or bltr1 and encoded by the ltb4r1 gene shimizu and colleagues

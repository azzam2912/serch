in other words a bilinear form is a function that is linear in each argument separately the definition of a bilinear form can be extended to include modules over a ring with linear maps replaced by module homomorphisms when k is the field of complex numbers c one is often more interested in sesquilinear forms which are similar to bilinear forms but are conjugate linear in one argument let be an n dimensional vector space with basis define the matrix a by if the n 1 matrix x represents a vector v with respect to this basis and analogously y represents w then suppose is another basis for v such that where now the new matrix representation for the bilinear form is given by s as every bilinear form b on v defines a pair of linear maps from v to its dual space v define by this is often denoted as where the dot indicates the slot into which the argument for the resulting linear functional is to be placed see currying for a finite dimensional vector space v if either of b or b is an isomorphism then both are and the bilinear form b is said to

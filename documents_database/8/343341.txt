the method is often used in civil engineering hydrogeology or soil mechanics as a first check for problems of flow under hydraulic structures like dams or sheet pile walls as such a grid obtained by drawing a series of equipotential lines is called a flownet the flownet is an important tool in analysing two dimensional irrotational flow problems flow net technique is a graphical representation method the method consists of filling the flow area with stream and equipotential lines which are everywhere perpendicular to each other making a curvilinear grid typically there are two surfaces boundaries which are at constant values of potential or hydraulic head upstream and downstream ends and the other surfaces are no flow boundaries i e impermeable for example the bottom of the dam and the top of an impermeable bedrock layer which define the sides of the outermost streamtubes see figure 1 for a stereotypical flownet example mathematically the process of constructing a flownet consists of contouring the two harmonic or analytic functions of potential and stream function these functions both satisfy the laplace equation and the contour lines represent lines of constant head equipotentials and lines tangent to flowpaths streamlines together the potential function

it describes a kaleidoscopic construction each graph node represents a mirror domain facet and the label attached to a branch encodes the dihedral angle order between two mirrors on a domain ridge that is the amount by which the angle between the reflective planes can be multiplied by to get 180 degrees an unlabeled branch implicitly represents order 3 60 degrees each diagram represents a coxeter group and coxeter groups are classified by their associated diagrams dynkin diagrams are closely related objects which differ from coxeter diagrams in two respects firstly branches labeled 4 or greater are directed while coxeter diagrams are undirected secondly dynkin diagrams must satisfy an additional crystallographic restriction namely that the only allowed branch labels are 2 3 4 and 6 dynkin diagrams correspond to and are used to classify root systems and therefore semisimple lie algebras branches of a coxeter dynkin diagram are labeled with a rational number p representing a dihedral angle of 180 p when the angle is 90 and the mirrors have no interaction so the branch can be omitted from the diagram if a branch is unlabeled it is assumed to have representing an angle of 60 two parallel mirrors have

a nash equilibrium is considered payoff dominant if it is pareto superior to all other nash equilibria in the game when faced with a choice among equilibria all players would agree on the payoff dominant equilibrium since it offers to each player at least as much payoff as the other nash equilibria conversely a nash equilibrium is considered risk dominant if it has the largest basin of attraction i e is less risky this implies that the more uncertainty players have about the actions of the other player s the more likely they will choose the strategy corresponding to it the payoff matrix in figure 1 provides a simple two player two strategy example of a game with two pure nash equilibria the strategy pair hunt hunt is payoff dominant since payoffs are higher for both players compared to the other pure ne gather gather on the other hand gather gather risk dominates hunt hunt since if uncertainty exists about the other player s action gathering will provide a higher expected payoff the game in figure 1 is a well known game theoretic dilemma called stag hunt the rationale behind it is that communal action hunting yields a higher return

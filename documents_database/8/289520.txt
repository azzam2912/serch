its purpose is to increase the apparent signal to noise ratio of the resultant signal it does this by altering the spectral shape of the error that is introduced by dithering and quantization such that the noise power is at a lower level in frequency bands at which noise is considered to be less desirable and at a correspondingly higher level in bands where it is considered to be more desirable a popular noise shaping algorithm used in image processing is known as floyd steinberg dithering and many noise shaping algorithms used in audio processing are based on an absolute threshold of hearing model noise shaping works by putting the quantization error in a feedback loop any feedback loop functions as a filter so by creating a feedback loop for the error itself the error can be filtered as desired for example consider the feedback system where y n is the output sample value that is to be quantized x n is the input sample value n is the sample number and e n is the quantization error introduced at sample n in this model when any sample s bit depth is reduced the quantization error between the quantized value

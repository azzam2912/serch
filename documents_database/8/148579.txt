the rocket would only have to carry the means of capturing solar energy such as concentrators and mirrors the heated propellant would be fed through a conventional rocket nozzle to produce thrust its engine thrust would be directly related to the surface area of the solar collector and to the local intensity of the solar radiation in the shorter term solar thermal propulsion has been proposed both for longer life lower cost more efficient use of the sun and more flexible cryogenic upper stage launch vehicles and for on orbit propellant depots solar thermal propulsion is also a good candidate for use in reusable inter orbital tugs as it is a high efficiency low thrust system that can be refuelled with relative ease there are two solar thermal propulsion concepts differing primarily in the method by which they use solar power to heat up the propellant due to limitations in the temperature that heat exchanger materials can withstand approximately 2800 k the indirect absorption designs cannot achieve specific impulses beyond 900 seconds 9 kn s kg 9 km s or up to 1000 seconds see below the direct absorption designs allow higher propellant temperatures and therefore higher specific impulses approaching

the antibody reaction allows these species to be visualized under a microscope if the reaction is positive the capsule becomes opaque and appears to enlarge quellung is the german word for swelling and describes the microscopic appearance of pneumococcal or other bacterial capsules after their polysaccharide antigen has combined with a specific antibody the antibody usually comes from a bit of serum taken from an immunized laboratory animal as a result of this combination and precipitation of the large complex molecule formed the capsule appears to swell because of increased surface tension and its outlines become clearly demarcated the pneumococcal quellung reaction was first described in 1902 by the scientist fred neufeld and applied only to streptococcus pneumoniae both as microscopic capsular swelling and macroscopic agglutination clumping visible with the naked eye it was initially an intellectual curiosity more than anything else and could distinguish only the three pneumococcal serotypes known at that time however it acquired an important practical use with the advent of serum therapy to treat certain types of pneumococcal pneumonia in the 1920s because selection of the proper antiserum to treat an individual patient required correct identification of the infecting pneumococcal serotype and the quellung reaction

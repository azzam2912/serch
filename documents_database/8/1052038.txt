and wyers et al in 2005 it interacts with the exosome complex in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and is involved in the 3 end processing and degradation of ribosomal rna and snornas the tramp complex trims the poly a tails of rnas destined for rrp6 and the core exosome down to 4 5 adenosines assisting in transcript recognition and exosome complex activation the substrate specificity of exosomes is improved in the presence of tramp complex as it acts as a crucial cofactor and helps in maintaining various activities in this way tramp plays a critical role in ridding the cell of noncoding transcripts generated through pervasive rna polymerase ii transcription as well as functioning in the biogenesis and turnover of functional coding and noncoding rnas tramp complex also affects various other rna processes either directly or indirectly it is involved in rna export splicing hetero chromatic gene silencing and helps in maintaining stability of genome pol a polymerases showed various genetic interactions with dna topoisomerases top1p and hence they were called topoisomerase related function trf4p and trf5p due to this interaction with dna it has an important part in genomic stability in the cell trf4p is in higher concentration

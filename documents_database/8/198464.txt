phage therapy has many potential applications in human medicine as well as dentistry veterinary science and agriculture if the target host of a phage therapy treatment is not an animal the term biocontrol as in phage mediated biocontrol of bacteria is usually employed rather than phage therapy bacteriophages are much more specific than antibiotics they are typically harmless not only to the host organism but also to other beneficial bacteria such as the gut flora reducing the chances of opportunistic infections they have a high therapeutic index that is phage therapy would be expected to give rise to few side effects even at higher than therapeutic levels because phages replicate in vivo in cells of living organism a smaller effective dose can be used this specificity is also a disadvantage a phage will kill a bacterium only if it matches the specific strain consequently phage mixtures cocktails are often used to improve the chances of success alternatively samples taken from recovering patients sometimes contain appropriate phages that can be grown to cure other patients infected with the same strain phages tend to be more successful than antibiotics where there is a biofilm covered by a polysaccharide layer which antibiotics typically

the larger representatives have potential interest in optoelectronic applications and are actively researched in chemistry and electrical engineering pentacene has been incorporated into organic field effect transistors reaching charge carrier mobilities as high as 5 cm vs the first 5 unsubstituted members are listed in the following table the last member heptacene is very reactive and has only been isolated in a matrix however bis trialkylsilylethynylated versions of heptacene have been isolated as crystalline solids due to their increased conjugation length the larger acenes are also studied theoretically a number of reports are available on longer chains using density functional methods they are also building blocks for nanotubes and graphene unsubstituted octacene n 8 and nonacene n 9 have been detected in matrix isolation the first reports of stable nonacene derivatives claimed that due to the electronic effects of the thioaryl substituents the compound is not a diradical but a closed shell compound with the lowest homo lumo gap reported for any acene an observation in violation of kasha s rule subsequent work by others on different derivatives included crystal structures with no such violations the on surface synthesis and characterization of unsubstituted parent nonacene n 9 and decacene n

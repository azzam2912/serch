the most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms such as search and merge algorithms that require input data to be in sorted lists sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human readable output more formally the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions further the input data is often stored in an array which allows random access rather than a list which only allows sequential access though many algorithms can be applied to either type of data after suitable modification sorting algorithms are often referred to as a word followed by the word sort and grammatically are used in english as noun phrases for example in the sentence it is inefficient to use insertion sort on large lists the phrase insertion sort refers to the insertion sort sorting algorithm from the beginning of computing the sorting problem has attracted a great deal of research perhaps due to the complexity of solving it efficiently despite its simple familiar statement among the authors of early sorting algorithms around 1951 was betty holberton n e snyder who worked on eniac and univac bubble

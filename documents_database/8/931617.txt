for certain female mice the pheromones contained in the urine of male mice can be such stimuli inducing synchronous estrus when the pheromones contained in the urine of male mice stimulate synchronous estrus in a population of female mice it is known as the whitten effect this is a phenomenon observed by wesley k whitten 1956 1966 1968 whereby male mouse pheromone laden urine synchronizes the estrus cycle among unisexually grouped females and is an example of male to female pheromonal effects in mice similar to the bruce effect the whitten effect occurs when a group of female mice are exposed to the urine produced by a male mouse the male s urine contains certain volatile or airborne pheromones that affect the hormonal processes of the females that control their reproductive status a sexually mature and viable male must produce the urine as the pheromones that produce the whitten effect are dependent on male sex hormones such as testosterone the female mice do not require direct contact with the male s urine to produce the whitten effect as the pheromone contained in the urine is airborne and therefore is taken up by the females through their olfactory system the reproductive

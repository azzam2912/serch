a modern fishfinder displays measurements of reflected sound on a graphical display allowing an operator to interpret information to locate schools of fish underwater debris and the bottom of body of water fishfinder instruments are used both by sport and commercial fishermen modern electronics allows a high degree of integration between the fishfinder system marine radar compass and gps navigation systems fish finders were derived from fathometer s active sonar instruments used for navigation and safety to determine the depth of water the fathom is a unit of water depth from which the instrument gets its name the fathometer is an echo sounding system for measurement of water depth a fathometer will display water depth and can make an automatic permanent record of measurements since both fathometers and fishfinders work the same way and use similar frequencies and can detect both the bottom and fish the instruments have merged in operation an electrical impulse from a transmitter is converted into a sound wave by an underwater transducer called a hydrophone and sent into the water when the wave strikes something such as a fish it is reflected back and displays size composition and shape of the object the exact extent

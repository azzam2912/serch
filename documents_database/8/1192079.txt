gar wood s series of miss america boats were using multiple high powered aero engines to establish an apparently unbeatable record segrave had already used multiple aero engines in his land speed record setting sunbeam but miss england used a single napier lion engine and relied on an advanced planing hull design the hull was of an advanced lightweight construction which some designers including gar wood regarded as too light and flexible wood made many sportsmanlike contributions to his competitor particularly sharing his experience of propellor and rudder design he wanted a close race with a worthy opponent miss england raced successfully against gar wood s miss america vii in miami in 1929 it had been a successful trip for segrave having also taken the land speed record in golden arrow and he was knighted on his return a record for single engined boats of was established the racing success though was due to segrave s brave driving and some mechanical problems for miss america however miss england was always outclassed by the far more powerful and faster american boats miss england i survives to this day and is on display in the science museum london

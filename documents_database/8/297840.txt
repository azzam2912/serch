as a result all economies should eventually converge in terms of per capita income developing countries have the potential to grow at a faster rate than developed countries because diminishing returns in particular to capital are not as strong as in capital rich countries furthermore poorer countries can replicate the production methods technologies and institutions of developed countries in economic growth literature the term convergence can have two meanings the first kind sometimes called sigma convergence refers to a reduction in the dispersion of levels of income across economies beta convergence on the other hand occurs when poor economies grow faster than rich ones economists say that there is conditional beta convergence when economies experience beta convergence but conditional on other variables namely the investment rate and the population growth rate being held constant they say that unconditional beta convergence or absolute beta convergence exists when the growth rate of an economy declines as it approaches its steady state according to jack goldstone in the twentieth century the great divergence peaked before the first world war and continued until the early 1970s then after two decades of indeterminate fluctuations in the late 1980s it was replaced by the great convergence

it is named in analogy with rp which is similar but has no logarithmic space restriction the probabilistic turing machines in the definition of rl never accept incorrectly but are allowed to reject incorrectly less than 1 3 of the time this is called one sided error the constant 1 3 is arbitrary any x with 0 nl using a probabilistic counter and so is usually referred to as nl instead this also shows that rl is contained in nl rl is contained in bpl which is similar but allows two sided error incorrect accepts rl contains l the problems solvable by deterministic turing machines in log space since its definition is just more general noam nisan showed in 1992 the weak derandomization result that rl is contained in sc the class of problems solvable in polynomial time and polylogarithmic space on a deterministic turing machine in other words given polylogarithmic space a deterministic machine can simulate logarithmic space probabilistic algorithms it is believed that rl is equal to l that is that polynomial time logspace computation can be completely derandomized major evidence for this was presented by reingold et al in 2005 a proof of this is the holy

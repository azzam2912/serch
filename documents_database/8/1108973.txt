the fault was a reverse fault in the early cretaceous epoch during the primal stages of the farallon plate subduction beneath the north american continental plate and fully transitioned into a strike slip shear zone during the late cretaceous professor robert w webb of the university of chicago was the first to research the fault in 1936 he found a lava flow pliocene age that inducted the northern end of the fault line where the little kern and kern river coincided without any evidence of deformation upon the hardened lava and without any evidence found previously when investigating the fault line webb deemed the fault an inactive site in 2007 professor elisabeth nadin university of alaska fairbanks discovered that while mapping the faults within the southern sierra nevada there had been several accounts of activity along the kern canyon fault line well into the quaternary era her research continued into 2010 which explicitly entailed the lines of evidence that overturn the proposition that the fault line was inactive for more than 3 5 million years due to the continued activity of the fault line as well as its extension the kern canyon fault line is sub divided into three different

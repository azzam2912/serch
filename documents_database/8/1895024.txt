these fermions are fundamentally different from the hitherto known matter particles like electrons or neutrinos despite being endowed with spin one half they are not described by the celebrated dirac formalism but instead by a spinorial klein gordon formalism in 2004 dharam vir ahluwalia iit guwahati in collaboration with daniel grumiller presented an unexpected theoretical discovery of spin one half fermions with mass dimension one see and in the decade that followed a significant number of groups explored intriguing mathematical and physical properties of the new construct while ahluwalia and his students developed the formalism further however the formalism suffered from two troubling features that of non locality and a subtle violation of lorentz symmetry the origin of both of these issues has now been traced to a hidden freedom in the definition of duals of spinors and the associated field adjoints as a result there now exists an entirely new quantum theory of spin one half fermions that is free from all the mentioned issues the interactions of the new fermions are restricted to dimension four quartic self interaction and also to a dimension four coupling with the higgs a generalised yukawa coupling of the new fermions with neutrinos

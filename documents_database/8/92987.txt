in the sibley ahlquist taxonomy this order is raised to a superorder apodimorphae in which hummingbirds are separated as a new order trochiliformes with nearly 450 species identified to date they are the most diverse order of birds after the passerines as their name footless in greek suggests their legs are small and have limited function aside from perching the feet are covered with bare skin rather than the scales scutes that other birds have another shared characteristic is long wings with short stout humerus bones the evolution of these wing characteristics has provided the hummingbird with ideal wings for hovering the hummingbirds swifts and crested swifts share other anatomical similarities with one another as well as similarities notably as to the skull with their probable closest living relatives the owlet nightjars the owlet nightjars are apparently convergent with the closely related caprimulgiformes which form a clade cypselomorphae with the apodiformes the apodiformes evolved in the northern hemisphere eocypselus a primitive genus known from the late paleocene or early eocene of north central europe is somewhat difficult to assign it is considered a primitive hemiprocnid this would suggest that the major apodiform lineages diverged shortly after the cretaceous paleogene boundary

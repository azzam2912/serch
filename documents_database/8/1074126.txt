the standard specifies a common syntax command structure and data formats to be used with all instruments it introduced generic commands such as codice 1 and codice 2 that could be used with any instrument these commands are grouped into subsystems scpi also defines several classes of instruments for example any controllable power supply would implement the same codice 3 base functionality class instrument classes specify which subsystems they implement as well as any instrument specific features the physical hardware communications link is not defined by scpi while it was originally created for the ieee 488 1 gpib bus scpi can also be used with rs 232 rs 422 ethernet usb vxibus hislip etc scpi commands are ascii textual strings which are sent to the instrument over the physical layer e g ieee 488 1 commands are a series of one or more keywords many of which take parameters in the specification keywords are written codice 4 the entire keyword can be used or it can be abbreviated to just the uppercase portion responses to query commands are typically ascii strings however for bulk data binary formats can be used the scpi specification consists of four volumes volume 1 syntax

it is a part of the permanent collection at the flint institute of arts the painting is a double portrait of archduchess maria maddalena of austria and her son ferdinand the future ferdinando ii de medici grand duke of tuscany completed around 1623 after the death of ferdinand s father cosimo ii de medici grand duke of tuscany the painting shows maria maddalena in the center with her right hand next to cosimo ii s crown and her left hand resting on her young son s shoulder ferdinand would have been thirteen at the time but looks to be about 4 or 5 years old in the portrait in addition his mother looks much younger in this portrait than in a portrait sustermans did of her in 1622 it is believed that the first work he completed for the medici was the 1622 portrait of cosimo s widow marie madeline who became susterman s first patron sustermans was known for painting children accurately so it is unlikely that the artist didn t know how to make ferdinand look his age since this double portrait was delivered with a posthumous portrait of ferdinand s father cosimo ii it is quite possible

the multinational collaboration includes researchers from china chile the united states taiwan russia and the czech republic the us side of the project is funded by the us department of energy s office of high energy physics it is situated at daya bay approximately 52 kilometers northeast of hong kong and 45 kilometers east of shenzhen there is an affiliated project in the aberdeen tunnel underground laboratory in hong kong the aberdeen lab measures the neutrons produced by cosmic muons which may affect the daya bay reactor neutrino experiment the experiment consists of eight antineutrino detectors clustered in three locations within of six nuclear reactors each detector consists of 20 tons of liquid scintillator linear alkylbenzene doped with gadolinium surrounded by photomultiplier tubes and shielding a much larger follow up is in development in the form of the jiangmen underground neutrino observatory juno in kaiping which will use an acrylic sphere filled with 20 000 tons of liquid scintillator to detect reactor antineutrinos groundbreaking began 10 january 2015 with operation expected in 2020 the experiment studies neutrino oscillations and is designed to measure the mixing angle using antineutrinos produced by the reactors of the daya bay nuclear power plant and

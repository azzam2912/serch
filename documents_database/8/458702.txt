like all synthetic elements it has no stable isotopes the first isotope to be synthesized was mc in 2004 there are four known radioisotopes from mc to mc the longest lived isotope is mc with a half life of 0 8 seconds the isotopes undergo alpha decay into the corresponding isotope of nihonium with half lives increasing as neutron numbers increase the table below contains various combinations of targets and projectiles which could be used to form compound nuclei with z 115 each entry is a combination for which calculations have provided estimates for cross section yields from various neutron evaporation channels the channel with the highest expected yield is given hot fusion reactions are processes that create compound nuclei at high excitation energy 40 50 mev hence hot leading to a reduced probability of survival from fission the excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of 3 5 neutrons fusion reactions utilizing ca nuclei usually produce compound nuclei with intermediate excitation energies 30 35 mev and are sometimes referred to as warm fusion reactions this leads in part to relatively high yields from these reactions there are strong indications that this reaction was performed in

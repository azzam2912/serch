in a typical 4 byte on little endian platform fixed float number lower lsb 2 bytes are used to store the decimal part of the number just like integer value while upper 2 bytes are used to store the part of number before the decimal point floating point numbers are in general represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits and scaled using an exponent the base for the scaling is normally 2 10 or 16 the typical number that can be represented exactly is of the form above method of representing the floating point numbers is complex method of representing the floating point numbers but with it we can represent wide range of floating points numbers by this method as well as it is convenient to manipulate the floating point numbers by this method it is difficult for a human being to convert floating point real numbers in mathematical language number into the format in which they are stored into the memory as well as it is difficult to convert back floating point looking its hex or binary value into the real number due to the conversion problem fixed floating point numbers are used fixed floating point numbers

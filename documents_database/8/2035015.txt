such a system produces uniform flow that occurs at predictable times and provides easy access for measuring the curb gutter system cross section shape can be idealized as a triangular cross section this project provides the details of a field exploration of flow in a curb gutter system the observed curb gutter system is located on hearthstone drive in blacksburg virginia located in an apartment complex parking lot this system provides a segment of channel with a few imperfections the segment totals 37 feet in length includes a slight slope of 4 43 and provides conveyance from a parking lot in a nearby storm drain the following figures display the observed curb and gutter system and a cross section of the curb and gutter a rating curve displays the relationship between discharge and depth the depth typically referred to as stage is measured from the very bottom of the channel to the flow s surface the magnitude of flow or discharge q is dependent upon stage and channel shape and can be found using manning s equation manning s equation computes velocity as a function of channel slope hydraulic radius manning s n coefficient and a conversion factor manning s

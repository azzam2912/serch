one of his major research contributions were geometric modeling techniques called variational design of curves and surfaces his curve and surface interrogation methods are among his many contributions to topological and geometric aspects of scientific visualization hans hagen has published over four hundred articles in journals books and conference proceedings his research interests are deep and very broad his work concentrates on physically based modeling curve and surface interrogation and topology based visualization particular emphasis is placed on variational design the key idea is include energy minimization as an integral part of the algorithm and the underlying mathematics this concept is now industry standard hans hagen has a strong background in differential geometry and topology his geometric modeling publication record started with a work on geometric splines where he introduced a torsion continuous spline curve thereafter he developed together with guido brunnett and paolo santarelli the variational design methodology and a solution to the twist input and compatibility twist problem of the coons patches triangular patches did not have curvature modeling facilities for many years hans hagen had a strong impact on the geometric modeling community he started the world class dagstuhl seminar series on geometric modeling that regularly brings

an example would include for example the generation of myelin which insulates and protects nerves these are typically calcium binding proteins there are two types of myelin the first is oligodendrocyte which can be found in the mammalian central nervous system cns the second is schwann cells which are found in the peripheral nervous system pns myelination of axons by these schwann cells are essential for normal nerve function peripheral nerves rely on communication between axons and schwaan cells prion protein triggers are an important factor in the signals that ensure myelin maintenance and are distinct from those that direct myelination prion protein and antibodies pom1 and pom3 which recognize epitopes in the terminus around amino acids aa 140 152 and charged clusters of prion protein aa95 100 were used to their role in myelin maintenance the result indicated that neuronal expression and regulated proteolysis of prion protein are essential for myelin maintenance neurodegenerative disease neurodegenerative disease is caused by prions accumulation of prpsc the brains of humans or animals affected with prion disease show characteristics histopathological changes however the pathogenesis of the disease is largely unknown and treatment is often unsatisfactory tests on 60 week old mice investigated prpc

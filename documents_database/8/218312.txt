a theoretical definition is a proposed way of thinking about potentially related events theoretical definitions contain built in theories they cannot be simply reduced to describing a set of observations the definition may contain implicit inductions and deductive consequences that are part of the theory a theoretical definition of a term can change over time based on the methods in the field that created it without a falsifiable operational definition conceptual definitions assume both knowledge and acceptance of the theories that it depends on a hypothetical construct may serve as a theoretical definition as can a stipulative definition the term scientific theory is reserved for concepts that are widely accepted a scientific law often refers to regularities that can be expressed by a mathematical statement however there is no consensus about the distinction between these terms every scientific concept must have an operational definition however the operational definition can use both direct observations and latent variables in the natural sciences a concept is an abstract conclusion drawn from observations social and health sciences interact with non empirical fields and use both observation based and pre existing concepts such as intelligence race and gender most interdisciplinary fields are designed to address

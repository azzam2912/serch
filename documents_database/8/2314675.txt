the specific name vallesiensis was given because the species was found in localities of vallesian age leptofelis vallesiensis was first described as styriofelis vallesiensis in 2012 based on several specimens from batallones 1 and batallones 3 a pair of vallesian age localities in spain the specimens included a partial but well preserved skeleton and several skulls however a review of the species in 2017 concluded that it was sufficiently different from other styriofelis species as to warrant a new genus and was therefore reassigned as leptofelis vallesiensis leptofelis vallesiensis is theorized to have had long and slender legs and to weigh between similar in size to a caracal or serval it had certain adaptations intermediate between earlier felids which were mostly arboreal or semi arboreal and later felids that lived mainly on the ground because of this l vallesiensis is theorized to have been mainly ground living though still climbing trees to escape leptofelis seemed to prefer open woodland habitat as evidenced by finds at cerro de los batallones as a predator at batallones it would have hunted small rodents birds and other easily subdued animals this cat was contemporaneous with such herbivores as horses like hipparion the hornless rhinoceros

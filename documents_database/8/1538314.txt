in an interview with the minneapolis newspaper the star tribune glover said we started at the triangle bar and john koerner would go across the street to the viking bar during our breaks so we eventually started playing at the viking the same thing happened between the viking and the 400 bar we sort of kept moving to the places john liked to go to enjoy a quiet beer live at the 400 bar was recorded over two performances in january 2009 the a v club gave the release a positive review writing it s just live enough to keep the shine on the stage if the twin cities is indeed enjoying a new acoustic boom it s high time we heard again from the groundbreaking and still premier practitioners that damn mill is still broke down but koerner and glover are workin just fine all songs are traditional unless otherwise noted

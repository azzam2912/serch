familiar examples are automobile tyres hoses and conveyor belts reinforced rubber products combine a rubber matrix and a reinforcing material so high strength to flexibility ratios can be achieved the reinforcing material usually a kind of fibre provides the strength and stiffness the rubber matrix with low strength and stiffness provides air fluid tightness and supports the reinforcing materials to maintain their relative positions these positions are of great importance because they influence the resulting mechanical properties a composite structure where all fibres are loaded equally everywhere when pressurized is called an isotropic structure and the type of loading is named an isotensoidal loading to meet the isotensoidal concept the structure geometry must have an isotensoid meridian profile and the fibres must be positioned following geodesic paths a geodesic path connects two arbitrary points on a continuous surface by means of the shortest possible way to achieve optimal loading in a straight rubber hose the fibres must be positioned under an angle of approximately 54 7 angular degrees also referred to as the magic angle the magic angle of 54 7 exactly balances the internal pressure induced longitudinal stress and the hoop circumferential stress as observed in most biological pressurized

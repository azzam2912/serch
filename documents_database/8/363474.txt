this experimentation eventually led to the development of the kappa sounding rocket which was used for observations during the international geophysical year by 1960 the 8 rocket had reached an altitude of 200 km in 1964 the rocket group and the institute of aeronautics along with scientific ballooning team were merged to form within the university of tokyo the rocket evolved into the l lambda series and in 1970 l 4s 5 was launched as japan s first artificial satellite ohsumi although lambda rockets were only sounding rockets the next generation of m mu rockets was intended to be satellite launch vehicles from the start beginning in 1971 isas launched a series of scientific satellites to observe the ionosphere and magnetosphere since the launch of hakucho in 1979 isas has had x ray astronomy satellites consecutively in orbit until it was briefly terminated by the launch failure of astro e in 1981 as a part of university system reform and for the mission expansion isas was spun out from university of tokyo as an inter university national research organization institute of space and astronautical science in 2003 three national aerospace organizations including isas were merged to form japan aerospace exploration

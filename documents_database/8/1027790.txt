these complex applications have demonstrated that ecosimpro is very robust and ready for use in many other fields differential equation to familiarize yourself with the use of ecosimpro first create a simple component to solve a differential equation although ecosimpro is designed to simulate complex systems it can also be used independently of a physical system as if it were a pure equation solver the example in this section illustrates this type of use it solves the following differential equation to introduce a delay to variable x which is equivalent to where x and y have a time dependence that will be defined in the experiment tau is datum provided given by the user we will use a value of 0 6 seconds this equation introduces a delay in the x variable with respect to y with value tau to simulate this equation we will create an ecosimpro component with the equation in it the component to be simulated in el is like thus pendulum one example of applied calculus could be the movement of a perfect pendulum no friction taken into account we would have the following data the force of gravity g the length of the pendulum l

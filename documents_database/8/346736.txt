for example the wire speed of fast ethernet is 100 mbit s also known as the peak bitrate connection speed useful bit rate information rate or digital bandwidth capacity the wire speed is the data transfer rate that a telecommunications standard provides at a reference point between the physical layer and the datalink layer the wire speed should not be confused with the line bitrate also known as gross bit rate raw bitrate or data signalling rate which is 125 mbit s in fast ethernet in case there is a physical layer overhead for example due to line coding or error correcting codes the line bitrate is higher than the wire speed note also that the theoretical channel capacity of the cable may be much higher especially if the cable is short but this is not utilized in the communication standard the channel capacity depends on the physical and electrical properties of the cable while the wire speed also depends on the connection protocols the wire speed may also refer to maximum throughput which typically is a couple of percent lower than the physical layer net bitrate in wired networks due to datalink layer protocol overhead data packet gaps etc

these provinces are characterized by slow shear wave velocities and were discovered by seismic tomography of the deep earth there are two main provinces the african llsvp and the pacific llsvp both extend laterally for thousands of kilometers and possibly up to 1000 km vertically from the core mantle boundary the pacific llsvp has specific dimensions of 3000 km across and 300 m higher than the surrounding ocean floor and is situated over four hotspots that suggest multiple mantle plumes underneath these zones represent around 8 of the volume of the mantle 6 of the earth other names for llsvps include superwells thermo chemical piles or hidden reservoirs some of these names however are more interpretive of their geodynamical or geochemical effects while many questions remain about their nature llsvps were discovered in full mantle seismic tomographic models of shear velocity as slow features in the lowermost mantle beneath africa and the pacific the boundaries of these features appear fairly consistent across models when applying objective k means clustering the global spherical harmonic degree two structure is strong and aligns with its smallest moments of inertia along with the two llsvps this means by using shear wave velocities the established

francois mountain region of the missouri ozarks about south of st louis near lesterville missouri in reynolds county it is operated by ameren missouri previously amerenue formerly union electric the pumped storage hydroelectric plant was constructed from 1960 1962 and was designed to help meet daytime peak electric power demand it began operation in 1963 electrical generators are turned by water flowing from a reservoir on top of proffit mountain into a lower reservoir on the east fork of the black river at night excess electricity on the power grid is used to pump water back to the mountaintop the taum sauk plant is an open loop pure pumped operation unlike some other pumped storage sites there is no natural primary flow into the upper reservoir available for generation it is therefore a net consumer of electricity the laws of thermodynamics dictate that more power is used to pump the water up the mountain than is generated when it comes down however the plant is still economical to operate because the upper reservoir is refilled at night when the electrical generation system is running at low cost baseline capacity this ability to store huge amounts of energy led its operator

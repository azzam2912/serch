notably peptoids lack the amide hydrogen which is responsible for many of the secondary structure elements in peptides and proteins peptoids were first invented by reyna j simon paul bartlett and daniel v santi to mimic protein peptide products to aid in the discovery of protease stable small molecule drugs following the sub monomer protocol originally created by ron zuckermann each residue is installed in two steps acylation and displacement in the acylation step a haloacetic acid typically bromoacetic acid activated by diisopropylcarbodiimide reacts with the amine of the previous residue in the displacement step a classical s2 reaction an amine displaces the halide to form the n substituted glycine residue the submonomer approach allows the use of any commercially available or synthetically accessible amine with great potential for combinatorial chemistry like d peptides and peptides peptoids are completely resistant to proteolysis and are therefore advantageous for therapeutic applications where proteolysis is a major issue since secondary structure in peptoids does not involve hydrogen bonding it is not typically denatured by solvent temperature or chemical denaturants such as urea see details below notably since the amino portion of the amino acid results from the use of any amine thousands of

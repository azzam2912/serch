the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy centre nv has been the target of considerable interest with regards to performing experiments using odmr odmr of nvs in diamond has applications in magnetometry and sensing biomedical imaging quantum information and the exploration of fundamental physics the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond consists of a single substitutional nitrogen atom replacing one carbon atom and an adjacent gap or vacancy in the lattice where normally a carbon atom would be located the nitrogen vacancy occurs in three possible charge states positive nv neutral nv and negative nv as nv is the only one of these charge states which has shown to be odmr active it is often referred to simply as the nv the energy level structure of the nv consists of a triplet ground state a triplet excited state and two singlet states under resonant optical excitation the nv may be raised from the triplet ground state to the triplet excited state the centre may then return to the ground state via two routes by the emission of a photon of 637 nm in the zero phonon line zpl or longer wavelength from the phonon sideband or alternatively via the aforementioned singlet states through

fli 1 is activated through retroviral insertional mutagenesis in 90 of f mulv induced erythroleukemias the constitutive activation of fli 1 in erythroblasts leads to a dramatic shift in the epo epo r signal transduction pathway blocking erythroid differentiation activating the ras pathway and resulting in massive epo independent proliferation of erythroblasts these results suggest that fli 1 overexpression in erythroblasts alters their responsiveness to epo and triggers abnormal proliferation by switching the signaling event s associated with terminal differentiation to proliferation in addition to friend erythroleukemia proviral integration at the fli 1 locus also occurs in leukemias induced by the 10a1 graffi and cas br e viruses fli 1 aberrant expression is also associated with chromosomal abnormalities in humans in pediatric ewing s sarcoma a chromosomal translocation generates a fusion of the 5 transactivation domain of ewsr1 also known as ews with the 3 ets domain of fli 1 the resulting fusion oncoprotein ews fli 1 acts as an aberrant transcriptional activator with strong transforming capabilities ews fli 1 may steer clinically important genes via interaction with enhnacer like ggaa microsatellites the importance of fli 1 in the development of human leukemia such as acute myelogenous leukemia aml has

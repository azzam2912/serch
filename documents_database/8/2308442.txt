in nuclear engineering there are a number of empirical or semi empirical relations used for quantifying the process of removing heat from a nuclear reactor core so that the reactor operates in the projected temperature interval that depends on the materials used in the construction of the reactor the effectiveness of removal of heat from the reactor core depends on many factors including the cooling agents used and the type of reactor common coolers for nuclear reactors include heavy water the first alkaline metals such as sodium and lithium lead or lead based alloys and nak the thermal energy produced in nuclear fuel comes mainly from the kinetic energy of fission fragments therefore the heat generated per volume unit is proportional to the fraction of nuclear fissionable fuel burned in the unit of time formula 1 where formula 2 represents the number of atoms in a cubic meter of fuel a is the amount of energy released in the fuel in each fission reaction 181 mev formula 3 is the neutronic flux and formula 4 is the effective section of the fission the total heat produced in the nuclear reactor is formula 5 where formula 6 is the mean neutronic

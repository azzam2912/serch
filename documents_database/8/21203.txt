the sylow theorems form a fundamental part of finite group theory and have very important applications in the classification of finite simple groups for a prime number p a sylow p subgroup sometimes p sylow subgroup of a group g is a maximal p subgroup of g i e a subgroup of g that is a p group so that the order of every group element is a power of p that is not a proper subgroup of any other p subgroup of g the set of all sylow p subgroups for a given prime p is sometimes written syl g the sylow theorems assert a partial converse to lagrange s theorem lagrange s theorem states that for any finite group g the order number of elements of every subgroup of g divides the order of g the sylow theorems state that for every prime factor p of the order of a finite group g there exists a sylow p subgroup of g of order p the highest power of p that divides the order of g moreover every subgroup of order p is a sylow p subgroup of g and the sylow p subgroups of a group for a

it fits several other superficially different mathematical descriptions which can all be proved to define exactly the same curves one description of a parabola involves a point the focus and a line the directrix the focus does not lie on the directrix the parabola is the locus of points in that plane that are equidistant from both the directrix and the focus another description of a parabola is as a conic section created from the intersection of a right circular conical surface and a plane which is parallel to another plane that is tangential to the conical surface the line perpendicular to the directrix and passing through the focus that is the line that splits the parabola through the middle is called the axis of symmetry the point on the parabola that intersects the axis of symmetry is called the vertex and is the point where the parabola is most sharply curved the distance between the vertex and the focus measured along the axis of symmetry is the focal length the latus rectum is the chord of the parabola which is parallel to the directrix and passes through the focus parabolas can open up down left right or in some

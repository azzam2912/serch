this synthesis has much in common with the holton taxol total synthesis in that it is a linear synthesis starting from a naturally occurring compound with ring construction in the order a b c d the wender effort is shorter by approximately 10 steps raw materials for the preparation of taxol by this route include verbenone prenyl bromine allyl bromide propiolic acid gilman reagent and eschenmoser s salt the taxol synthesis started from the terpene verbenone 1 in scheme 1 which is the oxidation product of naturally occurring pinene and forming ring a construction of ring b started with abstraction of the pendant methyl group proton by potassium tert butoxide conjugated anion is formed followed by nucleophilic displacement of the bromine atom in prenyl bromide 2 to form diene 3 ozonolysis of the prenyl group more electron rich than the internal double bond formed aldehyde 4 which after isomerization or photorearrangement to the chrysanthenone 5 was reacted with the lithium salt via lda of the ethyl ester of propiolic acid 6 in a nucleophilic addition to the alcohol 7 this compound was not isolated but trapped in situ with trimethylsilyl chloride to the silyl ether 9 in the next step

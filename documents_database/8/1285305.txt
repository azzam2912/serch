the breakdown is caused by formation of a conducting path through the gate oxide to substrate due to electron tunneling current when mosfets are operated close to or beyond their specified operating voltages the defect generation in the dielectric is a stochastic process there are two modes of breakdown intrinsic and extrinsic intrinsic breakdown is caused by electrical stress induced defect generation extrinsic breakdown is caused by defects induced by the manufacturing process for integrated circuits the time to breakdown is dependent on the thickness of the dielectric gate oxide and also on the material type which is dependent on the manufacturing process node older generation products with gate oxide thickness 4nm are based on sio2 and the advanced process nodes with gate oxide high k dielectric materials there are different breakdown models and thickness of the gate oxide determines the validity of the model e model 1 e model and power law exponential model are common models which depict the breakdown behavior the failure types for integrated circuit ic components follow the classic bath tub curve there is infant mortality which is decreasing failure rate typically due to manufacturing defects a low constant failure rate which is random in

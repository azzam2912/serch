photon rockets have been discussed as a propulsion system that could make interstellar flight possible which requires the ability to propel spacecraft to speeds at least 10 of the light speed v 0 1c 30 000 km sec tsander 1967 photon propulsion has been considered to be one of the best available interstellar propulsion concepts because it is founded on established physics and technologies forward 1984 traditional photon rockets are proposed to be powered by onboard generators as in the nuclear photonic rocket the standard textbook case of such a rocket is the ideal case where all of the fuel is converted to photons which are radiated in the same direction in more realistic treatments one takes into account that the beam of photons is not perfectly collimated that not all of the fuel is converted to photons and so on a large amount of fuel would be required and the rocket would be a huge vessel the limitations posed by the rocket equation can be overcome as long as the reaction mass is not carried by the spacecraft in the beamed laser propulsion blp the photon generators and the spacecraft are physically separated and the photons are beamed from

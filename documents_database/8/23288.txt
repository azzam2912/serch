it is quantitatively expressed as where is any atom or molecule capable of ionization is that atom or molecule with an electron removed and is the removed electron this is generally an endothermic process generally the closer the outermost electrons are to the nucleus of the atom the higher the atom s or element s ionization energy the sciences of physics and chemistry use different measures of ionization energy in physics the unit is the amount of energy required to remove a single electron from a single atom or molecule expressed as electronvolts in chemistry the unit is the amount of energy required for all of the atoms in a mole of substance to lose one electron each molar ionization energy or enthalpy expressed as kilojoules per mole kj mol or kilocalories per mole kcal mol comparison of e of elements in the periodic table reveals two periodic trends the latter trend results from the outer electron shell being progressively farther from the nucleus with the addition of one inner shell per row as one moves down the column the n th ionization energy refers to the amount of energy required to remove an electron from the species with a

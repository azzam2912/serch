it is located at a distance of circa 350 million light years from earth which given its apparent dimensions means that ngc 7674 is about 125 000 light years across it was discovered by john herschel on august 16 1830 the galaxy is seen nearly face on at an inclination of 31 degrees the central bar shaped structure measuring 15 5 arcseconds is made up of stars the galaxy has two spiral arms that become broader as the distance increases one arm vanishes at the point it overlaps with the nearby galaxy ngc 7674a the shape of ngc 7674 including the long narrow streamers emanating northeast and northwest of the galaxy can be accounted for by tidal interactions with its companions there is no dwarf galaxy seen inside the streamers it is featured in arp s atlas of peculiar galaxies as number 182 in the category galaxies with narrow filaments ngc 7674 has a powerful active nucleus of the kind known as a type 2 seyfert that is perhaps fed by gas drawn into the center through the interactions with the companions using spectropolarimetry emission characteristic of a hidden broad line region blr visible only in the polarized flux spectrum

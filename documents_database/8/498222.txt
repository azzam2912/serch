the name harmonic balance is descriptive of the method which starts with kirchhoff s current law written in the frequency domain and a chosen number of harmonics a sinusoidal signal applied to a nonlinear component in a system will generate harmonics of the fundamental frequency effectively the method assumes the solution can be represented by a linear combination of sinusoids then balances current and voltage sinusoids to satisfy kirchhoff s law the method is commonly used to simulate circuits which include nonlinear elements and is most applicable to systems with feedback in which limit cycles occur microwave circuits were the original application for harmonic balance methods in electrical engineering microwave circuits were well suited because historically microwave circuits consist of many linear components which can be directly represented in the frequency domain plus a few nonlinear components system sizes were typically small for more general circuits the method was considered impractical for all but these very small circuits until the mid 1990s when krylov subspace methods were applied to the problem the application of preconditioned krylov subspace methods allowed much larger systems to be solved both in size of circuit and in numbers of harmonics this made practical the present

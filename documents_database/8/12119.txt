the signals are usually processed in a digital representation so speech processing can be regarded as a special case of digital signal processing applied to speech signals aspects of speech processing includes the acquisition manipulation storage transfer and output of speech signals the input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis early attempts at speech processing and recognition were primarily focused on understanding a handful of simple phonetic elements such as vowels in 1952 three researchers at bell labs stephen balashek r biddulph and k h davis developed a system that could recognize digits spoken by a single speaker linear predictive coding lpc a speech processing algorithm was first proposed by fumitada itakura of nagoya university and shuzo saito of nippon telegraph and telephone ntt in 1966 further developments in lpc technology were made by bishnu s atal and manfred r schroeder at bell labs during the 1970s lpc was the basis for voice over ip voip technology as well as speech synthesizer chips such as the texas instruments lpc speech chips used in the speak spell toys from 1978 one of the first commercially available speech recognition products was dragon dictate released in 1990 in

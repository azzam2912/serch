these patterns and forces are used to identify the presence and severity of cardiovascular diseases such as aortic aneurysm and atherosclerosis some of the methods used to study the hemodynamics of aortic flow are patient scans computational fluid dynamics models and particle tracking velocimetry ptv the information gathered through these studies can be used for surgery planning and the development of implants greater understanding of this topic reduces mortality rates associated with cardiovascular disease the mean velocity in the aorta varies over the cardiac cycle during systole the mean velocity rises to a peak then it falls during diastole this pattern is repeated with each squeezing pulse of the heart the highest velocities are found at the exit of the valve during systole at this stage the majority of the flow can be described with velocity vectors normal to the entrance but in plane velocities tangent to the flow are present as the path starts to curve in the ascending aorta the blood towards the outside of the arch tends to rotate towards the inner wall causing a helical pattern that is observed in most individuals as the blood moves into the aortic arch the area with the highest velocity

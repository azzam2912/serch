this is a basic concept in differential topology the notion of a submersion is dual to the notion of an immersion let m and n be differentiable manifolds and formula 1 be a differentiable map between them the map f is a submersion at a point formula 2 if its differential is a surjective linear map in this case p is called a regular point of the map f otherwise p is a critical point a point formula 4 is a regular value of f if all points p in the pre image formula 5 are regular points a differentiable map f that is a submersion at each point formula 2 is called a submersion equivalently f is a submersion if its differential formula 7 has constant rank equal to the dimension of n a word of warning some authors use the term critical point to describe a point where the rank of the jacobian matrix of f at p is not maximal indeed this is the more useful notion in singularity theory if the dimension of m is greater than or equal to the dimension of n then these two notions of critical point coincide but if the dimension

he studied the finite difference method with hanfried lenz and completed his habilitation in 1978 he became a professor of mathematics at university of giessen in 1980 the uses of finite geometry in coding theory led jungnickel and thomas beth to write variations of seven points which used the fano plane as a starting point with thomas beth and hanfried lenz he wrote design theory 1985 on combinatorial design albrecht beutelspacher reviewed it positively as deserving high estimation and as an impressive work it was re published by cambridge university press in 1986 he updated the work in 1989 for the second edition design theory 1999 was split into two volumes one and two in 1990 jungnickel wrote an article on geometric and graph theoretical aspects of latin squares of interest in coding theory in september 1990 university of vermont was the site of a conference concerned with the mathematics of coding theory and commemorating the contributions of marshall hall together with scott vanstone jungnickel edited the proceedings in 1993 jungnickel joined augsburg university where he occupies the chair for discrete mathematics optimisation and operations research jungnickel wrote about finite fields in 1993 finite fields structure and arithmetics a reviewer

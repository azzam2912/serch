the sperm types might differ in size shape and or chromosome complement sperm heteromorphism is also called sperm polymorphism or sperm dimorphism for species with two sperm types typically only one sperm type is capable of fertilizing eggs fertile types have been called eusperm or eupyrene sperm and infertile types parasperm or apyrene sperm one interpretation of sperm polymorphism is the kamikaze sperm hypothesis baker and bellis 1988 which has been widely discredited in humans the kamikaze sperm hypothesis states that the polymorphism of sperm is due to a subdivision of sperm into different functional groups there are those that defend the egg from fertilization by other male sperm and those that fertilize the egg however there is no evidence that the polymorphism of human sperm is for the purpose of antagonizing rival sperm sperm heteromorphism is known from several different groups of animals the non fertilising morph s have no function and are simply developmental errors this is thought to be unlikely in many sperm heteromorphic species because the production of infertile sperm may be highly regulated and infertile sperm can make up 90 of the total sperm in some lepidoptera and drosophila the non fertilising morph s are

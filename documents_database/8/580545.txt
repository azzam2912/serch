they are characterized as dna binding transcription factors and are mediators of sonic hedgehog shh signaling the protein encoded by this gene localizes in the cytoplasm and activates patched drosophila homolog ptch1 gene expression it is also thought to play a role during embryogenesis gli3 is a known transcriptional repressor but may also have a positive transcriptional function gli3 represses dhand and gremlin which are involved in developing digits there is evidence that shh controlled processing e g cleavage regulates transcriptional activity of gli3 similarly to that of ci gli3 mutant mice have many abnormalities including cns and lung defects and limb polydactyly in the developing mouse limb bud gli3 derepression predominately regulates shh target genes mutations in this gene have been associated with several diseases including greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome pallister hall syndrome preaxial polydactyly type iv and postaxial polydactyly types a1 and b dna copy number alterations that contribute to increased conversion of the oncogenes gli1 3 into transcriptional activators by the hedgehog signaling pathway are included in a genome wide pattern which was found to be correlated with an astrocytoma patient s outcome there is evidence that the autosomal dominant disorder greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome gcps that affects limb

as a non classical mhc class ii molecule hla do is a non polymorphic accessory protein that aids in antigenic peptide chaperoning and loading as opposed to its classical counterparts which are polymorphic and involved in antigen presentation though more remains to be elucidated about the function of hla do its unique distribution in the mammalian body namely the exclusive expression of hla do in b cells thymic medullary epithelial cells and dendritic cells indicate that it may be of physiological importance and has inspired further research moreover hla do is stable in complex with hla dm and its exhibited instability in the absence of hla dm as well as its evolutionary conservation further denote its biological significance and potential to confer evolutionary benefits to its host studies on hla do transfected fibroblast cells lines and on the hla do mouse homolog h 2o provide most of the current knowledge on the protein in 1985 the and chains were separately discovered and in 1990 both chains were found to be co expressed in one protein in h 2o in contrast to other molecules of mhc class ii interferon gamma does not induce hla do expression the binding of hla do

vinyl iodides are versatile molecules that serve as important building blocks and precursors in organic synthesis they are commonly used in carbon carbon forming reactions in transition metal catalyzed cross coupling reactions such as heck reaction sonogashira coupling and suzuki coupling synthesis of well defined geometry or complexity vinyl iodide is important in stereoselective synthesis of natural products and drugs vinyl iodides are generally stable under nucleophilic conditions in s2 reactions back attack is difficult because of steric clash of r groups on carbon adjacent to electrophilic center see figure 1a in addition the lone pair on iodide donates into the of the alkene which reduces electrophilic character on the carbon as a result of decreased positive charge also this stereoelectronic effect strengthens the c i bond thus making removal of the iodide difficult see figure 1b in s1 case dissociation is difficult because of the strengthened c i bond and loss of the iodide will generate an unstable carbocation see figure 1c in cross coupling reactions typically vinyl iodides react faster and under more mild conditions than vinyl chloride and vinyl bromide the order of reactivity is based on the strength of carbon halogen bond c i bond is

abzymes are usually raised in lab animals immunized against synthetic haptens but some natural abzymes can be found in normal humans anti vasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies and in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus where they can bind to and hydrolyze dna to date abzymes display only weak modest catalytic activity and have not proved to be of any practical use they are however subjects of considerable academic interest studying them has yielded important insights into reaction mechanisms enzyme structure and function catalysis and the immune system itself enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the transition state of a chemical reaction thereby enabling the formation of an otherwise less favorable molecular intermediate between the reactant s and the product s if an antibody is developed to bind to a molecule that is structurally and electronically similar to the transition state of a given chemical reaction the developed antibody will bind to and stabilize the transition state just like a natural enzyme lowering the activation energy of the reaction and thus catalyzing the reaction by raising an antibody to bind to a stable transition state analog a new and unique type of enzyme is produced so

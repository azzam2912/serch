the c5orf34 protein contains two mammalian conserved domains duf 4520 and duf 4524 the protein is also predicted to have a polo box domain pbd of polo like kinase 4 plk4 which has predicted conservation in distant orthologs from the clade aves c5orf34 is located on the negative dna strand of the short arm of chromosome 6 at locus 12 the gene is 28 744 base pairs long and spans from base pair 43 486 701 to base pair 43 515 445 the gene produces a single transcript of 2 540 base pairs long and encodes for 638 amino acids the gene paip1 is found on the negative strand just downstream of c5orf34 and is a member of the polyadenylate binding family paip1 extends from base pairs 43 526 267 to 43 557 419 ccl28 is found downstream on the negative strand and extends from base pairs 43378052 to 43413837 there indication of multiple sources that suggest in humans c5orf34 protein is expressed non ubiquitously in select tissues at low moderate levels with the most abundant expression in the tissues of the stomach small intestine testis skeletal muscle and heart muscle a study of rho kinase inhibitor effect on primary

it occurs when turbulent fluid systems reach critical conditions in response to shear flow which results from a combination of steep concentration gradients density gradients and high velocities it occurs much more rapidly than molecular diffusion and is therefore extremely important for problems concerning mixing and transport in systems dealing with combustion contaminants dissolved oxygen and solutions in industry in these fields turbulent diffusion acts as an excellent process for quickly reducing the concentrations of a species in a fluid or environment in cases where this is needed for rapid mixing during processing or rapid pollutant or contaminant reduction for safety however it has been extremely difficult to develop a concrete and fully functional model that can be applied to the diffusion of a species in all turbulent systems due to the inability to characterize both an instantaneous and predicted fluid velocity simultaneously in turbulent flow this is a result of several characteristics such as unpredictability rapid diffusivity high levels of fluctuating vorticity and dissipation of kinetic energy atmospheric dispersion or diffusion studies how pollutants are mixed in the environment there are many factors included in this modeling process such as which level of atmosphere s the mixing is taking

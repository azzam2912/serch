an involute of a curve is the locus of a point on a piece of taut string as the string is either unwrapped from or wrapped around the curve it is a class of curves coming under the roulette family of curves the evolute of an involute is the original curve the notions of the involute and evolute of a curve were introduced by christiaan huygens in his work titled horologium oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum ad horologia aptato demonstrationes geometricae 1673 let be formula 1 a regular curve in the plane with its curvature nowhere 0 and formula 2 then the curve with the parametric representation formula 3 is an involute of the given curve adding an arbitrary but fixed number formula 4 to the integral formula 5 results in an involute corresponding to a string extended by formula 4 like a ball of wool yarn having some length of thread already hanging before it is unwound hence the involute can be varied by constant formula 7 and or adding a number to the integral see involutes of a semicubic parabola if formula 8 one gets in order to derive properties of a regular curve it is advantageous to

the mineral crystallizes in the tetragonal crystal system and has been described as a distorted close packed cubic array of s atoms with some of the gaps filled with fe mackinawite occurs as opaque bronze to grey white tabular crystals and anhedral masses it has a mohs hardness of 2 5 and a specific gravity of 4 17 it was first described in 1962 for an occurrence in the mackinaw mine snohomish county washington for which it was named mackinawite occurs in serpentinized peridotites as a hydrothermal alteration product in meteorites and in association with chalcopyrite cubanite pentlandite pyrrhotite greigite maucherite and troilite mackinawite also occurs in reducing environments such as freshwater and marine sediments as a result of the metabolism of iron and sulfate reducing bacteria in anoxic environments mackinawite is formed by the reaction of hs with either fe ions or with fe metal mackinawite is a metastable mineral that occurs predominantly as a poorly crystalline precipitate after the initiation of precipitation mackinawite can take up to 2 years to form at 25 c it has been reported that mackinawite can be stable for up to 16 weeks at temperatures up to 100 c at ph values from

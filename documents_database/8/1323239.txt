this protocol allows two parties to establish private and authenticated communication solely based on their shared low entropy password without requiring a public key infrastructure it provides mutual authentication to the key exchange a feature that is lacking in the diffie hellman key exchange protocol two parties alice and bob agree on a group formula 1 with generator formula 2 of prime order formula 3 in which the discrete log problem is hard typically a schnorr group is used in general j pake can use any prime order group that is suitable for public key cryptography including elliptic curve cryptography let formula 4 be their shared low entropy secret which can be a password or a hash of a password formula 5 the protocol executes in two rounds after round 2 alice computes formula 24 similarly bob computes formula 25 with the same keying material formula 26 alice and bob can derive a session key using a cryptographic hash function formula 27 the two round j pake protocol is completely symmetric this helps significantly simplify the security analysis for example the proof that one party does not leak any password information in the data exchange must hold true for the

the name q machine stems from the original intention of creating a quiescent plasma that is free from the fluctuations that are present in plasmas created in electric discharges the q machine was first described in a publication by rynn and d angelo the q machine plasma is created at a plate that has been heated to about 2000 k and hence is called the hot plate electrons are emitted by the hot plate through thermionic emission and ions are created through contact ionization of atoms of alkali metals that have low ionisation potentials the hot plate is made of a metal that has a large work function and can withstand high temperatures e g tungsten or rhenium the alkali metal is boiled in an oven that is designed to direct a beam of alkaline metal vapour onto the hot plate a high value of the hot plate work function and a low ionisation potential of the metal makes for a low potential barrier for an electron in the alkaline metal to overcome thus making the ionisation process more efficient sometimes barium is used instead of an alkaline metal due to its excellent spectroscopic properties the fractional ionization of a

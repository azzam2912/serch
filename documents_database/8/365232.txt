his 1919 book geometrische kristallographie des diskontinuums played a seminal role in the refinement of space group theory in this book niggli demonstrated that although x ray reflection conditions do not always uniquely determine the space group to which a crystal belongs they do reveal a small number of possible space groups to which it could belong niggli used morphological methods to account for internal structure and in his 1928 kristallographische und strukturtheoretische grundbegriffe he took up what is essentially the reverse process the task of establishing the connection between space lattices and external crystal morphology the great aim of his life was to integrate the whole field of earth sciences in 1920 niggli became the lead scientist at the eth s institut f r mineralogie und petrographie where he brought his systematic approach to the study of crystal morphologies using x ray diffraction in 1935 niggli and his doctoral student werner nowacki 1909 1988 determined the 73 three dimensional arithmetic crystal classes symmorphic space groups niggli retired from the institute in 1949 he was also professor of mineralogy at the eidgen ssische technische hochschule and at the university of zurich niggli succeeded paul heinrich von groth 1843 1927 as

it has been cited about 4 000 times in scientific articles and has been nominated as one of the one hundred most influential works in cognitive science from the 20th century rethinking innateness applied insights from neurobiology and neural network modelling to brain development it questioned whether some of the hard nativist positions such as those adopted by noam chomsky steven pinker and elizabeth spelke are biologically plausible for example the authors challenged a claim by pinker that children are born with innate domain specific knowledge of the principles of grammar by questioning how the knowledge that pinker suggests might actually be encoded in the genes elman et al argue that information concerning something as specific as grammatical rules which they classify as propositional information could only be encoded as pre specified weights between neurons in the cortex but they argue that evidence from a number of sources such as brain plasticity the ability of a brain to change its response properties during development shows that information cannot be hard wired in this way instead they argue that genes might influence brain development by determining a system s architectural constraints by establishing the physical structure of a system they argue

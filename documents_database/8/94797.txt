this technique is typically used to build diaphragm water blocking walls surrounding tunnels and open cuts and to lay foundations while a trench is excavated to create a form for a wall it is simultaneously filled with slurry usually a mixture of bentonite and water the dense but liquid slurry prevents the trench from collapsing by providing outward pressure which balances the inward hydraulic forces and also retards water flow into the trench slurry walls are typically constructed by starting with a set of guide walls typically deep and thick the guide walls are constructed on the ground surface to outline the desired slurry trench and guide the excavation machinery excavation is done using a special clamshell shaped digger or a hydromill trench cutter suspended from a crane the excavator digs down to design depth or bedrock for the first wall segment the excavator is then lifted and moved along the trench guide walls to continue the trench with successive cuts as needed the trench is at all times kept filled with slurry to prevent its collapse but the liquid filling allows the excavation machinery and excavation spoil to be moved without hindrance once a particular length of trench is

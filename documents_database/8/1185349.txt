despite the wealth of gravitational evidence supporting the existence of non baryonic dark matter in the universe dark matter particles in our galaxy have never been directly detected in an experiment lux utilized a 370 kg liquid xenon detection mass in a time projection chamber tpc to identify individual particle interactions searching for faint dark matter interactions with unprecedented sensitivity the lux experiment which cost approximately 10 million to build was located underground at the sanford underground laboratory surf formerly the deep underground science and engineering laboratory or dusel in the homestake mine south dakota in lead south dakota the detector was located in the davis campus former site of the nobel prize winning homestake neutrino experiment led by raymond davis it was operated underground to reduce the background noise signal caused by high energy cosmic rays at the earth s surface the detector was decommissioned in 2016 and is now on display at the sanford lab homestake visitor center the detector was isolated from background particles by a surrounding water tank and the earth above this shielding reduced cosmic rays and radiation interacting with the xenon interactions in liquid xenon generate 175 nm ultraviolet photons and electrons these photons

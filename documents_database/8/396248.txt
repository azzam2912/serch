it was released november 20 2001 on five minute walk records five iron continued their tradition of tongue in cheek lyrics on songs such as pre ex girlfriend and you can t handle this the album also tackles serious issues elevating the social commentary to what hm characterized as a new level of brutal honesty far far away was inspired by the seekers song come the day and the day we killed by dee brown s book bury my heart at wounded knee the latter song references crazy horse an indian chief to speak about racism toward native americans another theme visited on this album is consumerism in vultures and blue mix blue mix specifically addresses practices of the music industry which roper sees as disparaging when copied within the christian music industry practices attacked include blue mixing or limiting opening bands sound so that the headliners sound the best and merchandising controls that raise profit margins at the expense of the band s freedom as roper stated to hm it really bothers me how often that happens in the christian industry it s not okay to do that kind of stuff car is dedicated to the memory of carlos

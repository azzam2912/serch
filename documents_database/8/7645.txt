coli it was discovered by esther lederberg in 1950 the wild type of this virus has a temperate life cycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through lysogeny or enter into a lytic phase during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring lambda strains mutated at specific sites are unable to lysogenize cells instead they grow and enter the lytic cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell the phage particle consists of a head also known as a capsid a tail and tail fibers see image of virus below the head contains the phage s double strand linear dna genome during infection the phage particle recognizes and binds to its host e coli causing dna in the head of the phage to be ejected through the tail into the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell usually a lytic cycle ensues where the lambda dna is replicated and new phage particles are produced within the cell this is followed by cell lysis releasing the cell contents including virions that have been assembled into the environment however under certain conditions the phage dna may integrate itself into the host cell chromosome in the lysogenic

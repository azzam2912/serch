it describes a particular form of the hazard function which comprises three parts the name is derived from the cross sectional shape of a bathtub steep sides and a flat bottom the bathtub curve is generated by mapping the rate of early infant mortality failures when first introduced the rate of random failures with constant failure rate during its useful life and finally the rate of wear out failures as the product exceeds its design lifetime in less technical terms in the early life of a product adhering to the bathtub curve the failure rate is high but rapidly decreasing as defective products are identified and discarded and early sources of potential failure such as handling and installation error are surmounted in the mid life of a product generally speaking for consumer products the failure rate is low and constant in the late life of the product the failure rate increases as age and wear take their toll on the product many electronic consumer product life cycles strongly exhibit the bathtub curve while the bathtub curve is useful not every product or system follows a bathtub curve hazard function for example if units are retired or have decreased use during

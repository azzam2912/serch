zirconium has very low absorption cross section of thermal neutrons high hardness ductility and corrosion resistance one of the main uses of zirconium alloys is in nuclear technology as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors especially water reactors a typical composition of nuclear grade zirconium alloys is more than 95 weight percent zirconium and less than 2 of tin niobium iron chromium nickel and other metals which are added to improve mechanical properties and corrosion resistance the water cooling of reactor zirconium alloys elevates requirement for their resistance to oxidation related nodular corrosion furthermore oxidative reaction of zirconium with water releases hydrogen gas which partly diffuses into the alloy and forms zirconium hydrides the hydrides are less dense and are weaker mechanically than the alloy their formation results in blistering and cracking of the cladding a phenomenon known as hydrogen embrittlement commercial non nuclear grade zirconium typically contains 1 5 of hafnium whose neutron absorption cross section is 600x that of zirconium hafnium must therefore be almost entirely removed reduced to zirconium the absorption cross section for thermal neutrons is 0 18 barn for zirconium which is much lower than that for such common metals as iron 2 4

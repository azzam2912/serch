the structure of bvr b has a single domain architecture consisting of a central parallel beta sheet with alpha helices on either side this characteristic dinucleotide binding fold comprises in this case a seven stranded parallel beta sheet further extended by an antiparallel strand in addition to the seven long strands of the main pleated sheet a short parallel beta sheet strands 6a and 6c is formed within the loop joining strand 6 and alpha helix f the central beta sheet and the two groups of helices are held together mainly through hydrophobic interactions one group of helices is made up of alpha helices c d and e the second group is composed of alpha helices a and f and includes a short 310 helix between strands beta2 and beta3 in contrast to typical dinucleotide binding proteins in which a regular alpha helix flanks these beta strands the most flexible loop in the structure corresponds to loop 120 between strand 5 and alpha helix e which contains residues with the highest main chain b factors with the exception of the n terminal region the final step in heme metabolism in mammals is catalyzed by the cytosolic biliverdin reductase enzymes a

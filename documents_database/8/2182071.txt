b16 cells are useful models for the study of metastasis and solid tumor formation and were one of the first effective murine tools for metastasis research b16 cells were discovered and maintained in the jackson laboratories in maine in 1954 when a tumor developed naturally behind the ear of a c57bl 6 mouse the cells were resected transplanted and maintained in vivo and still are today b16 models were in use to an extent in the 1970s but it was dr isaiah j fidler a jerusalem born oklahoma state trained veterinarian and university of pennsylvania trained biological researcher now at m d anderson cancer center in houston texas who established solid protocols for use the b16 model one of his first major studies involving b16 was in 1970 dr fidler stained b16s having cultured them in vitro with 125i 5 iodo 2 deoxyuridine for tracking and implanted the cells into c57bl 6j mice the common host sacrificed the mice at different times and measured the cells in the blood and in different organs he ascertained that 99 of the original cell population had perished within a day and that a cohort of about 400 cells had colonized the lung the

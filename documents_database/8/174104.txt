mostly granulated plastic early mixtures only added carbon powder and iron oxide however mixtures have since been developed containing polypropylene fumed silica and various minerals for triboelectrification toner using plant derived plastic also exists as an alternative to petroleum plastic toner particles are melted by the heat of the fuser and are thus bonded to the paper in earlier photocopiers this low cost carbon toner was poured by the user from a bottle into a reservoir in the machine later copiers and laser printers from the first 1984 hewlett packard laserjet feed directly from a sealed toner cartridge laser toner cartridges for use in color copiers and printers come in sets of cyan magenta yellow and black cmyk allowing a very large color gamut to be generated by mixing the specific polymer used varies by manufacturer but can be a styrene acrylate copolymer a polyester resin a styrene butadiene copolymer or a few other special polymers toner formulations vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and even from machine to machine typically formulation granule size and melting point vary the most originally the particle size of toner averaged 14 16 micrometres or greater to improve image resolution particle size was reduced eventually

it was developed as a fourth generation refrigerant to replace fluids as r 134a and as a blowing agent for foam and aerosol applications the use of r 134a is being phased out because of its high global warming potential hfo 1234ze e has zero ozone depletion potential odp 0 a very low global warming potential gwp global warming potential gwp of most of the hydro fluoro carbons hfcs several actions are ongoing in different countries to reduce the use of these fluids for example the european union s recent f gas regulation specifies the mandatory gwp values of the refrigerants to be used as working fluids in almost all air conditioners and refrigeration machines beginning in 2020 several types of possible replacement candidates have been proposed so far both synthetic and natural among the synthetic options hydro fluoro olefins hfos are the ones appearing most promising thus far hfo 1234ze e has been adopted as working fluid in chillers heat pumps and supermarket refrigeration systems it has been demonstrated that hfo 1234ze e can not be considered as a drop in replacement of hfc 134a in fact from a thermodynamic point of view it can be stated that the

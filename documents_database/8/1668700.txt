his position led him to expand his researches into the fields of molecular biology and microbiology popov worked at vector from 1976 to 1986 and at obolensk from 1986 until 1992 his work included designer bio agents that would cause the symptoms of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis in which a victim s auto immune system attacks its own body his team inserted genes into viruses to make protein fragments of myelin the sheathing around nerves victims that became infected would develop multiple sclerosis a degenerative disease of the nervous system by splicing myelin into legionella legionnaires disease they also created an agent that caused brain damage paralysis and death the recombinant legionella was very infectious and lethal with only a few cells causing disease at oblensk popov and his team spliced the diphtheria toxin gene into the plague bacterium thus creating a highly virulent and deadly strain popov has described biopreparat s project bonfire whose goal was to develop antibiotic resistant microbial strains and project factor whose goal was to create microbial weapons with new biologic properties that would result in high virulence improved stability and new clinical syndromes in 1992 popov defected to the united kingdom and later traveled

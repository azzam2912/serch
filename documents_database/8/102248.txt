they are all special cases of decompositions over an orthonormal basis of an inner product space here we consider that of square integrable functions defined on an interval of the real line which is important among others for interpolation theory consider a set of square integrable functions with values in formula 1 which are pairwise orthogonal for the inner product where w x is a weight function and formula 4 represents complex conjugation i e formula 5 for formula 6 the generalized fourier series of a square integrable function f a b formula 7 with respect to is then where the coefficients are given by if is a complete set i e an orthonormal basis of the space of all square integrable functions on a b as opposed to a smaller orthonormal set the relation formula 10 becomes equality in the l sense more precisely modulo not necessarily pointwise nor almost everywhere the legendre polynomials are solutions to the sturm liouville problem and because of sturm liouville theory these polynomials are eigenfunctions of the problem and are solutions orthogonal with respect to the inner product above with unit weight so we can form a generalized fourier series known as a

depending on the fluid in question and the context being referred to it may also vary significantly in dimensions perpendicular to elevation as well and these variations have relevance in the context of pressure gradient force and its effects however the vertical variation is especially significant as it results from the pull of gravity on the fluid namely for the same given fluid a decrease in elevation within it corresponds to a taller column of fluid weighing down on that point a relatively simple version of the vertical fluid pressure variation is simply that the pressure difference between two elevations is the product of elevation change gravity and density the equation is as follows where the delta symbol indicates a change in a given variable since is negative an increase in height will correspond to a decrease in pressure which fits with the previously mentioned reasoning about the weight of a column of fluid when density and gravity are approximately constant that is for relatively small changes in height simply multiplying height difference gravity and density will yield a good approximation of pressure difference where different fluids are layered on top of one another the total pressure difference would be

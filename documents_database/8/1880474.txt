polarized leukocytes move using amoeboid cell migration mechanisms with a small leading edge main cell body and posterior uropod protrusion cytoskeleton contraction and extension controlled by various polarized signals helps propel the cell body forward leukocyte polarization is an important requirement for migration activation and apoptosis in the adaptive and innate immune systems most leukocytes including monocytes granulocytes and t and b lymphocytes migrate to and from primary and secondary lymphoid organs to tissues to initiate immune responses to pathogens amoeboid cell migration mechanisms enable rapid movement without strong adhesion to tissue and that doesn t harm cell tissues as opposed to other types of cell migration the cell is also able to interact and integrate environmental signals so it can quickly find and follow chemical signals left by other cells or pathogens amoeboid movement generally consists of four main stages of movement in more detail after receptors on the cell recognize extracellular signals cell contents are polarized to create different front and rear environments already adhesion forces between the substrate and cell are present in the form of integrin icam binding between cells the uropod protrusion extends from the cell body due to actin polymerization and actomyosin extension as

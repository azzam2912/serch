the star is thought to be similar to the sun with nearly the same mass radius and luminosity in 1997 an extrasolar planet was announced on the basis of radial velocity measurements this detection method gives only a minimum mass on the planet follow up studies with the hipparcos satellite indicate that the companion is actually low mass star in a nearly face on orbit rho coronae borealis is a solar analog yellow dwarf star of the spectral type g0 2va the star is thought to have only 95 percent of the sun s mass along with 1 31 times its radius and 1 61 of its luminosity it may only be 51 to 65 percent as enriched with elements heavier than hydrogen based on its abundance of iron and may be somewhat older than the sun at around six billion years old a companion initially thought to be an extrasolar planet in a 39 6 day orbit was discovered in 1997 by observing the star s radial velocity variations this detection method only gives a lower limit on the true mass of the companion in 2001 preliminary hipparcos astrometrical satellite data indicated that the orbital inclination of the star

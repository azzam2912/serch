in humans it contains 34 exons and it is 108 834 base pairs long including introns and exons c9orf84 is located between the protein encoding genes gng10 and ugcg when this gene is transcribed in humans it most often forms a mrna which is 4 721 base pairs long and contains 26 exons there are at least 13 alternate splice forms of c9orf84 with more predicted c9orf84 in humans has at least 6 alternate isoforms with at least 10 more predicted the primarily used sequence in humans is c9orf84 isoform 1 this isoform is 1444 aa long contains 26 exons has a predicted molecular weight of 165 190 kda and a predicted pi of 5 10 c9orf84 has been show to undergo phosphorylation it is predicted that c9orf84 undergoes several other post translational modifications including glycosylation and o linked glycosylation and it contains leucine rich nuclear export signals compared to the generic reference set swp23s q the primary structure of the protein is deficient in the amino acid grouping agp alanine glycine proline and contains more acidic amino acids glutamate aspartate than basic amino acids lysine arginine this is true for the protein in all vertebrates in the human isoform

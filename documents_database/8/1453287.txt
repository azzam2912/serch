it is possible to make pieces of superconductor with a large built in persistent current either by creating the superconducting state cooling the material while charge is flowing through it or by changing the magnetic field around the superconductor after creating the superconducting state this principle is used in superconducting electromagnets to generate sustained high magnetic fields that only require a small amount of power to maintain the persistent current was first identified by h kamerlingh onnes and attempts to set a lower bound on their duration have reached values of over 100 000 years surprisingly it is also possible to have tiny persistent currents inside resistive metals that are placed in a magnetic field even in metals that are nominally non magnetic the current is the result of a quantum mechanical effect that influences how electrons travel through metals and arises from the same kind of motion that allows the electrons inside an atom to orbit the nucleus forever this type of persistent current is a mesoscopic low temperature effect the magnitude of the current becomes appreciable when the size of the metallic system is reduced to the scale of the electron quantum phase coherence length and the thermal

the rigid nature of the platters in a hard drive is what gives them their name as opposed to the flexible materials which are used to make floppy disks hard drives typically have several platters which are mounted on the same spindle a platter can store information on both sides requiring two heads per platter the magnetic surface of each platter is divided into small sub micrometer sized magnetic regions each of which is used to represent a single binary unit of information a typical magnetic region on a hard disk platter as of 2006 is about 200 250 nanometers wide in the radial direction of the platter and extends about 25 30 nanometers in the down track direction the circumferential direction on the platter corresponding to about 100 billion bits per square inch of disk area 15 5 gbit cm the material of the main magnetic medium layer is usually a cobalt based alloy in today s hard drives each of these magnetic regions is composed of a few hundred magnetic grains which are the base material that gets magnetized as a whole each magnetic region will have a magnetization one reason magnetic grains are used as opposed to

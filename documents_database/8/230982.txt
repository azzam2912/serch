it is also related to the theory of lie groups and lie algebras the statement of the theorem is as follows in both parts of the theorem the expression formula 17 is defined by means of the spectral theorem for unbounded self adjoint operators the operator formula 11 is called the infinitesimal generator of formula 19 furthermore formula 11 will be a bounded operator if and only if the operator valued mapping formula 21 is norm continuous the infinitesimal generator formula 11 of a strongly continuous unitary group formula 2 may be computed as with the domain of formula 11 consisting of those vectors formula 26 for which the limit exists in the norm topology that is to say formula 11 is equal to formula 28 times the derivative of formula 29 with respect to formula 30 at formula 31 part of the statement of the theorem is that this derivative exists i e that formula 11 is a densely defined self adjoint operator the result is not obvious even in the finite dimensional case since formula 29 is only assumed ahead of time to be continuous and not differentiable the family of translation operators is a one parameter unitary

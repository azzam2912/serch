conformal antennas were developed in the 1980s as avionics antennas integrated into the curving skin of military aircraft to reduce aerodynamic drag replacing conventional antenna designs which project from the aircraft surface military aircraft and missiles are the largest application of conformal antennas but they are also used in some civilian aircraft military ships and land vehicles as the cost of the required processing technology comes down they are being considered for use in civilian applications such as train antennas car radio antennas and cellular base station antennas to save space and also to make the antenna less visually intrusive by integrating it into existing objects conformal antennas are a form of phased array antenna they are composed of an array of many identical small flat antenna elements such as dipole horn or patch antennas covering the surface at each antenna the current from the transmitter passes through a phase shifter device which are all controlled by a microprocessor computer by controlling the phase of the feed current the nondirectional radio waves emitted by the individual antennas can be made to combine in front of the antenna by the process of interference forming a strong beam or beams of radio

the respiratory center is made up of three major respiratory groups of neurons two in the medulla and one in the pons in the medulla they are the dorsal respiratory group and the ventral respiratory group in the pons the pontine respiratory group includes two areas known as the pneumotaxic centre and the apneustic centre the respiratory centre is responsible for generating and maintaining the rhythm of respiration and also of adjusting this in homeostatic response to physiological changes the respiratory center receives input from chemoreceptors mechanoreceptors the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamus in order to regulate the rate and depth of breathing input is stimulated by altered levels of oxygen carbon dioxide and blood ph by hormonal changes relating to stress and anxiety from the hypothalamus and also by signals from the cerebral cortex to give a conscious control of respiration injury to respiratory groups can cause various breathing disorders that may require mechanical ventilation and is usually associated with a poor prognosis the respiratory centre is divided into three major groups two in the medulla and one in the pons the two groups in the medulla are the dorsal respiratory group and the ventral respiratory group in the

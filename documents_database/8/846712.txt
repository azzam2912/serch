the so core is a sulfate group and the r group is any organic residue all organosulfates are formally esters derived from alcohols and sulfuric acid although many are not prepared in this way many sulfate esters are used in detergents and some are useful reagents alkyl sulfates consist of a hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain a polar sulfate group containing an anion and either a cation or amine to neutralize the sulfate group examples include sodium lauryl sulfate also known as sulfuric acid mono dodecyl ester sodium salt and related potassium and ammonium salts alkyl sulfates are commonly used as an anionic surfactant in liquid soaps and detergents used to clean wool as surface cleaners and as active ingredients in laundry detergents shampoos and conditioners they can also be found in household products such as toothpaste antacids cosmetics and foods generally they are found in consumer products at concentrations ranging from 3 20 in 2003 approximately 118 000 t a of alkyl sulfates were used in the us a common example is sodium lauryl sulfate with the formula ch ch osona also common in consumer products are the sulfate esters of ethoxylated fatty alcohols such as those derived from lauryl alcohol

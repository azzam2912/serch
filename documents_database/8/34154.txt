the systematic name of the anion is dioxide 1 the reactive oxygen anion superoxide is particularly important as the product of the one electron reduction of dioxygen o which occurs widely in nature molecular oxygen dioxygen is a diradical containing two unpaired electrons and superoxide results from the addition of an electron which fills one of the two degenerate molecular orbitals leaving a charged ionic species with a single unpaired electron and a net negative charge of 1 both dioxygen and the superoxide anion are free radicals that exhibit paramagnetism superoxide forms salts with alkali metals and alkaline earth metals the salts cso rbo ko and nao are prepared by the reaction of o with the respective alkali metal the alkali salts of are orange yellow in color and quite stable provided they are kept dry upon dissolution of these salts in water however the dissolved undergoes disproportionation dismutation extremely rapidly in a ph dependent manner this reaction with moisture and carbon dioxide in exhaled air is the basis of the use of potassium superoxide as an oxygen source in chemical oxygen generators such as those used on the space shuttle and on submarines superoxides are also used in firefighters

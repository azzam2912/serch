the united states defence advanced research projects agency darpa awarded northrop grumman a us 10 3 million contract for risk reduction and preliminary planning for an x plane oblique flying wing demonstrator the program aimed at producing a technology demonstrator aircraft to explore the various challenges which the radical design entails the proposed aircraft would be a purely flying wing an aircraft with no other auxiliary surfaces such as tails canards or a fuselage where the wing is swept with one side of the aircraft forward and one backwards in an asymmetric fashion this aircraft configuration is believed to give it a combination of high speed long range and long endurance the program entailed two phases phase i explored the theory and result in a conceptual design while phase ii would have resulted in the design manufacture and flight test of an aircraft the outcome of the program would have resulted in a dataset that could then be used when considering future military aircraft designs flight of the switchblade was scheduled for 2020 with its 61 meter long oblique wing perpendicular to its engines like a typical aircraft as the aircraft increased speed the wing begins to pivot so that

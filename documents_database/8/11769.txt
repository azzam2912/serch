the theory covers approaches to statistical decision problems and to statistical inference and the actions and deductions that satisfy the basic principles stated for these different approaches within a given approach statistical theory gives ways of comparing statistical procedures it can find a best possible procedure within a given context for given statistical problems or can provide guidance on the choice between alternative procedures apart from philosophical considerations about how to make statistical inferences and decisions much of statistical theory consists of mathematical statistics and is closely linked to probability theory to utility theory and to optimization statistical theory provides an underlying rationale and provides a consistent basis for the choice of methodology used in applied statistics statistical models describe the sources of data and can have different types of formulation corresponding to these sources and to the problem being studied such problems can be of various kinds statistical models once specified can be tested to see whether they provide useful inferences for new data sets testing a hypothesis using the data that was used to specify the model is a fallacy according to the natural science of bacon and the scientific method of peirce statistical theory provides a guide

it was extended and published in the 1987 book neural darwinism the theory of neuronal group selection in 1972 edelman was awarded the nobel prize in medicine or physiology shared with rodney porter of great britain for his work in immunology showing how the population of lymphocytes capable of binding to a foreign antigen is increased by differential clonal multiplication following antigen discovery essentially this proved that the human body is capable of creating complex adaptive systems as a result of local events with feedback edelman s interest in selective systems expanded into the fields of neurobiology and neurophysiology and in neural darwinism edelman puts forth a theory called neuronal group selection it contains three major parts with neuronal heterogeneity by edelman called degeneracy it is possible to test the many circuits on the order of 30 billion neurons with an estimated one quadrillion connections between them in the human brain with a diverse set of inputs to see which neuronal groups respond appropriately statistically functional distributed widespread brain circuits thus emerge as a result edelman goes into some detail about how brain development depends on a variety of cell adhesion molecules cams and substrate adhesion molecules sams on cell

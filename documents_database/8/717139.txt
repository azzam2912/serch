a typical physical recording console has a pan control for each incoming source channel a pan control or pan pot short for panning potentiometer is an analog control with a position indicator which can range continuously from the 7 o clock when fully left to the 5 o clock position fully right audio mixing software replaces pan pots with on screen virtual knobs or sliders which function like their physical counterparts a pan pot has an internal architecture which determines how much of a source signal is sent to the left and right buses pan pots split audio signals into left and right channels each equipped with its own discrete gain volume control this signal distribution is often called a taper or law when centered at 12 o clock the law can be designed to send 3 4 5 or 6 decibels db equally to each bus signal passes through both the channels at an equal volume while the pan pot points directly north if the two output buses are later recombined into a monaural signal then a pan law of 6 db is desirable if the two output buses are to remain stereo then a law of 3 db

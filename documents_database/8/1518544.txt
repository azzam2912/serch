these polytopes were studied by constantin carath odory david gale theodore motzkin victor klee and others they play an important role in polyhedral combinatorics according to the upper bound theorem proved by peter mcmullen and richard stanley the boundary n d of the cyclic polytope c n d maximizes the number f of i dimensional faces among all simplicial spheres of dimension d 1 with n vertices the moment curve in formula 1 is defined by the formula 3 dimensional cyclic polytope with formula 4 vertices is the convex hull of formula 6 distinct points formula 7 with formula 8 on the moment curve the combinatorial structure of this polytope is independent of the points chosen and the resulting polytope has dimension d and n vertices its boundary is a d 1 dimensional simplicial polytope denoted n d the gale evenness condition provides a necessary and sufficient condition to determine a facet on a cyclic polytope let formula 9 then a formula 3 subset formula 11 forms a facet of formula 12 iff any two elements in formula 13 are separated by an even number of elements from formula 14 in the sequence formula 15 cyclic polytopes are examples of

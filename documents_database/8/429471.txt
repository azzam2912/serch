it is also called the vitreous lamina because of its glassy microscopic appearance it is 2 4 m thick bruch s membrane consists of five layers from inside to outside the retinal pigment epithelium transports metabolic waste from the photoreceptors across bruch s membrane to the choroid bruch s membrane is present by midterm in fetal development as an elastic sheet bruch s membrane thickens with age slowing the transport of metabolites this may lead to the formation of drusen in age related macular degeneration there is also a buildup of deposits basal linear deposits or blind and basal lamellar deposits blamd on and within the membrane primarily consisting of phospholipids the accumulation of lipids appears to be greater in the central fundus than in the periphery this build up seems to fragment the membrane into a lamellar structure more like puff pastry than a barrier inflammatory and neovascular mediators can then invite choroidal vessels to grow into and beyond the fragmented membrane this neovascular membrane destroys the architecture of the outer retina and leads to sudden loss of central vision wet age related macular degeneration pseudoxanthoma elasticum myopia and trauma can also cause defects in bruch s membrane which

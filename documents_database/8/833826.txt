it demonstrates materials microstructural and atomic length scale behavior by modelling the 111 plane of a close packed crystal a material s observable and measurable mechanical properties strongly depend on its atomic and microstructural configuration and characteristics this fact is intentionally ignored in continuum mechanics which assumes a material to have no underlying microstructure and be uniform and semi infinite throughout bubble rafts assemble bubbles on a water surface often with the help of amphiphilic soaps these assembled bubbles act like atoms diffusing slipping ripening straining and otherwise deforming in a way that models the behavior of the 111 plane of a close packed crystal the ideal lowest energy state of the assembly would undoubtedly be a perfectly regular single crystal but just as in metals the bubbles often form defects grain boundaries and multiple crystals the concept of bubble raft modelling was first presented in 1947 by nobel laureate sir william lawrence bragg and john nye of cambridge university s cavendish laboratory in proceedings of the royal society a 1 legend claims that bragg conceived of bubble raft models while pouring oil into his lawn mower he noticed that bubbles on the surface of the oil assembled into rafts

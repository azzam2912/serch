the migration of the growth cone is mediated through the interaction of numerous trophic and tropic factors netrins slits ephrins and semaphorins are four well studied tropic cues the growth cone is capable of modifying its sensitivity to these guidance molecules as it migrates to its target this sensitivity regulation is an important theme seen throughout development netrins are diffusible chemoattractive molecules that guide commissural axons across the midline they are secreted by floor plate cells at ventral midline of the spinal cord netrins establish a gradient to direct commissural axons at a distance netrin 2 is expressed broadly in the ventral two thirds of the spinal cord but not in the floor plate mice with netrin 1 loss of function exhibit severe disruption in commissural axon migration this experiment established the importance of netrin 1 in guidance decisions netrin 1 gradient in xenopus laevis ganglion cell can induce turning of retinal growth cones in vitro to steer axons out of the retina netrin unc 6 caenorhabditis elegans homologue and its corresponding receptor dcc deleted in colorectal cancer were initially identified as an attractive interaction dcc expressed by commissural axons binds to netrin with high affinity inhibiting netrin dcc signaling

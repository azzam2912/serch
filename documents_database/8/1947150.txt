they are normally constructed from mild steel channel sections supported at the head and the foot between floor slab levels and or the principal steelwork sections forming the structural frame of the building in cavity walls the windpost will typically be fixed into the inner and outer leafs of the wall by specialist fixings and fastenings at regular intervals along its length the windposts will be spaced along the walls of the building at regular intervals as calculated by the engineer to suit the required loadings in most cases a windpost is a large and very unwieldy element that can often weigh in excess of 400kg the manufacture and delivery of both steel and concrete windposts has a significant carbon footprint and once delivered to site their storage requires large areas to be set aside the procurement of windposts including the design process often requires a lead time of four to five weeks the length and weight of windposts makes them particularly difficult to manoeuvre into position in confined spaces when installed as part of an internal wall significant health and safety risks exist for the installers in lifting the windpost to its vertical position there is no recognised mechanical

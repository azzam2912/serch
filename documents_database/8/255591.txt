almost all scale invariant qfts are also conformally invariant the study of such theories is conformal field theory the coupling parameters of a quantum field theory can run even if the corresponding classical field theory is scale invariant in this case the non zero beta function tells us that the classical scale invariance is anomalous beta functions are usually computed in some kind of approximation scheme an example is perturbation theory where one assumes that the coupling parameters are small one can then make an expansion in powers of the coupling parameters and truncate the higher order terms also known as higher loop contributions due to the number of loops in the corresponding feynman graphs here are some examples of beta functions computed in perturbation theory the one loop beta function in quantum electrodynamics qed is or equivalently written in terms of the fine structure constant in natural units this beta function tells us that the coupling increases with increasing energy scale and qed becomes strongly coupled at high energy in fact the coupling apparently becomes infinite at some finite energy resulting in a landau pole however one cannot expect the perturbative beta function to give accurate results at strong

this catastrophic impact event resulted in what is one of the best exposed and has become the most accurately dated impact events it occurred within the frasnian age of the devonian at about 367 ma a moment in time that was about 3 5 ma prior to the frasnian famennian extinction events which it is unlikely to have affected the actual impact site has not yet been significantly documented even its precise diameter and its internal structural features are not yet clear enough to make speculations on the mass and trajectory genuinely useful the tectonic overprint the subsequent geologic modifications since the event have distorted the picture the distribution of the breccia has been compressed and skewed by west to east thrust faults across the area insufficient detail does not permit a precise reconstruction of the devonian paleogeography beyond the fact that it was a wet target impact in a reef front where carbonates were being built up in marine shallows the impact site contains megabreccia of gigantic displaced blocks together with several attributes familiar from other impact sites shocked quartz elevated iridium levels and spherical lapilli john e warme one of the geologists who first recognized the geologic anomalies

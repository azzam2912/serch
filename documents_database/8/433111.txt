areas from food processing including brewing beer to thermal design of building to biomedical devices to pollution control and global warming require knowledge of how energy and mass can be transported through materials mass momentum heat transfer cell therapy bioprocessing is a discipline that bridges the fields of cell therapy and bioprocessing i e biopharmaceutical manufacturing and is a sub field of bioprocess engineering the goals of cell therapy bioprocessing are to establish reproducible and robust manufacturing processes for the production of therapeutic cells commercially relevant bioprocesses will therapeutic cell manufacturing processes can be separated into upstream processes and downstream processes the upstream process is defined as the entire process from early cell isolation and cultivation to cell banking and culture expansion of the cells until final harvest termination of the culture and collection of the live cell batch aside from technology challenges concerning the scalability of culture apparatus a number of raw material supply risks have emerged in recent years including the availability of gmp grade fetal bovine serum the upstream part of a bioprocess refers to the first step in which microbes cells are grown e g bacterial or mammalian cell lines see cell culture in bioreactors upstream

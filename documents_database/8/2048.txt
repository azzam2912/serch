in particular it is concerned with the condensed phases that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong the most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids which arise from the electromagnetic forces between atoms condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws in particular they include the laws of quantum mechanics electromagnetism and statistical mechanics more exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase exhibited by certain materials at low temperature the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on crystal lattices of atoms and the bose einstein condensate found in ultracold atomic systems the study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of theoretical physics to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior the diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics one third of all american physicists self identify as condensed matter physicists and the division of condensed matter physics is the largest division at the american physical society the field overlaps with chemistry materials science

originally a single tunnel that opened to traffic in 1957 it was called the lehigh tunnel to avoid confusion with the existing kittatinny mountain tunnel on the mainline the tunnel was twinned in 1991 to allow two lanes of traffic in each direction it has an unusual appearance as the original northbound tunnel is rectangular as it used the older dig and blast technique while the new tube is oval having been constructed using the new austrian tunnelling method from 1980 to 1996 the northeast extension was designated as pennsylvania route 9 as opposing traffic faced each other in the single tube prior to the opening of the current southbound tube and therefore did not qualify for interstate highway status which was granted five years after the completion of the southbound tube the lehigh tunnel crosses the border between lehigh county and carbon county it is the only road tunnel crossed by the appalachian trail howard m sexton a 70 year old truck driver from new jersey was killed in the southbound lehigh tunnel on february 21 2018 when an electrical conduit broke free from the tunnel s ceiling and fell through the windshield of his truck striking him in

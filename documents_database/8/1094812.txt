nuclear monitoring can be done remotely or during onsite inspections of nuclear facilities data exploitation results in characterization of nuclear weapons reactors and materials a number of systems detect and monitor the world for nuclear explosions as well as nuclear materials production according to the united states department of defense masint is technically derived intelligence excluding traditional imagery imint and signals intelligence sigint that when collected processed and analyzed by dedicated masint systems results in intelligence that detects tracks identifies or describes the signatures distinctive characteristics of fixed or dynamic target sources masint was recognized as a formal intelligence discipline in 1986 materials intelligence is one of the major masint disciplines as with most masint subdisciplines nuclear masint overlaps with others radiation survey under nuclear masint is an area operation or will measure the effects on specific people or things nuclear test analysis on the other hand focuses on the field or reference laboratory analysis of samples from air sampling contaminated sites etc as with many branches of masint specific techniques may overlap with the six major conceptual disciplines of masint defined by the center for masint studies and research which divides masint into electro optical nuclear geophysical radar materials

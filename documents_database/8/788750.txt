many different stimuli including growth factors cytokines virus infection ligands for heterotrimeric g protein coupled receptors transforming agents and carcinogens activate the erk pathway the term extracellular signal regulated kinases is sometimes used as a synonym for mitogen activated protein kinase mapk but has more recently been adopted for a specific subset of the mammalian mapk family in the mapk erk pathway ras activates c raf followed by mitogen activated protein kinase kinase abbreviated as mkk mek or map2k and then mapk1 2 below ras is typically activated by growth hormones through receptor tyrosine kinases and grb2 sos but may also receive other signals erks are known to activate many transcription factors such as elk1 and some downstream protein kinases disruption of the erk pathway is common in cancers especially ras c raf and receptors such as her2 mitogen activated protein kinase 1 mapk1 is also known as extracellular signal regulated kinase 2 erk2 two similar 85 sequence identity protein kinases were originally called erk1 and erk2 they were found during a search for protein kinases that are rapidly phosphorylated after activation of cell surface tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation of erks leads to the

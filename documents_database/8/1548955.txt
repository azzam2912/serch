it is called touch dna because it only requires very small samples for example from the skin cells left on an object after it has been touched or casually handled or from footprints touch dna analysis only requires seven or eight cells from the outermost layer of human skin the technique has been criticized for high rates of false positives due to contamination for example fingerprint brushes used by crime scene investigators can transfer trace amounts of skin cells from one surface to another leading to inaccurate results because of the risk of false positives it is more often used by the defense to help exclude a suspect rather than the prosecution the technique is very similar to low copy number dna analysis to the extent that court rulings have sometimes confused the two however in lcn dna analysis the dna goes through additional cycles of pcr amplification touch dna relies on the str analysis of cells collected off of objects upon collection the cells dna is extracted and 13 genomic locations that vary among individuals are assessed to confirm suspects or exonerate those that are innocent

it is used aboard polar orbiting near earth weather satellite programs such as metop and npoess lrpt provides three image channels at full sensor resolution 10 bit 1 km pixel six lines second in addition to data from other sensors such as atmospheric sounders and gps positioning information the system is an update and replacement of the existing analog system called automatic picture transmission apt which has been used since the 1960s aboard noaa s tiros polar orbiting satellites the apt system provided only two image channels which were at a reduced accuracy and resolution 8 bit 4 km pixel two lines second compared to the apt system lrpt images are four times more accurate and contain twelve times the resolution further the additional data from other sensors increases the applications of the satellites and the users who receive the signal lrpt uses a packetized datastream transmitted at an approximately 62 kilobits per second kbit s rate each sensor using the lrpt is considered an application and provided a percentage of the transmission bandwidth in the form of a virtual channel for example the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr imaging sensor is provided approximately 40 kbit s to transmit

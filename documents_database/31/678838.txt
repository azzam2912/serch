daidzein and other isoflavones are produced in plants through the phenylpropanoid pathway of secondary metabolism and are used as signal carriers and defense responses to pathogenic attacks in humans recent research has shown the viability of using daidzein in medicine for menopausal relief osteoporosis blood cholesterol and lowering the risk of some hormone related cancers and heart disease daidzein and other isoflavone compounds such as genistein are present in a number of plants and herbs like kwao krua pueraria mirifica and kudzu pueraria lobata it can also be found in maackia amurensis cell cultures daidzein can be found in food such as soybeans and soy products like tofu and textured vegetable protein soy isoflavones are a group of compounds found in and isolated from the soybean of note total isoflavones in soybeans are in general 37 percent daidzein 57 percent genistein and 6 percent glycitein according to usda data soy germ contains 41 7 percent daidzein the isoflavonoid pathway has long been studied because of its prevalence in a wide variety of plant species including as pigmentation in many flowers as well as serving as signals in plants and microbes the isoflavone synthase ifs enzyme was suggested to be a

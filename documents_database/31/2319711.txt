george hourani indicated that the iqtisad and mizan al amal were completed before or during ghazali s crisis of faith it led him to abandon his notorious post at the ni amiyya school in baghdad and enter the path of tasawwuf in it he offers what scholars consider as the best defence of the ash arite school of islamic theology he also expressed strong reservations about a theology based on taqlid and marked by polemics in this book ghazali makes an attempt to respond to the extreme literalists and the mu tazilites it is the balance between reason and revelation that led to the title of book the moderation in belief ghazali begins the book with praise for god and importance of revelation on one hand he says a person who is not guided by reason will misunderstand the revelation while on the other hand a rationalist may exceed the limits leading to rejection of the plain meaning of revelation the right course he says is to reconcile reason with revelation one that puts reason at the service of understanding and then interprets the revelation reason together with the revelation is light upon light as mentioned in quran chapter 24

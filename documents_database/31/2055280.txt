it was driven by romain grosjean and pastor maldonado this was the team s only car to use mercedes engines after a 20 year partnership with renault the e23 hybrid was also the first enstone based car to be powered by an engine other than renault s since the ford powered benetton b194 in images of the 2015 car were released on 26 january 2015 the lotus mercedes partnership was originally intended to last for six years until 2020 but was terminated five years earlier as the team returned to renault power unit and thus bought lotus stake from 2016 onwards the car was considered an improvement compared to the disastrous lotus e22 which suffered from reliability issues and struggling for competitiveness due to the underpowered and unreliable renault power unit and the fundamental flaws of the e22 chassis however both driver errors and unreliability cost the team points finishes in many races limiting the car s potential of consistent points scoring maldonado retired in 5 out of the first 6 races either due to collisions or car problems grosjean and maldonado collided with each other in spain and britain a highlight of the season however was grosjean s podium

synthesis of silylones generally involves the use of sterically bulky carbenes to stabilize highly reactive si 0 centers for this reason silylones are sometimes referred to siladicarbenes to date silylones have been synthesized with cyclic alkyl amino carbenes caac and bidentate n heterocyclic carbenes bis nhc they are capable of reactions with a variety of substrates including chalcogens and carbon dioxide the structure of carbene stabilized silylones were first predicted using theoretical calculations by gernot frenking and coworkers in 2009 their theoretical study of silylones was inspired from the development and synthesis of carbones an analogous structure containing carbon 0 stabilized by two donor acceptor ligand interactions it was also inspired by previous reports of trisilaallene a silylene complex featuring a bent geometry about the si si si center the unexpected bent trisilaallene bond angle was dissimilar that of carbon allenes c c c yet like that of nhc stabilized carbones towards the goal of rationalizing this structure and to investigate silylones in general the authors analyzed the energetics of di coordinated model complexes of silicon 0 lsi and carbon 0 lc more specifically the analysis was conducted using boron trihydride bh binding analysis and proton affinity analysis at the

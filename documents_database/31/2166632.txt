randall collegiate professor of physics at the university of michigan his research interests include the production and manipulation of ultrafast pulses in particular for applications in studying light matter interactions cundiff is a fellow of american physical society the optical society of america and the institute of electrical and electronics engineers he is the co author with jun ye of the standard reference for frequency combs titled femtosecond optical frequency comb principle operation and applications cundiff s research interests broadly encompasses nonlinear light matter interactions and advancing ultrafast optical technologies multi dimensional coherent optical spectroscopy mdcs is an analogue of nmr spectroscopy at optical frequencies initially mdcs was primarily applied to study of molecular systems but the cundiff research group pioneered its application to atomic vapors and semiconductor nanostructures in the cundiff group s study of atomic vapors using mdcs notable results include direct detection of doubly excited states induced by dipole dipole interactions and an advance via acquisition of three dimensional spectra towards complete characterization of the atomic vapor hamiltonian a main focus of cundiff has been the application of mdcs to spectroscopy of semiconductor nanostructures and his group has achieved several milestones in quantum well nanostructures mdcs was

the series was about a retired jazz musician named jack evans hal linden who runs a restaurant where romances tend to start the waitress chelsea was played by finola hughes and the bartender greg was played by john dye a first attempt at the series in 1991 starred lou rawls in a never aired pilot abc liked the idea but not the execution i guess his successor hal linden said the following year so they hired a new producer scott brazil who rewrote it recast it and got me on board linden speculated that his casting came from the character being a former musician and bandleader performer and so am i maybe they were going on that the show was slated to simply be shown in the summer but did well enough in the ratings that abc decided to pick up the series for more episodes although initially having some success with audiences reviews tended toward the negative hence entertainment weekly deemed it drearily sentimental and banal while jon burlingame was slightly more positive describing it as a happy and unthreatening both reviewers compared it to the love boat and cheers

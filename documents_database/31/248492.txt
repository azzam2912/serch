the energy of the vacuum is zero by definition and assuming that all energy states can be thought of as particles in plane waves the mass gap is the mass of the lightest particle since the energies of exact i e nonperturbative energy eigenstates are spread out and therefore they are not technically eigenstates a more precise definition is that the mass gap is the greatest lower bound of the energy of any state which is orthogonal to the vacuum the analog of a mass gap in many body physics on a discrete lattice arises from a gapped hamiltonian for a given real valued quantum field formula 1 where formula 2 we can say that the theory has a mass gap if the two point function has the property with formula 4 being the lowest energy value in the spectrum of the hamiltonian and thus the mass gap this quantity easy to generalize to other fields is what is generally measured in lattice computations it was proved in this way that yang mills theory develops a mass gap on a lattice the corresponding time ordered value the propagator will have the property with the constant being finite a typical example

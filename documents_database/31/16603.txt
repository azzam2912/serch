it is based on the idea that the device nonlinearity can be modeled using a low order polynomial derived by means of taylor series expansion the third order intercept point relates nonlinear products caused by the third order nonlinear term to the linearly amplified signal in contrast to the second order intercept point that uses second order terms ip is the generally accepted unambiguous term for the third order intercept point although one occasionally sees the use of toi for this figure of merit such use is considered as incorrect by experts in the field the intercept point is a purely mathematical concept and does not correspond to a practically occurring physical power level in many cases it lies far beyond the damage threshold of the device two different definitions for intercept points are in use it is worth noticing that these definitions differ by 4 8 db 10 log 3 so care should be taken when using existing equations models or measurement data the intercept point is obtained graphically by plotting the output power versus the input power both on logarithmic scales e g decibels two curves are drawn one for the linearly amplified signal at an input tone

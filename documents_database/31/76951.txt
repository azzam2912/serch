this history begins at the time of the council of clermont deals with the fortunes of the first crusade and the earlier history of the latin kingdom of jerusalem and ends somewhat abruptly in 1121 the historia was well known during the middle ages and was largely used by william archbishop of tyre for the first six books of his belli sacri historia in modern times it was accepted unreservedly for many years by most historians including edward gibbon in more recent times its historical value has been seriously impugned but the verdict of the best scholarship seems to be that in general it forms a true record of the events of the first crusade although containing some legendary matter albert never visited the holy land but he appears to have had a considerable amount of discourse with returned crusaders and to have had access to valuable correspondence unlike many other chronicles of the first crusade albert did not rely on the gesta francorum but used his own independent interviews he may also have had access to the chanson d antioche as his work shares textual similarities with that poem the first edition of the history was published at helmstedt

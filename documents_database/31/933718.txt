in that way regular categories recapture many properties of abelian categories like the existence of images without requiring additivity at the same time regular categories provide a foundation for the study of a fragment of first order logic known as regular logic a category c is called regular if it satisfies the following three properties examples of regular categories include the following categories are not regular in a regular category the regular epimorphisms and the monomorphisms form a factorization system every morphism f x y can be factorized into a regular epimorphism e x e followed by a monomorphism m e y so that f me the factorization is unique in the sense that if e x e is another regular epimorphism and m e y is another monomorphism such that f m e then there exists an isomorphism h e e such that he e and m h m the monomorphism m is called the image of f in a regular category a diagram of the form formula 1 is said to be an exact sequence if it is both a coequalizer and a kernel pair the terminology is a generalization of exact sequences in homological algebra in an

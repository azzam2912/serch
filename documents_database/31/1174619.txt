these systems formed part of the first generation of systems based on the 64 bit alpha axp architecture and at the time of introduction ran digital s openvms axp or osf 1 axp operating systems the dec 4000 axp was succeeded by the end of 1994 by the alphaserver 2000 and 2100 departmental servers there are two models of the dec 4000 axp the possible values of x is 1 or 2 these numbers specify the number of microprocessors in the system the dec 4000 axp are two way symmetric multiprocessing smp capable systems that are housed in either a ba640 half height cabinet or a ba641 19 inch rackmountable enclosure that contains two backplanes a system backplane and a storage backplane plugged in the system backplane were one or two cpu modules one to four memory modules an i o module up to six futurebus profile b modules and in the storage backplane were one to four fixed media mass storage compartments and one removable media mass storage compartment two models of cpu module were used in the dec 4000 axp the kn430 also known as the b2001 ba used in the model 600 series and the b2012 aa

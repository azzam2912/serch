it is located in a 61 m cavern at the 500 level of the laboratoire souterrain bas bruit lsbb near apt in southern france the experiment is predominantly sensitive to spin dependent interactions of weakly interacting massive particles or wimps simple is an international collaboration with members from portugal france and the united states the simple detector is based on superheated droplet detectors sdds a suspension of 1 2 superheated liquid cclf droplets 30 m radius in a viscoelastic 900 ml gel matrix which undergo transitions to the gas phase upon energy deposition by incident radiation the refrigerant freon is used as the active mass in effect each droplet behaves as a miniature bubble chamber once a nucleation has occurred the acoustic shock wave is picked up by microphones each acquired signal is then fully discriminated in terms of acoustic external noise gel associated noise and most recently particle discrimination the detectors are typically operated at 200 kpa and 280 k due to the construction technique ssds are almost insensitive to background radiation and their sensitivity can be adjusted by controlling the temperature and pressure of each device the final phase ii analysis was published in physical review letters in

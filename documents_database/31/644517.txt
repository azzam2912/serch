this is not the same as a modular curve that happens to be an elliptic curve something that could be called an elliptic modular curve the modularity theorem also known as the taniyama shimura conjecture asserts that every elliptic curve defined over the rational numbers is modular in the 1950s and 1960s a connection between elliptic curves and modular forms was conjectured by the japanese mathematician goro shimura based on ideas posed by yutaka taniyama in the west it became well known through a 1967 paper by andr weil with weil giving conceptual evidence for it it is sometimes called the taniyama shimura weil conjecture it states that every rational elliptic curve is modular on a separate branch of development in the late 1960s yves hellegouarch came up with the idea of associating solutions a b c of fermat s equation with a completely different mathematical object an elliptic curve the curve consists of all points in the plane whose coordinates x y satisfy the relation such an elliptic curve would enjoy very special properties which are due to the appearance of high powers of integers in its equation and the fact that a b c is an n th

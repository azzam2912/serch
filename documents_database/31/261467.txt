one unit of glycemic load approximates the effect of consuming one gram of glucose glycemic load accounts for how much carbohydrate is in the food and how much each gram of carbohydrate in the food raises blood glucose levels glycemic load is based on the glycemic index gi and is calculated by multiplying the grams of available carbohydrate in the food by the food s glycemic index and then dividing by 100 glycemic load estimates the impact of carbohydrate consumption using the glycemic index while taking into account the amount of carbohydrates that are consumed in a serving gl is a gi weighted measure of carbohydrate content for instance watermelon has a high gi but a typical serving of watermelon does not contain many carbohydrates so the glycemic load of eating it is low whereas glycemic index is defined for each type of food glycemic load can be calculated for any size serving of a food an entire meal or an entire day s meals glycemic load of a 100g serving of food can be calculated as its carbohydrate content measured in grams g multiplied by the food s gi and divided by 100 for example watermelon has a gi

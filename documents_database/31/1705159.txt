they are simple in design making them rugged and capable of high rotation speeds this makes them suitable for their only widespread use in guided missiles guided missiles require a source of electrical power during flight this is needed to power the guidance and fuzing systems possibly also the high power loads of an active radar seeker i e a transmitter and rarely the missile s control surfaces control surface actuators for a high speed missile require a high force and so these are usually powered by some non electric means such as tapping propellant exhaust gas from the missile s motor rare exceptions where electrically powered control surfaces are used are mostly medium range subsonic naval missiles e g exocet harpoon and martel the total load varies for different missiles between around 100w to several kw the electrical supply for a missile must be reliable particularly after long storage depending on the missile type it may also be required to start delivering power almost immediately after start up or even before launch to allow gyroscopes to be accelerated to speed and to provide power for varying lengths of time small anti tank or air to air missiles may only

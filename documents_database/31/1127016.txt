ceramography can be thought of as the metallography of ceramics the microstructure is the structure level of approximately 0 1 to 100 m between the minimum wavelength of visible light and the resolution limit of the naked eye the microstructure includes most grains secondary phases grain boundaries pores micro cracks and hardness microindentions most bulk mechanical optical thermal electrical and magnetic properties are significantly affected by the microstructure the fabrication method and process conditions are generally indicated by the microstructure the root cause of many ceramic failures is evident in the microstructure ceramography is part of the broader field of materialography which includes all the microscopic techniques of material analysis such as metallography petrography and plastography ceramography is usually reserved for high performance ceramics for industrial applications such as 85 99 9 alumina alo in fig 1 zirconia zro silicon carbide sic silicon nitride sin and ceramic matrix composites it is seldom used on whiteware ceramics such as sanitaryware wall tiles and dishware ceramography evolved along with other branches of materialography and ceramic engineering alois de widmanst tten of austria etched a meteorite in 1808 to reveal proeutectoid ferrite bands that grew on prior austenite grain boundaries geologist henry clifton

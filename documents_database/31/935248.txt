although a member of the unafec party selected by prime minister antoine gizenga he failed to appear at the opening of the new government and never claimed his office as a result kasongo ilunga is now considered by the local media and the international community to have been an imaginary person most likely created by kisimba ngoy leader of the unafec party as a part of a plan to win the lucrative role for himself under government rules a party must provide a shortlist of at least two candidates for any ministerial role with the prime minister making the final choice from the list the only two candidates put forward for the foreign trade post were kasongo ilunga and kisimba ngoy with the list being compiled by kisimba himself however kisimba had been a vocal supporter of mobutu sese seko someone whom antoine gizenga had once strongly opposed likely causing him to choose the unknown ilunga over kisimba kisimba denied these charges claiming that ilunga later declined the role for personal reasons and that he had sent a signed letter to the prime minister tendering his resignation despite this gizenga refused to accept the resignation unless ilunga resigned in person

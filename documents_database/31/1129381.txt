also involved in tnfa and inflammatory cytokines like interleukin 1 signaling following activation of viral rna sensors such as rig i like receptors associates with ddx3x and phosphorylates interferon regulatory factors irfs irf3 and irf7 as well as ddx3x this activity allows subsequent homodimerization and nuclear translocation of the irf3 leading to transcriptional activation of pro inflammatory and antiviral genes including ifnb in order to establish such an antiviral state ikbke forms several different complexes whose composition depends on the type of cell and cellular stimuli thus several scaffolding molecules including ips1 mavs tank azi2 nap1 or tbkbp1 sintbad tank binding kinase 1 binding protein 1 can be recruited to the ikbke containing complexes activated by polyubiquitination in response to tnfa and interleukin 1 regulates the nf kappa b signaling pathway through at least the phosphorylation of cyld phosphorylates inhibitors of nf kappa b thus leading to the dissociation of the inhibitor nf kappa b complex and ultimately the degradation of the inhibitor in addition is also required for the induction of a subset of isgs which displays antiviral activity may be through the phosphorylation of stat1 at ser 708 phosphorylation of stat1 at ser 708 seems also to promote

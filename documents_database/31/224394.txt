multiple cylinders are commonly arranged side by side in a bank or engine block which is typically cast from aluminum or cast iron before receiving precision machine work cylinders may be sleeved lined with a harder metal or sleeveless with a wear resistant coating such as nikasil a sleeveless engine may also be referred to as a parent bore engine a cylinder s displacement or swept volume can be calculated by multiplying its cross sectional area the square of half the bore by pi by the distance of piston travels within the cylinder the stroke the engine displacement can be calculated by multiplying the swept volume of one cylinder by the number of cylinders presented symbolically a piston is seated inside each cylinder by several metal piston rings fitted around its outside surface in machined grooves typically two for compressional sealing and one to seal the oil the rings make near contact with the cylinder walls sleeved or sleeveless riding on a thin layer of lubricating oil essential to keep the engine from seizing and necessitating a cylinder wall s durable surface during the earliest stage of an engine s life its initial breaking in or running in period small

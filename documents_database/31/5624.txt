before the 20th century most calculations were done by humans early mechanical tools to help humans with digital calculations like the abacus were called calculating machines called by proprietary names or referred to as calculators the machine operator was called the computer the first aids to computation were purely mechanical devices which required the operator to set up the initial values of an elementary arithmetic operation then manipulate the device to obtain the result later computers represented numbers in a continuous form for instance distance along a scale rotation of a shaft or a voltage numbers could also be represented in the form of digits automatically manipulated by a mechanical mechanism although this approach generally required more complex mechanisms it greatly increased the precision of results a series of breakthroughs such as miniaturized transistor computers and the integrated circuit caused digital computers to largely replace analog computers the cost of computers gradually became so low that by the 1990s personal computers and then in the 2000s mobile computers smartphones and tablets became ubiquitous devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years mostly using one to one correspondence with fingers the earliest counting device was probably a form

the conjecture is named after paul erd s and stefan burr and is one of many conjectures named after erd s it states that the ramsey number of graphs in any sparse family of graphs should grow linearly in the number of vertices of the graph the conjecture was proven by choongbum lee thus it is now a theorem if g is an undirected graph then the degeneracy of g is the minimum number p such that every subgraph of g contains a vertex of degree p or smaller a graph with degeneracy p is called p degenerate equivalently a p degenerate graph is a graph that can be reduced to the empty graph by repeatedly removing a vertex of degree p or smaller it follows from ramsey s theorem that for any graph g there exists a least integer formula 1 the ramsey number of g such that any complete graph on at least formula 1 vertices whose edges are coloured red or blue contains a monochromatic copy of g for instance the ramsey number of a triangle is 6 no matter how the edges of a complete graph on six vertices are colored red or blue there is

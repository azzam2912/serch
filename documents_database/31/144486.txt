however in the process of bone formation osteoblasts function in groups of connected cells individual cells cannot make bone a group of organized osteoblasts together with the bone made by a unit of cells is usually called the osteon osteoblasts are specialized terminally differentiated products of mesenchymal stem cells they synthesize dense crosslinked collagen and specialized proteins in much smaller quantities including osteocalcin and osteopontin which compose the organic matrix of bone in organized groups of connected cells osteoblasts produce hydroxylapatite that is deposited in a highly regulated manner into the organic matrix forming a strong and dense mineralized tissue the mineralized matrix the mineralized skeleton is the main support for the bodies of air breathing vertebrates it is an important store of minerals for physiological homeostasis including both acid base balance and calcium or phosphate maintenance the skeleton is a large organ that is formed and degraded throughout life in the air breathing vertebrates the skeleton often referred to as the skeletal system is important both as a supporting structure and for maintenance of calcium phosphate and acid base status in the whole organism the functional part of bone the bone matrix is entirely extracellular the bone matrix consists

the term least element is defined dually that is it is an element of s that is smaller than every other element of s formally given a partially ordered set p an element g of a subset s of p is the greatest element of s if hence the greatest element of s is an upper bound of s that is contained within this subset it is necessarily unique by using instead of in the above definition one defines the least element of s like upper bounds greatest elements may fail to exist even if a set has some upper bounds it need not have a greatest element as shown by the example of the negative real numbers this example also demonstrates that the existence of a least upper bound the number 0 in this case does not imply the existence of a greatest element either similar conclusions hold for least elements a finite chain always has a greatest and a least element the greatest element of a partially ordered subset must not be confused with maximal elements of the set which are elements that are not smaller than any other elements a set can have several maximal elements without

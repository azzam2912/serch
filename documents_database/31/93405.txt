an antigen is a molecule capable of stimulating an immune response and is often produced by cancer cells or viruses antigens inside a cell are bound to class i mhc molecules and brought to the surface of the cell by the class i mhc molecule where they can be recognized by the t cell if the tcr is specific for that antigen it binds to the complex of the class i mhc molecule and the antigen and the t cell destroys the cell in order for the tcr to bind to the class i mhc molecule the former must be accompanied by a glycoprotein called cd8 which binds to the constant portion of the class i mhc molecule therefore these t cells are called cd8 t cells the affinity between cd8 and the mhc molecule keeps the t cell and the target cell bound closely together during antigen specific activation cd8 t cells are recognized as t cells once they become activated and are generally classified as having a pre defined cytotoxic role within the immune system however cd8 t cells also have the ability to make some cytokines the immune system must recognize millions of potential antigens there are

whereas the seven modes are all derived from the same scale and therefore can coincide with each other i e b locrian a aeolian and d dorian all coming to be the notes of the c major scale synthetic modes work differently these two modes which are mirror image to each other and are also transpositions of each other are created by dividing the octave into four equal parts and adding an interval of either half a step or a whole step to each resulting note as such they are both symmetric scales and are used in diminished context albeit in a different manner they are also the result of superimposing two diminished seventh chords set either half a step or a whole step from each other the symmetric diminished scale also known as half whole goes as follows it can be applied to a dominant chord the root of which can be equally transposed to any note of the diminished seventh chord built on the root for example this scale starting on c c d d e f g a b can be applied to either c7 a7 f7 or e7 the inverse symmetric diminished scale also known as

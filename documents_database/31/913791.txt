the problem may be solved by sorting the list and then checking if there are any consecutive equal elements it may also be solved in linear expected time by a randomized algorithm that inserts each item into a hash table and compares only those elements that are placed in the same hash table cell several lower bounds in computational complexity are proved by reducing the element distinctness problem to the problem in question i e by demonstrating that the solution of the element uniqueness problem may be quickly found after solving the problem in question it is known that for lists of numbers the problem s time complexity is n log n i e both the upper and lower bounds on its time complexity are of order of the linearithmic function in the algebraic decision tree model of computation a model of computation in which the elements may not be used to index the computer s memory as in the hash table solution but may only be accessed by computing and comparing simple algebraic functions of their values in other words an asymptotically optimal algorithm of linearithmic time complexity is known for this model the algebraic computation tree model basically

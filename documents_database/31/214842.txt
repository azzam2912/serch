intuitively this construction makes x into a cylinder and collapses one end of the cylinder to a point if formula 2 is a compact subspace of euclidean space the cone on formula 2 is homeomorphic to the union of segments from formula 2 to any fixed point formula 5 such that these segments intersect only by formula 6 itself that is the topological cone agrees with the geometric cone for compact spaces when the latter is defined however the topological cone construction is more general here we often use geometric cone defined in the introduction instead of the topological one the considered spaces are compact so we get the same result up to homeomorphism is the curved surface of the solid cone all cones are path connected since every point can be connected to the vertex point furthermore every cone is contractible to the vertex point by the homotopy the cone is used in algebraic topology precisely because it embeds a space as a subspace of a contractible space when x is compact and hausdorff essentially when x can be embedded in euclidean space then the cone cx can be visualized as the collection of lines joining every point of

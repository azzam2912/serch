it was initially developed in the 1950s at the dutch laboratory for soil mechanics in delft to investigate soft soils based on this history it has also been called the dutch cone test today the cpt is one of the most used and accepted soil methods for soil investigation worldwide the test method consists of pushing an instrumented cone with the tip facing down into the ground at a controlled rate controlled between 1 5 2 5 cm s accepted the resolution of the cpt in delineating stratigraphic layers is related to the size of the cone tip with typical cone tips having a cross sectional area of either 10 or 15 cm corresponding to diameters of 3 6 and 4 4 cm a very early ultra miniature 1 cm subtraction penetrometer was developed and used on a us mobile ballistic missile launch system mgm 134 midgetman soil structure design program in 1984 at the earth technology corporation of long beach california the early applications of cpt mainly determined the soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity the original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical measurements of the total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a conical tip into the soil

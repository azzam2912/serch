the concept was originally proposed by aho and ullman the following article deals with tree walking automata for a different notion of tree automaton closely related to regular tree languages see branching automaton all trees are assumed to be binary with labels from a fixed alphabet informally a tree walking automaton twa a is a finite state device that walks over an input tree in a sequential manner at each moment a visits a node v in state q depending on the state q the label of the node v and whether the node is the root a left child a right child or a leaf a changes its state from q to q and moves to the parent of v or its left or right child a twa accepts a tree if it enters an accepting state and rejects if its enters a rejecting state or makes an infinite loop as with string automata a twa may be deterministic or nondeterministic more formally a nondeterministic tree walking automaton over an alphabet is a tuple where q is a finite set of states its subsets i f and r are the sets of initial accepting and rejecting states respectively and

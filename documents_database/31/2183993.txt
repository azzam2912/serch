its closest phylogenetic relative is candidatus solibacter usitatus according to michael nerdahl it contains 5 650 368 nucleotides 4 777 proteins and 55 rna genes and has a circular chromosome according to information found from genbank according to the joint genome institute the bacterium is a gram negative highly capsulated aerobic heterotroph that grows with a range of sugars sugar polymers and some organic acids it was first found in soil in a pasture from australia in 2003 by a group of scientists led by s j joseph although koribacter has a very slow growth rate sometimes taking up to a week to have a visible colony it accounts for up to 14 of soil bacteria communities the amount of koribacter in soil is so abundant because iron is critical for its survival so with the large amount of iron in the soil it can thrive there koribacter plays a large role in regulating carbon monoxide output on earth from previous studies about bacteria it has been found that co oxidizing bacteria remove 20 of the total co emitted to the earth s atmosphere and because of that finding it is then plausible that acidobacteria including koribacter make a quantitatively

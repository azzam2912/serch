the new pore filling minerals forms bridges between original sediment grains thereby binding them together in this way sand becomes sandstone and gravel becomes conglomerate or breccia cementation occurs as part of the diagenesis or lithification of sediments cementation occurs primarily below the water table regardless of sedimentary grain sizes present large volumes of pore water must pass through sediment pores for new mineral cements to crystallize and so millions of years are generally required to complete the cementation process common mineral cements include calcite quartz or silica phases like cristobalite iron oxides and clay minerals but other mineral cements also occur cementation is continuous in the groundwater zone so much so that the term zone of cementation is sometimes used interchangeably cementation occurs in fissures or other openings of existing rocks and is a dynamic process more or less in equilibrium with a dissolution or dissolving process cement found on the sea floor is commonly aragonite and can take different textural forms these textural forms include pendant cement meniscus cement isopachous cement needle cement botryoidal cement blocky cement syntaxial rim cement and coarse mosaic cement the environment in which each of the cements is found depends on the pore

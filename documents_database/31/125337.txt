the attachment of methyl groups occurs predominantly at specific lysine or arginine residues on histones h3 and h4 two major types of histone methyltranferases exist lysine specific which can be set su var 3 9 enhancer of zeste trithorax domain containing or non set domain containing and arginine specific in both types of histone methyltransferases s adenosyl methionine sam serves as a cofactor and methyl donor group the genomic dna of eukaryotes associates with histones to form chromatin the level of chromatin compaction depends heavily on histone methylation and other post translational modifications of histones histone methylation is a principal epigenetic modification of chromatin that determines gene expression genomic stability stem cell maturation cell lineage development genetic imprinting dna methylation and cell mitosis the class of lysine specific histone methyltransferases is subdivided into set domain containing and non set domain containing as indicated by their monikers these differ in the presence of a set domain which is a type of protein domain human genes encoding proteins with histone methyltransferase activity include the structures involved in methyltransferase activity are the set domain composed of approximately 130 amino acids the pre set and the post set domains the pre set and post

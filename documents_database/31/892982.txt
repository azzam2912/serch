it is used in beet sugar factories to improve the capacity and operating time of evaporators and to produce soft molasses that can be further de sugarised with chromatography the original technology was invented by akzo for a different application it was first used in french sugar factories starting in the 1970s plants may have a capacity of some 100 up to 1000 m h and more the system is often used in the us france and britain german sugar makers traditionally prefer to invest into bigger evaporation capacity the nrs installation will consist of a number of columns filled with strong acid cationic resin it is installed after carbonatation and filtration and before evaporation the resin is loaded with sodium na ions that are exchanged for calcium ca the softened juice will then be evaporated for the regeneration of the resin softened juice will be mixed with caustic soda naoh and will be sent to the columns to transform the resin back into na form the calcium rich juice with high ph is sent in several fractions to the beginning of the clarification process where alkalinisation is needed and the calcium is absorbed by the solid organic matter it

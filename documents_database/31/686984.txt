the incident became one of the biggest scandals in archaeological circles in japan after the story was published by the mainichi shimbun on november 5 2000 for finds from the j mon period or later structures were originally made by digging below the then current surface causing changes in soil composition that make it much easier to discern fakes from real finds the paleolithic hoax highlighted some of the shortcomings of japanese archaeological research into paleolithic sites such as an over reliance on the dating of volcanic ash layers while ignoring other soil layers fujimura had begun faking discoveries when he was working as an amateur archaeologist in the 1970s when he became close to various paleolithic research groups in miyagi prefecture he found numerous artifacts and relics in quick succession all from the japanese paleolithic era some researchers were initially sceptical of fujimura s finds as there was little expectation that stone tools of such an age would be found in japan however fujimura s success in finding artifacts soon silenced his critics and his reputation as a leading amateur archaeologist was firmly established by the early 1980s he was seen as an indispensable member of any archaeological team

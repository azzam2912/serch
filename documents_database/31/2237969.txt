a common design principle of these devices is a special galvanic isolation module between the input control and the output switching circuits of the relay interface relays are widely used in control and protection systems of high voltage 10 100 kv electronic and electrophysical equipment and in high power installations any electromagnetic relay has a certain level of isolation between the input and output circuits however in ordinary relays this function is not prevalent and hence not considered in the existing system of relay classification in interface relays however the property of galvanic isolation decoupling between the input and output circuits is significantly bolstered and parameters of the galvanic isolation have an utmost importance from standpoint of the functions performed by this relay on the other hand the parameters associated with switching capacity are secondary and can significantly vary in interface relays with the same level of galvanic decoupling in this respect categorization of interface relays into existing classes of ordinary relays is arguable rather it seems more appropriate to categorize them as a separate class of electrical relays and classify according to characteristics of the galvanic decoupling unit by insulation voltage level by construction of galvanic isolation module by

no generality is lost by taking these to be rational functions of the sine and cosine michael spivak wrote that the world s sneakiest substitution is undoubtedly this technique various books call this the weierstrass substitution after karl weierstrass 1815 1897 without citing any occurrence of the substitution in weierstrass writings but the technique appears well before weierstrass was born in the work of leonhard euler 1707 1783 one starts with the problem of finding an antiderivative of a rational function of the sine and cosine and replaces sin x cos x and the differential dx with rational functions of a variable t and the product of a rational function of t with the differential dt as follows let by the double angle formula and pythagorean identity one has one gets by dividing both numerators and denominators by formula 5 the equality results from the following computation in the first line one does not simply substitute formula 10 for both limits of integration the singularity in this case a vertical asymptote of formula 11 at formula 12 must be taken into account if formula 14 as x varies the point cos x sin x winds repeatedly around the unit circle

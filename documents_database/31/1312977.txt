it is published by the radio technical commission for aeronautics rtca and supersedes do 138 the do 160 document was first published on february 28 1975 to specify test conditions for the design of avionics electronic hardware in airborne systems since then the standard has undergone subsequent revisions up through revision g this document outlines a set of minimal standard environmental test conditions categories and corresponding test procedures for airborne equipment for the entire spectrum of aircraft from light general aviation aircraft and helicopters through the jumbo jets and supersonic transport categories of aircraft the purpose of these tests is to provide a controlled laboratory means of assuring the performance characteristics of airborne equipment in environmental conditions similar of those which may be encountered in airborne operation of the equipment the standard environmental test conditions and test procedures contained within the standard may be used in conjunction with applicable equipment performance standards as a minimum specification under environmental conditions which can ensure an adequate degree of confidence in performance during use aboard an air vehicle the standard includes sections on the user of the standard must also decide interdependently of the standard how much additional test margin to allow for

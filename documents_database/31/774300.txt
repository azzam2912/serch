these libraries should help the scientific community to analyse gene function by rnai the consortium is based at the broad institute of the mit and harvard university and includes 6 mit and harvard associated institutions and 5 international life sciences organizations verified rnai clones and entire libraries are made available both by sigma aldrich and open biosystems a set of candidate hairpins are selected based on the 1st refseq transcript from each ncbi gene they should be 21mers be at least 25bp from start of the coding sequence and no closer than 150bp from its end candidates are scored based on various empirical rules see the broad institute s web site for a complete list and then blasted against 2 transcriptome sets hairpins that are unique for a unigene cluster and a refseq nm identifier are preferred lastly the candidates are spaced to have 1 hairpin in the 3 untranslated region and 4 in the coding sequence selected hairpins are cloned into the vector plko1 which is a multipurpose plasmid that can be propagated in bacteria transfected into mammalian cell lines or used for generation of lentiviruses it contains resistance genes against ampicillin and puromycin release 1 of the trc

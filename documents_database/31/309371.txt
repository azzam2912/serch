originally developed by the soviet union under the grau designation 9k31 it is commonly known by its nato reporting name sa 9 gaskin the system consists of a brdm 2 amphibious vehicle mounting two pairs of ready to fire 9m31 missiles the missiles used in this system were developed alongside the ubiquitous soviet manpads 9k32m strela 2 nato designation sa 7 grail in the 1960s at first both missiles were intended to be man portable systems but as it became obvious that strela 2 would be far the more compact of the two systems the development goals of strela 1 were changed instead of a battalion level man portable system the new criteria called for a regimental vehicle mounted sam to support the zsu 23 4 as a result of the change in role and more relaxed weight limits of a vehicle mounted sam the design team made the 9m31 a much heavier missile which permitted fewer design compromises than in the case of strela 2 to achieve acceptable kinematic performance the most notable difference is the much larger diameter of the missile and a blunt seeker head that occupies the full width of the missile body with all else

ribu is an indonesian word meaning thousand in indonesia and malaysia three categories of ribus are known according to the absolute height of the peak the sangat tinggi indonesian for very high category is for peaks higher than 3000 meters tinggi sedang indonesian for medium height for peaks between 2000 and 3000 meters and kurang tinggi indonesian for less high for peaks with an elevation of between 1000 and 2000 meters currently a total of 270 ribus are known across the indonesian archipelago including those in malaysia and east timor some are popular hikes such as mount rinjani mount semeru and mount kerinci while others are much more obscure and some do not even have official names some famous indonesian mountains such as mount bromo and tangkuban perahu are not ribus because they are connected to higher peaks by high passes and therefore do not achieve enough topographic prominence however a subsidiary category of indonesian for special peaks contains those deemed of such significant touristic interest that they merit inclusion albeit subjectively in a secondary list at the moment the gunung bagging website counts 115 indonesian the list of the indonesian ribus was compiled by andy dean and daniel patrick

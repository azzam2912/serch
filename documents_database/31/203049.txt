the aim 65 was essentially an expanded kim 1 computer available software included a line oriented machine code monitor basic interpreter assembler pascal pl 65 and forth development system available hardware included a floppy disk controller and a backplane for expansion rockwell advertised the 375 aim 65 with 1k ram as an easy inexpensive computer for learning designing work or just fun standard software included the system console monitor software in rom called advanced interactive monitor it featured an assembler disassembler setting and viewing memory and registers starting execution of other programs and more single stepping was made possible using non maskable interrupt nmi the command prompt was the less than sign if the thermal printer was turned on this would be output on a single line the monitor included a number of service routines that could be accessed and used by a user s program to control i o and code execution and was fully documented including source code the machine featured dual cassette tape control this made it possible to write large assembly programs using the two pass assembler rom source code in text was written twice consecutively to the input tape and then the assembler which could

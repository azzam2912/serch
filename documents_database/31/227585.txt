it takes its name from the greek word sideros iron it is a valuable iron mineral since it is 48 iron and contains no sulfur or phosphorus zinc magnesium and manganese commonly substitute for the iron resulting in the siderite smithsonite siderite magnesite and siderite rhodochrosite solid solution series siderite has mohs hardness of 3 75 4 25 a specific gravity of 3 96 a white streak and a vitreous lustre or pearly luster siderite is antiferromagnetic below its n el temperature of 37 k which can assist in its identification it crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system and are rhombohedral in shape typically with curved and striated faces it also occurs in masses color ranges from yellow to dark brown or black the latter being due to the presence of manganese siderite is commonly found in hydrothermal veins and is associated with barite fluorite galena and others it is also a common diagenetic mineral in shales and sandstones where it sometimes forms concretions which can encase three dimensionally preserved fossils in sedimentary rocks siderite commonly forms at shallow burial depths and its elemental composition is often related to the depositional environment of the enclosing sediments in addition a number

it is in the constellation ophiuchus at magnitude 4 it appears as a dim star visible to the unaided eye away from city lights this star system was first catalogued as a binary star by william herschel in the late 18th century in his study of binary stars herschel proved that this system is a gravitationally bound binary system where the two stars orbit around a common center of mass this was an important contribution to the proof that newton s law of universal gravitation applied to objects beyond the solar system he commented at the time that there was a possible third unseen companion affecting the orbit of the two visible stars 70 ophiuchi is a variable star with a magnitude range for the two stars combined of 4 00 to 4 03 the type of variability is uncertain and it is not clear which of the two components causes the variations it has been suspected of being either a by draconis variable or an rs canum venaticorum variable and a period of 1 92396 days has been measured the primary star is a yellow orange main sequence dwarf of spectral type k0 while the secondary is an orange

gremlin1 was first identified in differential screening as a transcriptional down regulated gene in v mos transformed rat embryonic fibroblasts gremlin1 grem1 is known for its antagonistic interaction with bone morphogenetic proteins bmps in the tgf beta signaling pathway grem1 inhibits predominantly bmp2 and bmp4 in limb buds and functions as part of a self regulatory feedback signaling system which is essential for normal limb bud development and digit formation inhibition of bmps by grem1 in limb buds allows the transcriptional up regulation of the fibroblast growth factors fgfs 4 and 8 and sonic hedgehog shh ligands which are part of the signaling system that controls progression of limb bud development grem1 regulation of bmp4 in mice embryos is also essential for kidney and lung branching morphogenesis data from microarrays of cancer and non cancer tissues suggest that grem1 and other bmp antagonists are important in the survival of cancer stroma and proliferation in some cancers grem1 expression is found in many cancers and is thought to play important roles in uterine cervix lung ovary kidney breast colon pancreas and sarcoma carcinomas more specifically the grem1 binding site between residues 1 to 67 interacts with the binding protein ywhah whose

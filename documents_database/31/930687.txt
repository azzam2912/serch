formula 13 the attractive basin of infinity is one of the components of the fatou set formula 14 in other words the filled in julia set is the complement of the unbounded fatou component formula 15 the julia set is the common boundary of the filled in julia set and the attractive basin of infinity formula 16 where formula 17 denotes the attractive basin of infinity exterior of filled in julia set set of escaping points for formula 18 formula 19 if the filled in julia set has no interior then the julia set coincides with the filled in julia set this happens when all the critical points of formula 18 are pre periodic such critical points are often called misiurewicz points the most studied polynomials are probably those of the form formula 21 which are often denoted by formula 22 where formula 23 is any complex number in this case the spine formula 24 of the filled julia set formula 25 is defined as arc between formula 26 fixed point and formula 27 formula 28 with such properties algorithms for constructing the spine curve formula 41 formula 42 divides dynamical plane into two components

he is best known for his work on event by event physics in heavy ion collisions sergei voloshin studied physics at moscow engineering physics institute where he completed his phd in nuclear physics in 1980 and became a faculty member at the department of theoretical physics during the period from 1992 to 1999 he was a visiting scientist at the university of pittsburgh physikalische institute university of heidelberg and lawrence berkeley national laboratory lbnl where he worked on anisotropic flow and event by event physics in nuclear collisions at sps and rhic in 1999 dr voloshin joined the department of physics and astronomy at wayne state university one of the best known voloshin s contribution is the analysis and interpretation of the so called anisotropic flow in heavy ion collisions he played a leading role in the discovery of the strong elliptic flow at rhic large elliptic flow consistent with calculations from ideal hydrodynamics was a key to the concept of strongly interacting quark gluon plasma a new form of matter discovered at rhic the idea of the constituent quark scaling proposed by voloshin and its observation at rhic is widely regarded as a proof for a deconfinement phase transition

most species are very small and dark details of their biology have not yet been properly studied but they are best known as kleptoparasites of predatory invertebrates and accordingly are commonly known as freeloader flies or jackal flies however because of the conditions under which many species breed out they also are known as filth flies the milichiidae are a family of flies in the suborder brachycera they were at one time included in the family carnidae at one time or another they have been assigned to various superfamilies including carnoidea chloropoidea and agromyzoidea as usual for flies of these groups milichiidae imagines are tiny but their heads are comparatively large compared to many fly species of the same size such as those in the family phoridae milichiidae are small to very small flies usually 1 to 3 mm in length typically they are black or at least dark in some species such as milichiella argyrogaster the abdomen of the male is silvery on its dorsal surface because of a covering of fine hairs the eyes of milichiidae are often red though this need not be obvious because many species of the flies are small and dusky though the proboscis

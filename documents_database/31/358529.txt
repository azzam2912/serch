it can occur in people with pre existing chronic kidney disease or those who have lost kidney function due to age protein toxicity occurs when the body is unable to get rid of the potentially toxic wastes that are generated as a result of protein metabolism it may be also caused by chronic kidney disease protein toxicity occurs when an individual with impaired kidney function consumes protein rich diet specifically proteins from animal sources that are rapidly absorbed into the blood stream and are rapidly metabolized causing the release of high concentration of toxic nitrogenous waste material a high protein diet is a health concern for those suffering from renal disease the main concern is that a high protein intake may promote further renal damage that can lead to protein toxicity the physiological changes induced by an increased protein intake such as an increased glomerular pressure and hyperfiltration place further strain on already damaged kidneys this strain can lead to proteins being inadequately metabolized and subsequently cause toxicity a high protein diet can lead to complications for those with renal disease and has been linked to further progression of the disease the well known nurse s health study found a

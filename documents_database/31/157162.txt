the twt belongs to a category of linear beam tubes such as the klystron in which the radio wave is amplified by absorbing power from a beam of electrons as it passes down the tube although there are various types of twt two major categories are a major advantage of the twt over some other microwave tubes is its ability to amplify a wide range of frequencies a wide bandwidth the bandwidth of the helix twt can be as high as two octaves while the cavity versions have bandwidths of 10 20 operating frequencies range from 300 mhz to 50 ghz the power gain of the tube is on the order of 40 to 70 decibels and output power ranges from a few watts to megawatts twts account for over 50 of the sales volume of all microwave vacuum tubes they are widely used as the power amplifiers and oscillators in radar systems communication satellite and spacecraft transmitters and electronic warfare systems the twt is an elongated vacuum tube with an electron gun a heated cathode that emits electrons at one end a voltage applied across the cathode and anode accelerates the electrons towards the far end of the tube

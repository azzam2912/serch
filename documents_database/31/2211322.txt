the organisation s first two reportsunburnable carbon 2011 and unburnable carbon 2013 argued that up to two thirds of the world s known reserves and resources of oil coal and gas could not be burned while avoiding dangerous levels of climate change as summarized by financial times columnist martin wolf the conclusion is quite simple burning known reserves of fossil fuels is incompatible with meeting the climate targets governments have set themselves the paris agreement adopted internationally in december 2015 aims to keep the global average temperature rise below 2 c of warming to avoid and reduce some of the most severe risks and impacts of climate change but this requires carbon dioxide levels emitted in the atmosphere by 2050 to not exceed a carbon budget of up to 900 gigatonnes drawing on research from the potsdam institute for climate impact research carbon tracker s reports showed that the world s reserves and resources of coal oil and gas if burned would emit more than three times this amount approximately 2800 gigatonnes this raises the possibility that by financing the development and production of fossil fuels that might never be consumed investors are exposed to the risk of stranded assets

first isolated from washed cultivated dinoflagellates they have been reported to have mutualistic as well as pathogenic symbioses with dinoflagellates d shibae cells are gram negative cocci or occasionally ovoid rods that measure 0 3 0 7 m in width and 0 3 1 0 m in length they are motile and have a single polar flagellum when grown in the dark colonies have a distinct pink or light red pigmentation while under strong illumination they are beige they contain bacteriochlorophyll a and the carotenoid pigment spheroidenone and have absorption spectrum peaks at 804 and 868 nm the carotenoid leads to an extended absorption spectrum including 400 600 nm d shibae cells use light as a supplementary energy source and don t use it to fix inorganic carbon colonies grown on complex agar media appear deep red in color d shibae is a facultative anaerobe that requires 1 7 salinity and grows between 15 and 38 c with an optima temperature of 33 c its optimal ph range is 6 5 9 0 while most of the organisms in the roseobacter clade are obligate aerobes d shibae is able to grow anaerobically using electron acceptors nitrate and dimethyl sulfoxide it

a more general definition includes all positive rational numbers with this property the sequence of integer congruent numbers starts with for example 5 is a congruent number because it is the area of a 20 3 3 2 41 6 triangle similarly 6 is a congruent number because it is the area of a 3 4 5 triangle 3 is not a congruent number if is a congruent number then is also a congruent number for any natural number just by multiplying each side of the triangle by and vice versa this leads to the observation that whether a nonzero rational number is a congruent number depends only on its residue in the group every residue class in this group contains exactly one square free integer and it is common therefore only to consider square free positive integers when speaking about congruent numbers the question of determining whether a given rational number is a congruent number is called the congruent number problem this problem has not as of 2019 been brought to a successful resolution tunnell s theorem provides an easily testable criterion for determining whether a number is congruent but his result relies on the birch and swinnerton dyer

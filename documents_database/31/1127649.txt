a metabolite of arachidonic acid it is produced by diverse cell types in humans and other animal species these cells may then metabolize the formed 5 s hete to 5 oxo eicosatetraenoic acid 5 oxo ete 5 s 15 s dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid 5 s 15 s dihete or 5 oxo 15 hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid 5 oxo 15 s hete 5 s hete 5 oxo ete 5 s 15 s dihete and 5 oxo 15 s hete while differing in potencies share a common mechanism for activating cells and a common set of activities they are therefore a family of structurally related metabolites animal studies and a limited set of human studies suggest that this family of metabolites serve as hormone like autocrine and paracrine signalling agents that contribute to the up regulation of acute inflammatory and allergic responses in this capacity these metabolites may be members of the innate immune system in vitro studies suggest that 5 s hete and or other of its family members may also be active in promoting the growth of certain types of cancers in simulating bone reabsorption in signaling for the secretion of aldosterone and progesterone in triggering parturition and in contributing to other responses

this occurs when recovery and recrystallisation are complete and further reduction in the internal energy can only be achieved by reducing the total area of grain boundary the term is commonly used in metallurgy but is also used in reference to ceramics and minerals most materials exhibit the hall petch effect at room temperature and so display a higher yield stress when the grain size is reduced at high temperatures the opposite is true since the open disordered nature of grain boundaries means that vacancies can diffuse more rapidly down boundaries leading to more rapid coble creep since boundaries are regions of high energy they make excellent sites for the nucleation of precipitates and other second phases e g mg si cu phases in some aluminium alloys or martensite platlets in steel depending on the second phase in question this may have positive or negative effects grain growth has long been studied primarily by the examination of sectioned polished and etched samples under the optical microscope although such methods enabled the collection of a great deal of empirical evidence particularly with regard to factors such as temperature or composition the lack of crystallographic information limited the development of an understanding

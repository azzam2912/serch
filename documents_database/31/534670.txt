the appearance of the output at the spectrum analyzer screen resembling teeth of a comb gave the device its name comb generators find wide range of uses in microwave technology e g synchronous signals in wide frequency bandwidth can be produced by a comb generator the most common use is in broadband frequency synthesizers where the high frequency signals act as stable references correlated to the lower energy references the outputs can be used directly or to synchronize phase locked loop oscillators it may be also used to generate a complete set of substitution channels for testing each of which carries the same baseband audio and video signal comb generators are also used in rfi testing of consumer electronics where their output is used as a simulated rf emissions as it is a stable broadband noise source with repeatable output it is also used during compliance testing to various government requirements for products such as medical devices fda military electronics mil std 461 commercial avionics federal aviation administration digital electronics federal communications commission in the usa an optical comb generator can be used as generators of terahertz radiation internally it is a resonant electro optic modulator with the capability of

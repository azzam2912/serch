the leading hypotheses propose the involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex basal ganglia and or the limbic system with discoveries being made in the fields of neuroanatomy neurochemistry neuroimmunology neurogenetics and neuroethology although there has been substantial debate regarding the assessment of ocd current research has gravitated toward structural and functional neuroimaging these technological innovations have provided a better understanding of the neuroanatomical risk factors of ocd these studies can be divided into four basic categories 1 resting studies that compare brain activity at rest in patients with ocd to controls 2 symptom provocation studies that compare brain activity before and after incitement of symptoms 3 treatment studies that compare brain activity before and after treatment with pharmacotherapy and 4 cognitive activation studies that compare brain activity while performing a task in patients with ocd to controls data obtained from this research suggests that three brain areas are involved with ocd the orbitofrontal cortex ofc the anterior cingulate cortex acc and the head of the caudate nucleus several studies have found that in patients with ocd these areas 1 are hyperactive at rest relative to healthy control 2 become increasingly active with symptom provocation and 3 no longer exhibit hyperactivity following

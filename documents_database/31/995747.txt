the nature of glucose phosphate stress is not fully understood but is correlated with intracellular accumulation of glucose 6 phosphate sgrs helps cells recover from glucose phosphate stress by base pairing with ptsg mrna encoding the glucose transporter and causing its degradation in an rnase e dependent manner base pairing between sgrs and ptsg mrna also requires hfq an rna chaperone frequently required by small rnas that affect their targets through base pairing the inability of cells expressing sgrs to create new glucose transporters leads to less glucose uptake and reduced levels of glucose 6 phosphate sgrs is an unusual small rna in that it also encodes a 43 amino acid functional polypeptide sgrt which helps cells recover from glucose phosphate stress by preventing glucose uptake the activity of sgrt does not affect the levels of ptsg mrna of ptsg protein it has been proposed that sgrt exerts its effects through regulation of the glucose transporter ptsg sgrs was originally discovered in e coli but homologues have since been identified in other gammaproteobacteria such as salmonella enterica and members of the genus citrobacter a comparative genomics based target prediction approach that employs these homologs has been developed and was used

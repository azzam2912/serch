different populations tend to favor one of a limited set of different spots around the chromatic circle as central to the set of higher tones roger shepard in 1963 had argued that such tone pairs would be heard ambiguously as either ascending or descending however psychology of music researcher diana deutsch in 1986 discovered that when the judgments of individual listeners were considered separately their judgments depended on the positions of the tones along the chromatic circle for example one listener would hear the tone pair c f as ascending and the tone pair g c as descending yet another listener would hear the tone pair c f as descending and the tone pair g c as ascending furthermore the way these tone pairs were perceived varied depending on the listener s language or dialect each shepard tone consists of a set of octave related sinusoids whose amplitudes are scaled by a fixed bell shaped spectral envelope based on a log frequency scale for example one tone might consist of a sinusoid at 440 hz accompanied by sinusoid at the higher octaves 880 hz 1760 hz etc and lower octaves 220 hz 110 hz etc the other tone might consist

xpnpep3 localizes to mitochondria in renal cells and to kidney tubules in a cell type specific pattern mutations in xpnpep3 gene have been identified as a cause of a nephronophthisis like disease the xpnpep3 gene is located at chromosome 22q13 2 consisting of 12 exons two splice variants of xpnpep3 app3m and app3c exist in mitochondria and cytosol respectively app3m has an n terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence mts domain importing app3m into mitochondria where the domain is removed proteolytically and app3m functions as a 51 kda mature protein by contrast app3c lacks the mts and is expressed in the cytosol arginine in mts is required for mitochondrial transport xpnpep3 belongs to a family of x pro aminopeptidases ec 3 4 11 9 that utilize a metal cofactor and remove the n terminal amino acid from peptides with a proline residue in the penultimate position it has been found that upon tumor necrosis factor stimulation xpnpep3 is released from mitochondria xpnpep3 is a new member of the tnf tnfr2 signaling complex and plays a role in the transduction mechanism of tnfr2 signal which activates both jnk1 and jnk2 pathways it is also observed that cell death increases upon downregulation of xpnpep3

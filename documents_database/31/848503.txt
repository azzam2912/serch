it is located in sight of the short lived popham colony and like the colony named for george popham the colony s leader during the american revolution a minor fortification stood on this site in 1808 the federal government built a small battery to accommodate guns on field carriages on this location as part of the second system of fortifications that guarded the coast these forts and batteries were built shortly after the passage of thomas jefferson s embargo act of 1807 which prohibited all exports from the us as an attempt to exert pressure on britain and france which had been taking actions against us shipping the first use of some of these forts was to enforce the embargo the embargo was deeply unpopular in new england and had severe economic effects there the embargo was repealed in march 1809 but the situation with britain ultimately led to the war of 1812 it was felt that these forts were built as much to enforce the embargo as to defend the country and they were derisively known as embargo forts the battery is mentioned in the secretary of war s reports on fortifications for december 1808 and december 1811 it

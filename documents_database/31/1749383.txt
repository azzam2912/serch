for example an electronic survey method might influence results for those who might be unfamiliar with an electronic survey interface differently than for those who might be familiar if measures are affected by cmv or common method bias the intercorrelations among them can be inflated or deflated depending upon several factors although it is sometimes assumed that cmv affects all variables evidence suggests that whether or not the correlation between two variables is affected by cmv is a function of both the method and the particular constructs being measured several ex ante remedies exist that help to avoid or minimize possible common method variance important remedies have been compiled and discussed by chang et al 2010 lindell whitney 2001 and podsakoff et al 2003 using simulated data sets richardson et al 2009 investigate three ex post techniques to test for common method variance the correlational marker technique the confirmatory factor analysis cfa marker technique and the unmeasured latent method construct ulmc technique only the cfa marker technique turns out to provide some value whereas the commonly used harman test does not turn out to provide such value a comprehensive example of this technique has been demonstrated by williams et al

anything with a base unit with provision to maintain a stable temperature pump air in either direction etc is often called a station preceded by rework soldering desoldering hot air one or sometimes more tools may be connected to a station e g a rework station may accommodate a soldering iron and hot air head a soldering iron with a hollow tip and a spring bulb or electrically operated suction pump may be called a terms such as suction pen may be used the meaning is usually clear from the context electrically operated pumps are used for several purposes in conjunction with a hand held head connected by a tube suction pumps are used to suck away molten solder leaving previously joined terminals disconnected they are primarily used to release through hole connections from a pcb the desoldering head must be designed so that the extracted solder does not solidify so as to obstruct it or enter the pump and can be removed and discarded easily it is not possible to remove a multi pin part by melting solder on the pins sequentially as one joint will solidify as the next is melted pumps and solder wick are among methods

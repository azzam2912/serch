subareas include the coupling of classes interfaces data and services loose coupling is the opposite of tight coupling components in a loosely coupled system can be replaced with alternative implementations that provide the same services components in a loosely coupled system are less constrained to the same platform language operating system or build environment if systems are decoupled in time it is difficult to also provide transactional integrity additional coordination protocols are required data replication across different systems provides loose coupling in availability but creates issues in maintaining consistency data synchronization loose coupling in broader distributed system design is achieved by the use of transactions queues provided by message oriented middleware and interoperability standards four types of autonomy which promote loose coupling are reference autonomy time autonomy format autonomy and platform autonomy loose coupling is an architectural principle and design goal in service oriented architectures eleven forms of loose coupling and their tight coupling counterparts are listed in enterprise service bus esb middleware was invented to achieve loose coupling in multiple dimensions however overengineered and mispositioned esbs can also have the contrary effect and create undesired tight coupling and a central architectural hotspot event driven architecture also aims at promoting

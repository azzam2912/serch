the 20 mw biolevano project is due to come on stream in the fourth quarter of 2011 at a cost of 80 million a key feature is the development of the wood chip supply chain a high proportion more than 85 of the plant s raw materials will come from a short supply chain the biolevano unit features very high conversion efficiency more than 30 and extremely low emissions lower than any other biomass power plant in italy the plant designed to deliver 140 gwhe per year of renewable energy sufficient to meet the needs of about 50 000 families will consume approximately 200 000 tonnes year of wood chips these will come mainly from poplar trees grown according to the short rotation forestry srf formula defined as high density plantations of fast growing species to be used for energy conversion taking into account the carbon capture cycle of its raw materials the olevano plant will reduce atmospheric emissions of co2 by more than 100 000 tonnes year by replacing electricity generated from fossil fuels located centrally in lomellina near the right bank of the agogna the village belonged to the counts of lomello some of them took up residence

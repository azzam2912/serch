evfimievski johannes gehrke ramakrishnan srikant gave a definition equivalent to local differential privacy in 2008 kasiviswanathan et al gave a formal definition conforming with the standard definition of differential privacy the prototypical example of a locally differential private mechanism is the randomized response survey technique proposed by stanley l warner in 1965 predating modern discussions of privacy warner s innovation was the introduction of the untrusted curator model where the entity collecting the data may not be trustworthy before users responses are sent to the curator the answers are randomized in a controlled manner guaranteeing differential privacy while allowing valid population wide statistical inferences let be a positive real number and formula 1 be a randomized algorithm that takes a user s private data as input let formula 2 denote the image of formula 1 the algorithm formula 1 is said to provide formula 5 local differential privacy if for all pairs of user s possible private data formula 6 and formula 7 and all subsets formula 8 of formula 2 formula 10 where the probability is taken over the randomness used by the algorithm the main difference between this definition and the standard definition of differential privacy is that

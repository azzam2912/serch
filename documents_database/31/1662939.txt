since 2001 the support and the development of medina takes place by t systems international gmbh the current release is medina rel 9 0 1 2 medina was designed as general purpose pre postprocessor for various areas of finite element analysis supporting most of the common cad formats solvers and operating systems currently the following cad formats are supported by medina further cad formats can be supported using the solution for 3d data conversion of t systems called com fox in the current release particularly the following solvers are supported by medina in the current release medina is running under the following operating systems and hardware architectures particularly medina is being used for the following tasks of fe analysis medina consists of two modules in the preprocessor all steps are taken before the computation can start i e in the postprocessor all steps are taken after the computation of the primary data of the solver is finished e g medina was designed to support complex simulation tasks and huge fe models found typically in automotive and aerospace industries with high performance important design elements to achieve high performance are parts structures and connector elements within the process step of the

among its applications it afforded insight into regression to the mean or regression to mediocrity the galton board consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pegs beads are dropped from the top and when the device is level bounce either left or right as they hit the pegs eventually they are collected into bins at the bottom where the height of bead columns accumulated in the bins approximate a bell curve overlaying pascal s triangle onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each bin large scale working models of this device created by charles and ray eames can be seen in the exhibits permanently on view at the boston museum of science the new york hall of science or the henry ford museum another large scale version is displayed in the lobby of index fund advisors in irvine california bean machines can be constructed for other distributions by changing the shape of the pins or biasing them towards one direction even bimodal bean machines are possible a bean machine for the log normal distribution common in many natural processes particularly biological ones which uses isoceles triangles of varying widths

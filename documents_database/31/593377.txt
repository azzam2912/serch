it produces artificial wavefronts synthesized by a large number of individually driven loudspeakers such wavefronts seem to originate from a virtual starting point the virtual source or notional source contrary to traditional spatialization techniques such as stereo or surround sound the localization of virtual sources in wfs does not depend on or change with the listener s position wfs is based on the huygens fresnel principle which states that any wavefront can be regarded as a superposition of elementary spherical waves therefore any wavefront can be synthesized from such elementary waves in practice a computer controls a large array of individual loudspeakers and actuates each one at exactly the time when the desired virtual wavefront would pass through it the basic procedure was developed in 1988 by professor a j berkhout at the delft university of technology its mathematical basis is the kirchhoff helmholtz integral it states that the sound pressure is completely determined within a volume free of sources if sound pressure and velocity are determined in all points on its surface therefore any sound field can be reconstructed if sound pressure and acoustic velocity are restored on all points of the surface of its volume this approach is

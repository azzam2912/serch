the word also refers to the transversely mounted motor of such a car a similar type of slot car that has the motor shaft mounted at an angle to the driven axle is the anglewinder in general the sidewinder and anglewinder are less common arrangements than the inline motor in which the shaft is perpendicular to the driven axle and drives it with bevel gears or a pinion and crown gear historically they are also less common than the pancake motor in which the shaft is vertical and power is carried to the axle by a chain of gears to a pinion and crown arrangement because they require more space between the drive wheels the sidewinder and anglewinder arrangements are more common in 1 32 and especially 1 24 than in the smaller scales the sidewinder and to an extent the anglewinder configurations are often seen as superior for slot racing cars this is because when accelerating the reverse torque of the motor transfers weight to the front of the vehicle and therefore the guide that keeps it on the track this allows the slot racer to accelerate through corners there is also a further advantage as if dynamic braking

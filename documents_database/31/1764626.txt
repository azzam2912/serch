in 1888 he became professor in stuttgart and 1890 professor of mechanical engineering at the technical university of darmstadt 1893 he took a professorship at the dresden technical university in 1896 he became head of the laboratory equipment of the university in 1898 was head of the stribeck physical metallurgy department of the technical institute and director of the center for scientific and technical studies in neubabelsberg in 1902 he described the friction coefficient in lubricated bearings now known as the stribeck curve from 1908 stribeck worked for the friedrich krupp ag in essen in 1919 at the robert bosch gmbh in stuttgart stribeck was a college friend of the industrialist robert bosch with whom he remained for a joint study at the royal wuerttemberg in stuttgart polytechnic lifelong allegiance stribeck was honored for his services to the wilhelm exner medal proposed richard stribeck carried out studies in the field of tribology focusing on friction in lubricated sliding contacts such as journal bearings his work lead to the development of the stribeck curve a fundamental tribological concept that shows how operation conditions in particular normal load lubricant viscosity and lubricant entrainment velocity influence the friction coefficient in fluid lubricated contacts

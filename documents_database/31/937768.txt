this arrangement allows the generator and gearbox to be located close to the ground facilitating service and repair vawts do not need to be pointed into the wind which removes the need for wind sensing and orientation mechanisms major drawbacks for the early designs savonius darrieus and giromill included the significant torque variation or ripple during each revolution and the large bending moments on the blades later designs addressed the torque ripple issue by sweeping the blades helically gorlov type a vertical axis wind turbine has its axis perpendicular to the wind streamlines and vertical to the ground a more general term that includes this option is transverse axis wind turbine or cross flow wind turbine for example the original darrieus patent us patent 1835018 includes both options drag type vawts such as the savonius rotor typically operate at lower tipspeed ratios than lift based vawts such as darrieus rotors and cycloturbines the forces and the velocities acting in a darrieus turbine are depicted in figure 1 the resultant velocity vector formula 1 is the vectorial sum of the undisturbed upstream air velocity formula 2 and the velocity vector of the advancing blade formula 3 formula 4 thus the oncoming

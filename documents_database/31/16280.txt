the duct acts as an atmospheric dielectric waveguide and limits the spread of the wavefront to only the horizontal dimension atmospheric ducting is a mode of propagation of electromagnetic radiation usually in the lower layers of earth s atmosphere where the waves are bent by atmospheric refraction in over the horizon radar ducting causes part of the radiated and target reflection energy of a radar system to be guided over distances far greater than the normal radar range it also causes long distance propagation of radio signals in bands that would normally be limited to line of sight normally radio ground waves propagate along the surface as creeping waves that is they are only diffracted around the curvature of the earth this is one reason that early long distance radio communication used long wavelengths the best known exception is that hf 3 30 mhz waves are reflected by the ionosphere the reduced refractive index due to lower densities at the higher altitudes in the earth s atmosphere bends the signals back toward the earth signals in a higher refractive index layer i e duct tend to remain in that layer because of the reflection and refraction encountered at the boundary

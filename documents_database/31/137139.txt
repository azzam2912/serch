it is so named because its action is proportional to the integral of the chern simons 3 form in condensed matter physics chern simons theory describes the topological order in fractional quantum hall effect states in mathematics it has been used to calculate knot invariants and three manifold invariants such as the jones polynomial particularly chern simons theory is specified by a choice of simple lie group g known as the gauge group of the theory and also a number referred to as the level of the theory which is a constant that multiplies the action the action is gauge dependent however the partition function of the quantum theory is well defined when the level is an integer and the gauge field strength vanishes on all boundaries of the 3 dimensional spacetime in the 1940s s s chern and a weil studied the global curvature properties of smooth manifolds m as de rham cohomology chern weil theory which is an important step in the theory of characteristic classes in differential geometry given a flat g principal bundle p on m there exists a unique homomorphism called the chern weil homomorphism from the algebra of g adjoint invariant polynomials on g

by convention the poles of the system are indicated in the plot by an x while the zeros are indicated by a circle or o a pole zero plot can represent either a continuous time ct or a discrete time dt system for a ct system the plane in which the poles and zeros appear is the s plane of the laplace transform in this context the parameter s represents the complex angular frequency which is the domain of the ct transfer function for a dt system the plane is the z plane where z represents the domain of the z transform in general a rational transfer function for a continuous time lti system has the form where either m or n or both may be zero but in real systems it should be the case that formula 9 otherwise the gain would be unbounded at high frequencies formula 10 such that formula 11 the region of convergence roc for a given ct transfer function is a half plane or vertical strip either of which contains no poles in general the roc is not unique and the particular roc in any given case depends on whether the system is causal

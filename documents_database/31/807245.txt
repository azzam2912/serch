it is a key prediction of the folding funnel hypothesis of the energy landscape theory of proteins downhill folding is predicted to occur under conditions of extreme native bias i e at low temperatures or in the absence of denaturants this corresponds to the type 0 scenario in the energy landscape theory at temperatures or denaturant concentrations close to their apparent midpoints proteins may switch from downhill to two state folding the type 0 to type 1 transition global downhill folding or one state folding is another scenario in which the protein folds in the absence of a free energy barrier under all conditions in other words there is a unimodal population distribution at all temperatures and denaturant concentrations suggesting a continuous unfolding transition in which different ensembles of structures populate at different conditions this is in contrast to two state folding which assumes only two ensembles folded and unfolded and a sharp unfolding transition free energy barriers in protein folding are predicted to be small because they arise as a result of compensation between large energetic and entropic terms non synchronization between gain in stabilizing energy and loss in conformational entropy results in two state folding while a synchronization

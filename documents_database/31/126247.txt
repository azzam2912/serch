these friction forces are generated by the extreme tightness of the structural bolts holding the connection together these bolts usually tension control bolts or compressible washer tension indicating type bolts are tensioned to a minimum required amount to generate large enough friction forces between the faying surfaces such that the shear or tension load is transferred by the structural members and not by the bolts in shear and the connection plates in bearing the turn of the nut method is also widely used to achieve that state of friction if slip critical connections fail by slipping they revert to bearing type connections with structural forces now transferred through bolt shear and connection plate bearing thus a slippage failure of a slip critical connection is not necessarily a catastrophic failure however slippage of a slip critical connection in columns may lead to column instability slippage of a slip critical joint in a roof truss could result in unintended ponding effects the faying surfaces of slip critical connections must be properly prepared in order to maximize friction forces between the surfaces joined usually this requires cleaning descaling roughening and or blasting of the faying surfaces painting the faying surfaces with a class

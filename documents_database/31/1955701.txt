human mammals and vertebrates serve as natural hosts there are currently 25 species in this genus including the type species human mastadenovirus c the genus as a whole includes many very common causes of human infection estimated to be responsible for 2 5 of all respiratory infections as well as gastrointestinal and eye infections symptoms are usually mild specific tropisms include serotypes 3 5 and 7 lower respiratory tract infections serotypes 8 19 and 37 epidemic keratoconjunctivitis serotypes 4 and 7 acute respiratory disease serotypes 40 and 41 gastroenteritis serotype 14 can cause potentially fatal adenovirus infections canine adenovirus 1 cadv 1 can lead to death in puppies or encephalitis in other carnivore species group dsdna viruses in mastadenovirus are non enveloped with icosahedral geometries and t 25 symmetry the diameter is around 90 nm genomes are linear and non segmented around 35 36kb in length the genome codes for 40 proteins viral replication is nuclear entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral fibers to the host car adhesion receptor subsequent binding of the penton protein to host integrin entry receptors mediates internalization into the host cell by clathrin mediated endocytosis of the virus and

since 2011 the french community has used the name wallonia brussels federation which is controversial because its name in the belgian constitution has not changed and because it is seen as a political statement the name french community refers to francophone belgians and not to french people residing in belgium as such the french community of belgium is sometimes rendered in english as the french speaking community of belgium for clarity the community has its own parliament government and administration its official flag is identical to the walloon flag which is also the official flag of the walloons of wallonia wallonia is home to 80 of all francophone belgians with the remaining 20 residing in brussels which is the seat of parliament of the french community historically this community spoke variants of walloon dutch picard luxembourgish or moselle franconian german but nowadays the dominant language is overwhelmingly belgian french except for some areas alongside the border to the grand duchy of luxembourg mainly the district called land of arlon or arelerland where luxembourgish is still widely spoken the french community of belgium includes 4 5 million people of whom french speakers who live in the flemish region are not included

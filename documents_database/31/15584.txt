it is a type of polyphase system and is the most common method used by electrical grids worldwide to transfer power it is also used to power large motors and other heavy loads a three wire three phase circuit is usually more economical than an equivalent two wire single phase circuit at the same line to ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit a given amount of electrical power polyphase power systems were independently invented by galileo ferraris mikhail dolivo dobrovolsky jonas wenstr m john hopkinson and nikola tesla in the late 1880s the conductors between a voltage source and a load are called lines and the voltage between any two lines is called line voltage the voltage measured between any line and neutral is called phase voltage for example for a 208y 120 volt service the line voltage is 208 volts and the phase voltage is 120 volts in a symmetric three phase power supply system three conductors each carry an alternating current of the same frequency and voltage amplitude relative to a common reference but with a phase difference of one third of a cycle between each the common reference is usually connected to ground

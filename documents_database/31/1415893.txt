dehalogenation can be divided into two subclasses reductive dehalogenation and hydro dehalogenation organic halides belong to a class of organic compounds that contain carbon halogen bond in 1832 scientist named justus von liebig synthesized the first organic halide charcoal via chlorination of ethanol since then organohalides have gained a lot of attention organohalides are commonly used as pesticides biodegradables soil fumigants refrigerants chemical reagents solvents and polymers it has been classified as pollutant despite of their wide use in various applications due to which dehalogenation is a key reaction to convert toxic organohalides to less hazardous products among halogens fluorine is the most electronegative atom and will have the highest tendency to make the strongest bond with carbon the rate of dehalogenation depends on the bond strength between carbon and halogen atom the bond dissociation energies of carbon halogen bonds are described as h3c i 234 kjmol 1 h3c br 293 kjmol 1 h3c cl 351 kjmol 1 and h3c f 452 kjmol 1 thus for the same structures the bond dissociation rate for dehalogenation will be f cl additionally the rate of dehalogenation for alkyl halide also varies with steric environment and follows this trend primary secondary tertiary halides

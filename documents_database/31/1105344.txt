igfbp 3 is one of six igf binding proteins igfbp 1 to igfbp 6 that have highly conserved structures and bind the insulin like growth factors igf 1 and igf 2 with high affinity igfbp 7 sometimes inappropriately included in this family shares neither the conserved structural features nor the high igf affinity igfbp 3 was first isolated characterized and quantitated in human plasma in 1986 it has well documented functions in the circulation in the extracellular environment and inside cells it is the main igf transport protein in the bloodstream where it carries the growth factors predominantly in stable complexes that contain the binding protein either igf 1 or igf 2 and a third protein called the acid labile subunit or als for igfs to reach the tissues from the bloodstream the circulating complexes are believed to partly dissociate possibly enhanced by limited proteolysis of igfbp 3 the igf 1 igfbp 3 ratio has sometimes been used as an index of igf bioavailability in the human circulation but this ignores igf 1 binding to other igfbps so the ratio is affected by the concentrations of all six igfbps and the fact that igf 2 which is three times more

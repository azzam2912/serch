it is constructed in a to 92 case resembling a small transistor it replaces the similar zn414 am radio ic from the 1970s the mk484 is favored by many hobbyists it is advantageous in that it performs well with minimal discrete components and can run from a single 1 5 volt cell the mk484 has now in turn been replaced by the ta7642 the simplest circuit employing the mk484 can be constructed using only a battery an earphone or high impedance speaker a coil and a variable capacitor the output of the mk484 can be fed into the base of a transistor to provide greater amplification as a class a amplifier however this is often an inefficient design conversely the lm386 audio amplifier may be used to drive a small speaker note that higher voltage is required if the lm386 is to be used therefore small signal diodes such as 1n4148 are recommended to create a voltage drop or use a zener dc dc converter with a red led in forward can double as a power indicator and a resistor several hundred ohms for 9v operation as to avoid overvolting the mk484

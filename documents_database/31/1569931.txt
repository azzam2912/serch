the primitive objects of study are physical processes and the different ways that these can be composed it was pioneered in 2004 by abramsky and coecke mathematically the basic setup is captured by a dagger symmetric monoidal category composition of morphisms models sequential composition of processes and the tensor product describes parallel composition of processes the role of the dagger is to assign to each state a corresponding test these can then be adorned with more structure to study various aspects for instance a substantial portion of the mathematical backbone to this approach is drawn from australian category theory most notably from work by kelly and laplaza joyal and street carboni and walters and lack one of the most notable features of categorical quantum mechanics is that the compositional structure can be faithfully captured by a purely diagrammatic calculus these diagrammatic languages can be traced back to penrose graphical notation developed in the early 1970s diagrammatic reasoning has been used before in quantum information science in the quantum circuit model however in categorical quantum mechanics primitive gates like the cnot gate arise as composites of more basic algebras resulting in a much more compact calculus in particular the zx calculus

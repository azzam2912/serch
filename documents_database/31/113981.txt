prasad and charles sommerfield is a series of inequalities for solutions of partial differential equations depending on the homotopy class of the solution at infinity this set of inequalities is very useful for solving soliton equations often by insisting that the bound be satisfied called saturated one can come up with a simpler set of partial differential equations to solve the bogomol nyi equations solutions saturating the bound are called bps states and play an important role in field theory and string theory in a theory of u 1 yang mills higgs the energy at a given time t is given by where d is the covariant derivative and v is the potential if we assume that v is nonnegative and is zero only for the higgs vacuum and that the higgs field is in the adjoint representation then by virtue of the yang mills bianchi identity therefore saturation obtains for formula 4 and the bogomol nyi equation the other condition for saturation is that the higgs mass and self interaction are zero which is the case in n 2 supersymmetric theories this quantity is the absolute value of the magnetic flux a slight generalization applying to dyons also exists

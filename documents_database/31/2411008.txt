it is located at a distance of circa 65 million light years from earth which given its apparent dimensions means that ngc 3729 is about 60 000 light years across it was discovered by william herschel on april 12 1789 ngc 3729 has a bright nucleus embedded in a bar which measures 0 5 x 0 1 arcminutes at the end of the bar lies a ring with knots the outer part of the galaxy is formed by an asymmetric faint nebulosity with condensations it is possible that the condensation is a disturbed satellite galaxy in the centre of ngc 3729 is predicted to lie an intermediate mass black hole whose mass is estimated to be between 4 and 400 thousands 10 based on ks band bulge luminosity the galaxy has an inner ring which emits in far ultraviolet and h alpha which are considered to be markers of recent star formation activity ngc 3729 is member of the m109 group which is part of the south ursa major groups part of the virgo supercluster it forms a pair with ngc 3718 which lies 11 5 arcminutes to the west it is possible the two galaxies interacted in the past

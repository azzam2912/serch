they produce energy from light and are named for their green pigment usually found in photosynthetic bodies called chlorosomes chloroflexia are typically filamentous and can move about through bacterial gliding they are facultatively aerobic but do not produce oxygen in the process of producing energy from light or phototrophy additionally chloroflexia have a different method of phototrophy photoheterotrophy than true photosynthetic bacteria whereas most bacteria in terms of diversity are diderms and stain gram negative with the exception of the firmicutes low gc gram positives actinobacteria high gc gram positives and the deinococcus thermus group gram positive but diderms with thick peptidoglycan the members of the phylum chloroflexi are monoderms and stain mostly gram negative the chloroflexia class is a group of deep branching photosynthetic bacteria with the exception of herpetosiphon and kallotenue species that currently consist of three orders chloroflexales herpetosiphonales and kallotenuales the herpetosiphonales and kallotenuales each consist of a single genus within its own family herpetosiphonaceae herpetosiphon and kallotenuaceae kallotenue respectively whereas the chloroflexales are more phylogenetically diverse comparative genomic analysis has recently refined the taxonomy of the class chloroflexia dividing the chloroflexales into the suborder chloroflexineae consisting of the families oscillachloridaceae and chloroflexaceae and the suborder

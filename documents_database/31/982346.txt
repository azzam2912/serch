a delta fibers a fibers and c fibers carrying pain sensation in the spinothalamic tract contribute to this commissure as do fibers of the anterior corticospinal tract which carry motor signals from the primary motor cortex two of the five sensory modalities pain and temperature cross sides at the anterior white commissure reaching the contralateral side about two vertebral levels rostral to their origin the spinothalamic tract thus decussates very soon after entering the spinal cord ascending in the spinal cord contralateral to the side from where it provides pain and temperature sensory information therefore a lesion that is caudal to the sensory decussation where the remaining 3 5 modalities decussate at the superior medulla will result in contralateral opposite sided pain and temperature loss as this has already crossed over at the anterior white commissure whereas loss of crude touch pressure and proprioception will be ipsilateral same sided as these have not yet crossed over

both methods are designed to satisfy the condorcet criterion and allow for incomplete ballots and equal rankings the nanson method is based on the original work of the mathematician edward j nanson in 1882 nanson s method eliminates those choices from a borda count tally that are at or below the average borda count score then the ballots are retallied as if the remaining candidates were exclusively on the ballot this process is repeated if necessary until a single winner remains if a condorcet winner exists they will be elected if not there is a condorcet cycle then the preference with the smallest majority will be eliminated nanson s method can be adapted to handle incomplete ballots plumping and equal rankings bracketing though he describes two different methods to handle these cases a theoretically correct method involving fractions of a vote and a practical method involving whole numbers which has the side effect of diminishing the voting power of voters who plump or bracket this then allows the use of approval style voting for uninformed voters who merely wish to approve of some candidates and disapprove of others the method can be adapted to multi winner elections by removing the

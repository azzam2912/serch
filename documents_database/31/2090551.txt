this system has played an important role in some applications of provability algebras in proof theory and has been extensively studied since the late 1980s it is named after giorgi japaridze the language of glp extends that of the language of classical propositional logic by including the infinite series 0 1 2 of necessity operators their dual possibility operators are defined by p n p the axioms of glp are all classical tautologies and all formulas of one of the following forms and the rules of inference are consider a sufficiently strong first order theory t such as peano arithmetic pa define the series t t t of theories as follows for each n let pr x be a natural arithmetization of the predicate x is the g del number of a sentence provable in t a realization is a function which sends each nonlogical atom a of the language of glp to a sentence a of the language of t it extends to all formulas of the language of glp by stipulating that commutes with the boolean connectives and that n f is pr n f where f stands for the numeral for the g del number of f

br received his phd in 1995 from the universidad complutense de madrid in physics with advisor miguel ngel rodr guez he began his research career in 1989 at the centro de investigaciones energ ticas medioambientales y tecnol gicas ciemat in the field of anomalous transport and complex systems in 1993 he established his own research group to study tumor growth in 2002 he moved to the consejo superior de investigaciones cient ficas csic br is known for the controversy surrounding his research on cancer which states among other things that br s theory stems from his mathematical research on the fractal growth of tumour cell colonies in vitro this growth according to his studies would display a set of distinct characteristics with regards to growth patterns and would imply a greater proliferation around tumour boundaries br s team referred this growth pattern as the universal dynamics of tumour growth this theory is currently recognised as one of the possible equations to describe tumour growth the rationale for the use of neupogen would be that the concurrence of a massive amount of neutrophils near the edge of the tumour may result in a massive population in the concavities at the tumour

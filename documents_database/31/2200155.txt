it is known to host a super earth exoplanet that orbits within the habitable zone discovered in 2016 prior to kepler observation kepler 1229 had the 2mass catalogue number 2mass j19495680 4659481 in the kepler input catalog it has the designation of kic 10027247 and when it was found to have a transiting planet candidate it was given the kepler object of interest number of koi 2418 planetary candidates were detected around the star by nasa s kepler mission a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars the transit method that kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars these dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits pass in front of their stars from the perspective of earth although other phenomenon can also be responsible which is why the term planetary candidate is used following the acceptance of the discovery paper the kepler team provided an additional moniker for the system of kepler 1229 the discoverers referred to the star as kepler 1229 which is the normal procedure for naming the exoplanets discovered by the spacecraft hence this is the name used by the public to refer to the star and its planet

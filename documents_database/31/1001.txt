first proposed by j j thomson in 1904 soon after the discovery of the electron but before the discovery of the atomic nucleus the model tried to explain two properties of atoms then known that electrons are negatively charged particles and that atoms have no net electric charge the plum pudding model has electrons surrounded by a volume of positive charge like negatively charged plums embedded in a positively charged pudding in this model atoms were known to consist of negatively charged electrons though thomson called them corpuscles they were more commonly called electrons which g j stoney proposed as the fundamental unit quantity of electricity in 1891 at the time atoms were known to have no net electric charge to account for this thomson knew atoms must also have a source of positive charge to balance the negative charge of the electrons he considered three plausible models that would be consistent with the properties of atoms then known thomson chose the third possibility as the most likely structure of atoms thomson published his proposed model in the march 1904 edition of the philosophical magazine the leading british science journal of the day in thomson s view the atoms of

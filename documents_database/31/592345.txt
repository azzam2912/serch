it is a polynomial in two variables which plays an important role in graph theory it is defined for every undirected graph formula 1 and contains information about how the graph is connected it is denoted by formula 2 the importance of this polynomial stems from the information it contains about formula 1 though originally studied in algebraic graph theory as a generalization of counting problems related to graph coloring and nowhere zero flow it contains several famous other specializations from other sciences such as the jones polynomial from knot theory and the partition functions of the potts model from statistical physics it is also the source of several central computational problems in theoretical computer science the tutte polynomial has several equivalent definitions it is equivalent to whitney s rank polynomial tutte s own dichromatic polynomial and fortuin kasteleyn s random cluster model under simple transformations it is essentially a generating function for the number of edge sets of a given size and connected components with immediate generalizations to matroids it is also the most general graph invariant that can be defined by a deletion contraction recurrence several textbooks about graph theory and matroid theory devote entire chapters to it

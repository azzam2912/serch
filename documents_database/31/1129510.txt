when a capacitor is introduced between the input and output sides of the amplifier with the intention of moving the pole lowest in frequency usually an input pole to lower frequencies pole splitting causes the pole next in frequency usually an output pole to move to a higher frequency this pole movement increases the stability of the amplifier and improves its step response at the cost of decreased speed this example shows that introduction of the capacitor referred to as c in the amplifier of figure 1 has two results first it causes the lowest frequency pole of the amplifier to move still lower in frequency and second it causes the higher pole to move higher in frequency the amplifier of figure 1 has a low frequency pole due to the added input resistance r and capacitance c with the time constant c r r this pole is moved down in frequency by the miller effect the amplifier is given a high frequency output pole by addition of the load resistance r and capacitance c with the time constant c r r the upward movement of the high frequency pole occurs because the miller amplified compensation capacitor c alters the

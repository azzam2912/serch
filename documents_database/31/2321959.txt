it uses sodium dodecyl sulfate sds molecules to help identify and isolate protein molecules sds page is a discontinuous electrophoretic system developed by ulrich k laemmli which is commonly used as a method to separate proteins with molecular masses between 5 and 250 kda the publication describing it is the most frequently cited paper by a single author and the second most cited overall sds page is an electrophoresis method that allows protein separation by mass the medium also referred to as matrix is a polyacrylamide based discontinuous gel in addition sds sodium dodecyl sulfate is used about 1 4 grams of sds bind to a gram of protein corresponding to one sds molecule per two amino acids sds acts as a surfactant covering the proteins intrinsic charge and conferring them very similar charge to mass ratios the intrinsic charges of the proteins are negligible in comparison to the sds loading and the positive charges are also greatly reduced in the basic ph range of a separating gel upon application of a constant electric field the protein migrate towards the anode each with a different speed depending on its mass this simple procedure allows precise protein separation by mass sds

this silicate mineral has been found as inclusions in pegmatites primarily in the kola peninsula in lappland where the mineral s name gets its origin laplandite is orthorhombic which states that crystallographically it contains three axes of unequal lengths that all intersect at 90 degrees perpendicular to one another the shape of the crystal is bipyramidal and is similar in structure to olivine or aragonite because of these different axes lengths it shows anisotropism which will allow for the visibility of birefringence this property can give the mineral very distinct colors when viewed under cross polarization laplandite has three different indices of refraction which are measures of the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the speed of light within the mineral determined individually on each axis due to these different indices laplandite is a biaxial mineral which states that the mineral will have two optic axes under the microscope this mineral has moderate relief which describes the contrast between laplandite s refractive index and the refractive index of the mounting medium on which it is placed the relief can be seen physically as how easily you can see the boundary lines of the mineral under plane polarized light

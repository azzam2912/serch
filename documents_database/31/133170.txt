hex forms solid grey crystals at standard temperature and pressure is highly toxic reacts with water and is corrosive to most metals the compound reacts mildly with aluminium forming a thin surface layer of alf that resists any further reaction from the compound milled uranium ore uo or yellowcake is dissolved in nitric acid yielding a solution of uranyl nitrate uo no pure uranyl nitrate is obtained by solvent extraction then treated with ammonia to produce ammonium diuranate adu nh uo reduction with hydrogen gives uo which is converted with hydrofluoric acid hf to uranium tetrafluoride uf oxidation with fluorine yields uf during nuclear reprocessing uranium is reacted with chlorine trifluoride to give uf at atmospheric pressure it sublimes at 56 5 c the solid state structure was determined by neutron diffraction at 77 k and 293 k it has been shown that uranium hexafluoride is an oxidant and a lewis acid that is able to bind to fluoride for instance the reaction of copper ii fluoride with uranium hexafluoride in acetonitrile is reported to form copper ii heptafluorouranate vi cu uf polymeric uranium vi fluorides containing organic cations have been isolated and characterised by x ray diffraction uf is

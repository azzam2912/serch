the use of computer models provides an exacting interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories this interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research such as neural networks and evolutionary programs this field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented stored perceived performed and generated by using a well structured computer environment the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated even while enjoying the simplest of melodies there are multiple brain processes that are synchronizing to comprehend what is going on after the stimulus enters and undergoes the processes of the ear it enters the auditory cortex part of the temporal lobe which begins processing the sound by assessing its pitch and volume from here brain functioning differs amongst the analysis of different aspects of music for instance the rhythm is processed and regulated by the left frontal cortex the left parietal cortex and the right cerebellum standardly tonality the building of musical structure around a central chord is assessed by the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum abram 2015 music is able to access many different brain functions that

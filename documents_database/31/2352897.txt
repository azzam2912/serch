the galaxy was discovered in 1987 by sanduleak and pesch and is located at a distance of about in the bo tes void and has no significant neighbours within 2 5 mpc the galaxy may be a counterpart to the rectangular shaped galaxy leda 74886 in that they both appear to contain an intermediate scale disk in the case of leda 74886 that disk is orientated edge on to our line of sight the early type galaxy class is commonly known to contain elliptical galaxies e with no substantial stellar disk perhaps just a small nuclear disk and lenticular galaxies s0 with their large scale disks that dominate the light at large radii bridging these two types of galaxies are the es galaxies with their intermediate scale disks referred to as ellicular galaxies in recent works leda 2108986 has accreted a gas disk which counter rotates relative to its stellar disk it also displays a young spiral pattern within this stellar disk the presence of such faint disk structures and rotation within some dwarf early type galaxies in galaxy clusters has often been heralded as evidence that they were once late type spiral or dwarf irregular galaxies prior to experiencing

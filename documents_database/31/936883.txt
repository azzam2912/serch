msh2 is a tumor suppressor gene and more specifically a caretaker gene that codes for a dna mismatch repair mmr protein msh2 which forms a heterodimer with msh6 to make the human muts mismatch repair complex it also dimerizes with msh3 to form the muts dna repair complex msh2 is involved in many different forms of dna repair including transcription coupled repair homologous recombination and base excision repair mutations in the msh2 gene are associated with microsatellite instability and some cancers especially with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer hnpcc hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer hnpcc sometimes referred to as lynch syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion where inheritance of only one copy of a mutated mismatch repair gene is enough to cause disease phenotype mutations in the msh2 gene account for 40 of genetic alterations associated with this disease and is the leading cause together with mlh1 mutations mutations associated with hnpcc are broadly distributed in all domains of msh2 and hypothetical functions of these mutations based on the crystal structure of the muts include protein protein interactions stability allosteric regulation msh2 msh6 interface and dna binding mutations in msh2 and other mismatch repair genes cause dna damage to go

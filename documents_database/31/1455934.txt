its aim is to support teaching of process algebras systems are described as process algebra terms that are then mapped to labeled transition systems ltss properties can be verified by checking equivalences between concrete and abstract system descriptions or by model checking temporal formulas expressed as calculus or actl over the obtained lts a key feature of tapas that makes it particularly suited for teaching is that it maintains a consistent graphical and textual representation of each system after a change in the graphic notation the textual representation is updated immediately but after textual modifications the update of the graphical representation has to be manually triggered in tapas concurrent systems are described by means of processes which are nondeterministic descriptions of system behaviors and process systems which are obtained by process compositions notably processes can be defined in terms of other processes or process systems processes and process systems are composed by using the operators of a given process algebra currently tapas supports two process algebras ccsp and pepa ccsp ccs csp is obtained from ccs by considering some operators of csp after creating a ccsp process system the user can analyze it using one of the following tools pepa

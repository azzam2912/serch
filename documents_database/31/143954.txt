invented by edward e simmons and arthur c ruge in 1938 the most common type of strain gauge consists of an insulating flexible backing which supports a metallic foil pattern the gauge is attached to the object by a suitable adhesive such as cyanoacrylate as the object is deformed the foil is deformed causing its electrical resistance to change this resistance change usually measured using a wheatstone bridge is related to the strain by the quantity known as the gauge factor a strain gauge takes advantage of the physical property of electrical conductance and its dependence on the conductor s geometry when an electrical conductor is stretched within the limits of its elasticity such that it does not break or permanently deform it will become narrower and longer which increases its electrical resistance end to end conversely when a conductor is compressed such that it does not buckle it will broaden and shorten which decreases its electrical resistance end to end from the measured electrical resistance of the strain gauge the amount of induced stress may be inferred a typical strain gauge arranges a long thin conductive strip in a zig zag pattern of parallel lines this does not increase

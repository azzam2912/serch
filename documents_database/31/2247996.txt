initial description of the fusome occurred in the 19th century and since then the fusome has been extensively studied in drosophila melanogaster male and female germline development this structure has roles in maintaining germline cysts coordinating the number of mitotic divisions prior to meiosis and oocyte determination by serving as a structure for intercellular communication in d melanogaster germline cysts form from four mitotic divisions with incomplete cytokinesis that originated from one germline stem cell incomplete cytokinesis results in intercellular bridges connecting every cell in the cyst called ring canals the four mitotic divisions result in cysts of 16 cells connected by 15 ring canals the fusome is composed of membrane vesicles and originates from endoplasmic reticulum fusome material is inside ring canals and can range in size from 1 to 10 um depending on the stage of development 1 1 fusome development the spectrosome is a round structure in germline stem cells that develops into the fusome in cyst cells fusome divides asymmetrically into daughter cells in females by attaching to one spindle pole during meiosis resulting in one cell receiving all fusome material fusome is generated de novo in the ring canal connecting the two cells the two

it is defined as the following infinite series which converges for formula 1 the euler product for the riemann zeta function s implies that which by m bius inversion gives when s goes to 1 we have formula 5 this is used in the definition of dirichlet density this gives the continuation of p s to formula 6 with an infinite number of logarithmic singularities at points s where ns is a pole only ns 1 when n is a squarefree number greater than or equal to 1 or zero of the riemann zeta function the line formula 7 is a natural boundary as the singularities cluster near all points of this line if one defines a sequence then the prime zeta function is related to artin s constant by where l is the n th lucas number specific values are the integral over the prime zeta function is usually anchored at infinity because the pole at formula 11 prohibits defining a nice lower bound at some finite integer without entering a discussion on branch cuts in the complex plane the noteworthy values are again those where the sums converge slowly the first derivative is the interesting values are again

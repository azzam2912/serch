it also demonstrates remarkable protection against corrosion and oxidation its ability to withstand high stress and a wide range of temperatures both in and out of water as well as being able to resist corrosion while being exposed to highly acidic environments makes it a fitting choice for nuclear and marine applications inconel 625 was developed in the 1960s with the purpose of creating a material that could be used for steam line piping some modifications were made to its original composition that have enabled it to be even more creep resistant and weldable because of this the uses of inconel 625 have expanded into a wide range of industries such as the chemical processing industry and for marine and nuclear applications to make pumps and valves and other high pressure equipment because of the metal s high niobium nb levels as well as its exposure to harsh environments and high temperatures there was concern about the weldability of inconel 625 studies were therefore conducted to test the metal s weldability tensile strength and creep resistance and inconel 625 was found to be an ideal choice for welding other well known names for inconel 625 are haynes 625 nickelvac 625

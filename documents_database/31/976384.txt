menin is a putative tumor suppressor associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 men 1 syndrome in vitro studies have shown that menin is localized to the nucleus possesses two functional nuclear localization signals and inhibits transcriptional activation by jund however the function of this protein is not known two messages have been detected on northern blots but the larger message has not been characterized two variants of the shorter transcript have been identified where alternative splicing affects the coding sequence five variants where alternative splicing takes place in the 5 utr have also been identified in 1988 researchers at uppsala university hospital and the karolinska institute in stockholm mapped the men1 gene to the long arm of chromosome 11 the gene was finally cloned in 1997 the gene is located on long arm of chromosome 11 11q13 between base pairs 64 570 985 and 64 578 765 it has 10 exons and encodes a 610 amino acid protein over 1300 mutations have been reported to date 2010 the majority 70 of these are predicted to lead to truncated forms are scattered throughout the gene four c 249 252delgtct deletion at codons 83 84 c 1546 1547insc insertion at codon

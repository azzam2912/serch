such crystallographic defects in diamond may be the result of lattice irregularities or extrinsic substitutional or interstitial impurities introduced during or after the diamond growth the defects affect the material properties of diamond and determine to which type a diamond is assigned the most dramatic effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity as explained by the electronic band structure the defects can be detected by different types of spectroscopy including electron paramagnetic resonance epr luminescence induced by light photoluminescence pl or electron beam cathodoluminescence cl and absorption of light in the infrared ir visible and uv parts of the spectrum the absorption spectrum is used not only to identify the defects but also to estimate their concentration it can also distinguish natural from synthetic or enhanced diamonds there is a tradition in diamond spectroscopy to label a defect induced spectrum by a numbered acronym e g gr1 this tradition has been followed in general with some notable deviations such as a b and c centers many acronyms are confusing though the symmetry of defects in crystals is described by the point groups they differ from the space groups describing the symmetry of crystals by absence of translations and

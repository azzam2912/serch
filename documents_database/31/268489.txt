only rays which pass through this virtual aperture can exit the system the exit pupil is the image of the aperture stop in the optics that follow it in a telescope or compound microscope this image is the image of the objective element s as produced by the eyepiece the size and shape of this disc is crucial to the instrument s performance because the observer s eye can see light only if it passes through this tiny aperture the term exit pupil is also sometimes used to refer to the diameter of the virtual aperture older literature on optics sometimes refers to the exit pupil as the ramsden disc named after english instrument maker jesse ramsden to use an optical instrument the entrance pupil of the viewer s eye must be aligned with and be of similar size to the instrument s exit pupil this properly couples the optical system to the eye and avoids vignetting the entrance pupil of the eye is the image of the anatomical pupil as seen through the cornea the location of the exit pupil thus determines the eye relief of an eyepiece good eyepiece designs produce an exit pupil of diameter approximating the

the compound has been of some scientific interest as a model for testing aromaticity and was first synthesised by boekelheide in 1979 superphane is the base compound for a large group of derivatives with structural variations the analogs with 2 to 5 bridges are also known compounds the benzene rings have been replaced by other aromatic units such as those based on ferrocene or stabilized cyclobutadiene numerous derivatives are known with variations in the type and length of the bridging units the first synthesis of superphane itself by boekelheide involved forming pairs of bridging units at each stage two o chloromethyl toluene structures are pyrolyzed to form o xylylenes either directly or via benzocyclobutene intermediates upon further pyrolysis these each undergo electrocyclic ring opening to form o xylylenes these structures were not isolated they immediately react via 4 4 cycloaddition reactions to form two adjacent bridges between the aromatic rings the process started from 2 4 5 trimethylbenzyl chloride 1 which was pyrolyzed at 700 c to give benzocyclobutene 2 and further pyrolyzed to the cyclooctane dimer 3 rieche formylation afforded 4 after separation from other regioisomers aldehyde reduction using sodium borohydride gave diol 5 and then chlorination using thionyl

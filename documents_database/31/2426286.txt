erich4 is highly conserved in mammals and exhibits overexpression in tissues of the kidneys terminal ileum and duodenum the function of erich4 has yet to be well understood by the scientific community but is suggested to contribute to immune inflammatory responses erich4 is located on the sense strand of 19q13 2 in humans consists of 2 340 base pairs and contains 2 exons erich4 on the sense strand is located within dmac2 and next pcat19 and b3nt8 which are all on the antisense strand the promoter is predicted to begin 1 806 bp upstream from the 5 utr and consists of 1 819 bp which overlaps with the coding sequence by 13 bp the erich4 mrna sequence is 955 nucleotides in length with a fold energy predicted as 139 80 kcal mol with 0 258 energy base erich4 has one different protein encoding transcript variant or isoform the primary encoded protein consists of 130 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 14 5 kda and isoelectric point of 4 pi as suggested by the protein s name glutamate rich protein 4 the protein is most highly composed of glutamic acid amino acids at 17 7 of the protein

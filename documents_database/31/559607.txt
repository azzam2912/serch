a key prerequisite concept is that of a statistical ensemble an idealization comprising the state space of possible states of a system each labeled with a probability that emphasizes properties of a large system as a whole at the expense of knowledge about parameters of separate particles when an ensemble describes a system of particles with similar properties their number is called the particle number and usually denoted by n in classical mechanics all particles fundamental and composite particles atoms molecules electrons etc in the system are considered distinguishable this means that individual particles in a system can be tracked as a consequence changing the position of any two particles in the system leads to a completely different configuration of the entire system furthermore there is no restriction on placing more than one particle in any given state accessible to the system these characteristics of classical positions are called maxwell boltzmann statistics or m b statistics the fundamental feature of quantum mechanics that distinguishes it from classical mechanics is that particles of a particular type are indistinguishable from one another this means that in an assembly consisting of similar particles interchanging any two particles does not lead to a new

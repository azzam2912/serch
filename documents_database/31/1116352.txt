the genotyping stage employs different techniques including single nucleotide polymorphism snp analysis chips typically 0 02 of the genome or partial or full genome sequencing once the genotypes are known the individual s variations can be compared with the published literature to determine likelihood of trait expression ancestry inference and disease risk automated high throughput sequencers have increased the speed and reduced the cost of sequencing making it possible to offer whole genome sequencing including interpretation to consumers since 2015 for less than 1 000 the emerging market of direct to consumer genome sequencing services has brought new questions about both the medical efficacy and the ethical dilemmas associated with widespread knowledge of individual genetic information personalized medicine is a medical method that targets treatment structures and medicinal decisions based on a patient s predicted response or risk of disease the national cancer institute or nci an arm of the national institutes of health lists a patient s genes proteins and environment as the primarily factors analyzed to prevent diagnose and treat disease through personalized medicine there are various subcategories of the concept of personalized medicine such as predictive medicine precision medicine and stratified medicine although these terms are used

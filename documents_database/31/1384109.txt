mangalloy is known for its high impact strength and resistance to abrasion once in its work hardened state mangalloy is made by alloying steel containing 0 8 to 1 25 carbon with 11 to 15 manganese mangalloy is a unique non magnetic steel with extreme anti wear properties the material is very resistant to abrasion and will achieve up to three times its surface hardness during conditions of impact without any increase in brittleness which is usually associated with hardness this allows mangalloy to retain its toughness most steels contain 0 15 to 0 8 manganese high strength alloys often contain 1 to 1 8 manganese at about 1 5 manganese content the steel becomes brittle and this trait increases until about 4 to 5 manganese content is reached at this point the steel will pulverize at the strike of a hammer further increase in the manganese content will increase both hardness and ductility at around 10 manganese content the steel will remain in its austenite form at room temperature if cooled correctly both hardness and ductility reach their highest points around 12 depending on other alloying agents the primary of these alloying agents is carbon because the addition of

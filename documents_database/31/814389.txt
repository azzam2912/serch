meltwater is often found in the ablation zone of glaciers where the rate of snow cover is reducing meltwater can be produced during volcanic eruptions in a similar way in which the more dangerous lahars form when meltwater pools on the surface rather than flowing it forms melt ponds as the weather gets colder meltwater will often re freeze meltwater can collect or melt under the ice s surface these pools of water known as subglacial lakes can form due to geothermal heat and friction meltwater provides drinking water for a large proportion of the world s population as well as providing water for irrigation and hydroelectric plants some cities around the world have large lakes that collect snow melt to supplement water supply cities that source water from meltwater include melbourne canberra los angeles las vegas amongst others glacial meltwater comes from glacial melt due to external forces or by pressure and geothermal heat often there will be rivers flowing through glaciers into lakes these brilliantly blue lakes get their color from rock flour sediment that has been transported through the rivers to the lakes this sediment comes from rocks grinding together underneath the glacier the fine powder is

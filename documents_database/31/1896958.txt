when a girder is subjected to a positive bending moment the top flange acts in compression making a flat plate flange more susceptible to local buckling than the balloon flange is this type of girder was rarely used its only common user being isambard kingdom brunel in the 1840s and 1850s brunel was working at a period of increased theoretical and mathematical analysis of bridge and mechanical structures together with the work of william fairbairn particularly in relation to stephenson s tubular bridges such as conwy there was an increased understanding of how beams in compression would fail by buckling brunel was known for his distrust of cast iron as a material at least for large beams this distrust of cast iron was vindicated when his friend stephenson s adventurous cast iron dee bridge 1846 collapsed in 1847 brunel gave evidence in his support at the following inquiry but this was on the basis of stephenson being a competent engineer within the bounds of current knowledge rather than in support of large cast iron beams stephenson s dee bridge had used a truss girder where an inverted t shaped cast iron girder was trussed by applied wrought iron tension bars

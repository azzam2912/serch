first detected using long term strain measurements most slow earthquakes now appear to be accompanied by fluid flow and related tremor which can be detected and approximately located using seismometer data filtered appropriately typically in the 1 5 hz band that is they are quiet compared to a regular earthquake but not silent as described in the past slow earthquakes should not be confused with tsunami earthquakes in which relatively slow rupture velocity produces tsunami out of proportion to the triggering earthquake in a tsunami earthquake the rupture propagates along the fault more slowly than usual but the energy release occurs on a similar timescale to other earthquakes earthquakes occur as a consequence of gradual stress increases in a region and once it reaches the maximum stress that the rocks can withstand a rupture generates and the resulting earthquake motion is related to a drop in the shear stress of the system earthquakes generate seismic waves when the rupture in the system occurs the seismic waves consist of different types of waves that are capable of moving through the earth like ripples over water the causes that lead to slow earthquakes have only been theoretically investigated by the formation of

the shell contains 10 whorls the protoconch is eroded but its first whorl is flattish and appears from above discoid and glassy the subsequent whorls are glistening constricted and appressed at the suture these whorls contain on the penultimate whorl eighteen arcuate and protractive axial ribs which extend from the suture to the siphonal canal except over the last half of the body whorl the constriction which indicates the anal fasciole gives the posterior edge of the whorl a marginate appearance but does not interrupt the ribs which are very prominent in front of the fasciole at the shoulder the whole surface is evenly sculptured by strongly incised almost channelled lines with wider flat strap like interspaces near the siphonal canal these become narrower and cord like and the channels wider diminishing again toward the end of the canal the spiral sculpture does not nodulate the ribs but is minutely crenulated on the eminences by fine even incremental lines the aperture is short wide with a deep rounded anal sulcus next the suture a thin and much produced outer lip a short slightly recurved flaring siphonal canal the arcuate columella is callous white and smooth with a conspicuous nodule on

the first caesium clock was built by louis essen in 1955 at the national physical laboratory in the uk and promoted worldwide by gernot m r winkler of the usno caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate time and frequency standards and serve as the primary standard for the definition of the second in the international system of units si the metric system by definition radiation produced by the transition between the two hyperfine ground states of caesium in the absence of external influences such as the earth s magnetic field has a frequency of exactly that value was chosen so that the caesium second equalled to the limit of human measuring ability in 1960 when it was adopted the existing standard ephemeris second based on the earth s orbit around the sun because no other measurement involving time had been as precise the effect of the change was less than the experimental uncertainty of all existing measurements the official definition of the second given by the bipm at the 13th general conference on weights and measures in 1967 is the second is the duration of periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of

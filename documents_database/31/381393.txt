commonly known as vanadium pentoxide it is a brown yellow solid although when freshly precipitated from aqueous solution its colour is deep orange because of its high oxidation state it is both an amphoteric oxide and an oxidizing agent from the industrial perspective it is the most important compound of vanadium being the principal precursor to alloys of vanadium and is a widely used industrial catalyst the mineral form of this compound shcherbinaite is extremely rare almost always found among fumaroles a mineral trihydrate vo 3ho is also known under the name of navajoite upon heating a mixture of vanadium v oxide and vanadium iii oxide comproportionation occurs to give vanadium iv oxide as a deep blue solid the reduction can also be effected by oxalic acid carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide further reduction using hydrogen or excess co can lead to complex mixtures of oxides such as vo and vo before black vo is reached vo is an amphoteric oxide unlike most metal oxides it dissolves slightly in water to give a pale yellow acidic solution thus vo reacts with strong non reducing acids to form solutions containing the pale yellow salts containing dioxovanadium v centers it also reacts

when the string bush hid the facts without newline or quotes was put in a new notepad document and saved closed and reopened the nonsensical chinese characters would appear instead while bush hid the facts is the sentence most commonly presented on the internet to induce the error the bug can be triggered by many strings with letters and spaces in the same positions for example other sequences trigger the bug as well including even the text the bug occurs when the string is passed to the win32 charset detection function istextunicode istextunicode sees that the bytes match the utf 16le encoding of valid if nonsensical chinese unicode characters concludes that the text is valid utf 16le chinese and returns true and the application then incorrectly interprets the text as utf 16le the bug had existed since istextunicode was introduced with in 1994 but was not discovered until early 2004 many text editors and tools exhibit this behavior on windows because they use istextunicode to determine the encoding of text files as of windows vista notepad has been modified to use a different detection algorithm that does not exhibit the bug but istextunicode remains unchanged in the operating system so

tissue engineering can be described as the use of engineering techniques including engineering materials and processes in order to grow living tissues regenerative medicine can be described as the treatment of defective tissues using the regenerative capacity of the body s healthy tissues combined dr nick rhodes describes the discipline as aiming to repair tissue defects by driving regeneration of healthy tissues using engineered materials and processes dr nick rhodes was born in manchester uk in 1966 and attended the university of lancaster where he gained a bachelor s degree in biochemistry he gained a masters in bioengineering from the university of strathclyde where he learned the basics of blood compatibility he trained under professor david f williams at the university of liverpool where he completed his ph d in blood compatibility he was awarded an advanced research fellowship from the uk engineering and physical sciences research council epsrc which allowed him the opportunity to broaden his research into biomaterials for tissue engineering dr rhodes continued his research at the university of liverpool being appointed a lecturer within the faculty of medicine in 1999 followed by senior lecturer in 2003 then reader in 2007 he had a prime role in

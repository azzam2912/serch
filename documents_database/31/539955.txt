the most common liquid used is mercury but other liquids will work as well for example low melting alloys of gallium the liquid and its container are rotated at a constant speed around a vertical axis which causes the surface of the liquid to assume a paraboloidal shape suitable for use as the primary mirror of a reflecting telescope the rotating liquid assumes the paraboloidal shape regardless of the container s shape to reduce the amount of liquid metal needed and thus weight a rotating mercury mirror uses a container that is as close to the necessary parabolic shape as possible liquid mirrors can be a low cost alternative to conventional large telescopes compared to a solid glass mirror that must be cast ground and polished a rotating liquid metal mirror is much less expensive to manufacture isaac newton noted that the free surface of a rotating liquid forms a circular paraboloid and can therefore be used as a telescope but he could not actually build one because he had no way to stabilize the speed of rotation the concept was further developed by ernesto capocci of the naples observatory 1850 but it was not until 1872 that henry skey

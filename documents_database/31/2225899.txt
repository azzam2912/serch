masc was first described by sk lov et al in 2010 the authors of this report found a chromosome translocation in certain salivary gland tumors that was identical to the 12 15 p13 q25 fusion gene mutation found previously in secretory carcinoma a subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast the translocation found in masc occurs between the etv6 gene located on the short arm designated p of chromosome 12 at position p13 2 i e 12p13 2 and the ntrk3 gene located on the long arm designated q of chromosome 15 at position q25 3 i e 15q25 3 to create the 12 15 p13 q25 fusion gene etv6 ntrk3 this mutant fusion gene also occurs in congenital fibrosarcoma congenital mesoblastic nephroma secretory breast cancer also termed juvenile breast cancer acute myelogenous leukemia alk negative inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour and radiation induced papillary thyroid carcinoma the masc gene codes for the transcription factor protein etv6 which suppresses the expression of and thereby regulates various genes that in mice are required for normal hematopoiesis as well as the development and maintenance of the vascular network the ntrk3 gene codes for tropomyosin receptor kinase c also termed trkc or tel the

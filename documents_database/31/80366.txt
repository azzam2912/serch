it is an axonometric projection in which the three coordinate axes appear equally foreshortened and the angle between any two of them is 120 degrees the term isometric comes from the greek for equal measure reflecting that the scale along each axis of the projection is the same unlike some other forms of graphical projection an isometric view of an object can be obtained by choosing the viewing direction such that the angles between the projections of the x y and z axes are all the same or 120 for example with a cube this is done by first looking straight towards one face next the cube is rotated 45 about the vertical axis followed by a rotation of approximately 35 264 precisely arcsin or arctan which is related to the magic angle about the horizontal axis note that with the cube see image the perimeter of the resulting 2d drawing is a perfect regular hexagon all the black lines have equal length and all the cube s faces are the same area isometric graph paper can be placed under a normal piece of drawing paper to help achieve the effect without calculation in a similar way an isometric view

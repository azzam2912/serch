an s space is a regular topological space that is hereditarily separable but is not a lindel f space an l space is a regular topological space that is hereditarily lindel f but not separable it had been believed for a long time that s space problem and l space problem are dual i e if there is an s space in some model of set theory then there is an l space in the same model and vice versa which is not true it was shown in the early 1980s that the existence of s space is independent of the usual axioms of zfc this means that to prove the existence of an s space or to prove the non existence of s space we need to assume axioms beyond those of zfc the l space problem whether an l space can exist without assuming additional set theoretic assumptions beyond those of zfc was not resolved until quite recently todorcevic proved that under pfa there is no s spaces this means that every regular formula 1 hereditarily separable space is lindel f for quite a long time it was believed the l space problem would have a similar solution

he has developed a method of seismic slope stability analysis which is named after him the sarma method sarma was initially educated in india studying civil engineering at the indian institute of technology in kharagpur and then geotechnical engineering at imperial college specialising in earthquake engineering and engineering seismology he worked under the supervision of professor nicolas ambraseys and obtained his phd degree in 1968 being the first phd degree awarded by the imperial college engineering seismology section followed by dimitri papastamatiou in 1971 his thesis title was response characteristics and stability of earth dams during strong earthquakes he joined the staff in 1967 as a lecturer in engineering seismology his major research focuses on engineering seismology and geotechnical engineering he specialised in seismic analysis and performance of soil slopes earth dams and the earthquake resistant design of foundations and design code development and evaluation he developed a new method of analysing the stability of slopes and dams in seismic conditions and calculating the permanent displacements due to strong shaking this method published in the 1970s several publications of this method are found in 1973 1975 and 1979 is named after him sarma method and it is a special case

protein kinases are enzymes that add a phosphate po group to a protein and can modulate its function the phosphate groups are usually added to serine threonine or tyrosine amino acids on the protein most kinases act on both serine and threonine the tyrosine kinases act on tyrosine and a number dual specificity kinases act on all three there are also protein kinases that phosphorylate other amino acids including histidine kinases that phosphorylate histidine residues phosphorylation regulates many biological processes and protein kinase inhibitors can be used to treat diseases due to hyperactive protein kinases including mutant or overexpressed kinases in cancer or to modulate cell functions to overcome other disease drivers kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib are often used in the treatment of cancer and inflammation some of the kinase inhibitors used in treating cancer are inhibitors of tyrosine kinases the effectiveness of kinase inhibitors on various cancers can vary from patient to patient currently there are several drugs launched or in development that target protein kinases and the receptors that activate them note ad approval date ms myelosuppression d diarrhoea fr fluid retention as far as myelosuppression diarrhoea and fluid retention goes means 70 of patients exhibit clinically

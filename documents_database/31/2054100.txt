the main mechanism is a mutation of the gene encoding ccr5 which acts as a co receptor for hiv it is estimated that the proportion of people with some form of resistance to hiv is under 1 in 1994 stephen crohn became the first person discovered to be completely resistant to hiv in all tests performed despite having partners infected by the virus crohn s resistance was a result of the absence of a receptor which prevent the hiv from infecting cd4 present on the exterior of the white blood cells the absence of such receptors or rather the shortening of them to the point of being inoperable is known as the delta 32 mutation this mutation is linked to groups of people that have been exposed to hiv but remain uninfected such as some offspring of hiv positive mothers health officials and sex workers in early 2000 researchers discovered a small group of sex workers in nairobi kenya who were estimated to have sexual contact with 60 to 70 hiv positive clients a year without signs of infection these sex workers were not found to have the delta mutation leading scientists to believe other factors could create a genetic

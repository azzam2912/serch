unfortunately no trace remains of these gardens besides the mansion the listing included three additional contributing buildings one other contributing structure and one non constributing structure on an area of the additional buildings include an outstanding federal style carriage barn another single bay carriage house a hay barn a corn crib and a shed the mansion seems unornamented yet in fact represents a sophisticated design it s located on a hilltop and seems isolated though being only about a mile away from interstate 88 the property was covered in a 1984 multiple resource area study of duanesburg properties which provides much background on the duane family the study describes the mansion as a squarish two story frame residence with a low hipped roof prominent two story piazza supported by doric columns round topped floor length windows opening onto the piazza and three identical entrances supported by gabled porches supported by slender ionic columns with its simply symmetrical form and sophisticated detailing it is a distinctive example of federal design and an unusual rural interpretation of the adamesque vocabulary after further substantive review the property was individually listed on the national register in 1987

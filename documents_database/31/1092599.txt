f t x is a set rather than a single point in formula 2 differential inclusions arise in many situations including differential variational inequalities projected dynamical systems dynamic coulomb friction problems and fuzzy set arithmetic for example the basic rule for coulomb friction is that the friction force has magnitude n in the direction opposite to the direction of slip where n is the normal force and is a constant the friction coefficient however if the slip is zero the friction force can be any force in the correct plane with magnitude smaller than or equal to n thus writing the friction force as a function of position and velocity leads to a set valued function existence theory usually assumes that f t x is an upper hemicontinuous function of x measurable in t and that f t x is a closed convex set for all t and x existence of solutions for the initial value problem for a sufficiently small time interval t t 0 then follows global existence can be shown provided f does not allow blow up formula 4 as formula 5 for a finite formula 6 existence theory for differential inclusions with non convex f t

culled from two live john peel radio 1 sessions the tracks were originally recorded and broadcast in 1977 the band formed in late 1976 recorded and sent their demo to peel the demo itself would go on to receive some airplay its cover was purposefully designed in striking blue and yellow used later on their debut lp so it could be seen without reading it even in a pile specifically for the benefit of john peel and his producer john waters sic according to bullen i phoned john walters once a week asking if he d listened to it and then he eventually gave us our session that was a great thing for us we did two in 77 within a few months of one another which was a bit unusual and i guess showed how much he loved the first one but i think he found our second one a bit self indulgent and didn t offer us another one after that the first session produced by tony wilson was recorded on the 28th of march 1977 and then first broadcast on the 22nd of april 1977 the second session produced by malcolm brown was recorded on the 26th

it is unknown whether they are related to the timing noise which all pulsars exhibit following a glitch is a period of gradual recovery where the observed periodicity slows to a period close to that observed before the glitch these gradual recovery periods have been observed to last from days to years currently only multiple glitches of the crab and vela pulsars have been observed and studied extensively while the exact cause of glitches is unknown they are thought to be caused by an internal process within the pulsar this differs from the steady decrease in the star s rotational frequency which is caused by external processes although the details of the glitch process are unknown it is thought that the resulting increase in the pulsar s rotational frequency is caused by a brief coupling of the pulsar s faster spinning superfluid core to the crust which are usually decoupled this brief coupling transfers angular momentum from core to the surface which causes a decrease in the measured period it is thought that the coupling could be caused by a breaking of the pulsar s magnetic dipole which would apply a torque to the crust causing a brief coupling between

it involves the quenching of singlet excited state chlorophylls chl via enhanced internal conversion to the ground state non radiative decay thus harmlessly dissipating excess excitation energy as heat through molecular vibrations npq occurs in almost all photosynthetic eukaryotes algae and plants and helps to regulate and protect photosynthesis in environments where light energy absorption exceeds the capacity for light utilization in photosynthesis when a molecule of chlorophyll absorbs light it is promoted from its ground state to its first singlet excited state the excited state then has three main fates either the energy is 1 passed to another chlorophyll molecule by f rster resonance energy transfer in this way excitation is gradually passed to the photochemical reaction centers photosystem i and photosystem ii where energy is used in photosynthesis called photochemical quenching or 2 the excited state can return to the ground state by emitting the energy as heat called non photochemical quenching or 3 the excited state can return to the ground state by emitting a photon fluorescence in higher plants the absorption of light continues to increase as light intensity increases while the capacity for photosynthesis tends to saturate therefore there is the potential for the absorption

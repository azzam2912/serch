it is essentially a northward continuation of the fluvial sediments of the mississippi river delta to its confluence with the ohio river at cairo illinois the current sedimentary area was formed in the cretaceous and early cenozoic by the filling with sediment of a pre existing basin an explanation for the embayment s formation was put forward by van arsdale and cox in 2007 movement of the earth s crust brought this region over a volcanic hotspot in the earth s mantle causing an upthrust of magma which formed the appalachian ouachita range subsequent erosion caused a deep trough that was flooded by the gulf of mexico and eventually filled with sediment from the mississippi river the embayment is a topographically low lying basin that is filled with cretaceous to recent sediments the northern end of the embayment appears as an anomalous break in regional geologic structure with paleozoic sedimentary rocks both to the east in kentucky and tennessee and to the west in missouri and arkansas the current sedimentary basin results from the filling of a cretaceous tectonic basin and existed as a large bay in the cretaceous through early cenozoic shoreline the new madrid seismic zone lies at

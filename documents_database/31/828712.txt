air showers utilize high pressure hepa or ulpa filtered air to remove dust fibrous lint and other contaminants from personnel or object surfaces the forceful cleansing of surfaces prior to entering clean environments reduces the number of airborne particulates introduced when properly incorporated into cleanroom design air showers provide an iso classified transition vestibule to ensure the cleanliness of the classified cleanroom air showers are typically placed between a gowning area and cleanroom after workers don appropriate garb and personal protective equipment they enter the shower so that the pressurized air nozzles remove any residual particles from coveralls once the program cycle is complete users exit out through a second door into the cleanroom air showers or air tunnels may also be placed between cleanrooms of different iso ratings air showers are generally constructed from cleanroom compatible steel or plastic materials and feature electronically powered blowers filters and high pressure jet nozzles the latter being incorporated into the walls and ceiling of the chamber air at velocities of 3 000 to 7 000 feet per minute fpm continuously streams from the jet nozzles for 30 45 seconds effectively removing loose particulate matter personnel inside the enclosure will lift their arms

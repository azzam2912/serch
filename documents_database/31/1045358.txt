immunoblasts are the most immature members of the protective cells involved in an immune response activated b cells may differentiate into memory cells or plasma cells while activated t cells may differentiate into memory cells or effector cells that aid in the immune response the majority of lymphocytes are small and have a thin rim of cytoplasm 6 9 m in diameter about the same size as erythrocytes diameter 7 5 m large lymphocytes 12 18 m in diameter are probably activated i e immunoblasts cells with a paler and wider rim of cytoplasm and are often mistaken for monocytes they have moderate to abundant basophilic cytoplasm and a prominent centrally located trapezoid shaped single nucleolus which often has fine strands of chromatin attached to the nuclear membrane spider legs in some cases immunoblasts show some morphologic features of plasma cells centroblasts are distinguished from immunoblasts by being large lymphoid cells containing a moderate amount of cytoplasm round to oval vesicular i e containing small fluid filled sacs nuclei vesicular chromatin and 2 3 small nucleoli often located adjacent to the nuclear membrane both immunoblasts and centroblasts are derived from b cells

sometimes for some reasons product spaces are equipped with sigma algebra different than the product sigma algebra in these cases the projections need not be measurable at all the projected set of a measurable set is called analytic set and need not be a measurable set however in some cases either relatively to the product sigma algebra or relatively to some other sigma algebra projected set of measurable set is indeed measurable henri lebesgue himself one of the founders of measure theory was mistaken about that fact in a paper from 1905 he wrote that the projection of borel set in the plane onto the real line is again a borel set the mathematician mikhail yakovlevich suslin found that error about ten years later and his following research has led to descriptive set theory the fundamental mistake of lebesgue was to think that projection commutes with decreasing intersection while there are simple counterexamples to that as an example for not measurable projection one can take the space formula 1 with the sigma algebra formula 2 and the space formula 1 with the sigma algebra formula 4 the diagonal set formula 5 is not measurable relatively to formula 6 although the

for implementation of boundary conditions when we construct a staggered grid we add an extra node across the physical boundary in order to get this allow us to introduce the boundary conditions and achieve discretion equations for nodes near boundary with small modifications most common boundary conditions used in computational fluid dynamics are we are considering the case of an inlet perpendicular to the x direction if flow across the boundary is zero normal velocities are set to zero scalar flux across the boundary is zero in this type of situations values of properties just adjacent to the solution domain are taken as values at the nearest node just inside the domain consider situation solid wall parallel to the x direction assumptions made and relations considered turbulent flow formula 1 in the log law region of a turbulent boundary layer laminar flow formula 2 important points for applying wall functions these conditions are used when we don t know the exact details of flow distribution but boundary values of pressure are known for example external flows around objects internal flows with multiple outlets buoyancy driven flows free surface flows etc considering the case of an outlet perpendicular to the x

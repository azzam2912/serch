suppose we have a statistical sample x x where each x follows a cumulative distribution f which depends on an unknown parameter if an estimator of based on the sample can be represented as a functional of the empirical distribution function f the estimator is said to be fisher consistent if as long as the x are exchangeable an estimator t defined in terms of the x can be converted into an estimator t that can be defined in terms of f by averaging t over all permutations of the data the resulting estimator will have the same expected value as t and its variance will be no larger than that of t if the strong law of large numbers can be applied the empirical distribution functions f converge pointwise to f allowing us to express fisher consistency as a limit the estimator is fisher consistent if suppose our sample is obtained from a finite population z z we can represent our sample of size n in terms of the proportion of the sample n n taking on each value in the population writing our estimator of as t n n n n the population analogue of the estimator is

choropleth maps provide an easy way to visualize how a measurement varies across a geographic area or show the level of variability within a region a heat map is similar but does not use geographic boundaries the earliest known choropleth map was created in 1826 by baron pierre charles dupin they were first called cartes teint es coloured map in french the term choroplethe map was introduced in 1938 by the geographer john kirtland wright in problems in population mapping choropleth maps are based on statistical data aggregated over previously defined regions e g counties in contrast to area class and isarithmic maps in which region boundaries are defined by data patterns thus where defined regions are important to a discussion as in an election map divided by electoral regions choropleths are preferred where real world patterns may not conform to the regions discussed issues such as the ecological fallacy and the modifiable areal unit problem maup can lead to major misinterpretations and other techniques are preferable similarly the size and specificity of the displayed regions depend on the variable being represented while the use of smaller and more specific regions can decrease the risk of ecological fallacy and maup

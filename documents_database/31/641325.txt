dichlorodifluoroethylenes are colourless gases and are some of the simplest chlorodifluoroalkenes the structural isomers are used as intermediates or precursors in the production of other industrial chemicals 1 1 dichloro 2 2 difluoroethylene is a low boiling liquid that is used a refrigerant it may also be used as a solvent but has practical limitations as such because of its low boiling point commercial listings 19 c lit 17 c it is regarded as a hazardous chemical for being toxic by inhalation see msds and a low boiling liquid and it causes irritation when it comes into contact with the skin and mucous membranes its ashrae number is r 1112a and its cas number is 79 35 6 concentrated 1 1 dichloro 2 2 difluoroethylene can be ignited with ease in the laboratory the diastereomers were co isolated first in 1965 by using a combination of fractional melting and fractional distillation the cis isomer s ashrae number is r 1112c and its cas number is 311 81 9 its melting point is the trans isomer s ashrae number is r 1112t and its cas number is 381 71 5 its melting point is the diastereomers are commercially only available as

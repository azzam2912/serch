the gauge that had been adopted by most railways at that time had been fine for small mineral trucks on a horse drawn tramway but he wanted something more stable for his high speed railway the large diameter wheels used in stage coaches gave better ride quality over rough ground and brunel originally intended to have his carriages carried in the same way on large diameter wheels placed outside their bodies to achieve this he needed a wider track gauge and he settled on a broad gauge but it was soon eased slightly to when the time came to build the passenger carriages they were designed conventionally with smaller wheels under the bodies but with the broad track gauge the bodies could be much wider than on the standard gauge his original intention to have the wheels outside the width of the bodies was abandoned early locomotive powered railways had used short cast iron rails carried on stone blocks a few were trying timber sleepers to support the rails and to maintain the gauge between them these rails were brittle and broke easily and they gave a rough ride due to the difficulty of maintaining a smooth line between the

early plasters contained asbestos but newer ones consist of a base layer of absorptive substrate panels which are typically mineral wool or a non combustible inorganic blow glass granulate a first finishing layer is then applied on top of the substrate panels and sometimes a second finishing layer is added for greater sound attenuation pre made acoustic panels are more commonly used but acoustic plaster provides a smooth and seamless appearance and greater flexibility for readjustment the drawback is the greater level of skill required in application proprietary types of acoustic plaster developed in the 1920s included macoustic plaster sabinite kalite wyodak old newark and sprayo flake produced by companies such as us gypsum acoustic plasters are aesthetically favorable because it allows for seamless smooth application compared to panels that show visible joints some acoustic plasters contain aggregate but better systems incorporate fiber acoustic plasters are generally applied at a thickness between 1 16 and 1 5 acoustic plasters consist of a base layer of absorptive substrate panels which are typically mineral wool or a non combustible inorganic blow glass granulate a first finishing layer is then applied on top of the substrate panels and when dried produces a first

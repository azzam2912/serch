concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium sized applications from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off grid rooftop pv system commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s the 392 mw ivanpah installation is the largest concentrating solar power plant in the world located in the mojave desert of california as the cost of solar electricity has fallen the number of grid connected solar pv systems has grown into the millions and utility scale photovoltaic power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built solar pv is rapidly becoming an inexpensive low carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the sun the current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is the 850 mw longyangxia dam solar park in qinghai china the international energy agency projected in 2014 that under its high renewables scenario by 2050 solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power would contribute about 16 and

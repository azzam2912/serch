the method is named after paul job and is also used in instrumental analysis and advanced chemical equilibrium texts and research articles job first published his method in 1928 while studying the associations of ions in solution by plotting the uv absorbance of a solution of against the mole fraction of he produced a graph which provided information about the equilibrium complexes present in solution in solutions where two species are present i e species a and species b one species a may bind to the other species b in some cases more than one a will bind with a single b one way to determine the amount of a binding to b is by using a job plot in this method the sum of the molar concentrations of the two binding partners e g a protein and ligand or a metal and a ligand is held constant but their mole fractions are varied an observable that is proportional to complex formation such as absorption signal or enzymatic activity is plotted against the mole fractions of these two components is the mole fraction of compound a and p is the physical property being measured to understand complex formation this property

manufacturers of application delivery controllers and content delivery networks cdns use a host of techniques to accelerate dynamic sites including an edge device either an adc or a cdn is capable of tcp multiplexing which can be placed between web servers and clients to offload origin servers and accelerate content delivery usually each connection between client and server requires a dedicated process that lives on the origin for the duration of the connection when clients have a slow connection this occupies part of the origin server because the process has to stay alive while the server is waiting for a complete request with tcp multiplexing the situation is different the device obtains a complete and valid request from the client before sending this to the origin when the request has fully arrived this offloads application and database servers which are slower and more expensive to use compared to adcs or cdns http has a built in system for cache control using headers such as etag expires and last modified many cdns and adcs that claim to have dsa have replaced this with their system calling it dynamic caching or dynamic cache control it gives them more options to invalidate and

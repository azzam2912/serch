it formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs the theorem was proved independently by jacques hadamard and charles jean de la vall e poussin in 1896 using ideas introduced by bernhard riemann in particular the riemann zeta function the first such distribution found is where is the prime counting function and is the natural logarithm of this means that for large enough the probability that a random integer not greater than is prime is very close to consequently a random integer with at most digits for large enough is about half as likely to be prime as a random integer with at most digits for example among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits about one in 2300 is prime whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits about one in 4600 is prime in other words the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first integers is roughly let be the prime counting function that gives the number of primes less than or equal to for any real number for example because there are four prime numbers 2 3 5 and

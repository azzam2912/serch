it is a fundamental feature of operating systems one particular instance is parallel writing of data to disk when file data is spread across multiple disks for example in a raid array one can store multiple parts of the data at the same time thereby achieving higher write speeds than with a single device other ways of parallel access to data include parallel virtual file system lustre gfs etc it is used for scientific computing and not for databases it breaks up support into multiple layers including high level i o library middleware layer and parallel file system parallel file system manages the single view maintains logical space and provides access to data files a single file may be stripped across one or more object storage target which increases the bandwidth while accessing the file and available disk space the caches are larger in parallel i o and shared through distributed memory systems companies have been running parallel i o on their servers to achieve results with regard to price and performance parallel processing is especially critical for scientific calculations where applications are not only cpu but also are i o bound

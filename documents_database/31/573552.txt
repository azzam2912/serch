the system under test may be composed of hardware or software or hardware with embedded software or hardware software with human in the loop testing sit consists initially of the process of assembling the constituent parts of a system in a logical cost effective way comprehensively checking system execution all nominal exceptional paths and including a full functional check out following integration system test is a process of verifying that the system meets its requirements and validating that the system performs in accordance with the customer or user expectations in technology product development the beginning of system integration testing is often the first time that an entire system has been assembled such that it can be tested as a whole in order to make system testing most productive the many constituent assemblies and subsystems will have typically gone through a subsystem test and successfully verified that each subsystem meets its requirements at the subsystem interface level in the context of software systems and software engineering system integration testing is a testing process that exercises a software system s coexistence with others with multiple integrated systems assuming that each have already passed system testing sit proceeds to test their required interactions

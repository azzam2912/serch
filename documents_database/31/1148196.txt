these are most commonly manifestations of arithmetic overflow but can also be the result of other issues the most well known consequence of bugs of this type is the y2k problem but many other milestone dates or times exist that have caused or will cause problems depending on various programming deficiencies during the 1960s some computer programs were written using just a single digit for the year so that 0 9 represented the years 1960 1969 it was especially easy to write programs in the cobol language with this limitation the problem was identified and corrected before 1970 no consequences due to this problem are known to have occurred the fix generally was to expand the year to just two digits owing to limitations of the storage media common in that era tab cards and magnetic tape on 4 january 1975 the 12 bit field that had been used for dates in the decsystem 10 operating systems overflowed there were numerous problems and crashes related to this bug while an alternative format was developed some mainframe programs were written to encode dates as the number of days since a zero date of 1 january 1900 storing them as signed 16

physically rectifiers take a number of forms including vacuum tube diodes mercury arc valves stacks of copper and selenium oxide plates semiconductor diodes silicon controlled rectifiers and other silicon based semiconductor switches historically even synchronous electromechanical switches and motors have been used early radio receivers called crystal radios used a cat s whisker of fine wire pressing on a crystal of galena lead sulfide to serve as a point contact rectifier or crystal detector rectifiers have many uses but are often found serving as components of dc power supplies and high voltage direct current power transmission systems rectification may serve in roles other than to generate direct current for use as a source of power as noted detectors of radio signals serve as rectifiers in gas heating systems flame rectification is used to detect presence of a flame depending on the type of alternating current supply and the arrangement of the rectifier circuit the output voltage may require additional smoothing to produce a uniform steady voltage many applications of rectifiers such as power supplies for radio television and computer equipment require a steady constant dc voltage as would be produced by a battery in these applications the output of the

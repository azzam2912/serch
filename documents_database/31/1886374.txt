the bijvoet center performs research on the relation between the structure and function of biomolecules including proteins and lipids which play a role in biological processes such as regulation interaction and recognition the bijvoet center houses advanced infrastructures for the analysis of proteins and other biomolecules using nmr x ray crystallography electron microscopy and mass spectrometry the institute is named after famous dutch chemist johannes martin bijvoet who worked at utrecht university utrecht university and the netherlands foundation for chemical research son which later became the chemical sciences division of nwo the netherlands organisation for scientific research founded the bijvoet center for biomolecular research as a joint research institute on march 25 1988 the goal was to create a center for research and expertise in structural biology with an internationally recognized academic staff and an advanced instrumental and computational infrastructure with the original task to conduct research into the molecular structure and reactivity of chemically and biologically important medium sized molecules and new methods to analyze them when the institute was founded it received 8 5 million dutch guilder approximately 3 9 million euro for new equipment that would contribute to societally important areas such as pharmacochemistry and biotechnology among

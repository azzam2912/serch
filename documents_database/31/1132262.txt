this corresponds to the existence of a timelike direction a modified metric with multiple negative eigenvalues would correspondingly imply a number of such timelike directions but there is no consensus regarding the possible relationships of these extra times to time as conventionally understood if the special theory of relativity is generalized for the case of k dimensional time t t t and n dimensional space x x x then the k n dimensional interval being invariant is given by the expression the metric signature is then or the transformations between the two inertial frames of reference k and k which are in a standard configuration i e transformations without translations and or rotations of the space axis in the hyperplane of space and or rotations of the time axis in the hyperplane of time are given as follows where formula 6 formula 7 formula 8 are the vectors of the velocities of k against k defined accordingly in relation to the time dimensions t t t formula 9 formula 10 1 2 k k 2 k 3 k n here is the kronecker delta these transformations are generalization of the lorentz boost in a fixed space direction x in the

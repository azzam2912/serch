it is the iron in hemoglobin specifically that gives blood its red color the actual color ranges from crimson to a dark brown blood depending on how oxygenated the blood is and may have a slightly orange hue deoxygenated blood which circulates closer to the body s surface and which is therefore generally more likely to be seen than oxygenated blood issues from bodily veins in a dark red state but quickly oxygenates upon exposure to air turning a brighter shade of red this happens more quickly with smaller volumes of blood such as a pinprick and less quickly from cuts or punctures that cause greater blood flows such as a puncture in the basilic vein all blood collected during a phlebotomy procedure is deoxygenated blood and it does not usually have a chance to become oxygenated upon leaving the body arterial blood which is already oxygenated is also already a brighter shade of red this is the blood see from a pulsating neck arm or leg wound and it does not change color upon exposure to air the color blood red therefore covers both these states the darker deoxygenated color and the brighter oxygenated one also dried blood often

first described independently by gilles klopman and lionel salem in 1968 this relationship provides a mathematical basis for the key assumptions of frontier molecular orbital theory i e theory of homo lumo interactions and hard soft acid base hsab theory conceptually it highlights the importance of considering both electrostatic interactions and orbital interactions and weighing the relative significance of each when rationalizing the selectivity or reactivity of a chemical process in modern form the klopman salem equation is commonly given asformula 1 where formula 2 is the electron population in atomic orbital a formula 3 formula 4 are the resonance and overlap integrals for the interaction of atomic orbitals a and b formula 5 is the total charge on atom k formula 6 is the local dielectric constant formula 7 is the distance between the nuclei of atoms k and l formula 8 is the coefficient of atomic orbital a in molecular orbital r and formula 9 is the energy of molecular orbital r broadly speaking the first term describes the closed shell repulsion of the occupied molecular orbitals of the reactants four electron filled filled interactions steric effects the second term describes the coulombic attraction or repulsion between the

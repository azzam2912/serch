this process uses a metal billet or ingot which is inserted in a chamber one side of this contains a die to produce the desired cross section and the other side a hydraulic ram is present to push the metal billet or ingot metal flows around the profile of the die and after solidification takes the desired shape extrusion process can be done with the material hot or cold but most of the metals are heated before the process if high surface finish and tight tolerances are required then the material is not heated dfm stands for design for manufacturing so as the name suggest the design is manufacturing friendly in simple terms design that can be manufactured easily and cheaply dfm guidelines define a set of rules for a person designing a product to ease the manufacturing process reduce cost and time for example if a hole is to be drilled if the designer specifies a standard hole size then it reduces the cost because the drill bits of unusual sizes are not readily available they have to be custom made nowadays quite a wide variety of metals are currently extruded commercially the most common are in order of

the process of browning is one of the chemical reactions that take place in food chemistry and represents an interesting research topic regarding health nutrition and food technology though there are many different ways food chemically changes over time browning in particular falls into 2 main categories enzymatic versus non enzymatic browning processes browning has many important implications on the food industry relating to nutrition technology and economic cost researchers are especially interested in studying the control inhibition of browning and the different methods that can be employed to maximize this inhibition and ultimately prolong the shelf life of food enzymatic browning is one of the most important reactions that takes place in most fruits and vegetables as well as in seafood these processes affect the taste color and value of such foods generally it is a chemical reaction involving polyphenol oxidase catechol oxidase and other enzymes that create melanins and benzoquinone from natural phenols enzymatic browning also called oxidation of foods requires exposure to oxygen it begins with the oxidation of phenols by polyphenol oxidase into quinones whose strong electrophilic state causes high susceptibility to a nucleophilic attack from other proteins these quinones are then polymerized in a series

fogel the purpose was to determine the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence checkers playing computer program the screen name was used on the zone an internet boardgaming site in 1999 during this time blondie24 played against some 165 human opponents and was shown to achieve a rating of 2048 or better than 99 61 of the playing population of that web site the design of blondie24 is based on a minimax algorithm of the checkers game tree in which the evaluation function is a deep learning convolutional artificial neural network the neural net receives as input a vector representation of the checkerboard positions and returns a single value which is passed on to the minimax algorithm the weights of the neural network were obtained by an evolutionary algorithm an approach now called neuroevolution in this case a population of blondie24 like programs played each other in checkers and those were eliminated that performed relatively poorly performance was measured by a points system each program earned one point for a win none for a draw and two points were subtracted for a loss points were earned for each neural network after a multiple of games the neural networks did not know

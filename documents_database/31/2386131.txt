these include organisms in the microbial mat free floating cells or bacteria in an endosymbiotic relationship with animals chemolithoautotrophic bacteria derive nutrients and energy from the geological activity at hydrothermal vents to fix carbon into organic forms viruses are also a part of the hydrothermal vent microbial community and their influence on the microbial ecology in these ecosystems is a burgeoning field of research hydrothermal vents are located where the tectonic plates are moving apart and spreading this allows water from the ocean to enter into the crust of the earth where it is heated by the magma the increasing pressure and temperature forces the water back out of these openings on the way out the water accumulates dissolved minerals and chemicals from the rocks that it encounters there are generally three kinds of vents that occur and are all characterized by its temperature and chemical composition diffuse vents release clear water typically up to 30 c white smoker vents emit a milky coloured water that are approximately 200 330 c black smoker vents generally release water hotter than the others between 300 400 c the waters from black smokers are darkened by the precipitates of sulfide that are accumulated

o wirsen and holger w jannasch of the university of california berkeley thermotoga neapolitana is considered thermophilic with a livable temperature range of 50 95 c the optimum temperature was found to be 77 c making it nearly hyperthermophilic there is also evidence that it could be found in saline environments due to its ability to thrive in moderately halophilic environments thermotoga neapolitana is a rod shaped gram negative bacterium it is distinguishable by a thick periplasmic cell wall generally they are found to be 0 2 5 m but they may reach sizes of up to 100 m it is non sporulating this along with its rod shape and gram negative features are characteristic of the order thermotogales using a guar gum based medium mannanase mannosidase galactosidase have been purified these galactomannans are associated with allowing an organism to endure harsh environments through stabilization of the membrane such as high temperatures these enzymes help provide simple saccharides to the organism polymers similar to those degraded by t neopolitana are often used as storage polymers by plants this may show that as the geothermal environments in which this organism is found have changed and biodiversified so might the metabolism of

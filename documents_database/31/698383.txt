examples of such problems include for example mechanical impact problems electrical circuits with ideal diodes coulomb friction problems for contacting bodies and dynamic economic and related problems such as dynamic traffic networks and networks of queues where the constraints can either be upper limits on queue length or that the queue length cannot become negative dvis are related to a number of other concepts including differential inclusions projected dynamical systems evolutionary inequalities and parabolic variational inequalities differential variational inequalities were first formally introduced by pang and stewart whose definition should not be confused with the differential variational inequality used in aubin and cellina 1984 differential variational inequalities have the form to find formula 1 such that for every formula 3 and almost all t k a closed convex set where closely associated with dvis are dynamic differential complementarity problems if k is a closed convex cone then the variational inequality is equivalent to the complementarity problem consider a rigid ball of radius formula 6 falling from a height towards a table assume that the forces acting on the ball are gravitation and the contact forces of the table preventing penetration then the differential equation describing the motion is where formula

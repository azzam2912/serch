the burst set a new record for the farthest object that was observable with the naked eye it had a peak visual apparent magnitude of 5 8 and remained visible to human eyes for approximately 30 seconds the magnitude was brighter than 9 0 for approximately 60 seconds if viewed from 1 au away it would have had a peak apparent magnitude of 67 57 2 148e 16 times brighter than the sun s apparent magnitude of 26 74 the grb s redshift was measured to be 0 937 which means that the explosion occurred about 7 5 billion years ago the lookback time and it took the light that long to reach earth this is roughly half the time since the big bang the first scientific paper submitted on the event suggested that the grb could have easily been seen to a redshift of 16 essentially to the time in the universe when stars were just being formed well into the age of reionization from a sub meter sized telescope equipped with near infrared filters the afterglow of the burst set a new record for the most intrinsically bright object ever observed by humans in the universe 2 5

consequently the gravitational potential of an embedded lens has a finite range i e there is no lensing effect outside of the void this is different from a standard lens where the gravitational potential of the lens has an infinite range as a consequence of embedding the bending angle lens equation image amplification image shear and time delay between multiple images of an embedded lens are all different from those of a standard linearized lens for example the potential part of the time delay between image pairs and the weak lensing shear of embedded lens can differ from the standard gravitational lensing theory by more than a few percents for an embedded point mass lens the lens equation to the lowest order can be written formula 1 where formula 2 is the einstein ring of the standard point mass lens and formula 3 is the angular size of the embedded lens this can be compared with the standard schwarzschild lens equation formula 4

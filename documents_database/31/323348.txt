most notably grp stimulates the release of gastrin from the g cells of the stomach the gene from which grp is derived encodes a number of bombesin like peptides its 148 amino acid preproprotein following cleavage of a signal peptide is further processed to produce either the 27 amino acid gastrin releasing peptide or the 10 amino acid neuromedin c these smaller peptides regulate numerous functions of the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems including release of gastrointestinal hormones smooth muscle cell contraction and epithelial cell proliferation gastrin releasing peptide is a regulatory human peptide that elicits gastrin release and regulates gastric acid secretion and enteric motor function the post ganglionic fibers of the vagus nerve that innervate the g cells of the stomach release grp which stimulates the g cells to release gastrin grp is also involved in the biology of the circadian system playing a role in the signaling of light to the master circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus furthermore grp seems to mediate certain aspects of stress this is the reason for the observed fact that atropine does not block the vagal effect on gastrin release the human grp gene is located on chromosome

the function and biological process of the queuosine salvage protein is not well understood by the scientific community but some evidence from orthologs indicates it may be involved in trna processing the most common mrna contains 4 coding exons and it has 2 additional alternatively spliced exons c9orf64 has been found in 5 different splice variants expression of this gene is highest in the duodenum and small intestine and it is also expressed in 24 other tissues 22 variants have been annotated in the nih database linked to disease conditions such as seizures developmental delay and muscular hypotonia queuosine salvage protein is 341 amino acids long with a molecular weight of 39 029 daltons and an isoelectric point of 5 61 it is a member of the duf2419 superfamily the duf position on the human protein is from amino acid 53 to 341 bioinformatic tools at expasy predicted a second peroxisomal targeting signal c9orf64 is located on chromosome 9q21 32 the genes closest to c9orf64 on the long arm of chromosome 9 include gkap1 kif27 hnrnpk rmi1 and a microrna mir7 1 c9orf64 is only found in eukaryotes orthologs have been found from primates to fungi and plants

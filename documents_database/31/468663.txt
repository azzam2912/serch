most low cost instrumentation and signal converters carry out this conversion by filtering the signal into an average rectified value and applying a correction factor the value of the correction factor applied is only correct if the input signal is sinusoidal the true rms value is actually proportional to the square root of the average of the square of the curve and not to the average of the absolute value of the curve for any given waveform the ratio of these two averages is constant and as most measurements are made on what are nominally sine waves the correction factor assumes this waveform but any distortion or offsets will lead to errors although in most cases this produces adequate results a correct conversion or the measurement of non sinusoidal values requires a more complex and costly converter known as a true rms converter the rms value of an alternating current is also known as its heating value as it is a voltage which is equivalent to the direct current value that would be required to get the same heating effect for example if 120 v ac rms is applied to a resistive heating element it would heat up by exactly

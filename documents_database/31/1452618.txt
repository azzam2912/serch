it blocks a type potassium channels in the central nervous system and herg channels in the heart bmtx3 was originally purified from the venom of the chinese scorpion buthus martensi karsch bmtx3 is a short chain peptide like other potassium channel blockers in the scorpion venom and added to the phylogenetic tree in the subfamily ktx15 its 3d structure has not yet been elucidated but based on sequence similarity it likely resembles the 3d structure of bmtx1 or discrepin bmtx3 consists of an helix and two sheet segments cross linked by three disulfide bridges cs motif it is a short chain peptide with a molecular mass of 3751 6 da it consists of 37 amino acids bmtx3 is the first toxin from the scorpion ktx subfamily 15 with two functional faces as all ktx peptides bmtx3 blocks a type i potassium currents k 54 nm bmtx3 blocks primarily the kv4 x proteins and has a higher affinity for kv4 1 channels than for kv4 2 and kv4 3 channels the second functional face of bmtx3 blocks the herg human ether go go channel k 2 m a characteristic belonging to ktx peptides bmtx3 binding site seems essentially localized in neurons

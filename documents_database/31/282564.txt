space guns could thus potentially provide a method of non rocket spacelaunch it has been conjectured that space guns could place satellites into earth s orbit although after launch propulsion of the satellite would be necessary to achieve a stable orbit and could also launch spacecraft beyond earth s gravitational pull and into other parts of the solar system by exceeding earth s escape velocity of about 11 2 km s or however these speeds are too far into the hypersonic range for most practical propulsion systems and also would cause most objects to burn up due to aerodynamic heating or be torn apart by aerodynamic drag therefore a more likely future use of space guns would be to launch objects into near earth orbit from where attached rockets could be fired or the objects could be collected by maneuverable orbiting satellites in project harp a 1960s joint united states and canada defence project a u s navy 100 caliber gun was used to fire a projectile at 3600 m s or reaching an apogee of hence performing a suborbital spaceflight however a space gun has never been successfully used to launch an object into orbit or out of earth

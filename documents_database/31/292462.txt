anything inside the path will be included after the clipping path is applied anything outside the path will be omitted from the output applying the clipping path results in a hard aliased or soft anti aliased edge depending on the image editor s capabilities by convention the inside of the path is defined by its direction reversing the direction of a path reverses what is considered inside or outside an inclusive path is one where what is visually inside the path corresponds to what will be preserved an exclusive path of opposite direction contains what is visually outside the path by convention a clockwise path that is non self intersecting is considered inclusive a compound path results from the combination of multiple paths inclusive and exclusive and the boolean operations that ultimately determine what the combined path contains for instance an inclusive path which contains a smaller exclusive path results in a shape with a hole defined by the exclusive path one common use of a clipping path is to cull objects that do not need to be rendered because they are outside the user s viewport or obscured by display elements such as a hud clipping planes are used

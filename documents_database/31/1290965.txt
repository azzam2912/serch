the family is cosmopolitan and contains both teleomorphic and anamorphic genera most of the latter being yeasts all teleomorphic species of fungi in the tremellaceae are parasites of other fungi though the yeast states are widespread and not restricted to hosts basidiocarps fruit bodies when produced are gelatinous the family currently comprises 18 genera plus synonyms containing around 250 valid species significant genera include tremella two species of which are edible and commercially cultivated and the yeast genus cryptococcus several species of which are human pathogens causing cryptococcosis fries created the family tremellaceae as tremellini in 1821 basing it on the macromorphology of fruit bodies he included within it most species of fungi that were gelatinous dividing it into the genera agyrium dacrymyces exidia hymenella naematelia and tremella agyrium and hymenella are now referred to the ascomycota as are several of the species fries placed in dacrymyces and tremella in 1900 patouillard radically revised the family by switching the emphasis to the micromorphology of fruit bodies for patouillard the tremellaceae was limited to genera and species in which the basidia were tremelloid globose to ellipsoid with vertical or diagonal septa whether or not the fruit bodies were gelatinous patouillard s

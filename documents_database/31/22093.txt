the exact frequency response of the filter depends on the filter design the filter is sometimes called a high cut filter or treble cut filter in audio applications a low pass filter is the complement of a high pass filter in the optical domain high pass and low pass have the opposite meanings with a high pass filter more commonly long pass passing only longer wavelengths lower frequencies and vice versa for low pass more commonly short pass low pass filters exist in many different forms including electronic circuits such as a hiss filter used in audio anti aliasing filters for conditioning signals prior to analog to digital conversion digital filters for smoothing sets of data acoustic barriers blurring of images and so on the moving average operation used in fields such as finance is a particular kind of low pass filter and can be analyzed with the same signal processing techniques as are used for other low pass filters low pass filters provide a smoother form of a signal removing the short term fluctuations and leaving the longer term trend filter designers will often use the low pass form as a prototype filter that is a filter with unity

all primitive recursive functions are total and computable but the ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive after ackermann s publication of his function which had three nonnegative integer arguments many authors modified it to suit various purposes so that today the ackermann function may refer to any of numerous variants of the original function one common version the two argument ackermann p ter function is defined as follows for nonnegative integers m and n its value grows rapidly even for small inputs for example is an integer of 19 729 decimal digits equivalent to 2 3 or 2 3 in the late 1920s the mathematicians gabriel sudan and wilhelm ackermann students of david hilbert were studying the foundations of computation both sudan and ackermann are credited with discovering total computable functions termed simply recursive in some references that are not primitive recursive sudan published the lesser known sudan function then shortly afterwards and independently in 1928 ackermann published his function formula 2 the greek letter phi ackermann s three argument function formula 3 is defined such that for p 0 1 2 it reproduces the basic operations of addition multiplication and exponentiation as and

it has been applied to the analysis of biomolecules biopolymers such as dna proteins peptides and sugars and large organic molecules such as polymers dendrimers and other macromolecules which tend to be fragile and fragment when ionized by more conventional ionization methods it is similar in character to electrospray ionization esi in that both techniques are relatively soft low fragmentation ways of obtaining ions of large molecules in the gas phase though maldi typically produces far fewer multi charged ions maldi methodology is a three step process first the sample is mixed with a suitable matrix material and applied to a metal plate second a pulsed laser irradiates the sample triggering ablation and desorption of the sample and matrix material finally the analyte molecules are ionized by being protonated or deprotonated in the hot plume of ablated gases and then they can be accelerated into whichever mass spectrometer is used to analyse them the term matrix assisted laser desorption ionization maldi was coined in 1985 by franz hillenkamp michael karas and their colleagues these researchers found that the amino acid alanine could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulsed

ewf allows the writes to be discarded or committed to the original volume later either directly or through inaction based on the configuration as this minimizes writes to a specified hard disk ewf and fbwf file based write filter have become popular in enthusiast computing as a way of decreasing wear of solid state drives on netbooks and carpcs ewf has three main operating modes ewf disk ewf ram and ewf ram reg in each mode the location of the ewf volume which stores the configuration and the overlay volume which stores file changes is different ewf disk stores the overlay data outside the primary disk allowing an external disk such as a compactflash to be used as an overlay the ewf volume is stored in an unpartitioned space on the disk ewf ram stores the overlay data in the ram and the ewf volume in an unpartitioned space on the disk ewf ram reg is same as ewf ram except the ewf volume is stored in windows registry as is the case with the appropriation of ewf in carpcs which are more often based on windows xp because of its smaller footprint it has been used with similar effect

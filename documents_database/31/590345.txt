they are usually the base of a package management system with ports handling package creation and additional tools managing package removal upgrade and other tasks in addition to the bsds a few linux distributions have implemented similar infrastructure including gentoo s portage arch s arch build system abs crux s ports and void linux s templates the main advantage of the ports collection method of install is the fine tuning and optimization of the software installation according to the hardware resources available for instance the system administrator can easily create a 64 bit install of a piece of software on a 64 bit system if a 64 bit binary isn t readily available instead of using a 32 bit version not optimized for such a system on the other hand the main disadvantage is the extra time spent in packages compilation for instance a full install of a freebsd system through the ports collection can take up to several days depending on the system performance jordan hubbard committed his port make macros to the freebsd cvs repository on august 21 1994 his package install suite makefile had been committed a year earlier august 26 1993 the core ports framework was

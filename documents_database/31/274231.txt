mutations in these cells are the only mutations that can be passed on to offspring when either a mutated sperm or oocyte come together to form a zygote after this fertilization event occurs germ cells divide rapidly to produce all of the cells in the body causing this mutation to be present in every somatic and germline cell in the offspring this is also known as a constitutional mutation germline mutation is distinct from somatic mutation germline mutations can be caused by a variety of endogenous internal and exogenous external factors and can occur throughout zygote development a mutation that arises only in germ cells can result in offspring with a genetic condition that is not present in either parent this is because the mutation is not present in the rest of the parents body only the germline due to many severe diseases stemming from de novo germline mutations different gene editing techniques can be used to induce dna breaks and repair the mutation germline mutations can occur before fertilization and during various stages of zygote development when the mutation arises will determine the effect it has on offspring if the mutation arises in either the sperm or the oocyte

the m ori name for it is p teke for many years it had been considered to be conspecific with the flightless auckland and campbell teals in anas aucklandica the name brown teal has also been largely applied to that entire taxon common in the early years of european colonisation the brown duck as it had been often referred to was heavily harvested as a food source its numbers quickly fell especially in the south island and in 1921 they became fully protected captive breeding and releasing into predator controlled areas has seen good localised populations re introduced around the country in recent years pateke is the progenitor of the flightless auckland teal and campbell teals but all are now recognised as separate species on account of their geographic isolation and their plumage size and genetic distinctions the insular a aucklandica and a nesiotis are recognised as good species but are still sometimes referred to as being part of the brown teal group the use of the name pateke is now common and is specific for this particular species concerns have been raised about establishing genetically similar populations during re introduction the original captive pateke were sourced from great barrier

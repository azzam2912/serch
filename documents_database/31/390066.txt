communities of organisms that are dependent on each other and on their environment live in aquatic ecosystems the two main types of aquatic ecosystems are marine ecosystems and freshwater ecosystems marine ecosystems the largest of all ecosystems cover approximately 71 of the earth s surface and contain approximately 97 of the planet s water they generate 32 of the world s net primary production they are distinguished from freshwater ecosystems by the presence of dissolved compounds especially salts in the water approximately 85 of the dissolved materials in seawater are sodium and chlorine seawater has an average salinity of 35 parts per thousand of water actual salinity varies among different marine ecosystems marine ecosystems can be divided into many zones depending upon water depth and shoreline features the oceanic zone is the vast open part of the ocean where animals such as whales sharks and tuna live the benthic zone consists of substrates below water where many invertebrates live the intertidal zone is the area between high and low tides in this figure it is termed the littoral zone other near shore neritic zones can include estuaries salt marshes coral reefs lagoons and mangrove swamps in the deep water hydrothermal

a classification system for glycoside hydrolases based on sequence similarity has led to the definition of 100 different families this classification is available on the cazy web site and also discussed at cazypedia an online encyclopedia of carbohydrate active enzymes glycoside hydrolase family 79 includes endo beta n glucuronidase and heparanase cazy gh 79 heparan sulphate proteoglycans hspgs play a key role in the self assembly insolubility and barrier properties of basement membranes and extracellular matrices hence cleavage of heparan sulphate hs affects the integrity and functional state of tissues and thereby fundamental normal and pathological phenomena involving cell migration and response to changes in the extracellular microenvironment heparanase degrades hs at specific intrachain sites the enzyme is synthesized as a latent approximately 65 kda protein that is processed at the n terminus into a highly active approximately 50 kda form experimental evidence suggests that heparanase may facilitate both tumour cell invasion and neovascularisation both critical steps in cancer progression the enzyme is also involved in cell migration associated with inflammation and autoimmunity

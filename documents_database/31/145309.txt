for example the interval class between pitch classes 4 and 9 is 5 because 9 4 5 is less than 4 9 5 7 mod 12 see modular arithmetic for more on modulo 12 the largest interval class is 6 since any greater interval n may be reduced to 12 n the concept of interval class accounts for octave enharmonic and inversional equivalency consider for instance the following passage to hear a midi realization click the following in the example above all four labeled pitch pairs or dyads share a common intervallic color in atonal theory this similarity is denoted by interval class ic 5 in this case tonal theory however classifies the four intervals differently interval 1 as perfect fifth 2 perfect twelfth 3 diminished sixth and 4 perfect fourth the unordered pitch class interval i a b may be defined as where i is an ordered pitch class interval while notating unordered intervals with parentheses as in the example directly above is perhaps the standard some theorists including robert prefer to use braces as in i a b both notations are considered acceptable

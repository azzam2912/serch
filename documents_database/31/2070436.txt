has only been discovered in recent years in the laboratory as it is not naturally occurring lead bismuthate forms a pentavalent structure significantly different from the regular ionic interactions of sodium bismuthate but similar to that of strontium bismuthate in the structure six oxygen atoms are coordinated octahedrally to both the bismuth and lead atoms the bismuth and oxygen atoms form negatively charged layers by creating repeating octahedral geometries the positively charged lead atoms are then disbursed within the layers forming a hexagonal unit cell with a lead atom in each of the corners the density of the crystal is 9 18 g cm the formula weight is 233 99 g mol the volume of the crystal structure unit is 169 26 a lattice parameters a is 5 321 angstroms one of the first found uses of lead bismuthate was its ability to be a semiconductor when doped with a metal that has one less electron p type doping it has ability to conduct its coefficient of performance also increases to a range of 0 2 to 0 6 its application as a semiconductor involves mixing bio pbo and sio into a paint and coat solar panels with the paint

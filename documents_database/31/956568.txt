ice crystals dust atmospheric particulates cosmic dust and blood cells cause optical phenomena such as rainbows the blue color of the sky and halos maxwell s equations are the basis of theoretical and computational methods describing light scattering but since exact solutions to maxwell s equations are only known for selected geometries such as spherical particle light scattering by particles is a branch of computational electromagnetics dealing with electromagnetic radiation scattering and absorption by particles in case of geometries for which analytical solutions are known such as spheres cluster of spheres infinite cylinders the solutions are typically calculated in terms of infinite series in case of more complex geometries and for inhomogeneous particles the original maxwell s equations are discretized and solved multiple scattering effects of light scattering by particles are treated by radiative transfer techniques see e g atmospheric radiative transfer codes relative size of a scattering particle is defined by size parameter which is the ratio of its characteristic dimension and wavelength the fdtd method belongs in the general class of grid based differential time domain numerical modeling methods the time dependent maxwell s equations in partial differential form are discretized using central difference approximations to the space

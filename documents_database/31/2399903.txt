the zero point is used to calibrate a system to the standard magnitude system as the flux detected from stars will vary from detector to detector traditionally vega is used as the calibration star for the zero point magnitude in specific pass bands u b and v although often an average of multiple stars is used for higher accuracy it is not often practical to find vega in the sky to calibrate the detector so for general purposes any star may be used in the sky that has a known apparent magnitude the equation for the magnitude of an object in a given band is formula 1 where m is the magnitude of an object f is the flux at a specific wavelength and s is the sensitivity function of a given instrument under ideal conditions the sensitivity is 1 inside a pass band and 0 outside a pass band the constant c is determined from the 0 point magnitude using the above equation by setting the magnitude equal to 0 under most circumstances vega is used as the zero point but in reality an elaborate bootstrap system is used to calibrate a detector the calibration typically takes place through

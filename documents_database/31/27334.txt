the universal machine essentially achieves this by reading both the description of the machine to be simulated as well as the input there of from its own tape alan turing introduced the idea of such a machine in 1936 1937 this principle is considered to be the origin of the idea of a stored program computer used by john von neumann in 1946 for the electronic computing instrument that now bears von neumann s name the von neumann architecture in terms of computational complexity a multi tape universal turing machine need only be slower by logarithmic factor compared to the machines it simulates every turing machine computes a certain fixed partial computable function from the input strings over its alphabet in that sense it behaves like a computer with a fixed program however we can encode the action table of any turing machine in a string thus we can construct a turing machine that expects on its tape a string describing an action table followed by a string describing the input tape and computes the tape that the encoded turing machine would have computed turing described such a construction in complete detail in his 1936 paper davis makes a persuasive

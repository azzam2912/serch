an example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate is an example in three variables is polynomials appear in many areas of mathematics and science for example they are used to form polynomial equations which encode a wide range of problems from elementary word problems to complicated scientific problems they are used to define polynomial functions which appear in settings ranging from basic chemistry and physics to economics and social science they are used in calculus and numerical analysis to approximate other functions in advanced mathematics polynomials are used to construct polynomial rings and algebraic varieties central concepts in algebra and algebraic geometry the word polynomial joins two diverse roots the greek poly meaning many and the latin nomen or name it was derived from the term binomial by replacing the latin root bi with the greek poly the word polynomial was first used in the 17th century the x occurring in a polynomial is commonly called either a variable or an indeterminate when the polynomial is considered as an expression x is a fixed symbol which does not have any value its value is indeterminate however when one considers the function defined by the polynomial then x represents the

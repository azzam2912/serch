it was discovered by grote reber in 1939 in 1951 cygnus a along with cassiopeia a and puppis a were the first radio stars identified with an optical source of these cygnus a became the first radio galaxy the other two being nebulae inside the milky way in 1953 roger jennison and m k das gupta showed it to be a double source like all radio galaxies it contains an active galactic nucleus the supermassive black hole at the core has a mass of images of the galaxy in the radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum show two jets protruding in opposite directions from the galaxy s center these jets extend many times the width of the portion of the host galaxy which emits radiation at visible wavelengths at the ends of the jets are two lobes with hot spots of more intense radiation at their edges these hot spots are formed when material from the jets collides with the surrounding intergalactic medium in 2016 a radio transient was discovered 460 parsecs away from the center of cygnus a between 1989 and 2016 the object cospatial with a previously known infrared source exhibited at least an eightfold increase in radio

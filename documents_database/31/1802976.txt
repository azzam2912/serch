the development of better instrumentation for measuring the eye s axial length al and the use of more precise mathematical formulas to perform the appropriate calculations have significantly improved the accuracy with which the surgeon determines the iol power in order to determine the power of intraocular lens several values need to be known of these parameters the first two are measured before the implantation the third parameter the elp need to be estimated mathematically before the implantation and the last parameter is provided by the manufacturer of the intraocular lens the axial length al is the distance between the anterior surface of the cornea and the fovea and usually measured by a scan ultrasonography or optical coherence biometry the al is the most important factor in iol calculation a 1 mm error in al measurement results in a refractive error of approximately 2 88 d or about 3 0 3 5 d error of iol power in an average eye a mean shortening of 0 25 0 33mm can translate into an error of iol power by approximately 1 d in a scan ultrasound biometry a crystal oscillates to generate a high frequency sound wave that penetrates into the

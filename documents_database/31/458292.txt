one gram of a 100 active chlorine bleach has the quantitative bleaching capacity as one gram of free chlorine the term active chlorine is used because most commercial bleaches also contain chlorine in the form of chloride ions which have no bleaching properties liquid bleaches for domestic use fall in 3 categories for pool treatment 10 hypochlorite solutions without surfactants and detergents for laundry and general purpose cleaning at 3 5 active chlorine which are usually recommended to be diluted substantially before use and in pre mixed specialty formulations targeted at particular cleaning bleaching or disinfecting applications commercial chlorine bleaches range from under 10 active chlorine to over 40 values can be higher than 100 because hypochlorite ion has a molecular weight of 51 45 g mol whereas dichlorine cl has a molecular weight of 70 90 g mol dichlorine has a reference bleaching potential of 100 for its molecular weight hypochlorite clo also has a molecule to molecule bleaching potential the same as dichlorine however its lower molecular weight leads to a higher potential bleaching power in the example of lithium hypochlorite molecular weight 58 39 it only takes 58 39 grams to equal the bleaching power of 70

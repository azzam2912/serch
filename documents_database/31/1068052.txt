clinically it has been shown to be effective against upper and lower respiratory tract infections urinary tract infections and gonorrhea cefodizime is a bactericidal antibiotic that targets penicillin binding proteins pbps 1a b 2 and 3 resulting in the eventual death of the bacterial cell in vivo experimental models of infection showed that bacterial clearance by this drug is at least as effective compared with other 3rd generation cephalosporins it has similar adverse effect profile to other 3rd generation cephalosporins as well mainly being limited to gastrointestinal or dermatological side effects it is not currently approved by the fda for use in the united states cefodizime demonstrated superior clinical efficacy that what could be predicted from its in vitro experimental results certain immunomodulatory properties of the drug might account for its increased in vivo activity against specific bacterial species these immunomodulatory properties stimulate some phagocyte and lymphocyte cellular functions when they have been impaired it was shown in a 2004 study that cefodizime increased expression of toll like receptor 4 tlr 4 in neutrophils stimulated by klebsiella pneumoniae infection which then affected the production of cytokines in the stimulated cells a 1992 study conducted in vitro susceptibility studies for cefodizime

paternal mtdna inheritance is observed in a small proportion of species in general mtdna is passed unchanged from a mother to her offspring making it an example of non mendelian inheritance in contrast mtdna transmission from both parents occurs regularly in certain bivalves paternal mtdna inheritance in animals varies for example in mytilidae mussels paternal mtdna is transmitted through the sperm and establishes itself only in the male gonad in testing 172 sheep the mitochondrial dna from three lambs in two half sib families were found to show paternal inheritance an instance of paternal leakage resulted in a study on chickens there has been evidences that paternal leakage is an integral part of the inheritance of drosophila simulans in human mitochondrial genetics there is debate over whether or not paternal mtdna transmission is possible many studies hold that paternal mtdna is never transmitted to offspring this thought is central to mtdna genealogical dna testing and to the theory of mitochondrial eve the fact that mitochondrial dna is maternally inherited enables researchers to trace maternal lineage far back in time y chromosomal dna paternally inherited is used in an analogous way to trace the agnate lineage in sexual reproduction paternal mitochondria

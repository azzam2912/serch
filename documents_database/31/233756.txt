nems form the next logical miniaturization step from so called microelectromechanical systems or mems devices nems typically integrate transistor like nanoelectronics with mechanical actuators pumps or motors and may thereby form physical biological and chemical sensors the name derives from typical device dimensions in the nanometer range leading to low mass high mechanical resonance frequencies potentially large quantum mechanical effects such as zero point motion and a high surface to volume ratio useful for surface based sensing mechanisms applications include accelerometers and sensors to detect chemical substances in the air as noted by richard feynman in his famous talk in 1959 there s plenty of room at the bottom there are many potential applications of machines at smaller and smaller sizes by building and controlling devices at smaller scales all technology benefits the expected benefits include greater efficiencies and reduced size decreased power consumption and lower costs of production in electromechanical systems in 1960 mohamed m atalla and dawon kahng at bell labs fabricated the first mosfet with a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm in 1962 atalla and kahng fabricated a nanolayer base metal semiconductor junction m s junction transistor that used gold au thin films with a thickness

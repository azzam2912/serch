initially the companies combined the gendarmes fully armoured men at arms along with lighter coutiliers and archers in the same mounted formation with the better armoured men forming the foremost ranks however as time passed the lighter horsemen were increasingly separated into independent formations of medium cavalry bearing lighter armour and much shorter lances than the gendarmes these lighter formations eventually gained the name of chevau l gers a similar development also happened in the organization of the austrian and spanish cavalry with the growth of caballer a ligera formations their original similarities to lancer units meant that in the armies of the napoleonic wars the title came to be applied for both sword armed medium cavalry and lancer cavalry units interchangeably depending on the regional custom examples of this include the famous polish 1st light cavalry regiment of the french guards and the 2e r giment de chevau l gers lanciers de la garde imp riale both subtitled chevau l gers despite being light lancer cavalry while the austrian and many other german states retained chevau l gers that were actually sword armed medium cavalry

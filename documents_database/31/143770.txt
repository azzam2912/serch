the meaning of significant is a matter of context but often a threshold velocity of 30 to 50 of the speed of light 0 3 c to 0 5 c is used at 30 of c the difference between relativistic mass and rest mass is only about 5 while at 50 it is 15 at 0 75 c the difference is over 50 so that above this range of speeds special relativity is required to accurately describe motion whereas below this range sufficient accuracy is usually provided by newtonian physics and the tsiolkovsky rocket equation in this context a rocket is defined as an object carrying all of its reaction mass energy and engines with it there is no known technology capable of accelerating a rocket to relativistic velocities relativistic rockets require enormous advances in spacecraft propulsion energy storage and engine efficiency which may or may not ever be possible nuclear pulse propulsion could theoretically achieve 0 1 c using current known technologies but would still require many engineering advances to achieve this the relativistic gamma factor formula 1 at 10 of light velocity is 1 005 the time dilation factor of 1 005 which occurs at 10 of light

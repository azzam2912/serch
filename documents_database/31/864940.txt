some load the core files and libraries during computer startup and allows the applications to start more quickly when selected later quickstarters typically place an icon in the system tray when the full application needs to be loaded the base components are already in ram which significantly reduces load time quickstarters are controversial because they use up ram even when the application is not open for this reason quickstarters can actually decrease performance as a whole for example if six applications load a quickstarter into the system tray at 50 megabytes per piece that is 300 megabytes of ram that could otherwise be used for working applications if the user only has 256 megabytes of ram this will cause running applications to page to virtual memory and drastically reduce performance on the other hand if the user has one gigabyte of ram running applications will probably not be paged and load times for quickstart applications will be reduced resulting in higher overall performance the point from where the user powers on the system and when the system is ready for use will be delayed as the system must incur a performance penalty in the form of reading the quickstart applications

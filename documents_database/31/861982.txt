using secondary amines as opposed to primary amines the zincke reaction takes on a different shape forming zincke aldehydes in which the pyridine ring is ring opened with the terminal iminium group hydrolyzed to an aldehyde the use of the dinitrophenyl group for pyridine activation was first reported by theodor zincke the use of cyanogen bromide for pyridine activation was independently reported by w k nig the synthesis and utility of zincke aldehydes has been reviewed a variation of the zincke reaction has been applied in the synthesis of novel indoles with cyanogen bromide mediated pyridine activation k nig method more recently an interesting rearrangement of zincke aldehydes to z unsaturated amides was discovered serendipitously while trying to do an intramolecular diels alder reaction the rearrangement gives the z product stereospecifically in a follow up paper allylic amines were used and gave products of a rearrangement intramolecular diels alder cascade mechanistic details were also discussed however further investigations in collaboration with the houk group revealed an unusual and unexpected mechanism based on computational studies the new mechanism involves formation of a vinyl ketene the vanderwal group has also reported the synthesis of 4 stannyldienals from zincke aldehydes by addition of

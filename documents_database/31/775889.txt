it is a possible low angle diffraction standard that was characterized using the powder diffraction technique diffraction patterns obtained with 1 54 synchrotron and cu ka radiations showed thirteen reflections in the range 1 5 20 0 2 theta with the national institute of standards and technology s standard reference material silicon as an internal standard the long spacing of silver behenate was accurately determined from the profile fitted synchrotron diffraction peaks with d 58 380 3 5 8380 3 nm this result was in agreement with that obtained from the cu ka pattern the profile widths of the silver behenate peaks were found to be consistently larger than those of the silicon peaks indicating significant line broadening for silver behenate the average crystallite size along the long spacing direction of silver behenate was estimated using the scherrer equation giving d avg 900 50 85 95 nm because silver behenate has a large number of well defined diffraction peaks in the 1 5 20 0 2 theta range it is suitable for use as an angle calibration standard for low angle diffraction however care must be taken if silver behenate is to be used as a peak profile calibration standard

the successful zebra crossing design was not considered safe enough for busy roads and could create traffic delays as pedestrians crossed whenever they wanted off the shelf light controlled systems were available but were too expensive for widespread use some cities had innovated with their own one off crossings but the lack of standardisation was considered a safety issue furthermore all existing signalled crossings tended to have two major drawbacks stopping traffic for long periods of time and appearing to violate contemporary right of way law by signalling don t cross to pedestrians in reality the don t cross indication was not a legally enforceable instruction the panda crossing was introduced in 1962 as an attempt to combine the best features of available and experimental crossing systems the first public example was opened on 2 april of that year outside london waterloo railway station the majority of the initial sites used for this experiment were in guildford where all thirteen existing crossings were converted and in lincoln where ten crossings were converted further sites across england and wales increased the size of the experiment to more than forty sites in all the layout was superficially similar to a traditional zebra

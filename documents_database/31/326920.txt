a sample in which these orientations are fully random is said to have no distinct texture if the crystallographic orientations are not random but have some preferred orientation then the sample has a weak moderate or strong texture the degree is dependent on the percentage of crystals having the preferred orientation texture is seen in almost all engineered materials and can have a great influence on materials properties also geologic rocks show texture due to their thermo mechanic history of formation processes one extreme case is a complete lack of texture a solid with perfectly random crystallite orientation will have isotropic properties at length scales sufficiently larger than the size of the crystallites the opposite extreme is a perfect single crystal which likely has anisotropic properties by geometric necessity texture can be determined by various methods some methods allow a quantitative analysis of the texture while others are only qualitative among the quantitative techniques the most widely used is x ray diffraction using texture goniometers followed by the ebsd method electron backscatter diffraction in scanning electron microscopes qualitative analysis can be done by laue photography simple x ray diffraction or with a polarized microscope neutron and synchrotron high energy x

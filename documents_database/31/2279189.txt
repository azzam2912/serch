the nanoclamp scaffold is based on an igg like thermostable carbohydrate binding module family 32 cbm32 from a clostridium perfringens hyaluronidase mu toxin the shape of nanoclamps approximates a cylinder of approximately 4 nm in length and 2 5 nm in diameter roughly the same size as a nanobody nanoclamps to specific targets are generated by varying the amino acid sequences and sometimes the length of three solvent exposed adjacent loops that connect the beta strands making up the beta sandwich fold conferring binding affinity and specificity for the target nanoclamps are the first antibody mimetics described to be polyol responsive meaning they release their targets upon exposure to a non chaotropic salt and a polyol such as propylene glycol this property has been shown to be useful for purifying functional proteins and protein complexes by affinity purification nanoclamps are easily produced in the cytoplasm of e coli with typical yields in the range of 50 to 300 mg l culture because nanoclamps are devoid of cysteines an engineered c terminal cysteine can be used for site directed conjugation of entities like fluorophores or resins using thiol chemistry nanoclamps were developed in the laboratories of nectagen inc nanoclamp phage display

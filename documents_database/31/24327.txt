having a left and a right side that are mirror images of each other this also means they have a head and a tail anterior posterior axis as well as a back and a belly ventral dorsal axis nearly all are bilaterally symmetrical as adults as well the most notable exception is the echinoderms which achieve near radial symmetry as adults but are bilaterally symmetrical during embryonic development most animals are bilaterians excluding sponges ctenophores placozoans and cnidarians for the most part bilateral embryos are triploblastic having three germ layers endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm except for a few phyla i e flatworms and gnathostomulids bilaterians have complete digestive tracts with a separate mouth and anus some bilaterians lack body cavities acoelomates i e platyhelminthes gastrotricha and gnathostomulida while others display primary body cavities deriving from the blastocoel as pseudocoeloms or secondary cavities that appear de novo for example the coelom some of the earliest bilaterians were wormlike and a bilaterian body can be conceptualized as a cylinder with a gut running between two openings the mouth and the anus around the gut it has an internal body cavity a coelom or pseudocoelom animals with this bilaterally symmetric body plan have

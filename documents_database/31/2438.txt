context sensitive is one of the four types of grammars in the chomsky hierarchy computationally a context sensitive language is equivalent with a linear bounded nondeterministic turing machine also called a linear bounded automaton that is a non deterministic turing machine with a tape of only formula 1 cells where formula 2 is the size of the input and formula 3 is a constant associated with the machine this means that every formal language that can be decided by such a machine is a context sensitive language and every context sensitive language can be decided by such a machine this set of languages is also known as nlinspace or nspace o n because they can be accepted using linear space on a non deterministic turing machine the class linspace or dspace o n is defined the same except using a deterministic turing machine clearly linspace is a subset of nlinspace but it is not known whether linspace nlinspace one of the simplest context sensitive but not context free languages is formula 4 the language of all strings consisting of occurrences of the symbol a then b s then c s abc etc a superset of this language called the bach

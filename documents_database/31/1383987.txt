note that in this equation the normal points to the inner of the enclosed volume if the more usual outer pointing normal is used the integral will have the opposite sign a more general form can be derived for non monochromatic waves the complex amplitude of the wave can be represented by a fourier integral of the form where by fourier inversion we have the integral theorem above is applied to each fourier component formula 4 and the following expression is obtained where the square brackets on v terms denote retarded values i e the values at time t s c kirchhoff showed that the above equation can be approximated in many cases to a simpler form known as the kirchhoff or fresnel kirchhoff diffraction formula which is equivalent to the huygens fresnel equation but provides a formula for the inclination factor which is not defined in the latter the diffraction integral can be applied to a wide range of problems in optics

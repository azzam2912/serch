a homogenized sample is equal in composition throughout so that removing a fraction does not alter the overall molecular make up of the sample remaining and is identical to the fraction removed homogenization in biology is often followed by molecular extraction and various analytical techniques including elisa and western blot homogenization of tissue in solution is often performed simultaneously with cell lysis to prevent lysis however the tissue or collection of cells e g from cell culture can be kept at temperatures slightly above zero to prevent autolysis and in an isotonic solution to prevent osmotic damage if freezing the tissue is possible cryohomogenization can be performed under dry conditions and is often the method of choice whenever it is desirable to collect several distinct molecular classes e g both protein and rna from a single sample or combined set of samples or when long term storage of part of the sample is desired cryohomogenization can be carried out using a supercooled mortar and pestle classic approach or the tissue can be homogenized by crushing it into a fine powder inside a clean plastic bag resting against a supercooled solid metal block more recently developed and more efficient technique high

it is very similar to a recirculating wind tunnel but with water as the working fluid and related phenomena are investigated such as measuring the forces on scale models of submarines or lift and drag on hydrofoils water tunnels are sometimes used in place of wind tunnels to perform measurements because techniques like particle image velocimetry piv are easier to implement in water for many cases as long as the reynolds number is equivalent the results are valid whether a submerged water vehicle model is tested in air or an aerial vehicle is tested in water for low reynolds number flows tunnels can be made to run oil instead of water the advantage is that the increased kinematic viscosity will allow the flow to be a faster speed and thus easier to maintain stably for a lower reynolds number whereas in wind tunnels the driving force is usually sophisticated multiblade propellers with adjustable blade pitch in water and oil tunnels the fluid is circulated with pumps effectively using a net pressure head difference to move the fluid rather than imparting momentum on it directly thus the return section of water and oil tunnels does not need any flow management typically

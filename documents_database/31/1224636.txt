typically the comparison is made with a default unmarked articulation of the same phoneme in a neutral sound environment for example the english velar consonant is fronted before the vowel as in keep compared to articulation of before other vowels as in cool this fronting is called palatalization the relative position of a sound may be described as advanced fronted retracted backed raised lowered centralized or mid centralized the latter two terms are only used with vowels and are marked in the international phonetic alphabet with diacritics over the vowel letter the others are used with both consonants and vowels and are marked with iconic diacritics under the letter another dimension of relative articulation that has ipa diacritics is the degree of roundedness more rounded and less rounded an advanced or fronted sound is one that is pronounced farther to the front of the vocal tract than some reference point the diacritic for this in the ipa is the subscript plus conversely a retracted or backed sound is one that is pronounced farther to the back of the vocal tract and its ipa diacritic is the subscript minus when there is no room for the sign under a letter it

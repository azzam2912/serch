the anomaly was absent in data collected in 2016 suggesting that the diphoton excess was a statistical fluctuation in the interval between the december 2015 and august 2016 results the anomaly generated considerable interest in the scientific community including about 500 theoretical studies the hypothetical particle was denoted by the greek letter pronounced digamma in the scientific literature owing to the decay channel in which the anomaly occurred the data however were always less than five standard deviations sigma different from that expected if there was no new particle and as such the anomaly never reached the accepted level of statistical significance required to announce a discovery in particle physics after the august 2016 results interest in the anomaly sank as it was considered a statistical fluctuation indeed a bayesian analysis of the anomaly found that whilst data collected in 2015 constituted substantial evidence for the digamma on the jeffreys scale data collected in 2016 combined with that collected in 2015 was evidence against the digamma on december 15 2015 the atlas and cms collaborations at cern presented results from the second operational run of the large hadron collider lhc at the center of mass energy of 13 tev the

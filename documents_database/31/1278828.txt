cycling and walking are permitted along the entire length while horseriding is permitted on several sections only the 1 7m ystwyth trail was partially completed in september 2008 and runs along part of the former redundant track bed of the old manchester and milford railway a great western railway branch line it remains incomplete as several sections of the former railway line were not purchased to create the trail due to extensive lobbying by local councillors of ceredigion county council against the trail as existing landowners and farmers objected to the construction of the trail diversions of the trail have now been carried out onto narrow sections of existing public roads to link these missing sections but this has created a non continuous trail with intermediate road sections on narrow roads which have considerable safety issues due to their narrowness many bends and no traffic speed limits due to these objections and lobbying it is unlikely that this trail will be developed or completed any further the ystwyth trail links with other routes via lampeter and devil s bridge creating a link with both the l n cambria and l n teifi long distance cycling routes sustrans national network routes

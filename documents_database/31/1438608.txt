the process of determining a ghost lineage relies on fossilized evidence before and after the hypothetical existence of the lineage and extrapolating relationships between organisms based on phylogenetic analysis ghost lineages are commonly confused with lazarus taxa but there is a difference for example coelacanths see below are a lazarus taxon and the gaps in its fossil record are referred to as ghost lineages in 1992 an article stated these additional entities are taxa groups that are predicted to occur by the internal branching structure of phylogenetic trees i refer to these as ghost lineages because they are invisible to the fossil record phylogenetic trees constructed based on fossil records and darwin s theory of evolution often give an indication that species with similar phenotypes existed although its fossil has not been discovered it is important to note that ghost lineages and ghost taxa are not the same a ghost lineage is a single direct connection between the descendant and the ancestor while a ghost taxon has multiple split descendants when looking back at extinct organisms there are some groups of organisms or lineages that have gaps in their fossil records these organisms or species may be closely related to

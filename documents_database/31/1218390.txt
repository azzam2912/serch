rmhh is one of the longest running newsgroups on usenet for the discussion of rap and hip hop established in 1995 the newsgroup was proposed and chartered by steve flash juon in 1994 as an effort to expand the discussion of rap and hip hop music on usenet two newsgroups alt rap and rec music funky already existed for the discussion of rap and hip hop music however it was noted that the alt rap group was not as widely distributed due to usenet servers not carrying all or any of the alt hierarchy and the discussion in rec music funky was mainly centered around funk music juon and others felt that both groups would be better served by moving discussion to the more high profile high distributed rec music sub hierarchy the proposed finalized charter for the rec music hip hop this newsgroup is to provide a forum for the discussion and dissemination of information specifically relating to hip hop music and culture this group is meant to replace the newsgroup alt rap for a multitude of reasons stated herein one members of the rec music funky included rap as a form of funky music in their charter yet

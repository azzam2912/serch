on the other hand real gas models have to be used near the condensation point of gases near critical points at very high pressures to explain the joule thomson effect and in other less usual cases the deviation from ideality can be described by the compressibility factor z real gases are often modeled by taking into account their molar weight and molar volume or alternatively where p is the pressure t is the temperature r the ideal gas constant and v the molar volume a and b are parameters that are determined empirically for each gas but are sometimes estimated from their critical temperature t and critical pressure p using these relations with the reduced properties formula 4 the equation can be written in the reduced form the redlich kwong equation is another two parameter equation that is used to model real gases it is almost always more accurate than the van der waals equation and often more accurate than some equations with more than two parameters the equation is or alternatively where a and b two empirical parameters that are not the same parameters as in the van der waals equation these parameters can be determined using formula 9

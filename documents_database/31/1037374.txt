surge tanks are usually provided in high or medium head plants when there is a considerable distance between the water source and the power unit necessitating a long penstock the main functions of the surge tank are 1 when the load decreases the water moves backwards and gets stored in it 2 when the load increases additional supply of water will be provided by surge tank in short the surge tank mitigates pressure variations due to rapid changes in velocity of water consider a pipe containing a flowing fluid when a valve is either fully or partially closed at some point downstream the fluid will continue to flow at the original velocity in order to counteract the momentum of the fluid the pressure will rise significantly pressure surge just upstream of the control valve and may result in damage to the pipe system if a surge chamber is connected to the pipeline just upstream of the valve on valve closure the fluid instead of being stopped suddenly by the valve will flow upwards into the chamber hence reducing the surge pressures experienced in the pipeline upon closure of the valve the fluid continues to flow passing into the surge tank

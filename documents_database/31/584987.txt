bigraphs can be conveniently and formally displayed as diagrams they have applications in the modelling of distributed systems for ubiquitous computing and can be used to describe mobile interactions they have also been used by robin milner in an attempt to subsume calculus of communicating systems ccs and calculus they have been studied in the context of category theory aside from nodes and hyper edges a bigraph may have associated with it one or more regions which are roots in the place forest and zero or more holes in the place graph into which other bigraph regions may be inserted similarly to nodes we may assign controls that define identities and an arity the number of ports for a given node to which link graph edges may connect these controls are drawn from a bigraph signature in the link graph we define inner and outer names which define the connection points at which coincident names may be fused to form a single link a bigraph is a 5 tuple formula 1 where formula 2 is a set of nodes formula 3 is a set of edges formula 4 is the control map that assigns controls to nodes formula 5 is

it is a stochastic gradient descent method in that the filter is only adapted based on the error at the current time it was invented in 1960 by stanford university professor bernard widrow and his first ph d student ted hoff the realization of the causal wiener filter looks a lot like the solution to the least squares estimate except in the signal processing domain the least squares solution for input matrix formula 1 and output vector formula 2 is formula 3 the fir least mean squares filter is related to the wiener filter but minimizing the error criterion of the former does not rely on cross correlations or auto correlations its solution converges to the wiener filter solution most linear adaptive filtering problems can be formulated using the block diagram above that is an unknown system formula 4 is to be identified and the adaptive filter attempts to adapt the filter formula 5 to make it as close as possible to formula 4 while using only observable signals formula 7 formula 8 and formula 9 but formula 10 formula 11 and formula 12 are not directly observable its solution is closely related to the wiener filter the basic idea

the framework can be seen as a generalisation of barendregt s lambda cube in the sense that all corners of the cube can be represented as instances of a pts with just two sorts in fact barendregt 1991 framed his cube in this setting pure type systems may obscure the distinction between types and terms and collapse the type hierarchy as is the case with the calculus of constructions but this is not generally the case e g the simply typed lambda calculus allows only terms to depend on terms pure type systems were independently introduced by stefano berardi 1988 and jan terlouw 1989 barendregt discussed them at length in his subsequent papers in his phd thesis berardi defined a cube of constructive logics akin to the lambda cube these specifications are non dependent a modification of this cube was later called the l cube by geuvers who in his phd thesis extended the curry howard correspondence to this setting based on these ideas barthe and others defined classical pure type systems cpts by adding a double negation operator similarly in 1998 tijn borghuis introduced modal pure type systems mpts roorda has discussed the application of pure type systems to

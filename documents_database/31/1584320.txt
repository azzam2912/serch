it was specifically designed to conduct the accelerated astm f1624 step modified slow strain rate tests on a variety of test coupons or structural components it can also function to conduct conventional astm e8 tensile tests astm f519 200 hr sustained load tests with subsequent programmable step loads to rupture for increased reliability and astm g129 slow strain rate tensile tests the rsl testing system can be applied to all of the specimen geometries in astm f519 including notched round tensile bars notched c rings and notched square bars product testing of actual hardware can also be conducted such as with fasteners taking mechanical advantage of by testing in bending allows 1 diameter bolts to be tested with only a 1 kip load cell the rsl test method has been demonstrated as a valuable tool in the testing of high performance materials for determining susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement this test is dependent upon the test machine s capability to provide a profile with incremental increases in the applied stress as a function of time it is imperative that the load increases do not overshoot the next elevation in applied stress this is achieved through careful design and operation of the

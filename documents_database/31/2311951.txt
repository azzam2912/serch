ultimately none of the competing designs would be produced and the fw 190 was replaced in the ground attack role by the messerschmitt me 262 jet fighter among the first of these was the p 193 others studied either in parallel or shortly afterwards included the p 192 p 194 and p 196 although its estimated top speed of at was faster than the p 102 the rate of climb of the p 193 proved inadequate and the design was dropped the p 193 was of pusher layout with a deep ventral fin to protect the rear mounted propeller from ground impact but was otherwise conventional in appearance the pilot was seated well forward giving an excellent vision while the junkers jumo 213a engine rated at was mid mounted and drove the propeller through a long extension shaft in order to obtain the necessary rotation for takeoff the incidence of the main wing could be increased similar to the earlier bv 144 transport prototype then under construction in france despite its difference from the even more radical p 192 studied in parallel the two designs shared many of the same wing forward fuselage tricycle undercarriage and armament components it had

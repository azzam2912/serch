they are thus baryons with total isospin of 0 and have either neutral electric charge or the elementary charge 1 lambda baryons are usually represented by the symbols and in this notation the superscript character indicates whether the particle is electrically neutral or carries a positive charge the subscript character or its absence indicates whether the third quark is a strange quark no subscript a charm quark a bottom quark or a top quark physicists do not expect to observe a lambda baryon with a top quark because the standard model of particle physics predicts that the mean lifetime of top quarks is roughly seconds that is about of the mean timescale for strong interactions which indicates that the top quark would decay before a lambda baryon could form a hadron the lambda baryon was first discovered in october 1950 by v d hopper and s biswas of the university of melbourne as a neutral v particle with a proton as a decay product thus correctly distinguishing it as a baryon rather than a meson i e different in kind from the k meson discovered in 1947 by rochester and butler they were produced by cosmic rays and detected in

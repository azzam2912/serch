all depth first search trees and all hamiltonian paths are tr maux trees tr maux trees are named after charles pierre tr maux a 19th century french author who used a form of depth first search as a strategy for solving mazes they have also been called normal spanning trees especially in the context of infinite graphs in finite graphs although depth first search itself is inherently sequential tr maux trees can be constructed by a randomized parallel algorithm in the complexity class rnc they can be used to define the tree depth of a graph and as part of the left right planarity test for testing whether a graph is a planar graph a characterization of tr maux trees in the monadic second order logic of graphs allows graph properties involving orientations to be recognized efficiently for graphs of bounded treewidth using courcelle s theorem not every infinite connected graph has a tr maux tree and the graphs that do have them can be characterized by their forbidden minors a tr maux tree exists in every connected graph with countably many vertices even when an infinite form of depth first search would not succeed in exploring every vertex of

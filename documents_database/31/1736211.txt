as a result these tests are widely used for estimating premorbid intelligence in conditions such as dementia traumatic brain injury and stroke in neuropsychological assessment it is important to be able to accurately estimate premorbid intelligence accurate estimation allows the quantification of the impacts of neurological damage or decline when compared to tests of current intelligence the magnitude of decline is important for prognosis rehabilitation planning and financial compensation hold tests typically measure crystallised intelligence that is stored knowledge and skills such as vocabulary and pronunciation of course hold tests of abilities directly affected by neurological damage are likely to underestimate intelligence for example using reading tests in patients with aphasia examples of hold tests used the use of hold tests is only one of a few possible methods of quantification of premorbid function in practice a neuropsychologist may use a combination of methods to yield the most accurate estimate of premorbid intelligence some of the other methods used are a review examined whether hold tests best estimate or regression equation methods were most accurate in predicting overall iq full scale iq as determined by wechsler adult intelligence scale wais r in a non neurologically impaired population it was found

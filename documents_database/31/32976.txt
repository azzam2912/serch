it is found in soil and other low temperature environments such as sediment goethite has been well known since ancient times for its use as a pigment brown ochre evidence has been found of its use in paint pigment samples taken from the caves of lascaux in france it was first described in 1806 based on samples found in the hollertszug mine in herdorf germany the mineral was named after the german polymath and poet johann wolfgang von goethe 1749 1832 goethite is an iron oxyhydroxide containing ferric iron it is the main component of rust and bog iron ore goethite s hardness ranges from 5 0 to 5 5 on the mohs scale and its specific gravity varies from 3 3 to 4 3 the mineral forms prismatic needle like crystals needle iron ore but is more typically massive feroxyhyte and lepidocrocite are both polymorphs of the iron oxyhydroxide feo oh which are stable at the pressure and temperature conditions of the earth s surface although they have the same chemical formula as goethite their different crystalline structures make them distinct minerals additionally goethite has several high pressure and high temperature polymorphs which may be relevant to the conditions

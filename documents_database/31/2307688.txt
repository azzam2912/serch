this makes a ccp a population of plants with a lot of inherent genetic diversity in contrast to monocultures where all plants are clones and homozygous at all loci fully inbred in recent years ccps have been proposed as a way to create modern landraces of wheat barley and oats research is done to explore whether they are better suited for organic farming than the modern cultivars they are suited for participatory breeding of crops which is in contrast to cultivars owned by big breeding companies the idea of using ccps in plant breeding was initially published in 1956 yield data for 4 different populations for 8 28 years were presented in the article and after 8 15 years of repeated breeding under natural selection the populations out yielded the reference cultivar creating a ccp involves 3 steps initiation multiplication and mixture the population then goes into the maintenance phase a number of lines generally 7 30 with interesting properties such as yield or baking quality are selected and all possible crosses of them are done if many lines of different genetic background are used a huge amount of genetic diversity will be present seeds from crosses are sown out

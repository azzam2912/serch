on 9 november 2018 cameron dawson managed to get his first clean sheet of the 2018 19 season by a goalless 0 0 draw against their city rivals sheffield united even making a spectacular penalty save from david mcgoldrick s bottom right corner penalty and managed to hold on for the rest of the game and make it a 0 0 draw in december 2018 when luhukay was sacked at the time the caretaker manager lee bullen dropped him back to the number 3 position but the next fixture he was the number 2 not number 3rd choice and added keiren westwood back to the number one position but later in the season dawson made appearances in the 2 2 away draw against norwich city to replace keiren westwood at the time getting injured in the warm up and next 2 fixtures made appearances vs teams like bristol city and preston north end so that westwood could get back to full fitness because of injury

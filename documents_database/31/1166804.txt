this fingerprint may be used for data deduplication purposes this is also referred to as file fingerprinting data fingerprinting or structured data fingerprinting fingerprints are typically used to avoid the comparison and transmission of bulky data for instance a web browser or proxy server can efficiently check whether a remote file has been modified by fetching only its fingerprint and comparing it with that of the previously fetched copy fingerprint functions may be seen as high performance hash functions used to uniquely identify substantial blocks of data where cryptographic hash functions may be unnecessary audio fingerprint algorithms should not be confused with this type of fingerprint function to serve its intended purposes a fingerprinting algorithm must be able to capture the identity of a file with virtual certainty in other words the probability of a collision two files yielding the same fingerprint must be negligible compared to the probability of other unavoidable causes of fatal errors such as the system being destroyed by war or by a meteorite say 10 or less this requirement is somewhat similar to that of a checksum function but is much more stringent to detect accidental data corruption or transmission errors it is sufficient that

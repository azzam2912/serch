the complete process is often referred to as a modal analysis or experimental modal analysis there are several ways to do modal testing but impact hammer testing and shaker vibration tester testing are commonplace in both cases energy is supplied to the system with a known frequency content where structural resonances occur there will be an amplification of the response clearly seen in the response spectra using the response spectra and force spectra a transfer function can be obtained the transfer function or frequency response function frf is often curve fitted to estimate the modal parameters however there are many methods of modal parameter estimation and it is the topic of much research an ideal impact to a structure is a perfect impulse which has an infinitely small duration causing a constant amplitude in the frequency domain this would result in all modes of vibration being excited with equal energy the impact hammer test is designed to replicate this however in reality a hammer strike cannot last for an infinitely small duration but has a known contact time the duration of the contact time directly influences the frequency content of the force with a larger contact time causing a smaller

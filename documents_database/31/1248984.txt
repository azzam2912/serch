according to research by roly brown there are three versions from jack barnard and a mr j thomas both noted by cecil sharp and a version sent to sharp which was supplied by a dr john taylor who recorded it from a soldier each version is quite different some not referencing the rebellion at all but all versions sharing the distinctive irish lilting refrain and a final verse stating that jimmy murphy was hung for courting ladies as opposed to sheep stealing according to frank harte it has been suggested to me that the reference in the last verse to kate whelan now jimmy murphy was hanged not for sheep stealing but for courting a pretty girl and her name was kate whelan could be interpreted as a reference to ireland as cathleen ni houlihan when i first heard this song sung by sean g o thuama many years ago it had only three verses and that most peculiar chorus a friend of mine luke cheevers in true traditional fashion wrote several verses which i believe enhance the song and expand the story frank harte

while several sequence elements are known to regulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation cpe is the best characterized the most common cpe sequence is uuuuau though there are other variations binding of cpe binding protein cpeb to this region promotes the extension of the existing polyadenine tail and in general activation of the mrna for protein translation this elongation occurs after the mrna has been exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm a longer poly a tail attracts more cytoplasmic polyadenine binding proteins pabps which interact with several other cytoplasmic proteins that encourage the mrna and the ribosome to associate the lengthening of the poly a tail thus has a role in increasing translational efficiency of the mrna the polyadenine tails are extended from approximately 40 bases to 150 bases cytoplasmic polyadenylation should be distinguished from nuclear polyadenlyation cytoplasmic polyadenylation occurs in the cytoplasm in specific mrnas as opposed to occurring in the nucleus and affecting almost all eukaryotic mrnas among other functions a prominent role for the cpe has been identified in oogenesis spermatogenesis mitosis and the growth of new synapses the role of the cpe was first characterized in xenopus oocytes and embryos but recent research has identified roles for the

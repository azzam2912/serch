geometric morphometrics is an approach that studies shape using cartesian landmark and semilandmark coordinates that are capable of capturing morphologically distinct shape variables the landmarks can be analyzed using various statistical techniques separate from size position and orientation so that the only variables being observed are based on morphology geometric morphometrics is used to observe variation in numerous formats especially those pertaining to evolutionary and biological processes which can be used to help explore the answers to a lot of questions in physical anthropology geometric morphometrics is part of a larger subfield in anthropology which has more recently been named virtual anthropology virtual anthropology looks at virtual morphology the use of virtual copies of specimens to perform various quantitative analyses on shape such as geometric morphometrics and form the field of geometric morphometrics grew out of the accumulation of improvements of methods and approaches over several decades beginning with francis galton 1822 1911 galton was a polymath and the president of the anthropological institute of great britain in 1907 he invented a way to quantify facial shapes using a base line registration approach for shape comparisons this was later adapted by fred bookstein and termed two point coordinates or bookstein

although functions of bounded variation have derivatives in the sense of radon measures it is desirable to have a derivative that takes values in the same space as the functions themselves although the precise definition of the reduced derivative is quite involved its key properties are quite easy to remember the notion of reduced derivative appears to have been introduced by alexander mielke and florian theil in 2004 let x be a separable reflexive banach space with norm and fix t 0 let bv 0 t x denote the space of all left continuous functions z 0 t x with bounded variation on 0 t for any function of time f use subscripts to denote the right left continuous versions of f i e for any sub interval a b of 0 t let var z a b denote the variation of z over a b i e the supremum the first step in the construction of the reduced derivative is the stretch time so that z can be linearly interpolated at its jump points to this end define the stretched time function is left continuous i e moreover and are strictly increasing and agree except at the at most

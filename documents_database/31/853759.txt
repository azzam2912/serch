an extension of the concept of system on chip soc and system in package sip com lies between a full up computer and a microcontroller in nature it is very similar to a system on module som coms are complete embedded computers built on a single circuit board the design is centered on a microprocessor with ram input output controllers and all other features needed to be a functional computer on the one board however unlike a single board computer the com usually lacks the standard connectors for any input output peripherals to be attached directly to the board the module usually needs to be mounted on a carrier board or baseboard which breaks the bus out to standard peripheral connectors some coms also include peripheral connectors some can be used without a carrier a com solution offers a dense package computer system for use in small or specialized applications requiring low power consumption or small physical size as is needed in embedded systems as a com is very compact and highly integrated even complex cpus including multi core technology can be realized on a com some devices also incorporate field programmable gate array fpga components fpga based functions can

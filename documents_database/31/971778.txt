the complete guidance system contained a d 17b computer the associated stable platform and power supplies the d 17b weighed approximately contained 1 521 transistors 6 282 diodes 1 116 capacitors and 504 resistors these components were mounted on double copper clad engraved gold plated glass fiber laminate circuit boards there were 75 of these circuit boards and each one was coated with a flexible polyurethane compound for moisture and vibration protection the high degree of reliability and ruggedness of the computer were driven by the strict requirements of the weapons system high reliability was required of the d 17b it controlled a key weapon that would have just one chance to execute its mission reliability of the d 17b was achieved through the use of solid state electronics and a relatively simple design simpler drl diode resistor logic was used extensively but less reliable dtl diode transistor logic was used only where needed in the late 1950s and early 1960s when the d 17b was designed transistors lacked today s reliability dtl provided however either gain or inversion reliability was also enhanced by the rotating disk memory with non destructive readout ndro in actual real time situations minuteman missiles

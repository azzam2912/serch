the company developed a process to generate hydrocarbon based fuel by combining non fresh water nutrients cyanobacteria carbon dioxide and sunlight after ten years of operation and building a demonstration plant in new mexico the company shut down in august 2017 the company shut down after management was unable to raise money the company claimed it would be able to produce more than 20 000 gallons of fuel per acre per year 19 000 m km a helioculture uses photosynthetic organisms but is otherwise distinct from the process that makes fuel from algae oils made from algae usually have to be refined into fuel following a batch process but helioculture produces fuel directly either ethanol or hydrocarbons that do not need refining the helioculture process also does not produce biomass this process is enabled by the discovery of unique genes coding for enzymatic mechanisms that enable the direct synthesis of both alkane olefin ethanol and other key molecules helioculture allows for brackish water or graywater nonindustrial waste water from sources such as baths and washing machines to be used while traditional biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol require fresh water joule unlimited claimed that its product would have been cost competitive

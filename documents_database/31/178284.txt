the three shown boards have 105 180 and 275 nodes of which 30 40 and 50 are on the perimeter note that the edges between the five centermost nodes cross each other two players alternately place stones of their colour on empty nodes the game ends when the board is filled up or when both players agree that the score is decided each node on the perimeter of the board counts as one peri connected groups of one color that contain fewer than two peries are removed with the possible peri going to the surrounding group each remaining group is worth the number of peries it contains minus four the player with more points wins draws are decided in favour of the player owning more corners for example a group containing exactly two peries is worth 2 4 2 points this is the same as the two peries being given to the opponent that is creating a group with just two peries is worthless unless it disconnects opponent groups or contains a corner star is closely related to games of hex and y where the goal is to connect certain sides of the board to each other on the other

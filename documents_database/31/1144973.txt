if the ligand atoms were connected the resulting shape would be that of a pyramid with a square base the point group symmetry involved is of type c the geometry is common for certain main group compounds that have a stereochemically active lone pair as described by vsepr theory certain compounds crystallize in both the trigonal bipyramidal and the square pyramidal structures notably ni cn as a trigonal bipyramidal molecule undergoes berry pseudorotation it proceeds via an intermediary stage with the square planar geometry thus even though the geometry is rarely seen as the ground state it is accessed by a low energy distortion from a trigonal bipyramid pseudorotation also occurs in square pyramidal molecules molecules with this geometry as opposed to trigonal bipyramidal exhibit heavier vibration the mechanism used is similar to the berry mechanism some molecular compounds that adopt square pyramidal geometry are xeof and various halogen pentafluorides xf where x cl br i complexes of vanadium iv such as vo acac are square pyramidal acac acetylacetonate the deprotonated anion of acetylacetone 2 4 pentanedione

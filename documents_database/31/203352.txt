bread supposedly provides the yeast for the pruno to ferment pruno originated in and remains largely confined to prisons where it can be produced with the limited selection of equipment and ingredients available to inmates the concoction can be made using only a plastic bag hot running water and a towel or sock to conceal the pulp during fermentation the end result has been colorfully described as a bile flavored wine cooler although flavor is often not the primary objective depending on the time spent fermenting always balanced against the risk of discovery by officers the sugar content and the quality of the ingredients and preparation pruno s alcohol content by volume can range from as low as 2 equivalent to a very weak beer to as high as 14 equivalent to a strong wine typically the fermenting mass of fruit called the motor or kicker in prison parlance is retained from batch to batch to make the fermentation start faster the more sugar that is added the greater the potential for a higher alcohol content to a point beyond this point the waste products of fermentation mainly alcohol cause the motor to die or go dormant as the yeasts

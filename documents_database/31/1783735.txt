the title refers to the travelling salesman problem an optimization problem that acts like a key to solving other mathematical problems that are thought to be hard it has been proven that a quick travelling salesman algorithm if one exists could be converted into quick algorithms for many other difficult tasks such as factoring large numbers since many cryptographic schemes rely on the difficulty of factoring integers to protect their data this would allow access to private data like personal correspondence bank accounts and possibly government secrets the story was written and directed by timothy lanzone and premiered at the international house in philadelphia on june 16 2012 after screenings in eight countries spanning four continents including screenings at the university of pennsylvania and the university of cambridge the film was released globally on september 10 2013 the four mathematicians are gathered and meet with a top official of the united states department of defense after some discussion the group agrees that they must be wary with whom to trust and control their solution the official offers them a reward of 10 million in exchange for their portion of the algorithm swaying them by attempting to address their concerns only

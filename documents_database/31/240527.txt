two ports e g l and h are multiplexed onto a third port e g s the signals on ports l and h occupy disjoint frequency bands consequently the signals on l and h can coexist on port s without interfering with each other typically the signal on port l will occupy a single low frequency band and the signal on port h will occupy a higher frequency band in that situation the diplexer consists of a lowpass filter connecting ports l and s and high pass filter connecting ports h and s ideally all the lowband signal power on port l is transferred to the s port and vice versa all the highband signal power on port h is transferred to port s and vice versa ideally the separation of the signals is complete none of the low band signal is transferred from the l port to the h port in the real world some power will be lost and some signal power will leak to the wrong port the diplexer being a passive device is normally reciprocal the device itself doesn t have a notion of input or output however poorly designed diplexers may have differing impedance on

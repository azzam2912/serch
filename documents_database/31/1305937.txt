its faces meet only in right angles even though they cannot all be made parallel to the coordinate planes it is named for b rge jessen who investigated it in 1967 the vertices of jessen s icosahedron may be chosen to have as their coordinates the 12 points given by the cyclic permutations of the coordinates formula 1 with this coordinate representation the short edges of the icosahedron the ones with convex angles have length formula 2 and the long reflex edges have length formula 3 the faces of the icosahedron are equilateral triangles with the short side length and isosceles triangles with one long edge and two short edges a similar shape can be formed by keeping the vertices of a regular icosahedron in their original positions and replacing certain pairs of equilateral triangle faces by pairs of isosceles triangles and this shape has also sometimes incorrectly been called jessen s icosahedron however the resulting polyhedron does not have right angled dihedrals the vertices of jessen s icosahedron are perturbed from these positions in order to give all the dihedrals right angles jessen s icosahedron is vertex transitive or isogonal meaning that it has symmetries taking any vertex to

cytoplasmic material is trapped in the lysosome vacuole by a random process of membrane invagination the microautophagic pathway is especially important for survival of cells under conditions of starvation nitrogen deprivation or after treatment with rapamycin generally a non selective process there are three special cases of a selective microautophagic pathway micropexophagy piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus and micromitophagy all which are activated only under a specific conditions microautophagy together with macroautophagy is necessary for nutrient recycling under starvation microautophagy due to degradation of lipids incorporated into vesicles regulates the composition of lysosomal vacuolar membrane microautophagic pathway functions also as one of the mechanism of glycogen delivery into the lysosomes this autophagic pathway engulfs multivesicular bodies formed after endocytosis therefore it plays role in membrane proteins turnover microautophagy is also connected with organellar size maintenance composition of biological membranes cell survival under nitrogen restriction and the transition pathway from starvation induced growth arrest to logarithmic growth non selective microautophagic process can be dissected into 5 distinct steps majority of experiments were done on yeast vacuolar invaginations but the molecular principles seem to be more general invagination is a constitutive process but its frequency is dramatically increased during periods of starvation

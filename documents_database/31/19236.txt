he is often described as a polymath and in mathematics as the last universalist since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime as a mathematician and physicist he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics mathematical physics and celestial mechanics in his research on the three body problem poincar became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory he is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology poincar made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations and was the first to present the lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form poincar discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to hendrik lorentz in 1905 thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of maxwell s equations an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity in 1905 poincar first proposed gravitational waves ondes gravifiques emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the lorentz transformations the poincar group used in physics and mathematics

this reduces the many body problem to the calculation of a sum or integral over all possible auxiliary field configurations in this sense there is a trade off instead of dealing with one very complicated many body problem one faces the calculation of an infinite number of simple external field problems it is here as in other related methods that monte carlo enters the game in the guise of importance sampling the large sum over auxiliary field configurations is performed by sampling over the most important ones with a certain probability in classical statistical physics this probability is usually given by the positive semi definite boltzmann factor similar factors arise also in quantum field theories however these can have indefinite sign especially in the case of fermions or even be complex valued which precludes their direct interpretation as probabilities in these cases one has to resort to a reweighting procedure i e interpret the absolute value as probability and multiply the sign or phase to the observable to get a strictly positive reference distribution suitable for monte carlo sampling however it is well known that in specific parameter ranges of the model under consideration the oscillatory nature of the weight

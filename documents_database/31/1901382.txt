the aircraft is intended to be a demonstration and exploration of several key electrical power technologies for use in future hybrid helicopters the helicopter is the first all electric helicopter to hover out of ground effect and set a guinness world record in august 12 2011 it received an idtechex electric vehicles land sea air award in 2012 this prototyping platform was created to explore and demonstrate technologies leading to all electric or hybrid mechanical electric helicopter drivetrains two key goals are the elimination of expensive safety critical non redundant mechanical only helicopter transmissions and the provisioning of battery assisted emergency landing capabilities as an alternative to forced autorotation straight to the ground both technologies are expected to greatly improve the safety and practicality of helicopter flight the prototype solution f chretien helicopter is a coaxial rotor hang helicopter pitch and roll are controlled by weight shift the entire rotor is tilted in relation to the suspended airframe to shift the center of gravity thus no cyclic control is required these features were generally implemented on the demonstrator for simplicity and expedience and were incidental to the research and demonstration goals yaw is controlled by differential torque applied to the

the station is located at 214 northwest 9th terrace approximately three quarters of a mile west of downtown homestead constructed in 1927 it is identical to the original construction of the delray beach seaboard station farther north in palm beach county with the sole exception of its use of the same corinthian arches used in the naples seaboard station and hialeah seaboard station as opposed to the plain stucco arches of the delray beach station it has the distinction of being both the southernmost seaboard station and the southernmost railroad station in the united states still standing at its original location like many seaboard stations in south florida the structure combined both a passenger station and a freight depot however the station at most only briefly saw passenger service in the late 1920s before the seaboard extension between hialeah junction and homestead became dedicated to freight traffic only the structure has long since been abandoned for freight handling and is now privately owned by an auction house which is attempting to restore the station the adjacent tracks now only see sporadic freight service by csx transportation the successor to seaboard

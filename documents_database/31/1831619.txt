this salt is formed by the reaction of ammonia with carbon dioxide and is a white solid that is extremely soluble in water less so in alcohol it is unusual in that it will degrade at room temperature it is prepared by the direct reaction between liquid ammonia and dry ice solid carbon dioxide the structure of solid ammonium carbamate has been confirmed by x ray crystallography the oxygen centers form hydrogen bonds to the ammonium cation ammonium carbamate reverts to carbon dioxide and ammonia even as a solid it hydrates reversibly ammonium carbamate serves a key role in the formation of carbamoyl phosphate which is necessary for both the urea cycle and the production of pyrimidines in this enzyme catalyzed reaction atp and ammonium carbamate are converted to adp and carbamoyl phosphate the ability of ammonium carbamate to make urea was first discovered in 1870 when bassarov heated ammonium carbamate in sealed glass tubes at temperatures ranging from 130 to 140 c this heating yields urea and water in an equimolar ratio a typical industrial plant that makes urea can produce up to 1500 tons a day ammonia and carbon dioxide is excessively fed to a synthesis reactor in

he was one of the pioneers of somali poetry and arguably one of the greatest poet of the last century he was born within a family of shepherds from the ogaden he could not have a formal education born to a nomadic pastoralist family he had what could have been speech and language delay disorder at an early age young dhoodaan during those years was a very shy quiet and observant child many thought he will never speak again not surprising for a nomadic society that had little knowledge of disorders or its diagnosis techniques little did they know what was boiling under his prolonged silence and like a volcano he erupted what followed was a miracle not only was he able to speak but was able to do so flawlessly through poetry he spoke elegantly and with ease unusual for a child yet what people didn t understand was where he acquired such a skill poetry did not run in his blood line in fact none of his family history was known for poetry but because he didn t have the ability to speak at an early age he compensated it through observation he made sense of his surroundings

calcium caseinate is primarily used in meal preparation and fat breakdown caseinates are produced by adding an alkali to another derivative of casein acid casein the type of caseinate is determined by the cation added alongside the acid casein other cations used to form caseinates besides calcium include ammonium potassium and sodium calcium caseinate contains about 17 glutamic acid calcium caseinate is also soluble and does not clot in the stomach calcium caseinate is generally stable at a ph above 5 7 and appears as a milky liquid this is unlike ammonium potassium and sodium caseinates which are practically clear at a neutral or acidic ph casein is relatively insoluble in water and is easily separated from other milk proteins sugars and minerals most caseinates are capable of withstanding temperatures of 140 c 284 f however calcium caseinate is influenced by heat with temperatures as low as 50 c 122 f calcium is a divalent cation allowing it to form bonds with several caseinate anions this leads to the formation of several covalent bonds between caseinate anions which can ultimately cause the cross linked caseinate to form pockets of hydrophobic regions several foods creamers and toppings all contain a variety

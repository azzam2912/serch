as with medical adjuvants agricultural spray adjuvants are not themselves active in controlling or killing pests instead these additives modify some property of the spray solution which improves the ability of the pesticide to penetrate target or protect the target organism among the typical types of ingredients used are surfactants emulsifiers oils and salts each of these ingredients and others modifies the spray solution itself to improve such properties as spreading penetration droplet size or other characteristics these additives may be included in a formulation with a pesticide or may be added separately to a tank when they are included in the pesticide formulations themselves they are called in can adjuvants agricultural spray adjuvants may also be added separately when the spray solution is being prepared in this case the adjuvant is called a tank mix adjuvant when delivered in can adjuvants may be quite effective however because of the limited space or limited compatibility in a pesticide formulation not all necessary adjuvants may be included in can thus the addition of tank mix adjuvants may be necessary to optimize performance of the pesticide agricultural spray adjuvants do not reduce the amount of pesticide needed below the recommended use rate

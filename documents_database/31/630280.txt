the event loop works by making a request to some internal or external event provider that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived then calls the relevant event handler dispatches the event the event loop is also sometimes referred to as the message dispatcher message loop message pump or run loop the event loop may be used in conjunction with a reactor if the event provider follows the file interface which can be selected or polled the unix system call not actual polling the event loop almost always operates asynchronously with the message originator when the event loop forms the central control flow construct of a program as it often does it may be termed the main loop or main event loop this title is appropriate because such an event loop is at the highest level of control within the program message pumps are said to pump messages from the program s message queue assigned and usually owned by the underlying operating system into the program for processing in the strictest sense an event loop is one of the methods for implementing inter process communication in fact message processing exists in many systems including a kernel level component

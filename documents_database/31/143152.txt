it is a colourless volatile liquid that fumes in air it is used to produce high purity silicon and silica for commercial applications silicon tetrachloride is prepared by the chlorination of various silicon compounds such as ferrosilicon silicon carbide or mixtures of silicon dioxide and carbon the ferrosilicon route is most common in the laboratory sicl can be prepared by treating silicon with chlorine it was first prepared by j ns jakob berzelius in 1823 brine can be contaminated with silica when the production of chlorine is a byproduct of a metal refining process from metal chloride ore in rare occurrences the silicon dioxide in silica is converted to silicon tetrachloride when the contaminated brine is electrolyzed like other chlorosilanes silicon tetrachloride reacts readily with water in contrast carbon tetrachloride does not hydrolyze readily the reaction can be noticed on exposure of the liquid to air the vapour produces fumes as it reacts with moisture to give a cloud like aerosol of hydrochloric acid with alcohols and ethanol it reacts to give tetramethyl orthosilicate and tetraethyl orthosilicate at higher temperatures homologues of silicon tetrachloride can be prepared by the reaction in fact the chlorination of silicon is accompanied by the

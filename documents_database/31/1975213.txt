a process is a program under execution the fault zone of a process is that subset of program state which could be corrupted by the process continuing to execute after incurring a fault for instance due to an unreliable component used in the computer executing the program efficient memory like access is the defining characteristic of persistent memory it can be provided using microprocessor memory instructions such as load and store it can also be provided using apis that implement remote direct memory access rdma actions such as rdma read and rdma write other low latency methods that allow byte grain access to data also qualify persistent memory capabilities extend beyond non volatility of stored bits for instance the loss of key metadata such as page table entries or other constructs that translate virtual addresses to physical addresses may render durable bits non persistent in this respect persistent memory resembles more abstract forms of computer storage such as file systems in fact almost all existing persistent memory technologies implement at least a basic file system that can be used for associating names or identifiers with stored extents and at a minimum provide file system methods that can be used for

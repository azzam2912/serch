armand borel showed that its cohomology ring is isomorphic to the quotient of the ring of polynomials by the ideal generated by the invariant homogeneous polynomials of positive degree this ring had already been considered by claude chevalley in establishing the foundations of the cohomology of compact lie groups and their homogeneous spaces with andr weil jean louis koszul and henri cartan the existence of such a basis was used by chevalley to prove that the ring of invariants was itself a polynomial ring a detailed account of kostant polynomials was given by and independently as a tool to understand the schubert calculus of the flag manifold the kostant polynomials are related to the schubert polynomials defined combinatorially by for the classical flag manifold when g sl n c their structure is governed by difference operators associated to the corresponding root system let be a root system in a finite dimensional real inner product space v with weyl group w let be a set of positive roots and the corresponding set of simple roots if is a root then s denotes the corresponding reflection operator roots are regarded as linear polynomials on v using the inner product v v the

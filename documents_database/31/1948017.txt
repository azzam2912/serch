owing to their combination of periodic and aperiodic structure some tcp phases belong to the class of quasicrystals applications of tcp phases as high temperature structural and superconducting materials have been highlighted however they have not yet been sufficiently investigated for details of their physical properties also their complex and often non stoichiometric structure makes them good subjects for theoretical calculations in 1958 frank and kasper in their original work investigating many complex alloy structures showed that non icosahedral environments form an open end network which they called the major skeleton and is now identified as the declination locus they came up with the methodology to pack asymmetric icosahedra into crystals using other polyhedra with larger coordination number and atoms these coordination polyhedra were constructed to maintain topological close packing tcp based on the tetrahedral units fk crystallographic structures are classified into low and high polyhedral groups denoted by their coordination numbers cn referring to the number of atom centering the polyhedron some atoms have an icosahedral structure with low coordination labeled cn12 some others have higher coordination numbers of 14 15 and 16 labeled cn14 cn15 and cn16 respectively these atoms with higher coordination numbers form uninterrupted networks connected

the project was previously known as the geared turbofan gtf and originally the advanced technology fan integrator atfi the engine is expected to deliver reductions in fuel use and ground noise when used in next generation aircraft the pw1000g engine first entered commercial use in january 2016 with lufthansa s first commercial airbus a320neo flight in summer 1993 pratt whitney started to test its demonstrator at the nasa ames wind tunnel with a 4 1 gearbox its fan with 18 reversing pitch composite blades had a 15 1 bypass ratio it was to cut fuel consumption by 6 7 emissions by 15 and generate less noise due to lower fan tip speed of down from in conventional 5 1 bypass turbofans limited by weight and drag this was mitigated by using 40 composites by weight up from 15 otherwise p w was planning to run in 1994 a flight weight gearbox for of thrust p w first attempted to build a geared turbofan starting around 1998 with the pw8000 targeted for the range this essentially was an upgrade of the existing pw6000 that replaced the fan section with a gearing system and new single stage fan and aimed for 8

it was the fifth successful launch in a series of the nimbus program the objective of nimbus 5 was to test and evaluate advanced sensing technology and to provide improved photographs of cloud formations nimbus 5 was launched on december 11 1972 by a delta rocket from vandenberg air force base california usa the satellite orbited the earth once every 107 minutes at an inclination of 99 its perigee was and apogee was there were 6 science instruments aboard nimbus 5 the satellite also included sun sensors and horizon scanners for navigation the itpr was designed to obtain vertical profiles of temperature and moisture in the atmosphere a 3 dimensional map could then be created with a resolution of the scr had three objectives to observe the global atmospheric temperature structure to observe the distribution of water vapor and to measure the density of ice crystals in cirrus clouds it s sensing resolution was about nems was to demonstrate the use of microwave sensors for measuring tropospheric temperature profiles and water content in clouds and surface temperature the instrument monitored five selected frequencies continuously the data were recorded on a magnetic tape so they could be transmitted later esmr was

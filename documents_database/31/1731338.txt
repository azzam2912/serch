it is elongate conic with decidedly channeled sutures the nuclear whorls number at least 2 forming a depressed helicoid spire which is obliquely almost one half immersed in the first of the succeeding turns the six post nuclear whorls are moderately rounded they are marked by strong decidedly retractive axial ribs and on the first four turns by three spiral cords which equal the ribs in strength the middle one of these three cords is a little nearer that at the summit than to the one anterior to it of the ribs 16 occur upon all the whorls the intersections of the ribs and spiral cords form strong compressed tubercles the long axes of which coincide with the spiral sculpture the spaces between the cords and ribs are well rounded strongly impressed pits the median cord on the first four whorls is a little stronger than the other two on the penultimate whorl a slender spiral cord makes its appearance between the median and the supraperipheral cord which on the last turn immediately behind the aperture attains a strength equal to that of the spiral cord at the summit the entire surface of the spire is marked by numerous very

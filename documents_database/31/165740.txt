it was discovered by finholt bond and schlesinger in 1947 this compound is used as a reducing agent in organic synthesis especially for the reduction of esters carboxylic acids and amides the solid is dangerously reactive toward water releasing gaseous hydrogen h some related derivatives have been discussed for hydrogen storage lah is a colorless solid but commercial samples are usually gray due to contamination this material can be purified by recrystallization from diethyl ether large scale purifications employ a soxhlet extractor commonly the impure gray material is used in synthesis since the impurities are innocuous and can be easily separated from the organic products the pure powdered material is pyrophoric but not its large crystals some commercial materials contain mineral oil to inhibit reactions with atmospheric moisture but more commonly it is packed in moisture proof plastic sacks lah violently reacts with water including atmospheric moisture the reaction proceeds according to the following idealized equation this reaction provides a useful method to generate hydrogen in the laboratory aged air exposed samples often appear white because they have absorbed enough moisture to generate a mixture of the white compounds lithium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide lah crystallizes in the monoclinic space

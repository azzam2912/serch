the connection form generally depends on a choice of a coordinate frame and so is not a tensorial object various generalizations and reinterpretations of the connection form were formulated subsequent to cartan s initial work in particular on a principal bundle a principal connection is a natural reinterpretation of the connection form as a tensorial object on the other hand the connection form has the advantage that it is a differential form defined on the differentiable manifold rather than on an abstract principal bundle over it hence despite their lack of tensoriality connection forms continue to be used because of the relative ease of performing calculations with them in physics connection forms are also used broadly in the context of gauge theory through the gauge covariant derivative a connection form associates to each basis of a vector bundle a matrix of differential forms the connection form is not tensorial because under a change of basis the connection form transforms in a manner that involves the exterior derivative of the transition functions in much the same way as the christoffel symbols for the levi civita connection the main tensorial invariant of a connection form is its curvature form in the presence

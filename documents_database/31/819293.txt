this generalisation only becomes noticeable at dimensions two and above where weak 2 3 and 4 categories are typically referred to as bicategories tricategories and tetracategories the subject of weak n categories is an area of ongoing research there is currently much work to determine what the coherence laws for weak n categories should be weak n categories have become the main object of study in higher category theory there are basically two classes of theories those in which the higher cells and higher compositions are realized algebraically most remarkably the michael batanin s theory of weak higher categories and those in which more topological models are used e g a higher category as a simplicial set satisfying some universality properties in a terminology due to john baez and james dolan a n k category is a weak n category such that all h cells for h k are invertible some of the formalism for n k categories are much simpler than those for general n categories in particular several technically accessible formalisms of infinity 1 categories are now known now the most popular such a formalism centers on a notion of quasi category other approaches include a properly understood

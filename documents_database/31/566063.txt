due to earth s rotation and axial tilt with respect to the sun the stars and constellations can be divided into two categories those stars and constellations that never rise or set are called circumpolar the rest are divided into seasonal stars and constellations the stars and constellations that are circumpolar depends on the observer s latitude in the northern hemisphere certain stars and constellations will always be visible in the northern circumpolar sky the same holds true in the southern hemisphere where certain stars and constellations will always be visible in the southern circumpolar sky the celestial north pole currently marked by polaris less than 1 away always has an azimuth equal to zero the pole s altitude for a given latitude is fixed and its value is given by the following formula a 90 all stars with a declination less than a are not circumpolar as viewed from the north pole all fully visible constellations north of the celestial equator are circumpolar and likewise for constellations south of the celestial equator as viewed from the south pole as viewed from the equator no circumpolar constellations are visible as viewed from mid northern latitudes 40 50 n circumpolar constellations

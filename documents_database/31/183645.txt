it usually has two primary goals to avoid the unintentional creation of positive feedback which will cause the amplifier to oscillate and to control overshoot and ringing in the amplifier s step response it is also used extensively to improve the bandwidth of single pole systems most amplifiers use negative feedback to trade gain for other desirable properties such as decreased distortion improved noise reduction or increased invariance to variation of parameters such as temperature ideally the phase characteristic of an amplifier s frequency response would be linear however device limitations make this goal physically unattainable more particularly capacitances within the amplifier s gain stages cause the output signal to lag behind the input signal by 90 for each pole they create if the sum of these phase lags reaches 360 the output signal will be in phase with the input signal feeding back any portion of this output signal to the input when the gain of the amplifier is sufficient will cause the amplifier to oscillate this is because the feedback signal will reinforce the input signal that is the feedback is then positive rather than negative frequency compensation is implemented to avoid this result another goal of frequency

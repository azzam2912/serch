they were once considered protozoans or protists but are now known to be fungi or a sister group to fungi loosely 1500 of the probably more than one million species are named now microsporidia are restricted to animal hosts and all major groups of animals host microsporidia most infect insects but they are also responsible for common diseases of crustaceans and fish the named species of microsporidia usually infect one host species or a group of closely related taxa several species most of which are opportunistic also infect humans approximately 10 percent of the species are parasites of vertebrates including humans in which they can cause microsporidiosis after infection they influence their hosts in various ways and all organs and tissues are invaded though generally by different species of microsporidia some species are lethal and a few are used in biological control of insect pests parasitic castration gigantism or change of host sex are all potential effects of microsporidian parasitism in insects in the most advanced cases of parasitism the microsporidium rules the host cell completely and controls its metabolism and reproduction forming a xenoma replication takes place within the host s cells which are infected by means of unicellular

it is intended to prevent brute force attacks on ssh servers by monitoring invalid login attempts in the authentication log and blocking the originating ip addresses denyhosts is developed by phil schwartz who is also the developer of kodos python regular expression debugger denyhosts checks the end of the authentication log for recent failed login attempts it records information about their originating ip addresses and compares the number of invalid attempts to a user specified threshold if there have been too many invalid attempts it assumes a dictionary attack is occurring and prevents the ip address from making any further attempts by adding it to codice 1 on the server denyhosts 2 0 and above support centralized synchronization so that repeat offenders are blocked from many computers the site denyhosts net gathers statistics from computers running the software denyhosts is restricted to connections using ipv4 it does not work with ipv6 denyhosts may be run manually as a daemon or as a cron job in july 2007 the register reported that from may until july that year compromised computers at oracle uk were listed among the ten worst offenders for launching brute force ssh attacks on the internet according to

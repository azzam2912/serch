gene gating was first hypothesised by g nter blobel in 1985 it has been shown to occur in saccharomyces cerevisiae caenorhabditis elegans drosophila melanogaster as well as mammalian model systems the proteins that constitute the npcs known as nucleoporins have been shown to play a role in dna binding and mrna transport making gene gating possible in addition gene gating is orchestrated by two protein complexes spt ada gcn5 acetyltransferase saga and transcription export complex 2 trex 2 complex saga is a chromatin remodeling complex responsible for activating the transcription of certain inducible genes the saga complex binds to gene promoters and also interacts with the trex 2 complex in turn the trex 2 complex interacts with the npc thus favouring the relocation of actively transcribed genes to the periphery of the cell nucleus in contrast the rest of the periphery i e those parts not associated with npcs is transcriptionally silent heterochromatin nucleoporins nups are the main constituent proteins of npcs and have been shown to play multiple roles in mediating several processes involved in gene gating while it has been known that the nuclear periphery serves as the primary location for most heterochromatin telomeric and centrosomal dna studies

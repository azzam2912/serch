a flux density of one wb m one weber per square metre is one tesla the weber is named after the german physicist wilhelm eduard weber 1804 1891 the weber may be defined in terms of faraday s law which relates a changing magnetic flux through a loop to the electric field around the loop a change in flux of one weber per second will induce an electromotive force of one volt produce an electric potential difference of one volt across two open circuited terminals officially the weber is commonly expressed in a multitude of other units where wb weber ohm c coulomb v volt t tesla j joule m metre s second a ampere h henry mx maxwell in 1861 the british association for the advancement of science known as the ba established a committee under william thomson later lord kelvin to study electrical units in a february 1902 manuscript with handwritten notes of oliver heaviside giovanni giorgi proposed a set of rational units of electromagnetism including the weber noting that the product of the volt into the second has been called the weber by the b a the international electrotechnical commission began work on terminology in 1909 and

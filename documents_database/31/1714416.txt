this means compared to other substances it can store more heat per unit of weight water is non toxic and low cost an efficiently insulated tank can retain stored heat for days reducing fuel costs hot water tanks may have a built in gas or oil burner system electric immersion heaters some types use an external heat exchanger such as a central heating system or heated water from another energy source the most typical in the domestic context is a fossil fuel burner electric immersion elements or a district heating scheme water heaters for washing bathing or laundry have thermostat controls to regulate the temperature in the range of and are connected to the domestic cold water supply where the local water supply has a high content of dissolved minerals such as limestone heating the water causes the minerals to precipitate in the tank scaling a tank may develop leaks due to corrosion after only a few years a problem exacerbated by dissolved oxygen in the water which accelerates corrosion of both tank and fittings typically hot water storage tanks are wrapped in heat insulation to reduce energy consumption speed up the heating process and maintain the desired operating temperature

an example is the colourful and elaborate peacock plumage compared to the relatively subdued peahen plumage the costly ornaments notably the bird s extremely long tail appear to be incompatible with natural selection fisherian runaway can be postulated to include sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits such as behaviour expressed by either sex extreme and apparently maladaptive sexual dimorphism represented a paradox for evolutionary biologists from charles darwin s time up to the modern synthesis darwin attempted to resolve the paradox by assuming genetic bases for both the preference and the ornament and supposed an aesthetic sense in higher animals leading to powerful selection of both characteristics in subsequent generations fisher developed the theory further by assuming genetic correlation between the preference and the ornament that initially the ornament signalled greater potential fitness the likelihood of leaving more descendants so preference for the ornament had a selective advantage subsequently if strong enough female preference for exaggerated ornamentation in mate selection could be enough to undermine natural selection even when the ornament has become non adaptive over subsequent generations this could lead to runaway selection by positive feedback and the speed with which the trait and the preference increase could until counter selection

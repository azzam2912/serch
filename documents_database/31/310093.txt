false brinelling may occur in bearings which act under small oscillations or vibrations the basic cause of false brinelling is that the design of the bearing does not have a method for redistribution of lubricant without large rotational movement of all bearing surfaces in the raceway lubricant is pushed out of a loaded region during small oscillatory movements and vibration where the bearings surfaces repeatedly do not move very far without lubricant wear is increased when the small oscillatory movements occur again it is possible for the resulting wear debris to oxidize and form an abrasive compound which further accelerates wear in normal operation a rolling element bearing has the rollers and races separated by a thin layer of lubricant such as grease or oil although these lubricants normally appear liquid not solid under high pressure they act as solids and keep the bearing and race from touching if the lubricant is removed the bearings and races can touch directly while bearings and races appear smooth to the eye they are microscopically rough thus high points of each surface can touch but valleys do not the bearing load is thus spread over much less area increasing the contact stress causing

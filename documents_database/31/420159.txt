it has two main parts the test execution engine and the test script repository test harnesses allow for the automation of tests they can call functions with supplied parameters and print out and compare the results to the desired value the test harness is a hook to the developed code which can be tested using an automation framework a test harness should allow specific tests to run this helps in optimizing orchestrate a runtime environment and provide a capability to analyse results the typical objectives of a test harness are to these individual objectives may be fulfilled by unit test framework tools stubs or drivers a test harness may provide some of the following benefits an alternative definition of a test harness is software constructed to facilitate integration testing where test stubs are typically components of the application under development and are replaced by working components as the application is developed top down integration testing test harnesses are external to the application being tested and simulate services or functionality not available in a test environment for example when attempting to build an application that needs to interface with an application on a mainframe computer but no mainframe is available during

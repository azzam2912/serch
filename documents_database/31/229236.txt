at low frequencies e g visible light this yields thomson scattering at higher frequencies e g x rays and gamma rays this yields compton scattering for an incident unpolarized photon of energy formula 1 the differential cross section is where formula 3 is a differential cross section formula 4 is an infinitesimal solid angle element formula 5 is the fine structure constant 1 137 04 formula 6 is the scattering angle formula 7 is the reduced compton wave length of the electron 0 38616 pm formula 8 is the mass of an electron 511 kevformula 9 and formula 10 is the ratio of photon energy after and before the collision note that this result may also be expressed in terms of the classical electron radius formula 12 while this classical quantity is not particularly relevant in quantum electrodynamics it is easy to appreciate in the forward direction for formula 6 0 photons scatter off electrons as if these were about formula 12 2 8179 fm in linear dimension and formula 16 7 9406x10 m or 79 406 mb in size if the incoming photon is polarized the scattered photon is no longer isotropic with respect to the azimuthal angle for

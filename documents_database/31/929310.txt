isotonic contractions differ from isokinetic contractions in that in isokinetic contractions the muscle speed remains constant while superficially identical as the muscle s force changes via the length tension relationship during a contraction an isotonic contraction will keep force constant while velocity changes but an isokinetic contraction will keep velocity constant while force changes a near isotonic contraction is known as auxotonic contraction there are two types of isotonic contractions 1 concentric and 2 eccentric in a concentric contraction the muscle tension rises to meet the resistance then remains the same as the muscle shortens in eccentric the muscle lengthens due to the resistance being greater than the force the muscle is producing this type is typical of most exercise the external force on the muscle is less than the force the muscle is generating a shortening contraction the effect is not visible during the classic biceps curl which is in fact auxotonic because the resistance torque due to the weight being lifted does not remain the same through the exercise tension is highest at a parallel to the floor level and eases off above and below this point therefore tension changes as well as muscle length there are two

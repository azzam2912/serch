an important special case is the kernel of a linear map the kernel of a matrix also called the null space is the kernel of the linear map defined by the matrix the definition of kernel takes various forms in various contexts but in all of them the kernel of a homomorphism is trivial in a sense relevant to that context if and only if the homomorphism is injective the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms or first isomorphism theorem is a theorem again taking various forms that involves the quotient object also called quotient algebra in universal algebra and cokernel in category theory defined by the kernel in this article we first survey kernels for some important types of algebraic structures then we give general definitions from universal algebra for generic algebraic structures let v and w be vector spaces over a field or more generally modules over a ring and let t be a linear map from v to w if 0 is the zero vector of w then the kernel of t is the preimage of the zero subspace 0 that is the subset of v consisting of all those elements of v that are mapped by t to

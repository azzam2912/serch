the relationship is that of the founding abbey or conventual priory termed the motherhouse with a monastery composed of the monks or nuns of the new community which is called the daughter house in that situation the abbot or abbess or prior or prioress in those monastic congregations which do not have abbots or abbesses remains the ultimate authority for the affairs of the dependent priory which is considered an extension of the founding house this relationship will end at such time as the new community becomes fully autonomous in its own right monasteries of nuns can make a bond with a monastery of monks or friars preferably within the same congregation or order whereby the two are affiliated and the fathers guarantee pastoral care to the nuns in this sense the women s house is considered a dependency on that of the men for spiritual direction for all other matters however the nuns of the daughter monastery remain dependencies of the founding monastery of nuns which established them until they become autonomous an extension of this is the relationship of responsibility for providing pastoral care to parishes in the surrounding region which is assumed by an abbey or priory

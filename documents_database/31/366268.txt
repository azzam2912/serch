it can be characterized as the unique positive definite even unimodular lattice of rank 8 the name derives from the fact that it is the root lattice of the e root system the norm of the e lattice divided by 2 is a positive definite even unimodular quadratic form in 8 variables and conversely such a quadratic form can be used to construct a positive definite even unimodular lattice of rank 8 the existence of such a form was first shown by h j s smith in 1867 and the first explicit construction of this quadratic form was given by a korkin and g zolotarev in 1873 the e lattice is also called the gosset lattice after thorold gosset who was one of the first to study the geometry of the lattice itself around 1900 the e lattice is a discrete subgroup of r of full rank i e it spans all of r it can be given explicitly by the set of points r such that in symbols it is not hard to check that the sum of two lattice points is another lattice point so that is indeed a subgroup an alternative description of the e lattice which

this type of machining was originally performed mechanically on large complex machines these machines operated on 4 5 6 and even 12 axes which were controlled individually via levers that rested on cam plates the cam plates offered the ability to control the tooling device the table in which the part is secured as well as rotating the tooling or part within the machine due to the machines size and complexity it took extensive amounts of time to set them up for production once computer numerically controlled machining was introduced it provided a faster more efficient method for machining complex parts typical cnc tools support translation in 3 axis multiaxis machines also support rotation around one or multiple axis 5 axis machines are commonly used in industry in which the workpiece is translated linearly along three axes typically x y and z and the tooling spindle is capable of rotation about an addition 2 axes there are now many cam computer aided manufacturing software systems available to support multiaxis machining including software that can automatically convert 3 axis toolpaths into 5 axis toolpaths prior to the advancement of computer aided manufacturing transferring information from design to production often required extensive

it has an apparent visual magnitude of 3 115 which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye based upon parallax measurements this star is located at a distance of about from the earth the spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of k0 k1 iii where the luminosity class of iii indicates this is a giant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence the radius of this star has expanded to 21 times the sun s radius with an emission of about 151 times the luminosity of the sun this expanded outer envelope has an effective temperature of about 4 335 k giving it the characteristic orange hue of a k type star nu hydrae is an x ray emitter with an estimated luminosity of in the x ray band the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium what astronomers term the star s metallicity is about half that in the sun it has a relatively high proper motion across the celestial sphere suggesting that it has a peculiar velocity roughly three times higher than its neighbors nu hydrae was a later designation of

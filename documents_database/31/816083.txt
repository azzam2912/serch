this is true even if the zeros recur infinitely for example in pharmacy trailing zeros are omitted from dose values to prevent misreading however trailing zeros may be useful for indicating the number of significant figures for example in a measurement in such a context simplifying a number by removing trailing zeros would be incorrect the number of trailing zeros in a non zero base b integer n equals the exponent of the highest power of b that divides n for example 14000 has three trailing zeros and is therefore divisible by 1000 10 but not by 10 this property is useful when looking for small factors in integer factorization some computer architectures have a count trailing zeros operation in their instruction set for efficiently determining the number of trailing zero bits in a machine word the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of n the factorial of a non negative integer n is simply the multiplicity of the prime factor 5 in n this can be determined with this special case of de polignac s formula where k must be chosen such that more precisely and formula 5 denotes the floor function applied to a for n

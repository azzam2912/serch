this option is given to patients as an alternative to extraction when the wisdom teeth are in close association with the inferior alveolar nerve and so used to prevent damage to the nerve which may occur during extraction prevents potential neuropathy the risk of altered sensation is significantly lower than convention surgical removal of mandibular third molars with 8 of the cases affected temporarily and 3 6 of the cases got permanently affected 30 of the roots will migrate post coronectomy erupting away for the inferior alveolar canal this makes extraction of the remaining roots safer there is a 5 chance of failure of coronectomy the root will become mobilized during transection in 5 of the cases follicle remnants will form deep periodontal pockets which will lead to infection coronectomy should be considered if there are signs that the patient is at a high risk of nerve damage during extraction the patient should be aware of the potential risks of the procedure such as a plain film radiograph allows the proximity of the tooth to the inferior alveolar canal to be assessed the plain film can be assessed to identify the tooth as high risk if there is loss of

it was first explicitly defined by though pointed out that implicitly used the same function defined a p adic analog g of log had previously given a definition of a different p adic analogue of the gamma function but his function does not have satisfactory properties and is not used much the p adic gamma function is the unique continuous function of a p adic integer x with values in formula 1 such that for positive integers x where the product is restricted to integers i not divisible by p as the positive integers are dense with respect to the p adic topology in formula 1 formula 3 can be extended uniquely to the whole formula 1 here formula 1 is the ring of p adic integers it comes by the definition that the values of formula 6 are invertible in formula 1 this is so because these values are products of integers not divisible by p and this property holds after the continuous extension to formula 1 thus formula 9 here formula 10 is the set of invertible p adic integers the classical gamma function satisfies the functional equation formula 12 for any formula 13 this has an analogue

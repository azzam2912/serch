a salinometer may be calibrated in either micromhos a unit of electrical conductivity usually 0 22 or else directly calibrated for salt in grains per gallon 0 0 5 a typical reading on board ship would be 2 micromhos or 0 05 grains per gallon a reading of twice this may trigger a warning light or alarm fresh water generators evaporators use salinometers on the distillate discharge in order to gauge the quality of the water water from the evaporator can be destined for potable water supplies so salty water is not desirable for human consumption in some ships extremely high quality distillate is required for use in water tube boilers where salt water would be disastrous in these ships a salinometer is also installed on the feed system where it would alert the engineer to any salt contamination the salinometer may switch the evaporator s output from fresh water to feed water tanks automatically depending on the water quality the higher quality lower salinity is required for the boiler feedwater not for drinking

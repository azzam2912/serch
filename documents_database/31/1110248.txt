the enzyme localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus casein kinase a ubiquitous well conserved protein kinase involved in cell metabolism and differentiation is characterised by its preference for serine or threonine in acidic stretches of amino acids the enzyme is a tetramer of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits however some species e g mammals possess 2 related forms of the alpha subunit alpha and alpha while others e g fungi possess 2 related beta subunits beta and beta the alpha subunit is the catalytic unit and contains regions characteristic of serine threonine protein kinases the beta subunit is believed to be regulatory possessing an n terminal auto phosphorylation site an internal acidic domain and a potential metal binding motif the beta subunit is a highly conserved protein of about 25kda that contains in its central section a cysteine rich motif cx n c that could be involved in binding a metal such as zinc the mammalian beta subunit gene promoter shares common features with those of other mammalian protein kinases and is closely related to the promoter of the regulatory subunit of camp dependent protein kinase csnk2b has been shown to interact with cd163 csnk2a2 casein

its function is similar to most other techniques for generating rnaseq or dnaseq libraries in that it aims to generate random fragments of biological samples of rna or dna and append specific sequencing adaptors to either end of every fragment as per the requirements of the particular sequencing platform to be used e g hiseq in clickseq reverse transcription rt reactions are supplemented with small amounts of 3 azido nucleotides azntps at defined ratios to deoxyribonucleotides dntps azntps are chain terminators and therefore induce the stochastic termination of cdna synthesis at an average length determined by the ratio of azntps to dntps this results in the production of single stranded cdna fragments that contain an azido group at their 3 ends these 3 azido blocked cdna molecules are purified away from the components of the rt reaction and subsequently click ligated to 5 alkyne modified dna adaptors via copper catalysed azide alkyne cycloaddition cuaac this generates ssdna molecules with unnatural triazole linked dna backbones nevertheless these templates are used in pcr reactions and amplified to generate a cdna sequencing library with the appropriate 5 and 3 sequencing adapters and indices required for next generation sequencing clickseq has predominantly been used

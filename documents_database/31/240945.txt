humans serve as natural hosts there are currently three species in this genus including the type species human betaherpesvirus 6a diseases associated with this genus include hhv 6 sixth disease roseola infantum exanthem subitum hhv 7 symptoms analog to the sixth disease the genus consists of the following six species viruses in roseolovirus are enveloped with icosahedral spherical to pleomorphic and round geometries and t 16 symmetry the diameter is around 150 200 nm genomes are linear and non segmented around 200kb in length viral replication is nuclear and is lysogenic entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral glycoproteins to host receptors which mediates endocytosis replication follows the dsdna bidirectional replication model dna templated transcription with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription the virus exits the host cell by nuclear egress and budding humans serve as the natural host transmission routes are direct contact and respiratory human herpesvirus 6 hhv 6 is a set of two closely related herpes viruses known as hhv 6a and hhv 6b that infect nearly all human beings typically before the age of two the acquisition of hhv 6 in infancy is often symptomatic resulting in childhood

he is known for his research on quantum mechanics quantum field theory statistical mechanics and string theory and is particularly famous for his co invention together with antti niemi of the parity anomaly in odd dimensional gauge field theories and for his pioneering work on graphene he is also well known for development of thermal field theory the application of index theorems and their generalizations in quantum field theory and string theory notably with respect to the duality between string theories and gauge field theories gordon semenoff was born on july 11 1953 in pincher creek alberta canada where he attended matthew halton high school graduating in the class of 1971 after completing bachelor of science 1976 and doctor of philosophy 1981 degrees at the university of alberta in edmonton gordon spent one year 1981 1982 as a postdoctoral fellow at the university of alberta and the subsequent year 1982 1983 as a postdoctoral fellow at the center for theoretical physics of the massachusetts institute of technology mit in 1983 he was appointed a university research fellow at the university of british columbia and has spent the remainder of his career to date at that institution being promoted to full

the port which specifies the service such as a web or tftp server during encapsulation each layer builds a protocol data unit pdu by adding a header and sometimes trailer containing control information to the sdu from the layer above for example in the internet protocol suite the contents of a web page are encapsulated with an http header then by a tcp header an ip header and finally by a frame header and trailer the frame is forwarded to the destination node as a stream of bits where it is decapsulated or de encapsulated into the respective pdus and interpreted at each layer by the receiving node the result of encapsulation is that each lower layer provides a service to the layer or layers above it while at the same time each layer communicates with its corresponding layer on the receiving node these are known as adjacent layer interaction and same layer interaction respectively in discussions of encapsulation the more abstract layer is often called the upper layer protocol while the more specific layer is called the lower layer protocol sometimes however the terms upper layer protocols and lower layer protocols are used to describe the layers above and

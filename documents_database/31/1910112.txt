dyakonov theoretically predicted a new class of surface electromagnetic waves now called dyakonov surface waves dsws unlike other types of acoustic and electromagnetic surface waves the dsw s existence is due to the difference in symmetry of materials forming the interface he considered the interface between an isotropic transmitting medium and an anisotropic uniaxial crystal and showed that under certain conditions waves localized at the interface should exist later similar waves were predicted to exist at the interface between two identical uniaxial crystals with different orientations the previously known electromagnetic surface waves surface plasmons and surface plasmon polaritons exist under the condition that the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative while the other one is positive for example this is the case for the air metal interface below the plasma frequency in contrast the dsw can propagate when both materials are transparent hence they are virtually lossless which is their most fascinating property in recent years the significance and potential of the dsw have attracted the attention of many researchers a change of the constitutive properties of one or both of the two partnering materials due to say infiltration by any chemical or biological agent

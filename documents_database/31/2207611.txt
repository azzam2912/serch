his current field of research is computational biology after finishing his phd studies in theoretical physics at lund university in 1977 peterson worked as a postdoctoral researcher at nordita in copenhagen in 1978 1979 and at stanford university in 1980 1982 before returning to lund he has since then been active there except for a sabbatical period in 1986 1988 when he hold a senior scientist position at microelectronics and computer technology corporation in austin texas peterson is a professor in theoretical physics and was elected to the royal swedish academy of sciences in 2006 peterson s field of research was originally theoretical particle physics and statistical mechanics in the late 1980s he switched interests into machine learning methods for pattern recognition and image processing as well as algorithms for difficult optimization problems in particular he mapped the latter onto spin systems within physics a field that is now gaining attention when it comes to quantum computers with regard to pattern recognition he early on contributed with a learning algorithm for neural networks the mean field method which was relevant for the first steps in developing the current fashion deep learning his group in lund were somewhat of pioneers when

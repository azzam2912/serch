hamiltonian coloring uses a concept called detour distance between two vertices of the graph it has many applications in different areas of science and technology a graph g with diameter d with n nodes that is colored i e has a positive integer assigned to each vertex with k colors is called a radio k coloring g if for every pair of vertices a and b the sum of the distance between them and the difference between their labels colors is greater than k for example two nodes labelled 3 and 7 with a distance of 5 is acceptable for a radio 8 coloring but not for a radio 9 coloring since formula 1 which is not greater than 9 a radio d 1 coloring that is where k is equal to one less than the graph s diameter is known as an antipodal coloring because antipodal vertices may be colored the same but all nodes between them must be different the distance between two vertices in a graph is defined as the minimum of lengths of paths connecting those vertices the detour distance between two vertices say u and v is defined as the length of the longest u

knight for an ensemble of n spins in a magnetic induction field formula 1 the nuclear hamiltonian for the knight shift is expressed in cartesian form by formula 2 where for the i spin formula 3 is the gyromagnetic ratio formula 4 is a vector of the cartesian nuclear angular momentum operators the formula 5 matrix is a second rank tensor similar to the chemical shift shielding tensor the knight shift refers to the relative shift k in nmr frequency for atoms in a metal e g sodium compared with the same atoms in a nonmetallic environment e g sodium chloride the observed shift reflects the local magnetic field produced at the sodium nucleus by the magnetization of the conduction electrons the average local field in sodium augments the applied resonance field by approximately one part per 1000 in nonmetallic sodium chloride the local field is negligible in comparison the knight shift is due to the conduction electrons in metals they introduce an extra effective field at the nuclear site due to the spin orientations of the conduction electrons in the presence of an external field this is responsible for the shift observed in the nuclear magnetic resonance the shift

this demonstration was initiated and sustained by the non jewish wives and relatives of jewish men who had been arrested and targeted for deportation based on the racial policy of nazi germany the protests continued until the men being held were released the rosenstrasse protest is significant in its singularity as the only mass public demonstration by germans in the third reich against the deportation of jews there is a dispute about the key context of events for understanding the regime s response to the rosenstrasse protest most historians have understood the protest as part of the history of intermarriages it was the goal of the nazi government to classify intermarried jews similarly to those of the full jew status as defined by the nuremberg laws and murder them accordingly however most of those deemed to be of the aryan race and who were married to jews refused to divorce in a succession of actions beginning in 1933 the aryan spouses placed themselves between the regime and its mission to destroy their marriages and persecute the jewish individuals in the intermarried families the nazi regime ultimately refrained from outright persecution in order to not draw attention to intermarried couples and

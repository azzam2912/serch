at low enough temperatures any enzymatic or chemical activity which might cause damage to the biological material in question is effectively stopped cryopreservation methods seek to reach low temperatures without causing additional damage caused by the formation of ice crystals during freezing traditional cryopreservation has relied on coating the material to be frozen with a class of molecules termed cryoprotectants new methods are constantly being investigated due to the inherent toxicity of many cryoprotectants by default it should be considered that cryopreservation alters or compromises the structure and function of cells unless it is proven otherwise for a particular cell population cryoconservation of animal genetic resources is the process in which animal genetic material is collected and stored with the intention of conservation of the breed water bears tardigrada microscopic multicellular organisms can survive freezing by replacing most of their internal water with the sugar trehalose preventing it from crystallization that otherwise damages cell membranes mixtures of solutes can achieve similar effects some solutes including salts have the disadvantage that they may be toxic at intense concentrations in addition to the water bear wood frogs can tolerate the freezing of their blood and other tissues urea is accumulated in tissues

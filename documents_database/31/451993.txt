each element of the set formula 2 corresponds to a cube move which is the effect of any sequence of rotations of the cube s faces with this representation not only can any cube move be represented but also any position of the cube as well by detailing the cube moves required to rotate the solved cube into that position indeed with the solved position as a starting point there is a one to one correspondence between each of the legal positions of the rubik s cube and the elements of formula 2 the group operation formula 4 is the composition of cube moves corresponding to the result of performing one cube move after another the rubik s cube group is constructed by labeling each of the 48 non center facets with the integers 1 to 48 each configuration of the cube can be represented as a permutation of the labels 1 to 48 depending on the position of each facet using this representation the solved cube is the identity permutation which leaves the cube unchanged while the twelve cube moves that rotate a layer of the cube 90 degrees are represented by their respective permutations the rubik s cube

these are quite similar to the typical glow plug engine that runs on a mixture of methanol based fuels with a hot wire filament to provide ignition despite their name their use of compression ignition and the use of a kerosene fuel that is similar to diesel model diesels share very little with full size diesel engines full size diesel engines such as those found in a truck are fuel injected and either two stroke or four stroke they use compression ignition to ignite the mixture the compression within the cylinder heats the inlet charge sufficiently to cause ignition without requiring any external ignition source a fundamental feature of such engines unlike petrol gasoline engines is that they draw in air alone and the fuel is only mixed by being injected into the combustion chamber separately model diesel engines are instead a carbureted two stroke using the crankcase for charge air compression the carburetor supplies a mixture of fuel and air into the engine with the proportions kept fairly constant and their total volume throttled to control the engine power apart from sharing the diesel s use of compression ignition their construction has more in common with a small two

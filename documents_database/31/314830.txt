contrasts with homogeneous catalysis where the reactants products and catalyst exist in the same phase phase distinguishes between not only solid liquid and gas components but also immiscible mixtures e g oil and water or anywhere an interface is present catalysts are useful because they increase the rate of a reaction without themselves being consumed and are therefore reusable heterogeneous catalysis typically involves solid phase catalysts and gas phase reactants in this case there is a cycle of molecular adsorption reaction and desorption occurring at the catalyst surface thermodynamics mass transfer and heat transfer influence the rate kinetics of reaction heterogeneous catalysis is very important because it enables faster large scale production and the selective product formation approximately 35 of the world s gdp is influenced by catalysis the production of 90 of chemicals by volume is assisted by solid catalysts the chemical and energy industries rely heavily on heterogeneous catalysis for example the haber bosch process uses metal based catalysts in the synthesis of ammonia an important component in fertilizer 144 million tons of ammonia were produced in 2016 adsorption is an essential step in heterogeneous catalysis adsorption is the process by which a gas or solution phase molecule

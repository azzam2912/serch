grk3 was initially called beta adrenergic receptor kinase 2 ark 2 and is a member of the g protein coupled receptor kinase subfamily of the ser thr protein kinases that is most highly similar to grk2 g protein coupled receptor kinases phosphorylate activated g protein coupled receptors which promotes the binding of an arrestin protein to the receptor arrestin binding to phosphorylated active receptor prevents receptor stimulation of heterotrimeric g protein transducer proteins blocking their cellular signaling and resulting in receptor desensitization arrestin binding also directs receptors to specific cellular internalization pathways removing the receptors from the cell surface and also preventing additional activation arrestin binding to phosphorylated active receptor also enables receptor signaling through arrestin partner proteins thus the grk arrestin system serves as a complex signaling switch for g protein coupled receptors grk3 and the closely related grk2 phosphorylate receptors at sites that encourage arrestin mediated receptor desensitization internalization and trafficking rather than arrestin mediated signaling in contrast to grk5 and grk6 which have the opposite effect this difference is one basis for pharmacological biased agonism also called functional selectivity where a drug binding to a receptor may bias that receptor s signaling toward a particular subset of

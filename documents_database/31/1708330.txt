rig i retinoic acid inducible gene i also known as ddx58 is the best characterized receptor within the rig i like receptor rlr family together with mda5 melanoma differentiation associated 5 and lgp2 laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 this family of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors prrs are sentinels for intracellular viral rna that is a product of viral infection the rlr receptors provide frontline defence against viral infections in most tissues the rig i receptor prefers to bind short rna carrying an uncapped 5 triphosphate and additional motifs such as poly uridine rich rna motifs rig i triggers an immune response to rna viruses from various families including the paramyxoviruses e g measles rhabdoviruses e g vesicular stomatitis virus and orthomyxoviruses e g influenza a mda5 ligands are poorly characterized but the preference is for long double stranded rna 2000 bp such as the replicative form of picornavirus rna that is found in picornavirus infected cells lgp2 binds to blunt ended double stranded rna of variable length and also to rna bound mda5 to regulate filament formation the latter is linked to lgp2 s recognition of picornaviruses e g encephalomyocarditis virus as per mda5 the rlr receptors are members

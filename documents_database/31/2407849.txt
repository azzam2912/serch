the theorem is named after felix behrend who published it in 1935 the logarithmic density of a set of integers from 1 to formula 1 can be defined by setting the weight of each integer formula 4 to be formula 5 and dividing the total weight of the set by formula 6 or equivalently for the purposes of asymptotic analysis dividing by the formula 1th partial sum of the harmonic series the resulting number is 1 or close to 1 when the set includes all of the integers in that range but smaller when many integers are missing and particularly when the missing integers are themselves small a subset of formula 8 is called primitive if it has the property that no subset element is a multiple of any other element behrend s theorem states that the logarithmic density of any primitive subset must be small more precisely the logarithmic density of such a set must be formula 9 for infinite primitive sequences the maximum possible density is smaller formula 10 there exist large primitive subsets of formula 8 however these sets still have small logarithmic density both of these subsets have significantly smaller logarithmic density than the bound given

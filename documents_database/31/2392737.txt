its maximum apparent visual magnitude is 12 16 but its light curve shows clearly eclipsing events where its brightness can drop to a magnitude of 13 07 this leads to its classification as an algol variable star the optical spectrum of qr andromedae is not of a typical stellar blackbody but is peculiar with many emission lines the strongest being the he line balmer series and o lines are also present it was also one of the super soft x ray sources discovered by rosat satellite one of the few source of this kind observed so far in the milky way it is now commonly accepted that super soft x ray sources are white dwarfs that are burning matter with nuclear fusion on their surfaces sustained by a high accretion rate of matter coming from a companion star qr andromedae is the nearest and brightest of those sources and it has an orbital period of 15 85 hours the companion star has a mass between 0 3 0 5 and should be a remnant of a more massive evolved star that is filling its roche lobe eclipses in the light curve of qr andromedae are not symmetrical the ingress is

the project entails the construction of a demonstration power plant at koeberg near cape town now postponed indefinitely and a fuel plant at pelindaba near pretoria the pbmr is characterised by inherent safety features which mean that no human error or equipment failure can cause an accident that would harm the public heat from the pbmr can be used for a variety of industrial process applications including process steam for cogeneration applications in situ oil sands recovery ethanol applications refinery and petrochemical applications the high temperature heat can also be used to reform methane to produce syngas where the syngas can be used as feedstock to produce hydrogen ammonia and methanol and to produce hydrogen and oxygen by decomposing water thermochemically the pbmr is modular in that only small to mid sized units will be designed larger power stations will be built by combining many of these modules as of 2008 400mwt was emerging as an optimum module size considerably larger than the original concept size the pbmr is fuelled and moderated by graphite fuel spheres each containing triso coated low enriched uranium oxide fuel particles there are 15000 fuel particles per fuel sphere the size of a billiard ball

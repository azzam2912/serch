immediately following initiation pol ii becomes trapped in promoter proximal paused positions on the majority of human genes figure 1 p tefb is a cyclin dependent kinase that can phosphorylate the drb sensitivity inducing factor dsif and negative elongation factor nelf as well as the carboxyl terminal domain of the large subunit of pol ii and this causes the transition into productive elongation leading to the synthesis of mrnas p tefb is regulated in part by a reversible association with the 7sk snrnp treatment of cells with the p tefb inhibitors drb or flavopidirol leads to loss of mrna production and ultimately cell death p tefb was identified and purified as a factor needed for the generation of long run off transcripts using an in vitro transcription system derived from drosophila cells it is a cyclin dependent kinase containing the catalytic subunit cdk9 and a regulatory subunit cyclin t in drosophila in humans there are multiple forms of p tefb which contain cdk9 and one of several cyclin subunits cyclin t1 t2 and k p tefb associates with other factors including the bromodomain protein brd4 and is found associated with a large complex of proteins called the super elongation complex

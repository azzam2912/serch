dsps are fabricated on mos integrated circuit chips they are widely used in audio signal processing telecommunications digital image processing radar sonar and speech recognition systems and in common consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones disk drives and high definition television hdtv products the goal of dsp is usually to measure filter or compress continuous real world analog signals most general purpose microprocessors can also execute digital signal processing algorithms successfully but may not be able to keep up with such processing continuously in real time also dedicated dsps usually have better power efficiency thus they are more suitable in portable devices such as mobile phones because of power consumption constraints dsps often use special memory architectures that are able to fetch multiple data or instructions at the same time dsps often also implement data compression technology with the discrete cosine transform dct in particular being a widely used compression technology in dsps digital signal processing algorithms typically require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly and repeatedly on a series of data samples signals perhaps from audio or video sensors are constantly converted from analog to digital manipulated digitally and then converted back to analog

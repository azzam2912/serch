banlec is one of the predominant proteins in the pulp of ripe bananas and has binding specificity for mannose and mannose containing oligosaccharides a 2010 study reported that banlec was a potent inhibitor of hiv replication banlec has a number of similarities to concanavalin a and binds to mannose related carbohydrate structures it was discovered due to its highly immunogenic properties banlec induces a strong igg4 antibody response and appears to be an important antigen involved in banana allergies banlec expression can be induced by the plant hormone methyl jasmonate banlec exists as a homodimer of two identical 15 kda subunits and has also been reported as a tetramer complex the protein is highly stable unfolding only at high temperatures all jacalin related lectins feature type i beta prism folding motifs the beta prism i fold is like a perfect beta prism with each side made up of a four stranded greek key motif but banlec is the first jacalin related lectin from the monocot family of plants while all other members are dicots other monocot mannose binding lectins exhibit beta prism ii folding instead banlec features strong intersubunit interactions with high levels of hydrogen bonding and water bridges allowing

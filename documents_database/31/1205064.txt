ecologists have been unable to successfully explain regular population cycles for many decades delayed density dependence may hold the answer here populations are allowed to increase above their normal capacity because there is a time lag until negative feedback mechanisms bring the population back down this effect has been used to explain the widely fluctuating population cycles of lemmings forest insects as well as the population cycles of larger mammals such as moose and wolves other causes of population cycles include cycling abiotic factors the causes of delayed density dependence vary in each situation in lemmings food supply and predation are the most important factors that lead to delayed density dependence competition between life stages is another cause in some species of moth the practice of egg cannibalism takes place where older moths eat eggs of their own species this produces imbalances in the population levels of different generations leading to delayed density dependence disease is another causative factor the delay is introduced because of the time it takes for enough susceptible individuals to be present for the disease to spread again the delay to sexual maturity introduces delayed density dependence in many instances in this case there is density

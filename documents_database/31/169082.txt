it was invented in august 1957 by leo esaki yuriko kurose and takashi suzuki when they were working at tokyo tsushin kogyo now known as sony in 1973 esaki received the nobel prize in physics jointly with brian josephson for discovering the electron tunneling effect used in these diodes robert noyce independently devised the idea of a tunnel diode while working for william shockley but was discouraged from pursuing it tunnel diodes were first manufactured by sony in 1957 followed by general electric and other companies from about 1960 and are still made in low volume today tunnel diodes have a heavily doped p n junction that is about 10 nm 100 wide the heavy doping results in a broken band gap where conduction band electron states on the n side are more or less aligned with valence band hole states on the p side they are usually made from germanium but can also be made from gallium arsenide and silicon materials their negative differential resistance in part of their operating range allows them to function as oscillators and amplifiers and in switching circuits using hysteresis they are also used as frequency converters and detectors their low capacitance allows them

its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 26 and an inclination of 10 with respect to the ecliptic first identified as at the finnish turku observatory in 1947 swann s observation arc was extended by 37 years prior to its official discovery observation at palomar the c type asteroid is classified as a ch subtype in the smass taxonomy according to the surveys carried out by the japanese akari satellite and nasa s wide field infrared survey explorer with its subsequent neowise mission swann measures 9 5 and 11 1 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0 029 and 0 101 respectively the collaborative asteroid lightcurve link however assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0 20 and derives a much smaller diameter of 5 85 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 13 46 in july 2006 a rotational lightcurve of swann was obtained from photometric observations by petr pravec at the ond ejov observatory in the czech republic it gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0 67 magnitude a second lightcurve obtained by jean gabriel bosch in september 2006 gave a period of hours and an amplitude of

the axial valley is 500 1000 m deep 50 100 km long ridge segments are separated by 30 km long transform faults and 10 km long non transform discontinuities melt supply comes from axial volcanic ridges that are 15 km long 1 2 km wide and reaches 100 200 m above the axial floor with a spreading rate of 30 mm yr near the equator and 49 mm yr near the rodrigues triple junction rtj at its southern end the cir is an intermediately fast spreading ridge characterised by moderate obliquity and few large offsets the obvious exception being the almost 300 km long marie celeste fracture zone at 18 s between 21 s and the marie celeste fracture zone 18 s the cir deviates westward along this section the larger offsets switch from right lateral to left lateral but return to right lateral north of 18 s otherwise the southern section rtj argo fracture zone 25 s 13 s of the cir is near orthogonal relative to the spreading direction north of the argo fz it is highly oblique and dominated by numerous small ridge segments the northern section of the cir including the carlsberg ridge trends nnw and

after the proof of the bieberbach conjecture by louis de branges this conjecture is considered the most interesting challenge in the field and he himself and coauthors answered affirmatively to the conjecture for some classes of valent functions his researches in the field continued in the paper univalent functions and nonanalytic curves published in 1957 in 1968 he published the survey open problems on univalent and multivalent functions which eventually led him to write the two volume book univalent functions apart from his research activity he was actively involved in teaching he wrote several college and high school textbooks including analytic geometry and the calculus and the five volume set algebra from a to z he retired in 1993 became a distinguished professor emeritus in 1995 and died in 2004

from september 1984 to april 1986 it is the first update to the original macintosh 128k it was virtually identical to the previous macintosh differing primarily in the amount of built in random access memory the increased memory turned the macintosh into a more business capable computer and gained the ability to run more software the mac 512k originally shipped with macintosh system 1 1 but was able to run all versions of mac os up to system 4 1 it was replaced by the macintosh 512ke and the macintosh plus all support for the mac 512k was discontinued on september 1 1998 like the macintosh 128k before it the 512k contained a motorola 68000 connected to a 512 kb dram by a 16 bit data bus though the memory had been quadrupled it could not be upgraded the large increase earned it the nickname fat mac a 64 kb rom chip boosts the effective memory to 576 kb but this is offset by the display s 22 kb framebuffer which is shared with the dma video controller this shared arrangement reduces cpu performance by up to 35 it shared a revised logic board with the re badged macintosh 128k

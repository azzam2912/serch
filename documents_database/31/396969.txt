he was born at hirschberg in silesia became a mining official at breslau in 1794 and in 1800 was appointed assessor to the department of mines and chemist to the royal porcelain factory at berlin where he died he is known for introducing the term stoichiometry to him belongs the merit of carrying out some of the earliest determinations of the quantities by weight in which acids saturate bases and bases acids and of arriving at the conception that those amounts of different bases which can saturate the same quantity of a particular acid are equivalent to each other see titration he was thus led to conclude that chemistry is a branch of applied mathematics and to endeavour to trace a law according to which the quantities of different bases required to saturate a given acid formed an arithmetical progression and the quantities of acids saturating a given base a geometric progression evidence for the existence of atoms was the law of definite proportions proposed by him in 1792 richter found that the ratio by weight of the compounds consumed in a chemical reaction was always the same it took 615 parts by weight of magnesia mgo for example to

depending on how easily the disease spreads contacts who could have been infected might include family neighbours and friends several layers of contacts may be vaccinated the contacts the contacts contacts the contact s contacts contacts etc ring vaccination thus requires contact tracing figuring out who a person is likely to infect or have infected this can be difficult in some cases it is preferable to vaccinate everyone within the area in which people have fallen ill geographically targeted reactive vaccination if there is a tight geographic community boundary it may be preferable to vaccinate the entire community in which the illness has appeared rather than explicitly tracing contacts many vaccines take several weeks to induce immunity and thus do not provide immediate protection however even if some of the ill person s contacts are already infected ring vaccination can prevent the virus from being transmitted again to the ill contacts contacts a few vaccines can protect even if they are given just after infection ring vaccination is somewhat more effective for vaccines providing this post exposure prophylaxis when responding to a possible outbreak health officials should consider which is best ring vaccination or mass vaccination in some outbreaks it

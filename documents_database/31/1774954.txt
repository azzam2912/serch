the isotopic ratios of radionuclides are used to get an accurate measurement for the elemental analysis of a sample singly charged ions of the sample are formed by the thermal ionization effect a chemically purified liquid sample is placed on a metal filament which is then heated to evaporate the solvent the removal of an electron from the purified sample is consequently achieved by heating the filament enough to release an electron which then ionizes the atoms of the sample tims utilizes a magnetic sector mass analyzer to separate the ions based on their mass to charge ratio the ions gain velocity by an electrical potential gradient and are focused into a beam by electrostatic lenses the ion beam then passes through the magnetic field of the electromagnet where it is partitioned into separate ion beams based on the ion s mass charge ratio these mass resolved beams are directed into a detector where it is converted into voltage the voltage detected is then used to calculate the isotopic ratio the filaments used are made from tantalum ta tungsten w platinum pt or rhenium re conventionally there are two filaments used in tims one filament is for the sample and

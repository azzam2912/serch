the only mandatory inputs in terms of variable gases are water vapor and ozone the range of temperatures and water vapour concentrations over which the optical depth computations are valid depends on the training datasets which were used crtm contains forward tangent linear adjoint and k full jacobian matrices versions of the model the latter three modules are used in inversion methods including variational assimilation and satellite retrievals one of several applications of crtm are retrievals of brightness temperature and sea surface temperature from advanced very high resolution radiometer sensor chen y f weng y han and q liu 2008 validation of the community radiative transfer model crtm by using cloudsat data j geophys res 113 d8 2156 2202 ding shouguo ping yang fuzhong weng quanhua liu yong han paul van delst jun li and bryan baum 2011 validation of the community radiative transfer model journal of quantitative spectroscopy and radiative transfer 112 6 1050 1064

it was released in august 1990 as the lead off single from his debut album a thousand winding roads home rose to the top of all three major country format charts that were in existence at the time billboard radio records now known as mediabase 24 7 and the now defunct gavin report marking the first time in chart history that a country singer s debut single had done so it also peaked at number 1 on the canadian rpm country tracks chart diffie said the song stirred strong emotions i think everybody related to it regardless of whether they were raised in the country or city because everybody has a home in their memory a music video did not accompany the song which was highly unusual for a hit record in the 1990s diffie told the chicago tribune that the decision happened by design we told people in radio that we wanted them to have the first shot at the music and i think they were appreciative of that

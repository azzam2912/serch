usually the term is used to refer to chemicals that are not carcinogenic on their own such that an equivalent amount of the chemical is insufficient to initiate carcinogenesis a chemical can be co carcinogenic with other chemicals or with nonchemical carcinogens such as uv radiation for example sodium arsenite can be administered to mice at a low enough concentration that it does not cause tumors on its own but it increases the rate of formation and size of tumors formed after uv exposure a chemical may act as a co carcinogen even if it does not cause direct dna damage such as mutation as long as it can affect a cancer related pathway an example of this category includes chemicals within the phorbol ester family which mimic a native signalling molecule this ester is not mutagenic but can increase the rate of cancer by promoting cell growth a traditional hallmark of cancer a chemical may both have anti carcinogenic properties and yet still be a co carcinogen in combination with some carcinogens additionally the carcinogenic modifying ability of a chemical can often be dose dependent where low doses of the compound produce beneficial or at least non harmful results

in 1915 santiago ramon y cajal mapped the neural connections of the optic lobes of a fly finding that these resembled those of vertebrates in 1978 edward b lewis helped to found evolutionary developmental biology discovering that homeotic genes regulated embryonic development in fruit flies in 1997 the term deep homology first appeared in a paper by neil shubin cliff tabin and sean b carroll describing the apparent relatedness in genetic regulatory apparatuses which indicated evolutionary similarities in disparate animal features whereas ordinary homology is seen in the pattern of structures such as limb bones of mammals that are evidently related deep homology can apply to groups of animals that have quite dissimilar anatomy vertebrates with endoskeletons made of bone and cartilage and arthropods with exoskeletons made of chitin nevertheless have limbs that are constructed using similar recipes or algorithms within the metazoa homeotic genes control differentiation along major body axes and pax genes especially pax6 help to control the development of the eye and other sensory organs the deep homology applies across widely separated groups such as in the eyes of mammals and the structurally quite different compound eyes of insects similarly hox genes help to form an animal

the octahedral cells correspond with the cells of a 24 cell and its dual e l elte identified it in 1912 as a semiregular polytope the cartesian coordinates of the runcinated 24 cell having edge length 2 is given by all permutations of sign and coordinates of the permutations of the second set of coordinates coincide with the vertices of an inscribed cantellated tesseract the regular skew polyhedron 4 8 3 exists in 4 space with 8 square around each vertex in a zig zagging nonplanar vertex figure these square faces can be seen on the runcinated 24 cell using all 576 edges and 288 vertices the 384 triangular faces of the runcinated 24 cell can be seen as removed the dual regular skew polyhedron 8 4 3 is similarly related to the octagonal faces of the bitruncated 24 cell the runcitruncated 24 cell or prismatorhombated icositetrachoron is a uniform 4 polytope derived from the 24 cell it is bounded by 24 truncated octahedra corresponding with the cells of a 24 cell 24 rhombicuboctahedra corresponding with the cells of the dual 24 cell 96 triangular prisms and 96 hexagonal prisms the cartesian coordinates of an origin centered runcitruncated 24 cell

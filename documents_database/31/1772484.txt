it was introduced by given any finite flat commutative group scheme g over s its cartier dual is the group of characters defined as the functor that takes any s scheme t to the abelian group of group scheme homomorphisms from the base change formula 1 to formula 2 and any map of s schemes to the canonical map of character groups this functor is representable by a finite flat s group scheme and cartier duality forms an additive involutive antiequivalence from the category of finite flat commutative s group schemes to itself if g is a constant commutative group scheme then its cartier dual is the diagonalizable group d g and vice versa if s is affine then the duality functor is given by the duality of the hopf algebras of functions a finite commutative group scheme over a field corresponds to a finite dimensional commutative cocommutative hopf algebra cartier duality corresponds to taking the dual of the hopf algebra exchanging the multiplication and comultipication the definition of cartier dual extends usefully to much more general situations where the resulting functor on schemes is no longer represented as a group scheme common cases include fppf sheaves of commutative groups

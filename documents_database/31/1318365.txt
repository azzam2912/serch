it identifies the set of components recommended for use in enterprise engineering this framework was developed in the 1990s by a joint task force of both the international federation of automatic control ifac and the international federation of information processing fip on enterprise architectures for enterprise integration the development started with the evaluation of then existing frameworks for enterprise application integration which was developed into an overall definition of a so called generalised architecture one of the basics of geram is that enterprise modelling was seen as the major issue in enterprise engineering and integration it contained several of building blocks in which the methodologies and the corresponding languages have been implemented such as the building blocks where designed to support the modelling process by providing means for more efficient modelling the resulting enterprise model em represents all or part of the enterprise operation these models will allow simulation of operational alternatives and thereby their evaluation leading geram provides a generic description of all the elements recommended in enterprise engineering and integration generalised enterprise reference architecture and methodology geram is an enterprise reference architecture that models the whole life history of an enterprise integration project from its initial concept in

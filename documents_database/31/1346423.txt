the genus name is derived from the nearby town of elfridia and the species name e bulbidens is with respect to the bulbous teeth of the animal bulbi for bulbous and dens for tooth it is one of the oldest known microsaurs and one of the few from the american southwest region the holotype of elfridia is a left mandible several other tooth bearing fragments and isolated postcranial elements are assigned to this taxon it is diagnosed by having lingually recurved tips of the teeth that are positioned asymmetrically on the labial portion there are nine to ten teeth on the mandible with a greatly enlarged tooth along the mid length of the tooth row thayer placed elridia within the gymnarthridae but the fragmentary nature of the material has precluded its incorporation into a phylogenetic analysis to more thoroughly test and to evaluate its relationships with other microsaurs he compared it to both euryodus and cardiocephalus noting a mixture of features shared between the two gymnarthrids such as the enlarged tooth shared with euryodus primus and striations on the teeth shared with cardiocephalus

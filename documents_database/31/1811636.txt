the order of a bramble is the smallest size of a hitting set a set of vertices of g that has a nonempty intersection with each of the subgraphs brambles may be used to characterize the treewidth of g a haven of order k in a graph g is a function that maps each set x of fewer than k vertices to a connected component of g x in such a way that every two subsets x and y touch each other thus the set of images of forms a bramble in g with order k conversely every bramble may be used to determine a haven for each set x of size smaller than the order of the bramble there is a unique connected component x that contains all of the subgraphs in the bramble that are disjoint from x as seymour and thomas showed the order of a bramble or equivalently of a haven characterizes treewidth a graph has a bramble of order k if and only if it has treewidth at least expander graphs of bounded degree have treewidth proportional to their number of vertices and therefore also have brambles of linear order however as martin grohe and

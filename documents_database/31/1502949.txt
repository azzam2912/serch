it is a pastiche or remaking of a well known photographic portrait of john lennon and yoko ono that was made by annie leibovitz a few hours before lennon s murder the photo made a splash in the british art scene in 1993 the work was exhibited as part of the exhibition brilliant held at the walker art center minneapolis usa in 1995 in his 2001 book high art lite art historian julian stallabrass states that the bond taylor wood version offers a reversal of gender roles however the original also has lennon and ono in the same position stallabrass also states that the work refers to na ve 1960s idealism though not entirely mockingly rather asking the viewer to contrast the situation in the 1990s with the 1960s for such artists it is clear we are living in a time of the twilight of ideals commenting on the photo work in 2010 taylor wood said the bizarre thing is that i d completely forgotten about that piece until it was brought up in an interview i don t remember what drove us to make it must have been high concept in there somewhere but god knows what it was

when the surface of a lava tube cools it forms a hardened lid that contains the ongoing lava flow beneath the surface in a conduit shaped passage once the flow of lava diminishes the tunnel may drain forming a hollow void lunar lava tubes are formed on surfaces that have a slope that ranges in angle from 0 4 to 6 5 lunar lava tubes may be as wide as before they become unstable against gravitational collapse however stable tubes may still be disrupted by seismic events or meteoroid bombardment the existence of a lava tube is sometimes revealed by the presence of a skylight a place in which the roof of the tube has collapsed leaving a circular hole that can be observed by lunar orbiters an area displaying a lava tube and rilles is the marius hills region in 2008 an opening to a lava tube in this area may have been discovered by the japanese kaguya spacecraft the skylight was photographed in more detail in 2011 by the lunar reconnaissance orbiter showing both the 65 meter wide pit and the floor of the cave about 36 meters below the hadley rille may have been a partly roofed

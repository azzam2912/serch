human spaceflight often requires astronaut crews to endure long periods without rest studies have shown that lack of sleep can cause fatigue that leads to errors while performing critical tasks also individuals who are fatigued often cannot determine the degree of their impairment astronauts and ground crews frequently suffer from the effects of sleep deprivation and circadian rhythm disruption fatigue due to sleep loss sleep shifting and work overload could cause performance errors that put space flight participants at risk of compromising mission objectives as well as the health and safety of those on board sleeping in space requires that astronauts sleep in a crew cabin a small room about the size of a shower stall they lie in a sleeping bag which is strapped to the wall astronauts have reported having nightmares dreams and snoring while sleeping in space sleeping and crew accommodations need to be well ventilated otherwise astronauts can wake up oxygen deprived and gasping for air because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads brain cells are extremely sensitive to a lack of oxygen and brain cells can start dying less than 5 minutes after their oxygen supply disappears the

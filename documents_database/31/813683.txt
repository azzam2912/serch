thus the mgo content of a metamorphosed ultramafic rock can be estimated roughly by understanding the mineral assemblage of the rock magnesium content determines the proportion of talc and or magnesite and aluminium calcium sodium content determines the proportion of amphibole and or chlorite several minerals are diagnostic of talc carbonated ultramafic rocks at amphibolite facies the diopside in isograd is reached dependent on carbon dioxide partial pressure and metamorphic assemblages trend toward talc pyroxene and eventually toward metamorphic olivine serpentinisation of olivine or by addition of aqueous silica carbonation of serpentine to form talc magnesite because carbon dioxide is such a common component of metamorphic fluids talc carbonated ultramafics are relatively common however the degree of talc carbonation is usually somewhere between the two end member compositions of pure serpentinite and pure talc carbonate it is common to see serpentinites which contain talc amphibole and chloritic minerals in small proportions which infer the presence of carbon dioxide in the metamorphic fluid talc carbonate is present in many of the ultramafic bodies of the archaean yilgarn craton western australia notably the widgiemooltha komatiite shows pure talc carbonation on the eastern flank of the widgeimooltha dome and almost pure serpentinite metamorphism

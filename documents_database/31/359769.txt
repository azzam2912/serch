it was published by nigel horspool in 1980 it is a simplification of the boyer moore string search algorithm which is related to the knuth morris pratt algorithm the algorithm trades space for time in order to obtain an average case complexity of o n on random text although it has o nm in the worst case where the length of the pattern is m and the length of the search string is n like boyer moore boyer moore horspool preprocesses the pattern to produce a table containing for each symbol in the alphabet the number of characters that can safely be skipped the preprocessing phase in pseudocode is as follows for an alphabet of 256 symbols i e bytes pattern search proceeds as follows the procedure reports the index of the first occurrence of in the algorithm performs best with long needle strings when it consistently hits a non matching character at or near the final byte of the current position in the haystack and the final byte of the needle does not occur elsewhere within the needle for instance a 32 byte needle ending in z searching through a 255 byte haystack which does not have a z

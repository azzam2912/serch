gravimetry may be used when either the magnitude of gravitational field or the properties of matter responsible for its creation are of interest gravity is usually measured in units of acceleration in the si system of units the standard unit of acceleration is 1 metre per second squared abbreviated as m s other units include the gal sometimes known as a galileo in either case with symbol gal which equals 1 centimetre per second squared and the g g equal to 9 80665 m s the value of the g approximately equals the acceleration due to gravity at the earth s surface although the value of g varies by location an instrument used to measure gravity is known as a gravimeter for a small body general relativity predicts gravitational effects indistinguishable from the effects of acceleration by the equivalence principle thus gravimeters can be regarded as special purpose accelerometers many weighing scales may be regarded as simple gravimeters in one common form a spring is used to counteract the force of gravity pulling on an object the change in length of the spring may be calibrated to the force required to balance the gravitational pull the resulting measurement may be

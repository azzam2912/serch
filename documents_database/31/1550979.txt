a gamma ray burst is a highly luminous flash associated with an explosion in a distant galaxy and producing gamma rays the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation and often followed by a longer lived afterglow emitted at longer wavelengths x ray ultraviolet optical infrared and radio grb 030329 was the first burst whose afterglow definitively exhibited characteristics of a supernova confirming the existence of a relationship between the two phenomena grb 030329 was one of three gamma ray bursts detected on 29 march 2003 the other two were labeled grb 030329a and grb 030329b grb 030329 was detected by multiple instruments onboard hete at 11 37 utc and lasted approximately 25 seconds the burst s optical afterglow was first observed from siding spring observatory less than two hours after the burst had been detected the x ray afterglow was first detected by rxte approximately five hours after the burst the radio afterglow was first detected by the very large array and at the time of its discovery was the brightest radio afterglow ever observed the burst was located at a sky position of r a dec and had a redshift of z 0 1685 corresponding to a distance of

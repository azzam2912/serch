this class of random number generator is aimed at being an improvement on the standard linear congruential generator these are based on a generalisation of the fibonacci sequence the fibonacci sequence may be described by the recurrence relation hence the new term is the sum of the last two terms in the sequence this can be generalised to the sequence in which case the new term is some combination of any two previous terms m is usually a power of 2 m 2 often 2 or 2 the formula 3 operator denotes a general binary operation this may be either addition subtraction multiplication or the bitwise arithmetic exclusive or operator xor the theory of this type of generator is rather complex and it may not be sufficient simply to choose random values for j and k these generators also tend to be very sensitive to initialisation generators of this type employ k words of state they remember the last k values if the operation used is addition then the generator is described as an additive lagged fibonacci generator or alfg if multiplication is used it is a multiplicative lagged fibonacci generator or mlfg and if the xor operation is used

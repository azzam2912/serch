it transfers fluid by means of the progress through the pump of a sequence of small fixed shape discrete cavities as its rotor is turned this leads to the volumetric flow rate being proportional to the rotation rate bidirectionally and to low levels of shearing being applied to the pumped fluid a common misconception among laymen is that the progressive cavity pump is a simple auger this type of pump is by no means an auger this misconception is usually caused by a lack of understanding of the basic principles of pump operation these pumps have application in fluid metering and pumping of viscous or shear sensitive materials the cavities taper down toward their ends and overlap as one cavity diminishes another increases the net flow amount has minimal variation as the total displacement is equal this design results in a flow with little to no pulse it is common for equipment to be referred to by the specific manufacturer or product names hence names can vary from industry to industry and even regionally examples include moineau after the inventor the original 4 manufacturing licenses were issued to moyno pump americas mono pump uk europe gardier belgium and pcm all

kilometers or pounds vs kilograms and tracking these dimensions as calculations or comparisons are performed the conversion of units from one dimensional unit to another is often somewhat complex dimensional analysis or more specifically the factor label method also known as the unit factor method is a widely used technique for such conversions using the rules of algebra the concept of physical dimension was introduced by joseph fourier in 1822 physical quantities that are of the same kind also called commensurable e g length or time or mass have the same dimension and can be directly compared to other physical quantities of the same kind i e length or time or mass resp even if they are originally expressed in differing units of measure such as yards and meters if physical quantities have different dimensions such as length vs mass they cannot be expressed in terms of similar units and cannot be compared in quantity also called incommensurable for example asking whether a kilogram is larger than an hour is meaningless any physically meaningful equation and any inequality will have the same dimensions on its left and right sides a property known as dimensional homogeneity checking for dimensional homogeneity is

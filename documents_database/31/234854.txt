excipients can also be useful in the manufacturing process to aid in the handling of the active substance concerns such as by facilitating powder flowability or non stick properties in addition to aiding in vitro stability such as prevention of denaturation or aggregation over the expected shelf life the selection of appropriate excipients also depends upon the route of administration and the dosage form as well as the active ingredient and other factors a comprehensive classification system based on structure property application relationships has been proposed for excipients used in parenteral medications pharmaceutical regulations and standards require that all ingredients in drugs as well as their chemical decomposition products be identified and shown to be safe often more excipient is found in a final drug formulation than active ingredient and practically all marketed drugs contain excipients as with new drug substances and dosage forms thereof novel excipients themselves can be patented sometimes however a particular formulation involving them is kept as a trade secret instead if not easily reverse engineered the federation of international pharmaceutical excipients council ipec a pharmaceutical regulatory non profit develops implements and promotes global use of appropriate quality safety and functionality standards for pharmaceutical excipients and

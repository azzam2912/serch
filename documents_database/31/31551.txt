the pore is bordered by a pair of specialized parenchyma cells known as guard cells that are responsible for regulating the size of the stomatal opening the term is usually used collectively to refer to the entire stomatal complex consisting of the paired guard cells and the pore itself which is referred to as the stomatal aperture air enters the plant through these openings by gaseous diffusion and contains carbon dioxide which is used in photosynthesis and oxygen which is used in respiration oxygen produced as a by product of photosynthesis diffuses out to the atmosphere through these same openings also water vapor diffuses through the stomata into the atmosphere in a process called transpiration stomata are present in the sporophyte generation of all land plant groups except liverworts in vascular plants the number size and distribution of stomata varies widely dicotyledons usually have more stomata on the lower surface of the leaves than the upper surface monocotyledons such as onion oat and maize may have about the same number of stomata on both leaf surfaces in plants with floating leaves stomata may be found only on the upper epidermis and submerged leaves may lack stomata entirely most tree species

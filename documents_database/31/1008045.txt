it is defined as the distance between chromosome positions also termed loci or markers for which the expected average number of intervening chromosomal crossovers in a single generation is 0 01 it is often used to infer distance along a chromosome however it is not a true physical distance the number of base pairs to which it corresponds varies widely across the genome different regions of a chromosome have different propensities towards crossover and it also depends on whether the meiosis in which the crossing over takes place is a part of oogenesis formation of female gametes or spermatogenesis formation of male gametes one centimorgan corresponds to about 1 million base pairs in humans on average the relationship is only rough as the physical chromosomal distance corresponding to one centimorgan varies from place to place in the genome and also varies between men and women since recombination during gamete formation in females is significantly more frequent than in males morton et al calculated that the female genome is 4782 cm long while the male genome is only 2809 cm long plasmodium falciparum has an average recombination distance of 15 kb per centimorgan markers separated by 15 kb of dna 15

the deterioration of meat flavor is most noticeable upon reheating as cooking and subsequent refrigeration is the case with most convenience foods containing meat it is a significant challenge to the processed food industry the flavor is variously described as rancid stale and like cardboard and even compared to damp dog hair warmed over flavor is caused by the oxidative decomposition of lipids fatty substances in the meat into chemicals short chain aldehydes or ketones which have an unpleasant taste or odor this decomposition process begins after cooking or processing and is aided by the release of naturally occurring iron in the meat the appearance of warmed over flavor begins as lipids primarily lipids from the cell membrane of cells in the meat are attacked by oxygen this process is aided by the release of iron from iron containing proteins in the meat including myoglobin and hemoglobin the iron is released by the heat of cooking or by mechanical grinding the free iron then acts as a catalyst or promoter of oxidation reactions the reactions break down some of the fats in the meat to form primary oxidation products these chemicals are not directly responsible for the objectionable taste instead

these groups are further condensed in many applications to give highly crosslinked insoluble polysiloxane networks when r is methyl the four possible functional siloxane monomeric units are described as follows note that a network of only q groups becomes fused quartz the most abundant silicone resins are built of d and t units dt resins or from m and q units mq resins however many other combinations mdt mtq qdt are also used in industry silicone resins represent a broad range of products materials of molecular weight in the range of 1000 10 000 are very useful in pressure sensitive adhesives silicone rubbers coatings and additives polysiloxane polymers with reactive side group functionality such as vinyl acrylate epoxy mercaptan or amine are used to create thermoset polymer matrix composites coatings and adhesives silicone resins are prepared by hydrolytic condensation of various silicone precursors in early processes of preparation of silicone resins sodium silicate and various chlorosilanes were used as starting materials although the starting materials were the least expensive ones something typical for industry structural control of the product was very difficult more recently a less reactive tetraethoxysilane teos or ethyl polysilicate and various disiloxanes are used as starting materials

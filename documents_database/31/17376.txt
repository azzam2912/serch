botulinum is a diverse group of pathogenic bacteria initially grouped together by their ability to produce botulinum toxin and now known as four distinct groups c botulinum groups i iv c botulinum groups i iv as well as some strains of clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii are the bacteria responsible for producing botulinum toxin c botulinum is responsible for foodborne botulism ingestion of preformed toxin infant botulism intestinal infection with toxin forming c botulinum and wound botulism infection of a wound with c botulinum c botulinum produces heat resistant endospores that are commonly found in soil and are able to survive under adverse conditions c botulinum is commonly associated with bulging canned food bulging misshapen cans are due to an internal increase in pressure caused by gas produced by the bacteria c botulinum is a gram positive rod shaped spore forming bacterium it is an obligate anaerobe meaning that oxygen is poisonous to the cells however c botulinum tolerates traces of oxygen due to the enzyme superoxide dismutase which is an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen c botulinum is only able to produce the neurotoxin during sporulation which can only happen in an anaerobic environment

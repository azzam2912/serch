1 246 contributors used idle time slices on almost two thousand computers to make its calculations the software used for the project made use of bellard s formula a faster version of the bbp formula after setting three records calculating the five trillionth bit the forty trillionth bit and the quadrillionth bit the project ended on september 11 2000 unlike most computations of pi which compute results in base 10 pihex computed in base 2 bits because bellard s formula and the bbp formula can only be used to compute pi in base 2 the final bit strings for each of the three calculations resulted as such 0000 0111 1110 0100 0101 0111 0011 0011 1100 1100 1010 0000 1111 1001 1111 1111 0011 0111 0001 1101 1110 0110 0010 0001 0110 1011 0000 0110 1001 1100 therefore the least significant known bit of pi is 1 at position 1 000 000 000 000 060 one quadrillion sixty or formula 1 to calculate the five trillionth digit and the following seventy six digits took 13 500 cpu hours using 25 computers from 6 different countries the forty trillionth digit required 84 500 cpu hours and 126 computers from 18 different

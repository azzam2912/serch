physically these represent the paths of usually ideal particles with no proper acceleration their motion satisfying the geodesic equations because the particles are subject to no proper acceleration the geodesics generally represent the straightest path between two points in a curved spacetime on an n dimensional riemannian manifold formula 1 the geodesic equation written in a coordinate chart with coordinates formula 2 is where the coordinates x s are regarded as the coordinates of a curve s in formula 1 and formula 5 are the christoffel symbols the christoffel symbols are functions of the metric and are given by where the comma indicates a partial derivative with respect to the coordinates as the manifold has dimension formula 8 the geodesic equations are a system of formula 8 ordinary differential equations for the formula 8 coordinate variables thus allied with initial conditions the system can according to the picard lindel f theorem be solved one can also use a lagrangian approach to the problem defining and applying the euler lagrange equation as the laws of physics can be written in any coordinate system it is convenient to choose one that simplifies the geodesic equations mathematically this means a coordinate chart is

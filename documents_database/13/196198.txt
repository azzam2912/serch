in contrast to rings or algebras where one can consider quotients by free rings to construct universal objects c algebras must be realizable as algebras of bounded operators on a hilbert space by the gelfand naimark segal construction and the relations must prescribe a uniform bound on the norm of each generator this means that depending on the generators and relations a universal c algebra may not exist in particular free c algebras do not exist there are several problems with defining relations for c algebras one is as previously mentioned due to the non existence of free c algebras not every relation defines a c algebra another problem is that one would often want to include order relations formulas involving continuous functional calculus and spectral data as relations for that reason we use a relatively roundabout way of defining c algebra relations the basic motivation behind the following definitions is that we will define relations as the category of their representations given a set x the null c relation on x is the category formula 1 with objects consisting of pairs j a where a is a c algebra and j is a function from x to a and

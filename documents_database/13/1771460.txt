its length measures 6 7 mm the 2 whorls of the protoconch are small they form a moderately elevated spire whose axis is at right angles to that of the succeeding turns in the first of which it is about one fourth immersed the nine whorls of the teleoconch are flattened in the middle they have a sloping shoulder that extends over the posterior fourth between the sutures and renders the whorls slightly angulated at their anterior margin they are weakly contracted at the suture they are marked by moderately strong well rounded low retractive axial ribs of which 24 occur upon the first 26 upon the second and third and 24 upon the remaining turns the intercostal spaces are a little more than double the width of the ribs they are marked by pits and incised spiral lines of these the one at the periphery and the one at the anterior termination of the posterior third between the sutures are of equal width and much wider than the rest two other pits a little less strong divide the space between the two strong pits into three segments the middle one of which is a trifle wider than the other

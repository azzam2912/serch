lara will monitor the doppler frequency shift of a radio signal traveling between the martian lander and the earth these doppler measurements will be used to precisely observe the orientation and rotation of mars leading to a better knowledge of the internal structure of the planet lara will obtain coherent two way doppler measurements from the x band radio link between the exomars 2020 surface platform and large antennas on earth like those of the deep space network the relative radial velocity between the earth and the martian lander is inferred from doppler shifts measured at the earth ground stations masers at the earth s ground stations ensure the frequency stability v ronique dehant scientist at the royal observatory of belgium is the principal investigator of the experiment antwerp space n v a subsidiary of ohb se is the manufacturer of the lara instrument the main parts of the transponder are the coherent detector the transmitter with the solid state power amplifier the micro controller unit the receiver and the power supply unit the allan deviation quantifying the frequency stability of the signal of the measurements is expected to be lower than formula 1at 60 second integration time the lara

in a narrower sense one speaks of a class logic only if classes are described by a property of their elements this class logic is thus a generalization of set theory which allows only a limited consideration of classes the first class logic in the strict sense was created by giuseppe peano in 1889 as the basis for his arithmetic peano axioms he introduced the class term which formally correctly describes classes through a property of their elements today the class term is denoted in the form x a x where a x is an arbitrary statement which all class members x meet peano axiomatized the class term for the first time and used it fully gottlob frege also tried establishing the arithmetic logic with class terms in 1893 bertrand russell discovered a conflict in it in 1902 which became known as russell s paradox as a result it became generally known that you can not safely use class terms to solve the problem russell developed his type theory from 1903 to 1908 which allowed only a very much restricted use of class terms in the long term she not prevailed but but more comfortable and more powerful 1907 initiated

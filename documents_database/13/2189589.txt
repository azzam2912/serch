by adjusting the strength of the beam current the brightness of the light produced by the phosphor on the screen can be varied the cathode ray tube allowed the development of all electronic television electromagnetic deflection yokes are also used in certain radar displays another way of deflecting an electron beam is to put two pairs of electrodes inside the crt after the electron gun structure electrostatic deflection is common in oscilloscope displays because it is easier to drive deflection plates at high frequencies compared to driving the large inductance of a deflection yoke compared with electrostatic deflection magnetic deflection has fewer obstructions inside the tube and so allows for a larger diameter electron beam producing a brighter image this is an advantage for a raster scan display which must cover the whole screen instead of one narrow trace as in an oscilloscope additionally magnetic deflection can be arranged to give a larger angle of deflection than electrostatic plates this makes the crt and resulting television receiver more compact the angle of magnetic deflection for a given deflection current is inversely proportional to the square root of the crt accelerating voltage but in electrostatic deflection the angle is inversely proportional

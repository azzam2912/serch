they burned kerosene fuel and hydrogen peroxide their construction was based on a common combustion chamber design used either singly or in clusters of up to eight they were developed by armstrong siddeley in coventry which later became bristol siddeley in 1959 and finally rolls royce in 1966 engine static testing was carried out at high down rocket test site near the needles on the isle of wight spadeadam in cumbria wasn t used for testing until blue streak after gamma use of kerosene hydrogen peroxide engines has been a particularly british trait in rocket development there being few comparable engines such as the lr 40 from the usa the combustion of kerosene with hydrogen peroxide is given by the formula where ch is the approximate formula of kerosene see rp 1 for a discussion of kerosene rocket fuels this compares with the combustion of kerosene and liquid oxygen lox showing that the exhaust from kerosene peroxide is predominantly water this results in a very clean exhaust second only to cryogenic lo lh and a distinctive clear flame the low molecular mass of water also helps to increase rocket thrust performance the oxidiser used with gamma was 85 high test

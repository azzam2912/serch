they were introduced by who named them crystals because in some sense they are rigid and grow in particular quasicoherent crystals over the crystalline site are analogous to quasicoherent modules over a scheme there are several variations of crystals as follows the infinitesimal site inf x s has as objects the infinitesimal extensions of open sets of x if x is a scheme over s then the sheaf o is defined by o t coordinate ring of t where we write t as an abbreviation for an object u t of inf x s sheaves on this site grow in the sense that they can be extended from open sets to infinitesimal extensions of open sets a crystal on the site inf x s is a sheaf f of o modules that is rigid in the following sense this is similar to the definition of a quasicoherent sheaf of modules in the zariski topology an example of a crystal is the sheaf o crystals on the crystalline site are defined in a similar way in general if e is a fibered category over f then a crystal is a cartesian section of the fibered category in the special case when

the glacier lies on the exposed north facing slopes in the upper blaueis cirque nestling between the rock faces of the blaueisspitze 2480 m hochkalter 2607 m and kleinkalter 2513 m which ring the glacier in a horseshoe shape because of its relatively low elevation the blaueis has been particularly affected by glacial retreat which is common amongst alpine glaciers since the mid 1980s rocks in the middle of the blaueis have become increasingly free of snow and the upper part of the glacier is now more or less completely separated from the lower field of what is now dead ice the thickness of the ice as determined by ground penetrating radar was only up to 13 feet in 2007 and the average thickness of the ice was less than four metres giving a volume of around 0 4 million m this means that the remaining ice mass is smaller than the mass lost in the last decade of the 20th century the base for ascents of the glacier is the blaueis hut at 1 680 m high in the blaueis cirque below the glacier the hut may be reached from ramsau or hintersee in just over three hours walking

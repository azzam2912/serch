it is represented by two nearly complete skeletons and a crushed skull preserved in the limestone qianosuchus was at least 3 metres long and had several skeletal adaptations which indicate a semi marine lifestyle similar to modern day saltwater crocodiles these adaptations have not been seen in any other archosaur from the triassic qianosuchus had a skull around 33 cm 13 inches long with an elongated snout the rostrum formed by the premaxilla is shallow at the front of the skull but deepens posteriorly each premaxilla has nine long teeth and the maxillae bear eighteen teeth each all the teeth are laterally compressed curved backwards and serrated like those of most other carnivorous archosaurs the nares are expanded and elongated and almost collide with the antorbital fenestrae meaning that the septum bony wall between them is thin and lightweight unusually the jugal forms no part of the border of the antorbital fenestra each orbit had a large and well developed sclerotic ring in it which would have reinforced the eyeball under pressure when qianosuchus was diving the frontal bones have deep fossae depressions on their upper surface which stretch backwards to the sutures with the parietals another such fossa is

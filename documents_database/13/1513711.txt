in other words the smallest closed invariant subset containing x is the whole space such an x is then called hypercyclic vector there is no hypercyclic operator in finite dimensional spaces but the property of hypercyclicity in spaces of infinite dimension is not a rare phenomenon many operators are hypercyclic the hypercyclicity is a special case of broader notions of topological transitivity see topological mixing and universality universality in general involves a set of mappings from one topological space to another instead of a sequence of powers of a single operator mapping from x to x but has a similar meaning to hypercyclicity examples of universal objects were discovered already in 1914 by julius p l in 1935 by j zef marcinkiewicz or maclane in 1952 however it was not until the 1980s when hypercyclic operators started to be more intensively studied an example of a hypercyclic operator is two times the backward shift operator on the sequence space that is the operator which takes a sequence to a sequence this was proved in 1969 by rolewicz

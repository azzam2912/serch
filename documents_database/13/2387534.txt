it was the pilot for a proposed tv series starring savalas which did not eventuate but was screened as a stand alone film it was directed by leo penn filming was to have began on 27 february 1980 but was pushed back reportedly to iron out script problems i know some people are thinking it s a pilot said savalas at the time i didn t think that way i made a two hour movie but doing it as a series would be different kojak was easy because i was playing telly for the most part it was a role i could ad lib although i could play a credible lawyer i know nothing about the law i d be more dependent on the scriptwriters savalas said if the series went ahead he would want to make the character come from new york rather than philadelphia telly s from new york and if you do a series you want to make it comfortable for the actor it d have to be close to my roots so i wouldn t have to worry about my speech pattern in december of 1980 approximately three months before the telefilm aired jove books released

the most common crown ethers are cyclic oligomers of ethylene oxide the repeating unit being ethyleneoxy i e chcho important members of this series are the tetramer n 4 the pentamer n 5 and the hexamer n 6 the term crown refers to the resemblance between the structure of a crown ether bound to a cation and a crown sitting on a person s head the first number in a crown ether s name refers to the number of atoms in the cycle and the second number refers to the number of those atoms that are oxygen crown ethers are much broader than the oligomers of ethylene oxide an important group are derived from catechol crown ethers strongly bind certain cations forming complexes the oxygen atoms are well situated to coordinate with a cation located at the interior of the ring whereas the exterior of the ring is hydrophobic the resulting cations often form salts that are soluble in nonpolar solvents and for this reason crown ethers are useful in phase transfer catalysis the denticity of the polyether influences the affinity of the crown ether for various cations for example 18 crown 6 has high affinity for potassium cation 15

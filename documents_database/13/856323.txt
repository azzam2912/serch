an isotropic line occurs only with an isotropic quadratic form and never with a definite quadratic form using complex geometry edmond laguerre first suggested the existence of two isotropic lines through the point that depend on the imaginary unit laguerre then interpreted these lines as geodesics in the complex projective plane points are represented by homogeneous coordinates formula 3 and lines by homogeneous coordinates formula 4 an isotropic line in the complex projective plane satisfies the equation in terms of the affine subspace an isotropic line through the origin is in projective geometry the isotropic lines are the ones passing through the circular points at infinity in the real orthogonal geometry of emil artin isotropic lines occur in pairs isotropic lines have been used in cosmological writing to carry light for example in a mathematical encyclopedia light consists of photons the worldline of a zero rest mass such as a non quantum model of a photon and other elementary particles of mass zero is an isotropic line for isotropic lines through the origin a particular point is a null vector and the collection of all such isotropic lines forms the light cone at the origin lie cartan expanded the concept

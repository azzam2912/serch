the full gene spans 62 533 base pairs bp eleven exons are transcribe in the protein coding mrna there is a second less prevalent transcript variant of nhlrc2 this non coding isoform is 522 bp of retained intron the translated nhlrc2 protein is 726 amino acids long in humans and has a molecular weight of 79 442 59 g mol it has been found in the cytosol mitochondria and or peroxisomes of cells in which it is expressed nhlrc2 is a part of the nhl repeat superfamily of n bladed beta propellers specifically nhlrc2 is a 6 bladed beta propeller the nhl repeat is found in many eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins and is associated with growth factor regulators the function of nhlrc2 is not yet fully understood using bioinformatic analysis a yvad motif was found to be conserved in eukaryotes bacteria and archaea yvad shows up three times alone in the human nhlrc2 protein this motif is potential involved in inhibiting caspases 1 2 3 4 5 thus possibly having anti apoptotic properties according to ncbi geo microarray expression patterns as well as unigene s expressed sequence tag est profiles nhlrc2 is expressed at low levels throughout most human tissues

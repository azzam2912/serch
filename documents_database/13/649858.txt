rpzds may also be known as reduced pressure principle rp reduced pressure principle backflow prevention devices reduced pressure zone assemblies rpza or reduced pressure principle assembly rppa backflow preventers are categorized into three groupings an assembly a device or a method with the exception of elimination these are the only ways one can control backflow from taking place the eight 8 named backflow assemblies all have two resilient seated isolation shut off valves with properly located test ports these assemblies have the distinct advantage of being in line serviceable and can be tested repaired without having to remove an installed assembly special accredited courses are given to test repair backflow assemblies and only certified testers may test backflow assemblies there are approximately fifteen 15 devices related to backflow which cannot be tested as they do not have isolation valves or test ports and there are no standards test procedures set in place to test for any device this is what sets apart an assembly from a device an assembly is testable a device is not lastly an air gap or barometric loop are methods to prevent backflow from taking place these are also non testable a rpzd is considered suitable

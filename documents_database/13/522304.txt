2001 mangroves salt marshes and seagrass are typical nursery habitats for a range of marine species some species will use nonvegetated sites such as yellow eyed mullet blue sprat and flounder the nursery habitat hypothesis states that the contribution per unit area of a nursery habitat is greater than for other habitats used by juveniles for the species productivity may be measured by density survival growth and movement to adult habitat beck et al 2001 there are two general models for the location of juvenile habitats within the total range for a species which reflect life history strategies of the species these are the classic concept juveniles and adults in separate habitats juveniles migrate to adult habitat general concept overlap of juvenile and adult habitats some marine species do not have juvenile habitats e g arthropods and scallops commonly fish ells some lobsters blue crabs and so forth do have distinct juvenile habitats whether with or without overlap with adult habitats in terms of management use of the nursery role hypothesis may be limiting as it excludes some potentially important nursery sites in these cases the effective juvenile habitat concept may be more useful this defines a nursery as that

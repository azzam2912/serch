it therefore has an inclination of or very close to 90 degrees to the body s equator a satellite in a polar orbit will pass over the equator at a different longitude on each of its orbits polar orbits are often used for earth mapping earth observation capturing the earth as time passes from one point reconnaissance satellites as well as for some weather satellites the iridium satellite constellation also uses a polar orbit to provide telecommunications services the disadvantage to this orbit is that no one spot on the earth s surface can be sensed continuously from a satellite in a polar orbit near polar orbiting satellites commonly choose a sun synchronous orbit meaning that each successive orbital pass occurs at the same local time of day this can be particularly important for applications such as remote sensing atmospheric temperature where the most important thing to see may well be changes over time which are not aliased onto changes in local time to keep the same local time on a given pass the time period of the orbit must be kept as short as possible this is achieved by keeping the orbit lower around earth however very low orbits

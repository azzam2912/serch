it is often used as a query language for deductive databases in recent years datalog has found new application in data integration information extraction networking program analysis security and cloud computing its origins date back to the beginning of logic programming but it became prominent as a separate area around 1977 when herv gallaire and jack minker organized a workshop on logic and databases david maier is credited with coining the term datalog unlike in prolog statements of a datalog program can be stated in any order furthermore datalog queries on finite sets are guaranteed to terminate so datalog does not have prolog s cut operator this makes datalog a fully declarative language in contrast to prolog datalog query evaluation with datalog is based on first order logic and is thus sound and complete however datalog is not turing complete and is thus used as a domain specific language that can take advantage of efficient algorithms developed for query resolution indeed various methods have been proposed to efficiently perform queries e g the magic sets algorithm tabled logic programming or slg resolution some widely used database systems include ideas and algorithms developed for datalog for example the standard includes recursive

that earned clayton the nasa exceptional scientific achievement medal 1992 for theoretical astrophysics related to the formation of chemical elements in the explosions of stars and to the observable products of these explosions supernovae thereafter became the most important stellar events in astronomy owing to their profoundly radioactive nature not only did clayton discover radioactive nucleosynthesis during explosive silicon burning in stars but he also predicted a new type of astronomy based on it namely the associated gamma ray line radiation emitted by matter ejected from supernovae that paper was selected as one of the fifty most influential papers in astronomy during the twentieth century for the centennial volume of the american astronomical society he gathered support from influential astronomers and physicists for a new nasa budget item for a gamma ray observatory satellite achieving successful funding for compton gamma ray observatory with his focus on radioactive supernova gas clayton discovered a new chemical pathway causing carbon dust to condense there by a process that is activated by the radioactivity clayton s foundational ideas for five original subfields of astrophysics are detailed in section 5 below they are 1 nucleosynthesis the assembly within stars of the atomic nuclei of the

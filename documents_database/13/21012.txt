a typical example of a group object is a topological group a group whose underlying set is a topological space such that the group operations are continuous formally we start with a category c with finite products i e c has a terminal object 1 and any two objects of c have a product a group object in c is an object g of c together with morphisms such that the following properties modeled on the group axioms more precisely on the definition of a group used in universal algebra are satisfied note that this is stated in terms of maps product and inverse must be maps in the category and without any reference to underlying elements of the group object categories in general do not have elements of their objects another way to state the above is to say g is a group object in a category c if for every object x in c there is a group structure on the morphisms hom x g from x to g such that the association of x to hom x g is a contravariant functor from c to the category of groups much of group theory can be formulated in

it aims to determine whether specific proteins are associated with specific genomic regions such as transcription factors on promoters or other dna binding sites and possibly defining cistromes chip also aims to determine the specific location in the genome that various histone modifications are associated with indicating the target of the histone modifiers briefly the conventional method is as follows there are mainly two types of chip primarily differing in the starting chromatin preparation the first uses reversibly cross linked chromatin sheared by sonication called cross linked chip xchip native chip nchip uses native chromatin sheared by micrococcal nuclease digestion cross linked chip is mainly suited for mapping the dna target of transcription factors or other chromatin associated proteins and uses reversibly cross linked chromatin as starting material the agent for reversible cross linking could be formaldehyde or uv light then the cross linked chromatin is usually sheared by sonication providing fragments of 300 1000 base pairs bp in length mild formaldehyde crosslinking followed by nuclease digestion has been used to shear the chromatin chromatin fragments of 400 500bp have proven to be suitable for chip assays as they cover two to three nucleosomes cell debris in the sheared lysate

this occurs when the frame rate is greater than 10 to 12 separate images per second the illusion of motion caused by animation and film relies on beta movement the static images do not physically change but give the appearance of motion because of being rapidly changed faster than the eye can see this optical illusion is caused by the fact that the human optic nerve responds to changes in light at about 10 cycles per second so changes about double of this are registered as motion instead of being separate distinct images one example of the beta movement effect would be a set of leds as shown at the adjacent picture the leds electronically are individually controlled but our eyes and brains perceive them as a snake running clockwise around the four edges of the square picture this is also seen commonly on led displays observations of what has come to be known as beta movement go back to the 19th century in 1875 sigmund exner showed that under the right conditions people will see two quick spatially separated but stationary electrical sparks as a single moving object by 1877 eadweard muybridge had animated a sequence of photographs of

it is designed for ultraviolet 90 320 nm spectroscopy of faint point sources with a resolving power of 1 550 24 000 science goals include the study of the origins of large scale structure in the universe the formation and evolution of galaxies and the origin of stellar and planetary systems and the cold interstellar medium cos was developed and built by the center for astrophysics and space astronomy casa arl at the university of colorado at boulder and the ball aerospace and technologies corporation in boulder colorado cos is installed into the axial instrument bay previously occupied by the corrective optics space telescope axial replacement costar instrument and is intended to complement the space telescope imaging spectrograph stis that was repaired during the same mission while stis operates across a wider wavelength range cos is many times more sensitive in the uv the cosmic origins spectrograph is an ultraviolet spectrograph that is optimized for high sensitivity and moderate spectral resolution of compact point like objects stars quasars etc cos has two principal channels one for far ultraviolet fuv spectroscopy covering 90 205 nm and one for near ultraviolet nuv spectroscopy spanning 170 320 nm the fuv channel can work

the auxiliary electrode is distinct from the reference electrode which establishes the electrical potential against which other potentials may be measured and the working electrode at which the cell reaction takes place in a two electrode system either a known current or potential is applied between the working and auxiliary electrodes and the other variable may be measured the auxiliary electrode functions as a cathode whenever the working electrode is operating as an anode and vice versa the auxiliary electrode often has a surface area much larger than that of the working electrode to ensure that the half reaction occurring at the auxiliary electrode can occur fast enough so as not to limit the process at the working electrode when a three electrode cell is used to perform electroanalytical chemistry the auxiliary electrode along with the working electrode provides a circuit over which current is either applied or measured here the potential of the auxiliary electrode is usually not measured and is adjusted so as to balance the reaction occurring at the working electrode this configuration allows the potential of the working electrode to be measured against a known reference electrode without compromising the stability of that reference electrode by

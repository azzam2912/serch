hgetx1 belongs to the ktx potassium channel toxin category and is placed in the sixth subfamily of all ktx toxins where hgetx1 is the fourteenth member which gives hgetx1 its systematic name ktx 6 14 all ktx category toxins are peptides that contain between 20 to 40 amino acids and contain three or four disulfide bridges hgetx1 consists of 36 amino acids and has four disulfide bridges these disulfide bridges exist between cys1 cys5 cys2 cys6 cys3 cys7 and cys4 cys8 it has a molecular mass of 3950 atomic mass units electrophysiological experiments whole cell configuration patch clamping have been performed to investigate the physiological effect of hgetx1 on shaker b k channels in insect cell cultures these recordings show that hgetx1 reversibly blocks the shaker b k channel this blockage follows a michaelis menten saturation relationship with a kd of 52 nm however there is no report of selectivity for or blockage of other subtypes of k channels hgetx1 has only been investigated for its effectiveness on the shaker b k channel where the toxin seems to work as a plug that blocks the pore s ion conductance this blockage follows the functional dyad model that underlies most ktx

ultrasound avoidance is known for several groups of insects that have independently evolved mechanisms for ultrasonic hearing insects have evolved a variety of ultrasound sensitive ears based upon a vibrating tympanic membrane tuned to sense the bat s echolocating calls the ultrasonic hearing is coupled to a motor response that causes evasion of the bat during flight although ultrasonic signals are used for echolocation by toothed whales no known examples of ultrasonic avoidance in their prey have been found to date ultrasonic hearing has evolved multiple times in insects a total of 19 times bats appeared in the eocene era about 50 million years ago antibat tactics should have evolved then antibat tactics are known in four orders of insecta moths lepidoptera crickets orthoptera mantids dictyoptera and green lacewings neuroptera there are hypotheses of ultrasound avoidance being present in diptera flies and coleoptera beetles the idea that moths were able to hear the cries of echolocating bats dates back to the late 19th century white in an 1877 letter to nature made the association between the moth s high pitched sounds and the high pitched bat calls and wondered whether the moths would be able to hear it however it

g tinney et al from the 2mass wide field t dwarf search wfts based on observations obtained at the anglo australian telescope siding spring australia in 2005 tinney et al published a paper in the astronomical journal where they presented discovery of five new brown dwarfs of spectral type t among which also was 2mass 1114 2618 trigonometric parallax of 2mass 1114 2618 measured in 2012 by dupuy liu under the hawaii infrared parallax program is 0 1792 0 0014 arcsec corresponding to a distance 5 58 0 04 pc or 18 20 0 14 ly photometric distance estimate of 2mass 1114 2618 published in its discovery paper in 2005 is 7 pc 22 8 ly spectrophotometric distance estimate by kirkpatrick et al 2012 is 6 6 pc 21 5 ly 2mass 1114 2618 has quite a large proper motion of 3043 2 mas yr with position angle 262 75 degrees indicating motion in south west direction on the sky at distance 18 20 ly assuming parallax 179 2 1 4 mas corresponding tangential velocity is 80 56 km s the other four discoveries of brown dwarfs presented in tinney et al 2005

rnaa was first reported in a 2006 pnas paper by li et al who also coined the term rnaa as a contrast to rna interference rnai to describe such gene activation phenomenon dsrnas that trigger rnaa have been termed small activating rna sarna since the initial discovery of rnaa in human cells many other groups have made similar observations in different mammalian species including human non human primates rat and mice plant and c elegans suggesting that rnaa is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of gene regulation rnaa can be generally classified into two categories exogenous and endogenous exogenous rnaa is triggered by artificially designed sarnas which target non coding sequences such as the promoter and the 3 terminus of a gene and these sarnas can be chemically synthesized or expressed as short hairpin rna shrna whereas for endogenous rnaa upregulation of gene expression is guided by naturally occurring endogenous small rnas such as mirna in mammalian cells and c elegans and 22g rna in c elegans the molecular mechanism of rnaa is not fully understood similar to rnai it has been shown that mammalian rnaa requires members of the ago clade of argonaute proteins particularly ago2 but possesses kinetics distinct

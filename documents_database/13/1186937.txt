it consists of a radiation source that emits a cloud of particles and a sensor that counts the received particles that are either reflected by the test material or pass through it by calculating the percentage of particles that return to the sensor the gauge can be calibrated to measure the density and inner structure of the test material different variants are used for different purposes for density analysis of very shallow objects such as roads or walls a gamma source emitter such as cesium is used to produce gamma radiation these isotopes are effective in analyzing the top 10 inches 25 centimeters with high accuracy radium is used for depths of 328 yards 300 meters such instruments can help find caves or identify locations with lower density that would make tunnel construction hazardous nuclear density gauges can also be used to measure the density of a liquid in a pipe if a source is mounted on one side of a pipe and a detector on the other the amount of radiation seen at the detector is dependent upon the shielding provided by the liquid in the pipe tracerco pioneered the use of radiation to measure density in the 1950s

this mycotoxin occurs predominantly in grains such as wheat barley oats rye and corn and less often in rice sorghum and triticale the occurrence of deoxynivalenol is associated primarily with fusarium graminearum gibberella zeae and f culmorum both of which are important plant pathogens which cause fusarium head blight in wheat and gibberella or fusarium ear blight in corn a direct relationship between the incidence of fusarium head blight and contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol has been established the incidence of fusarium head blight is strongly associated with moisture at the time of flowering anthesis and the timing of rainfall rather than the amount is the most critical factor however increased amount of moisture towards harvest time has been associated with lower amount of vomitoxin in wheat grain due to leaching of toxins furthermore deoxynivalenol contents are significantly affected by the susceptibility of cultivars towards fusarium species previous crop tillage practices and fungicide use it occurs abundantly in grains in norway due to heavy rainfall f graminearum grows optimally at a temperature of 25 c and at a water activity above 0 88 f culmorum grows optimally at 21 c and at a water activity above 0 87 the geographical

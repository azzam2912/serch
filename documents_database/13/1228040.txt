approximate finite dimensionality was first defined and described combinatorially by ola bratteli later george a elliott gave a complete classification of af algebras using the k functor whose range consists of ordered abelian groups with sufficiently nice order structure the classification theorem for af algebras serves as a prototype for classification results for larger classes of separable simple nuclear stably finite c algebras its proof divides into two parts the invariant here is k with its natural order structure this is a functor first one proves existence a homomorphism between invariants must lift to a homomorphism of algebras second one shows uniqueness the lift must be unique up to approximate unitary equivalence classification then follows from what is known as the intertwining argument for unital af algebras both existence and uniqueness follow from the fact the murray von neumann semigroup of projections in an af algebra is cancellative the counterpart of simple af c algebras in the von neumann algebra world are the hyperfinite factors which were classified by connes and haagerup in the context of noncommutative geometry and topology af c algebras are noncommutative generalizations of c x where x is a totally disconnected metrizable space an arbitrary finite

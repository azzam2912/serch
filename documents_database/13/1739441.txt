introduced in 1884 by the french mathematician gabriel koenigs it gives a canonical representation as dilations of a univalent holomorphic mapping or a semigroup of mappings of the unit disk in the complex numbers into itself let d be the unit disk in the complex numbers let be a holomorphic function mapping d into itself fixing the point 0 with not identically 0 and not an automorphism of d i e a m bius transformation defined by a matrix in su 1 1 by the denjoy wolff theorem leaves invariant each disk z schr der s equation is satisfied the function h is the uniform limit on compacta of the normalized iterates formula 3 moreover if is univalent so is as a consequence when and hence are univalent can be identified with the open domain under this conformal identification the mapping becomes multiplication by a dilation on let be a semigroup of holomorphic univalent mappings of into itself fixing 0 defined for such that each with 0 has the same koenigs function cf iterated function in fact if h is the koenigs function of then satisfies schroeder s equation and hence is proportion to h taking derivatives gives hence is

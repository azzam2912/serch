it was introduced by hitchcock in 1927 and later rediscovered several times notably in psychometrics for this reason the tensor rank decomposition is sometimes historically referred to as parafac or candecomp the tensor rank decomposition expresses a tensor as a minimum length linear combination of rank 1 tensors such rank 1 tensors are also called simple or pure a pure tensor is the tensor product of a collection of vectors consider a tensor space formula 1 where formula 2 is either the real field formula 3 or the complex field formula 4 every order formula 5 tensor in this space may then be represented with a suitably large formula 6 as a linear combination of formula 6 rank 1 tensors where formula 9 and formula 10 note that the superscript formula 11 should not be interpreted as an exponent it is merely another index when the number of terms formula 6 is minimal in the above expression then formula 6 is called the rank of the tensor and the decomposition is often referred to as a tensor rank decomposition minimal cp decomposition or canonical polyadic decomposition cpd contrariwise if the number of terms is not minimal then the above decomposition

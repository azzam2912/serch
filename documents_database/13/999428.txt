a partition into two classes can be represented by a coloring formula 2 we call 1 and 1 colors the color classes formula 3 and formula 4 form the corresponding partition for a hyperedge formula 5 set the discrepancy of formula 7 with respect to formula 8 and the discrepancy of formula 7 are defined by these notions as well as the term discrepancy seem to have appeared for the first time in a paper of beck earlier results on this problem include the famous lower bound on the discrepancy of arithmetic progressions by roth and upper bounds for this problem and other results by erd s and spencer and s rk zi described on p 39 at that time discrepancy problems were called quasi ramsey problems to get some intuition for this concept let s have a look at a few examples the last example shows that we cannot expect to determine the discrepancy by looking at a single parameter like the number of hyperedges still the size of the hypergraph yields first upper bounds with n the number of vertices and m the number of edges the proof is a simple application of the probabilistic method let formula

mmps belong to a family of zinc dependent neutral endopeptidases these enzymes have the ability to break down connective tissue the expression of mmps is increased in various pathological conditions like inflammatory conditions metabolic bone disease to cancer invasion metastasis and angiogenesis examples of diseases are periodontitis hepatitis glomerulonephritis atherosclerosis emphysema asthma autoimmune disorders of skin and dermal photoaging rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis multiple sclerosis alzheimer s disease chronic ulcerations uterine involution corneal epithelial defects bone resorption and tumor progression and metastasis due to the role of mmps in pathological conditions inhibitors of mmps may have therapeutic potential several other proteins have similar inhibitory effects however none as effective netrins procollagen c terminal proteinase enhancer pcpe reversion inducing cysteine rich protein with kazal motifs reck and tissue factor pathway inhibitor tfpi 2 they might have other biological activities which have yet been fully characterised mmp inhibitors can broadly be subdivided into non synthetic e g endogenous or synthetic several potent mmp inhibitors have been identified including hydroxymates thiols carbamoylphosphonates hydroxyureas hydrazines lactams squaric acids and nitrogenous ligands there are three classes of commonly used inhibitors for metalloproteinases the first generation of mmp inhibitors were based on the structure of the collagen

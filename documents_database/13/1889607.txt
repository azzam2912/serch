image geometry correction compensates for the distortion created by off axis projector or screen placement or non flat screen surface by applying a pre compensating inverse distortion to that image in the digital domain usually image geometry correction is applied such that equal areas of projection surface are perceived by the viewer map to equal areas in the source image it can also be used to apply a special effect distortion the term image geometry correction implying a static image is slightly misleading image geometry correction applies to static or dynamic images i e moving video image geometry correction is generally implemented in 2 different ways both techniques involve the real time execution of a spatial transformation from the input image to the output image and both techniques require powerful hardware the spatial transformation must be pre defined for a particular desired geometric and may be calculated by several different methods more to follow in graphics processing the spatial transformation consists of a polygon mesh usually triangles the transformation is executed by texture mapping from the rectilinear mesh of the input image to the transformed shape of the destination image each polygon on the input image is thus applied to

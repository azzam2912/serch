under the right conditions of temperature and usually high humidity these spores germinate grow as hyphae and colonize the insect s cuticle which they bore through by way of enzymatic hydrolysis reaching the insects body cavity hemocoel then the fungal cells proliferate in the host body cavity usually as walled hyphae or in the form of wall less protoplasts depending on the fungus involved after some time the insect is usually killed sometimes by fungal toxins and new propagules spores are formed in or on the insect if environmental conditions are again right high humidity is usually required for sporulation the entomopathogenic fungi include taxa from several of the main fungal groups and do not form a monophyletic group many common and or important entomopathogenic fungi are in the order hypocreales of the ascomycota the asexual anamorph phases beauveria isaria was paecilomyces hirsutella metarhizium nomuraea and the sexual teleomorph state cordyceps others entomophthora zoophthora pandora entomophaga belong in the order entomophthorales of the zygomycota related fungi attack and kill other invertebrates e g nematodes since they are considered natural mortality agents and environmentally safe there is worldwide interest in the use and manipulation of entomopathogenic fungi for biological control of

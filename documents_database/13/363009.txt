the letter m would represent the total impulse of between 5 120 01 and 10 240 00 n s of impulse motors e and below are considered low power rocket motors motors between f and g are considered mid power while motors h and above being high powered rocket motors motors which would be classified beyond o are in the realm of amateur rocketry in this context the term amateur refers to the rocketeer s independence from an established commercial or government organization professional organizations use the nomenclature of average thrust and burning time the designation for a specific motor looks like c6 3 in this example the letter c represents the total impulse range of the motor the number 6 before the dash represents the average thrust in newtons 4 448 n per lb and the number 3 after the dash represents the delay in seconds from propelling charge burnout to the firing of the ejection charge a gas generator composition usually black powder designed to deploy the recovery system a c6 3 motor would have between 5 01 and 10 n s of impulse produce 6 n average thrust and fire an ejection charge 3 seconds after burnout

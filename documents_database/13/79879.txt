in meteorology a baroclinic atmosphere is one for which the density depends on both the temperature and the pressure contrast this with a barotropic atmosphere for which the density depends only on the pressure in atmospheric terms the barotropic zones of the earth are generally found in the central latitudes or tropics whereas the baroclinic areas are generally found in the mid latitude polar regions baroclinity is proportional to which is proportional to the sine of the angle between surfaces of constant pressure and surfaces of constant density thus in a barotropic fluid which is defined by zero baroclinity these surfaces are parallel areas of high atmospheric baroclinity are characterized by the frequent formation of cyclones baroclinic instability is a fluid dynamical instability of fundamental importance in the atmosphere and in the oceans in the atmosphere it is the dominant mechanism shaping the cyclones and anticyclones that dominate weather in mid latitudes in the ocean it generates a field of mesoscale 100 km or smaller eddies that play various roles in oceanic dynamics and the transport of tracers baroclinic instability is a concept relevant to rapidly rotating strongly stratified fluids whether a fluid counts as rapidly rotating is determined in

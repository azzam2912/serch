historically conventional wisdom has it that rock is brittle and fails by fracture while plasticity is identified with ductile materials in field scale rock masses structural discontinuities exist in the rock indicating that failure has taken place since the rock has not fallen apart contrary to expectation of brittle behavior clearly elasticity theory is not the last work theoretically the concept of rock plasticity is based on soil plasticity which is different from metal plasticity in metal plasticity for example in steel the size of a dislocation is sub grain size while for soil it is the relative movement of microscopic grains the theory of soil plasticity was developed in the 1960s at rice university to provide for inelastic effects not observed in metals typical behaviors observed in rocks include strain softening perfect plasticity and work hardening application of continuum theory is possible in jointed rocks because of the continuity of tractions across joints even through displacements may be discontinuous the difference between an aggregate with joints and a continuous solid is in the type of constitutive law and the values of constitutive parameters experiments are usually carried out with the intention of characterizing the mechanical behavior of rock in

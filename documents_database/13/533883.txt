formally an open set formula 1 in the n dimensional complex space formula 2 is called a domain of holomorphy if there do not exist non empty open sets formula 3 and formula 4 where formula 5 is connected formula 6 and formula 7 such that for every holomorphic function formula 8 on formula 1 there exists a holomorphic function formula 10 on formula 5 with formula 12 on formula 13 in the formula 14 case every open set is a domain of holomorphy we can define a holomorphic function with zeros accumulating everywhere on the boundary of the domain which must then be a natural boundary for a domain of definition of its reciprocal for formula 15 this is no longer true as it follows from hartogs lemma for a domain formula 1 the following conditions are equivalent implications formula 34 are standard results for formula 35 see oka s lemma the main difficulty lies in proving formula 36 i e constructing a global holomorphic function which admits no extension from non extendable functions defined only locally this is called the levi problem after e e levi and was first solved by kiyoshi oka and then by lars h

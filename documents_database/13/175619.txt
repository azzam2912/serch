this album is historic since it is one of the first space rock lps the pretty things guitarist dick taylor who was looking for a new venture after leaving the band was pulled into hawkwind playing some gigs and producing this album after several unsuccessful attempts to capture the band s sound in the studio it was decided simply to record it live in the studio the bulk of the album is composed of a freeform instrumental piece that the band named sunshine special but it was separated into different tracks on this album on the lp paranoia ends after the first minute with the music slowing down as though the turntable is stopping and then picks up as the first cut on side 2 lyrics are scant but those that are present and the song titles are a reference to the drug experience as the sleeve notes explain this is the beginning by now we will be past this album we started out trying to freak people trippers now we are trying to levitate their minds in a nice way without acid and ultimately a completely audio visual thing using a complex of electronics lights and environmental experiences the

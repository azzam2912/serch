traffic device optimization hence becomes a significant aspect of operations several techniques exist to reduce delay of traffic generally the algorithms attempt to reduce delays user time stops exhaust gas emissions or some other measure of effectiveness many optimization software are geared towards pre timed coordinated systems normally optimization of signals along a road is a challenging and expensive task because the sources for traffic monitoring have been limited to inductive loops cameras or manually counting however due to recent advances in information technology portable devices with bluetooth and wi fi communication are becoming more common enabling real time continuous traffic monitoring and adjustments to traffic signal timing by placing sensors along roads tracking bluetooth and wi fi devices in passing vehicles the solution is able to accurately detect and record how long it takes a car to drive along a corridor segment by segment and in total this provides historic data for traditional timing methods but also enables real time feedback to changes in signal programs along with the ability to continuously detect traffic levels and travel time to trigger transitions among programs excessive city traffic can be the most frustrating part about living in urban areas the solution

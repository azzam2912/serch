it is a colorless volatile liquid although commercial samples can be yellow due to impurities in terms of its molecular structure it consists of a vinyl group linked to a nitrile it is an important monomer for the manufacture of useful plastics such as polyacrylonitrile it is reactive and toxic at low doses acrylonitrile was first synthesized by the french chemist charles moureu 1863 1929 in 1893 acrylonitrile is not naturally formed in the atmosphere of earth however it can occur at levels up to 0 11 ppm at industrial sites it persists in the air for up to a week it decomposes by reacting with oxygen and hydroxyl radical to form formyl cyanide and formaldehyde acrylonitrile is harmful to aquatic life acrylonitrile has been detected in the atmosphere of titan a moon of saturn computer simulations suggest that on titan conditions exist such that the compound could form structures similar to cell membranes and vesicles on earth acrylonitrile is produced by catalytic ammoxidation of propylene also known as the sohio process in 2002 world production capacity was estimated at 5 million tonnes per year acetonitrile and hydrogen cyanide are significant byproducts that are recovered for sale in fact the

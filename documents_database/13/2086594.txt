a davis of the percolation of ideas from the groundbreaking thesis of louis bachelier in 1900 to modern mathematical finance much of her recent research is concerned with mathematical models of population genetics where she has been particularly involved in efforts to understand the effects of spatial structure of populations on their patterns of genetic variation etheridge has made significant contributions in the theory and applications of probability and in the links between them her particular areas of research have been in measure valued processes especially superprocesses and their generalisations in theoretical population genetics and in mathematical ecology a recent focus has been on the genetics of spatially extended populations where she has exploited and developed inextricable links with infinite dimensional stochastic analysis her resolution of the so called pain in the torus is typical of her work in that it draws on ideas from diverse areas from measure valued processes to image analysis the result is a flexible framework for modelling biological populations which for the first time combines ecology and genetics in a tractable way while introducing a novel and mathematically interesting class of stochastic processes the breadth of her contributions is further illustrated by the topics of

it is also known as the illinois protocol due to its development at the university of illinois at urbana champaign write back caches can save a lot on bandwidth that is generally wasted on a write through cache there is always a dirty state present in write back caches which indicates that the data in the cache is different from that in main memory illinois protocol requires cache to cache transfer on a miss if the block resides in another cache this protocol reduces the number of main memory transactions with respect to the msi protocol this marks a significant improvement in the performance the letters in the acronym mesi represent four exclusive states that a cache line can be marked with encoded using two additional bits for any given pair of caches the permitted states of a given cache line are as follows when the block is marked m modified the copies of the block in other caches are marked as i invalid the state of the fsm transitions from one state to another based on 2 stimuli the first stimulus is the processor specific read and write request for example a processor p1 has a block x in

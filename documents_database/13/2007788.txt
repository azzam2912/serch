f newman and e a o brien is a recursive process for constructing the descendant tree of an assigned finite p group which is taken as the root of the tree for a finite p group formula 4 the lower exponent p central series briefly lower p central series of formula 4 is a descending series formula 6 of characteristic subgroups of formula 4 defined recursively by formula 8 and formula 9 for formula 10 since any non trivial finite p group formula 11 is nilpotent there exists an integer formula 12 such that formula 13 and formula 14 is called the exponent p class briefly p class of formula 4 only the trivial group formula 16 has formula 17 generally for any finite p group formula 4 its p class can be defined as formula 19 the complete lower p central series of formula 4 is therefore given by formula 21 since formula 22 is the frattini subgroup of formula 4 for the convenience of the reader and for pointing out the shifted numeration we recall that the usual lower central series of formula 4 is also a descending series formula 25 of characteristic subgroups of formula 4 defined

the particles entering such a tracker leave a precise record of their passage through the device by interaction with suitably constructed components and materials the presence of a calibrated magnetic field in all or part of the tracker allows the local momentum of the charged particle to be directly determined from the reconstructed local curvature of the trajectory for known or assumed electric charge of the particle generally track reconstruction is divided into two stages first track finding needs to be performed where a cluster of detector hits believed to originate from the same track are grouped together second a track fitting is performed track fitting is the procedure of mathematically fitting a curve to the found hits and from this fit the momentum is obtained identification and reconstruction of trajectories from the digitised output of a modern tracker can in the simplest cases in the absence of a magnetic field and absorbing scattering material be achieved via straight line segment fits a simple helical model to determine momentum in the presence of a magnetic field might be sufficient in less simple cases through to a complete e g kalman filter process to provide a detailed reconstructed local model throughout

it contributes to the cardiac transient outward potassium current i the main contributing current to the repolarizing phase 1 of the cardiac action potential potassium channels represent the most complex class of voltage gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release heart rate insulin secretion neuronal excitability epithelial electrolyte transport smooth muscle contraction and cell volume four sequence related potassium channel genes shaker shaw shab and shal have been identified in drosophila and each has been shown to have human homolog s this gene encodes a member of the potassium channel voltage gated shaker related subfamily this member contains six membrane spanning domains with a shaker type repeat in the fourth segment it belongs to the a type potassium current class the members of which may be important in the regulation of the fast repolarizing phase of action potentials in heart and thus may influence the duration of cardiac action potential the coding region of this gene is intronless and the gene is clustered with genes kcna3 and kcna10 on chromosome 1 in humans kcna4 kv1 4 contains a tandem inactivation domain at the n terminus it is composed of two subdomains

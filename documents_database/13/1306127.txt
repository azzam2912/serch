in 1941 he graduated from the physics department at moscow state university and soon after that on 25 june 1941 volunteered to the people s volunteer corps to participate in second world war he participated in the battle of moscow and met the end of the war in berlin with the 47th army of the first belorussian front after the war he worked for several years on various military related research projects in arzamas 16 in this period of time he was greatly influenced by nikolay bogoliubov and andrei sakharov then in 1954 he moved to steklov institute of mathematics where continued to work for the rest of his life his first research in arzamas 16 was devoted to various applications of plasma theory including analysis of stationary regimes for nuclear reactors jointly with v n klimov and analysis of temperature jumps of plasma in magnetic field after that he started to work in collaboration with nikolay bogoliubov on various problems in theoretical physics and obtained several fundamental results including development of an asymptotic method for systems with rapidly rotating phases development of the method of collective variables which is now widely used in theoretical physics and development of the

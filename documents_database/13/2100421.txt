structurally it is related to diborane but with methyl groups replacing terminal hydrides on each boron it is the dimer of methylborane chbh the simplest alkylborane 1 2 dimethyldiborane can exist in a cis and a trans arrangement 1 2 dimethyldiborane is an easily condensed colorless gas that ignites spontaneously in air an isomer of 1 2 dimethyldiborane is 1 1 dimethyldiborane known as unsymmetrical dimethyldiborane which has two methyl groups on one boron atom other methylated versions of diborane including methyldiborane trimethyldiborane tetramethyldiborane trimethylborane exists as a monomer methylboranes were first prepared by h i schlesinger and a o walker in the 1930s in a more modern synthesis 1 2 dmethyldiborane is produced by treating lithium methylborohydride with hydrogen chloride instead of hydrogen chloride methyl iodide or trimethylsilyl chloride can be used lithium methylborohydride can be made by treating methylboronic esters with lithium aluminium hydride methylboranes arise the reaction of diborane and trimethylborane this reaction produces 1 methyldiborane 1 1 dimethyldborane 1 1 2 trimethyldiborane and 1 1 2 2 tetramethyldiborane by treating monomethyldiborane with ether dimethyl ether borane ch o bh leaving methylborane which rapidly dimerises to 1 2 dimethyldiborane the reaction is complex tetramethyl lead reacts with

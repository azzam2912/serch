the primary motor cortex is the main contributor to generating neural impulses that pass down to the spinal cord and control the execution of movement however some of the other motor areas in the brain also play a role in this function it is located on the anterior paracentral lobule on the medial surface 2 the premotor cortex is responsible for some aspects of motor control possibly including the preparation for movement the sensory guidance of movement the spatial guidance of reaching or the direct control of some movements with an emphasis on control of proximal and trunk muscles of the body located anterior to the primary motor cortex 3 the supplementary motor area or sma has many proposed functions including the internally generated planning of movement the planning of sequences of movement and the coordination of the two sides of the body such as in bi manual coordination located on the midline surface of the hemisphere anterior to the primary motor cortex other brain regions outside the cerebral cortex are also of great importance to motor function most notably the cerebellum the basal ganglia pedunculopontine nucleus and the red nucleus as well as other subcortical motor nuclei in the

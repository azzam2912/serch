the symbol was once used for it it is also one hundredth of an ngstr m an internationally recognised but non si unit of length the picometre s length is of an order so small that its application is almost entirely confined to particle physics quantum physics chemistry and acoustics atoms are between 62 and 520 pm in diameter and the typical length of a carbon carbon single bond is 154 pm smaller units still may be used to describe smaller particles some of which are the components of atoms themselves such as hadrons and the upper limits of possible size for fermion point particles the laser interferometer space antenna lisa probe is planned for launch in 2034 to directly detect gravitational waves and will measure relative displacements with a resolution of 20 picometres over a distance of 2 5 gigametres yielding a strain sensitivity of better than 1 part in 10

in a column of fluid pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column similarly the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object the pressure difference results in a net upward force on the object the magnitude of the force is proportional to the pressure difference and as explained by archimedes principle is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object i e the displaced fluid for this reason an object whose average density is greater than that of the fluid in which it is submerged tends to sink if the object is less dense than the liquid the force can keep the object afloat this can occur only in a non inertial reference frame which either has a gravitational field or is accelerating due to a force other than gravity defining a downward direction the center of buoyancy of an object is the centroid of the displaced volume of fluid archimedes principle is

it is the starting point of the analysis of zero thickness infinitely thin string behavior using the principles of lagrangian mechanics just as the action for a free point particle is proportional to its proper time i e the length of its world line a relativistic string s action is proportional to the area of the sheet which the string traces as it travels through spacetime it is named after japanese physicists yoichiro nambu and tetsuo goto the basic principle of lagrangian mechanics the principle of stationary action is that an object subjected to outside influences will choose a path which makes a certain quantity the action an extremum the action is a functional a mathematical relationship which takes an entire path and produces a single number the physical path that which the object actually follows is the path for which the action is stationary or extremal any small variation of the path from the physical one does not significantly change the action often this is equivalent to saying the physical path is the one for which the action is a minimum actions are typically written using lagrangians formulas which depend upon the object s state at a particular point

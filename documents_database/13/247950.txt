hoses are also sometimes called pipes the word pipe usually refers to a rigid tube whereas a hose is usually a flexible one or more generally tubing the shape of a hose is usually cylindrical having a circular cross section hose design is based on a combination of application and performance common factors are size pressure rating weight length straight hose or coilhose and chemical compatibility applications mostly use nylon polyurethane polyethylene pvc or synthetic or natural rubbers based on the environment and pressure rating needed in recent years hoses can also be manufactured from special grades of polyethylene ldpe and especially lldpe other hose materials include ptfe teflon stainless steel and other metals to achieve a better pressure resistance hoses can be reinforced with fibers or a steel cord commonly used reinforcement methods are braiding spiraling knitting and wrapping of fabric plies the reinforcement increases the pressure resistance but also the stiffness to obtain flexibility corrugations or bellows are used usually circumferential or helical reinforcement rings are applied to maintain these corrugated or bellowed structures under internal pressure hoses can be used in water or other liquid environments or to convey air or other gases hoses are used to

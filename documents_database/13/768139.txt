airplanes emit particles and gases such as carbon dioxide water vapor hydrocarbons carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides sulfur oxides lead and black carbon which interact among themselves and with the atmosphere despite emission reductions from automobiles and more fuel efficient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines the rapid growth of air travel in the past years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to aviation from 1992 to 2005 passenger kilometers increased 5 2 percent per year in the european union greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by 87 percent between 1990 and 2006 comprehensive research shows that despite anticipated efficiency innovations to airframes engines aerodynamics and flight operations there is no end in sight even many decades out to rapid growth in co emissions from air travel and air freight due to projected continual growth in air travel this is because international aviation emissions have escaped international regulation up to the icao triennial conference in october 2016 agreed on the corsia offset scheme in addition due to low or non existent taxes on aviation fuel air travel enjoys a competitive advantage over other transportation modes due to lower fares unless market constraints are put in place growth in

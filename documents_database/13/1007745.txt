a sound speed gradient leads to refraction of sound wavefronts in the direction of lower sound speed causing the sound rays to follow a curved path the radius of curvature of the sound path is inversely proportional to the gradient when the sun warms the earth s surface there is a negative temperature gradient in atmosphere the speed of sound decreases with decreasing temperature so this also creates a negative sound speed gradient the sound wave front travels faster near the ground so the sound is refracted upward away from listeners on the ground creating an acoustic shadow at some distance from the source the opposite effect happens when the ground is covered with snow or in the morning over water when the sound speed gradient is positive in this case sound waves can be refracted from the upper levels down to the surface in underwater acoustics speed of sound depends on pressure hence depth temperature and salinity of seawater thus leading to vertical speed gradients similar to those that exist in atmospheric acoustics however when there is a zero sound speed gradient values of sound speed have the same isospeed in all parts of a given water column there

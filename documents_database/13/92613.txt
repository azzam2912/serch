there are more than 30 species of shearwaters a few larger ones in the genus calonectris and many smaller species in the genus puffinus the procellaria petrels and bulweria were believed to belong to this group but are only distantly related based on more recent studies while the pseudobulweria and lugensa petrels are more closely related the genus puffinus can be divided into a group of small species close to calonectris and a few larger ones more distantly related to both these birds are most common in temperate and cold waters they are pelagic outside the breeding season these tubenose birds fly with stiff wings and use a shearing flight technique flying very close to the water and seemingly cutting or shearing the tips of waves to move across wave fronts with the minimum of active flight this technique gives the group its english name some small species like the manx shearwater are cruciform in flight with their long wings held directly out from their bodies many are long distance migrants perhaps most spectacularly sooty shearwaters which cover distances in excess of from their breeding colony on the falkland islands 52 s 60 w to as far as 70 north

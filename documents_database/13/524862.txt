in it tate used a translation invariant integration on the locally compact group of ideles to lift the zeta function twisted by a hecke character i e a hecke l function of a number field to a zeta integral and study its properties using harmonic analysis more precisely the poisson summation formula he proved the functional equation and meromorphic continuation of the zeta integral and the hecke l function he also located the poles of the twisted zeta function his work can be viewed as an elegant and powerful reformulation of a work of erich hecke on the proof of the functional equation of the hecke l function erich hecke used a generalized theta series associated to an algebraic number field and a lattice in its ring of integers kenkichi iwasawa independently discovered essentially the same method without an analog of the local theory in tate s thesis during the second world war and announced it in his 1950 international congress of mathematicians paper and his letter to jean dieudonn written in 1952 hence this theory is often called iwasawa tate theory iwasawa in his letter to dieudonn derived on several pages not only the meromorphic continuation and functional equation

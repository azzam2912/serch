in these materials at energies near the fermi level the valence band and conduction band take the shape of the upper and lower halves of a conical surface meeting at what are called dirac points in quantum mechanics dirac cones are a kind of avoided crossing where the energy of the valence and conduction bands are not equal anywhere in two dimensional k space except at the zero dimensional dirac points as a result of the cones electrical conduction can be described by the movement of charge carriers which are massless fermions a situation which is handled theoretically by the relativistic dirac equation the massless fermions lead to various quantum hall effects and ultra high carrier mobility dirac cones were observed in 2009 using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy arpes on the graphite intercalation compound kc as an object with three dimensions dirac cones are a feature of two dimensional materials or surface states based on a linear dispersion relation between energy and the two components of the crystal momentum k and k however this concept can be extended to three dimensions where dirac semimetals are defined by a linear dispersion relation between energy and k k and k in k

the original definition of an am star was one in which the star shows an apparent surface underabundance of ca and or sc and or an apparent overabundance of the fe group and heavier elements the unusual relative abundances cause the spectral type assessed from the calcium k lines to be systematically earlier than one assessed from other metallic lines typically a spectral type judged solely from hydrogen lines is intermediate this leads to two or three spectral types being given for example sirius has been given a spectral type of ka0ha0vma1 indicating that it is a0 when judged by the calcium k line a0v when judge by its hydrogen lines and a1 when judged by the lines of heavy metals there are other formats such as a0ma1va again for sirius the chemical abnormalities are due to some elements which absorb more light being pushed towards the surface while others sink under the force of gravity this effect takes place only if the star has low rotational velocity normally a type stars rotate quickly most am stars form part of a binary system in which the rotation of the stars has been slowed by tidal braking the best known metallic

they can be considered a type of fossil but their significance and authenticity has been questioned raindrop impressions are only a few millimeters thick and less than 1 centimeter in diameter they can be preserved as widely scattered impressions or in close proximity to one another on the sediment surface raindrop impressions can appear as small craters or as small raised bumps if the sample has craters the top of the sample is being viewed because the rain would have fallen onto it making indentations if the sample has small raised bumps the bottom of the sample is being viewed in this case the raindrop impressions were created in the sediment which was then followed by more sediment which filled the impressions creating what appear to be raised bumps on the bottom of the upper layer fossilized raindrop impressions can help scientists determine historical atmospheric pressure rainfall is not the only explanation for the geological feature and not all raindrop impressions are considered to have formed due to the impact of raindrops arguments against a raindrop origin include in order for raindrop impressions to be preserved in the rock record the impression would have to have occurred towards the end

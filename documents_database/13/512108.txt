it is a reduced derivative of pyruvic acid it is a reactive compound that is implicated in the biology of diabetes methylglyoxal is produced industrially by degradation of carbohydrates using overexpressed methylglyoxal synthase gaseous methylglyoxal has two carbonyl groups an aldehyde and a ketone in the presence of water it exists as hydrates and oligomers the formation of these hydrates is indicative of the high reactivity of mgo which is relevant to its biological behavior in organisms methylglyoxal is formed as a side product of several metabolic pathways methylglyoxal mainly arises as side products of glycolysis involving glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate it is also thought to arise via the degradation of acetone and threonine illustrative of the myriad pathways to mgo aristolochic acid caused 12 fold increase of methylglyoxal from 18 to 231 g mg of kidney protein in poisoned mice it may form from 3 aminoacetone which is an intermediate of threonine catabolism as well as through lipid peroxidation however the most important source is glycolysis here methylglyoxal arises from nonenzymatic phosphate elimination from glyceraldehyde phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate dhap two intermediates of glycolysis this conversion is the basis of a potential biotechnological route to the commodity

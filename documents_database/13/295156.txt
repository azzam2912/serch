the two other theorems are hilbert s basis theorem that asserts that all ideals of polynomial rings over a field are finitely generated and hilbert s nullstellensatz which establishes a bijective correspondence between affine algebraic varieties and prime ideals of polynomial rings hilbert s syzygy theorem concern the relations or syzygies in hilbert s terminology between the generators of an ideal or more generally a module as the relations form a module one may consider the relations between the relations hilbert s syzygy theorem asserts that if one continues in this way starting with a module over a polynomial ring in indeterminates over a field one eventually finds a zero module of relations after at most steps hilbert s syzygy theorem is now considered to be an early result of homological algebra it is the starting point of the use of homological methods in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry the syzygy theorem first appeared in hilbert s seminal paper ber die theorie der algebraischen formen 1890 the paper is split into five parts part i proves hilbert s basis theorem over a field while part ii proves it over the integers part iii contains the syzygy theorem theorem iii which

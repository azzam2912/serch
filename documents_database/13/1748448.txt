it is intended to be coupled with external numerical software such as computer aided design cad finite element analysis fem structural analysis and computational fluid dynamics tools it was developed by cyber dyne srl and provides both a design environment for problem definition and analysis and a software network infrastructure to distribute the computational load cyber dyne was founded in 2011 as a research startup to transfer the knowledge of its founders in the field of numerical optimization and computational intelligence methods into a commercial product the problem definition workflow is based on the data flow paradigm multiple nodes can be interconnected to describe the data flow from the design variables to the desired objectives and constraints input output nodes can be used to calculate any part of the objective s computation using internal java python or bash batch or external third party processes any of these procedures can be distributed over a lan or the cloud exploiting all the available computational resources the optimization core is open and using the memetic computing mc approach which is an extension of the concept of memetic algorithm the user can define its own optimization algorithm as a set of independent pieces of

while usually associated with visual perception a form of optical illusion such phenomena can also be found for auditory and olfactory precepts perceptual multistability can be evoked by visual patterns that are too ambiguous for the human visual system to recognize with one unique interpretation familiar examples include the necker cube schroeder staircase structure from motion monocular rivalry and binocular rivalry but many more visually ambiguous patterns are known since most of these images lead to an alternation between two mutually exclusive perceptual states they are sometimes also referred to as bistable perception auditory and olfactory examples can occur when there are conflicting and so rivaling inputs into the two ears or two nostrils transitions from one precept to its alternative are called perceptual reversals they are spontaneous and stochastic events which cannot be eliminated by intentional efforts although some control over the alternation process is learnable reversal rates vary drastically between stimuli and observers and have been found to be slower for people with bipolar disorder human interest in these phenomena can be traced back to antiquity the fascination of multistable perception probably comes from the active nature of endogenous perceptual changes or from the dissociation of dynamic perception

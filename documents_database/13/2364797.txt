common classes of are of the type cr ml and cr m these compounds are reagents in inorganic and organic synthesis the principles that describe arene complexes extend to related organic ligands such as many heterocycles e g thiophene and polycyclic aromatic compounds e g naphthalene also known as reductive friedel crafts reaction the fischer hafner synthesis entails treatment of metal chlorides with arenes in the presence of aluminium trichloride and aluminium metal the method was demonstrated in the 1950s with the synthesis of bis benzene chromium by walter hafner and his advisor e o fischer the method has been extended to other metals e g ru cme in this reaction the alcl serves to remove chloride from the metal precursor and the al metal functions as the reductant the fischer hafner synthesis is limited to arenes lacking sensitive functional groups by metal vapor synthesis metal atoms co condensed with arenes react to give complexes of the type m arene cr ch can be produced by this method cr co reacts directly with benzene and other arenes to give the piano stool complexes cr cr co the carbonyls of mo and w behave comparably the method works particularly well with

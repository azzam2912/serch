the resulting compound is cast into a flat sheet which is typically pliable and deformable over a wide range of temperature typical products are generally shock insensitive secondary explosives requiring a blasting cap or other detonator detonation velocities are frequently very high which can improve the detonation synchronicity across the area of a tertiary charge with a low detonation velocity this property makes them suitable for use in detonation trains which require precise timing and homogeneous delivery of force across a complex surface but see also shaped charge for an orthogonal technique in an explosively pumped magnetic flux compression generator explosives are used to accelerate the plates of a large capacitor at each other while the capacitor has a charge the result is a colossal spike in amperage that can be used in a typical application to fire a railgun for kinetic effects or a transient electromagnetic munition for electronic warfare applications for maximum amperage the plates must remain parallel as they accelerate towards each other high detonation velocity is required in typical designs however the capacitor is not made from two flat plates but from two concentric cylinders therefore sheet explosives simplify construction the reference cited for this section

this is similar to the production of a sonic boom when an airplane is traveling through the air faster than sound waves can move through the air the direction this light is emitted is on a cone with angle about the direction in which the particle is moving with cos c the vacuum speed of light n the refractive index of the medium and v is the speed of the particle the angle of the cone thus is a direct measure of the particle s speed the frank tamm formula sin gives the number of photons produced most cherenkov detectors aim at recording the cherenkov light produced by a primary charged particle some sensor technologies explicitly aim at cherenkov light produced also by secondary particles be it incoherent emission as occurring in an electromagnetic particle shower or by coherent emission example askaryan effect cherenkov radiation is not only present in the range of visible light or uv light but also in any frequency range where the emission condition can be met i e in the radiofrequency range different levels of information can be used a binary information can be based on the absence or presence of detected cherenkov radiation the

it is the simplest numeral system to represent natural numbers in order to represent a number n an arbitrarily chosen symbol representing 1 is repeated n times for example the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 would be represented in this system as these numbers should be distinguished from repunits which are also written as sequences of ones but have their usual decimal numerical interpretation this system is used in tallying for example using the tally mark the number 3 is represented as in east asian cultures the number three is represented as a character that is drawn with three strokes one and two are represented similarly in china and japan the character is used to represent five in some situations because it is drawn with 5 strokes addition and subtraction are particularly simple in the unary system as they involve little more than string concatenation the hamming weight or population count operation that counts the number of nonzero bits in a sequence of binary values may also be interpreted as a conversion from unary to binary numbers however multiplication is more cumbersome and has often been used as a test case for the design of turing machines compared

dna is wrapped around histones and by transferring an acetyl group to the histones genes can be turned on and off in general histone acetylation increases gene expression in general histone acetylation is linked to transcriptional activation and associated with euchromatin euchromatin which is less densely compact allows transcription factors to bind more easily to regulatory sites on dna causing transcriptional activation when it was first discovered it was thought that acetylation of lysine neutralizes the positive charge normally present thus reducing affinity between histone and negatively charged dna which renders dna more accessible to transcription factors research has emerged since to show that lysine acetylation and other posttranslational modifications of histones generate binding sites for specific protein protein interaction domains such as the acetyllysine binding bromodomain histone acetyltransferases can also acetylate non histone proteins such as nuclear receptors and other transcription factors to facilitate gene expression hats are traditionally divided into two different classes based on their subcellular localization type a hats are located in the nucleus and are involved in the regulation of gene expression through acetylation of nucleosomal histones in the context of chromatin they contain a bromodomain which helps them recognize and bind to acetylated lysine

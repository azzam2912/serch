if a language has a particular case it also has all cases lower than this particular case to put it another way if a language lacks a particular case it is also unlikely to develop cases higher than this particular case this theory was developed by the australian linguist barry blake and his theory was inspired by the approach of italian linguist guglielmo cinque the hierarchy is as follows this is only a general tendency however many forms of central german such as colognian or luxembourgish have a dative case but lack a genitive in irish nouns the nominative and accusative have fallen together while the dative case has remained separate in some paradigms irish also has a genitive and vocative case in punjabi the accusative genitive and dative have merged to an oblique case but the language still retains vocative locative and ablative cases old english had an instrumental case but not a locative or prepositional blake argues that it is doubtful that the hierarchy can be extended much further but does suggest that the most common cases not listed in the hierarchy are the comitative purposive allative perlative and comparative

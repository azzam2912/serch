it was approved by the international maritime organization imo as an alternative to the double hull concept the united states coast guard does not allow this design to enter us waters effectively preventing it from being built the design is an enhanced mid deck tanker and consists of a series of centre and wing tanks that are divided by horizontal bulkheads the upper wing tanks form ballast tanks and act as emergency receiver tanks for cargo should the lower tanks be fractured the lower tanks are connected to these ballast tanks by non return valves when a lower tank is damaged the incoming sea water pushes the oil in the damaged tank up into the ballast tank because of the hydrostatic pressure there is an automatic transfer out of the damaged tank the double hull design is aimed at the probability of zero outflow in low energy collisions where only the outside hull is penetrated this will be the case however in high energy collisions both hulls are penetrated as the tanks of a double hull tanker are larger than those of marpol tankers and pre marpol tankers and the height of the cargo above the water line is higher

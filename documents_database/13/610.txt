an object s absolute magnitude is defined to be equal to the apparent magnitude that the object would have if it were viewed from a distance of exactly without extinction or dimming of its light due to absorption by interstellar matter and cosmic dust by hypothetically placing all objects at a standard reference distance from the observer their luminosities can be directly compared on a magnitude scale as with all astronomical magnitudes the absolute magnitude can be specified for different wavelength ranges corresponding to specified filter bands or passbands for stars a commonly quoted absolute magnitude is the absolute visual magnitude which uses the visual v band of the spectrum in the ubv photometric system absolute magnitudes are denoted by a capital m with a subscript representing the filter band used for measurement such as m for absolute magnitude in the v band the more luminous an object the smaller the numerical value of its absolute magnitude a difference of 5 magnitudes between the absolute magnitudes of two objects corresponds to a ratio of 100 in their luminosities and a difference of n magnitudes in absolute magnitude corresponds to a luminosity ratio of 100 for example a star of absolute

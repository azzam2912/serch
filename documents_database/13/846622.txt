the resulting two signals can possibly produce a pleasing stereo effect a matching pair of small diaphragm omnidirectional microphones is always used with a jecklin disk the technique was invented by j rg jecklin the former chief sound engineer of swiss radio now teaching at the university for music and performing arts in vienna he referred to the technique as an optimal stereo signal oss in the beginning jecklin used omnidirectional microphones on either side of a 30 cm 1 ft disk about 2 cm 3 4 thick which had a muffling layer of soft plastic foam or wool fleece on each side the capsules of the microphones were above the surface of the disc just in the center 16 5 centimeters 6 apart from each other and each pointing 20 degrees outside jecklin found the 16 5 cm 6 ear spacing between the microphones too narrow in his own paper he notes that the disk has to be 35 cm 13 in diameter and the distance between the microphones should be 36 cm 14 3 16 the concept is to make use of the baffle to recreate some of the frequency response time and amplitude variations human listeners experience

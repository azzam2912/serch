the book aims to be an introduction to the design and workings of computers and software with no prior knowledge required the book intends to show a layman the basic mechanical principles of how computers work instead of merely summarizing how the different parts relate he starts with basic principles of language and logic and then demonstrates how they can be embodied by electrical circuits and these principles give him an opening to describe in principle how computers work mechanically without requiring very much technical knowledge although it is not possible in a medium sized book for layman to describe the entire technical summary of a computer he describes how and why it is possible that elaborate electronics can act in the ways computers do in the introduction he contrasts his own work with those books which include pictures of trains full of 1s and 0s petzold begins with discussions of the inventions of morse code and braille adds electricity number systems boolean logic and the resulting epiphanies required to put them all together economically with these building blocks he builds circuits relays gates switches discusses the inventions of the vacuum tube transistors and finally the integrated circuit the last

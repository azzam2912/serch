from the university of louvain affiliation of authors has given the method its name the method is a greedy optimization method that appears to run in time formula 1 the inspiration for this method of community detection is the optimization of modularity as the algorithm progresses modularity is a scale value between 1 and 1 that measures the density of edges inside communities to edges outside communities optimizing this value theoretically results in the best possible grouping of the nodes of a given network however going through all possible iterations of the nodes into groups is impractical so heuristic algorithms are used in the louvain method of community detection first small communities are found by optimizing modularity locally on all nodes then each small community is grouped into one node and the first step is repeated the method is similar to the earlier method by clauset newman and moore that connects communities whose amalgamation produces the largest increase in modularity the value to be optimized is modularity defined as a value between 1 and 1 that measures the density of links inside communities compared to links between communities for a weighted graph modularity is defined as formula 2 where in

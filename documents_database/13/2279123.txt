one way to circumvent this issue is to estimate or generate regressors from observable data this generated regressor method is also applicable to unobserved instrumental variables under some regularity conditions consistency and asymptotic normality of least squares estimator is preserved but asymptotic variance has a different form in general suppose the model of interest is the following where g is a conditional mean function and its form is known up to finite dimensional parameter here formula 2 is not observable but we know that formula 3 for some function h known up to parameter formula 4 and a random sample formula 1 is available suppose we have a consistent estimator formula 6 of formula 4 that uses the observation formula 8 s then can be estimated by non linear least squares using formula 9 some examples of the above setup include anderson et al 1976 and barro 1977 this problem falls into the framework of two step m estimator and thus consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator can be verified using the general theory of two step m estimator as in general two step m estimator problem asymptotic variance of a generated regressor estimator is usually different from that

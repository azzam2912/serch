the cases can differ but the usual causes are the differing cases of visual artifacting can also differ between scheduled task s in microscopy an artifact is an apparent structural detail that is caused by the processing of the specimen and is thus not a legitimate feature of the specimen in light microscopy arteficts may be produced by air bubbles trapped under the slide s cover slip in electron microscopy distortions may be produced in the drying out of the specimen staining can cause the appearance of solid chemical deposits that may be seen as structures inside the cell different techniques including freeze fracturing and cell fractionation may be used to overcome the problems of artifacts a crush artifact is an artificial elongation and distortion seen in histopathology and cytopathology studies distortion can be caused by the slightest compression of tissue and can provide difficulties in diagnosis in projectional radiography visual artifacts that can constitute disease mimics include jewelry clothes and skin folds in magnetic resonance imaging artifacts can be classified as patient related signal processing dependent or hardware machine related

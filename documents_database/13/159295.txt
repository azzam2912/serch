in its most common application two signals are applied to a mixer and it produces new signals at the sum and difference of the original frequencies other frequency components may also be produced in a practical frequency mixer mixers are widely used to shift signals from one frequency range to another a process known as heterodyning for convenience in transmission or further signal processing for example a key component of a superheterodyne receiver is a mixer used to move received signals to a common intermediate frequency frequency mixers are also used to modulate a carrier signal in radio transmitters the essential characteristic of a mixer is that it produces a component in its output which is the product of the two input signals a device that has a non linear e g exponential characteristic can act as a mixer passive mixers use one or more diodes and rely on their non linear relation between voltage and current to provide the multiplying element in a passive mixer the desired output signal is always of lower power than the input signals active mixers use an amplifying device such as a transistor or vacuum tube to increase the strength of the product signal

troglofauna and stygofauna are the two types of subterranean fauna based on life history both are associated with subterranean environments troglofauna are associated with caves and spaces above the water table and stygofauna with water troglofaunal species include spiders insects myriapods and others some troglofauna live permanently underground and cannot survive outside the cave environment troglofauna adaptations and characteristics include a heightened sense of hearing touch and smell loss of under used senses is apparent in the lack of pigmentation as well as eyesight in most troglofauna troglofauna insects may exhibit a lack of wings and longer appendages troglofauna are divided into three main categories based on their ecology troglofauna usually live in moderate cave regions the overall climates of these caves do not significantly change throughout the year humidity in such caves is generally high ranging from 95 to 100 percent evaporation rates are low the cave ecosystem in which troglofauna reside can be divided into four zones entrance twilight transition and deep cave the entrance zone is where the surface and underground environments meet light becomes scarcer in the twilight zone the transition zone is almost completely dark however some outside environmental effects can still be felt finally

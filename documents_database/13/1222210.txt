the eonothem is not to be confused with the eon itself which is a corresponding division of geologic time spanning a specific amount of hundreds of millions of years during which rocks were formed that are classified within the eonothem eonothems have the same names as their corresponding eons which means during the history of the earth only four eonothems were formed oldest to newest these are the hadean archean proterozoic and phanerozoic a rock stratum fossil or feature present in the upper phanerozoic eonothem would therefore have originated within the later phanerozoic eon in practice the rock column is discontinuous eonothems despite discontinuities locally missing strata or unconformities can be compared to others where the rock record is more complete and by correlation of points of correspondence be fixed appropriately within the eon they are therefore useful as broad chronostratigraphic units specifying approximate age within the timelines within the rock column eonothems are subdivided into erathems and their smaller subdivisions within geology and paleobiology and their sub fields and a whole system of cross disciplinary classification by strata is in place with oversight by the international commission on stratigraphy eonothems are not often used in practice as expert dating

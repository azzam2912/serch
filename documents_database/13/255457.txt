the rhombomeres appear as a series of slightly constricted swellings in the neural tube caudal to the cephalic flexure in human embryonic development the rhombomeres are present by day 29 in the early developmental stages of the neural tube segmentation of the neuroepithelium occurs this segmentation turns into a series of neuromeres each segment is called a rhombomere every rhombomere develops its own set of ganglia and nerves later on in development rhombomeres form the rhombocephalon which forms the hindbrain in vertebrates each rhombomere expresses its own unique set of genes which has been shown to influence postnatal rhythmic behaviors such as respiration mastication and walking in mice it was shown that the patterning of the neural tube into rhombomeric segments may regulate spatial and temporal appearance of the central pattern generator rhombomeres are considered self governing developmental units with certain aspects of the rhombomere phenotype being determined at the time of formation each rhombomere expresses a unique combination of transcription factors and so each rhombomeric domain has its own distinct molecular cues that could theoretically establish rhombomere specific patterns of neuronal differentiation some of these neuronal populations have been identified in some species many of the mature hindbrain nuclei

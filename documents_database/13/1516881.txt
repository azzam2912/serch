although there are other techniques such as kahan summation that typically have even smaller round off errors pairwise summation is nearly as good differing only by a logarithmic factor while having much lower computational cost it can be implemented so as to have nearly the same cost and exactly the same number of arithmetic operations as naive summation in particular pairwise summation of a sequence of n numbers x works by recursively breaking the sequence into two halves summing each half and adding the two sums a divide and conquer algorithm its worst case roundoff errors grow asymptotically as at most o log n where is the machine precision assuming a fixed condition number as discussed below in comparison the naive technique of accumulating the sum in sequence adding each x one at a time for i 1 n has roundoff errors that grow at worst as o n kahan summation has a worst case error of roughly o independent of n but requires several times more arithmetic operations if the roundoff errors are random and in particular have random signs then they form a random walk and the error growth is reduced to an average of formula 1 for

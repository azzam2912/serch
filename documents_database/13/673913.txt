consequently it often was necessary to calculate exposure from lighting conditions the relationship of recommended photographic exposure to a scene s average luminance is given by the camera exposure equation where use of the symbol formula 4 for luminance reflects photographic industry practice at the time of asa ph2 5 1960 current si practice prefers the symbol formula 8 german sources typically used formula 9 for the relative aperture many authors now use formula 10 and formula 11 for relative aperture and exposure time recommendations for the value of the calibration constant formula 6 in applicable ansi and iso standards have varied slightly over the years this topic is discussed in greater detail under exposure meter calibration in the light meter article in an attempt to simplify choosing among combinations of equivalent camera settings the concept of exposure values german lichtwert was originally developed and proposed to other manufacturers by the german shutter manufacturer in the early 1950s combinations of shutter speed and relative aperture that resulted in the same exposure were said to have the same exposure value formula 13 a base 2 logarithmic scale defined by when applied to the left hand side of the exposure equation formula

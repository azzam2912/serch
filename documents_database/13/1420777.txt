the amount of dopant necessary to cause changes is typically very low when doped into crystalline substances the dopant s atoms get incorporated into its crystal lattice the crystalline materials are frequently either crystals of a semiconductor such as silicon and germanium for use in solid state electronics or transparent crystals for use in the production of various laser types however in some cases of the latter noncrystalline substances such as glass can also be doped with impurities in solid state electronics using the proper types and amounts of dopants in semiconductors is what produces the p type semiconductors and n type semiconductors that are essential for making transistors and diodes the procedure of doping tiny amounts of the metals chromium cr neodymium nd erbium er thulium tm ytterbium yb and a few others into transparent crystals ceramics or glasses is used to produce the active medium for solid state lasers it is in the electrons of the dopant atoms that a population inversion can be produced and this population inversion is essential for the stimulated emission of photons in the operation of all lasers in the case of the natural ruby what has occurred is that a tiny amount

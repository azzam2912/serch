when lif levels drop the cells differentiate lif derives its name from its ability to induce the terminal differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells thus preventing their continued growth other properties attributed to the cytokine include the growth promotion and cell differentiation of different types of target cells influence on bone metabolism cachexia neural development embryogenesis and inflammation p53 regulated lif has been shown to facilitate implantation in the mouse model and possibly in humans it has been suggested that recombinant human lif might help to improve the implantation rate in women with unexplained infertility lif binds to the specific lif receptor lifr which forms a heterodimer with a specific subunit common to all members of that family of receptors the gp130 signal transducing subunit this leads to activation of the jak stat janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription and mapk mitogen activated protein kinase cascades lif is normally expressed in the trophectoderm of the developing embryo with its receptor lifr expressed throughout the inner cell mass as embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass at the blastocyst stage removing them from the inner cell mass also removes their source of lif recombinant lif has been

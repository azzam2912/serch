following a standard recipe which is widely used in mathematical physics these tensor fields should also give rise to specific contributions to the stress energy tensor formula 1 a field is described by a lagrangian varying with respect to the field should give the field equations and varying with respect to the metric should give the stress energy contribution due to the field finally when all the contributions to the stress energy tensor are added up the result must be a solution of the einstein field equations written here in geometrized units where speed of light c gravitational constant g 1 in the above field equations formula 3 is the einstein tensor computed uniquely from the metric tensor which is part of the definition of a lorentzian manifold since giving the einstein tensor does not fully determine the riemann tensor but leaves the weyl tensor unspecified see the ricci decomposition the einstein equation may be considered a kind of compatibility condition the spacetime geometry must be consistent with the amount and motion of any matter or non gravitational fields in the sense that the immediate presence here and now of non gravitational energy momentum causes a proportional amount of ricci

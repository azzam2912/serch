metabolic pathways found in humans smpdb is designed specifically to support pathway elucidation and pathway discovery in metabolomics transcriptomics proteomics and systems biology it is able to do so in part by providing colorful detailed fully searchable hyperlinked diagrams of five types of small molecule pathways 1 general human metabolic pathways 2 human metabolic disease pathways 3 human metabolite signaling pathways 4 drug action pathways and 5 drug metabolism pathways smpdb pathways may be navigated viewed and zoomed interactively using a google maps like interface all smpdb pathways include information on the relevant organs subcellular compartments protein cofactors protein locations metabolite locations chemical structures and protein quaternary structures fig 1 each small molecule in smpdb is hyperlinked to detailed descriptions contained in the hmdb or drugbank and each protein or enzyme complex is hyperlinked to uniprot additionally all smpdb pathways are accompanied with detailed descriptions and references providing an overview of the pathway condition or processes depicted in each diagram users can browse the smpdb fig 2 or search its contents by text searching fig 3 sequence searching or chemical structure searching more powerful queries are also possible including searching with lists of gene or protein names drug names metabolite

together with the maxillae they comprise the hard palate palate is derived from the latin palatum the palatine bones are situated at the back of the nasal cavity between the maxilla and the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone they contribute to the walls of three cavities the floor and lateral walls of the nasal cavity the roof of the mouth and the floor of the orbits they help to form the pterygopalatine and pterygoid fossae and the inferior orbital fissures each palatine bone somewhat resembles the letter l and consists of a horizontal plate a perpendicular plate and three projecting processes the pyramidal process which is directed backward and lateral from the junction of the two parts and the orbital and sphenoidal processes which surmount the vertical part and are separated by a deep notch the sphenopalatine notch the two plates form the posterior part of the hard palate and the floor of the nasal cavity anteriorly they join with the maxillae the two horizontal plates articulate with each other at the posterior part of the median palatine suture and more anteriorly with the maxillae at the transverse palatine suture the human palatine articulates with six bones the sphenoid

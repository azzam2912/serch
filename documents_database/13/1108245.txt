the oscillator strength can be thought of as the ratio between the quantum mechanical transition rate and the classical absorption emission rate of a single electron oscillator with the same frequency as the transition an atom or a molecule can absorb light and undergo a transition from one quantum state to another the oscillator strength formula 1 of a transition from a lower state formula 2 to an upper state formula 3 may be defined by where formula 5 is the mass of an electron and formula 6 is the reduced planck constant the quantum states formula 7 1 2 are assumed to have several degenerate sub states which are labeled by formula 8 degenerate means that they all have the same energy formula 9 the operator formula 10 is the sum of the x coordinates formula 11 of all formula 12 electrons in the system etc the oscillator strength is the same for each sub state formula 14 to make equations of the previous section applicable to the states belonging to the continuum spectrum they should be rewritten in terms of matrix elements of the momentum formula 15 in absence of magnetic field the hamiltonian can be written as

the cannelure may be pressed into or cast with the bullet or case in the minie ball the purpose of the cannelure was two fold for one it changed the center of gravity of the bullet so that it would turn in flight in the direction it was falling in instead of maintaining an orientation pointing at the original line of sight from the barrel the bullet would strike its target by the point instead of being slightly misaligned the second purpose in the minie ball and often in other bullets to be fired from black powder weapons was to hold a lubricant which would reduce the rate of bore fouling by black powder residue in modern bullets such as the 7 62 illustrated here the cannelure is pressed into the circumference of the bullet to provide a strong purchase for the mouth of the cartridge case when it is crimped onto the cannelure this is done to prevent the bullet from moving either forward or backward in the case while bullet setback can be a problem with any self loading gun it can also be a problem with bolt action rifles if the cartridges used are rimmed or semi

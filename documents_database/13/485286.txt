it was capable of warping a live video stream by texture mapping it onto an arbitrary three dimensional shape around which the viewer could freely rotate or zoom in real time it could also interpolate or morph between two different shapes it was considered the first real time 3d video effects processor the mirage was programmable new shapes could be created by writing programs in the pascal programming language on an attached hewlett packard computer this made the device extremely flexible but such programming was difficult and it became a highly specialized skill known by few the programming of the hp mini computer was so complex that only basic canned effects would be practically used by video editors in productions physically the mirage was a large device whose processing equipment filled a full height 19 inch rack weighed 400 kilograms and consumed over 4 kilowatts of electrical power the quantel mirage did never before seen effects but required heavy math geometrical programming via the hp computer to define the basic shapes that real time video would be mapped onto one of the effects shown on the national association of broadcasters trade show floor to introduce the mirage was a flattened

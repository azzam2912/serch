the status of the innermost inner core as a distinct entity is contested detractors argue that anomalous data can be explained with other methods the innermost inner core model proposes a distinct laterally homogeneous anisotropic sphere within the inner core estimates differ on the size of the innermost sphere dziewonski and ishii call for a radius of 300 km trampert et al put forth a different model with a radius of 400 km the existence of distinct anisotropic spheres within the inner core would represent evidence of two distinct periods of inner core formation it has also been theorized that the anisotropy observed represents an unknown phase change in iron understanding the anisotropic structure of the innermost inner core would be an important constraint on inner core composition in 2012 lythgoe et al proposed the existence of anisotropic hemispheres within the inner core as an alternative to the innermost inner core theories the study suggests that ishii et al s conclusions were due to faulty statistical analysis and claims the data are best described by hemispheric anisotropy

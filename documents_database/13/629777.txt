human and vertebrates serve as natural hosts there are currently three species in this genus including the type species cardiovirus a diseases associated with this genus include myocarditis cardiovirus a has only one serotype while cardiovirus b consists of four viruses which are probably serologically distinct these are theiler s murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev vilyuisk human encephalomyelitis virus vhev a theiler like rat virus trv which has yet to be named and saffold virus saf v group ssrna viruses in cardiovirus are non enveloped with icosahedral spherical and round geometries and t pseudo3 symmetry the diameter is around 30 nm genomes are linear and non segmented around 7 8kb in length viral replication is cytoplasmic entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the virus to host receptors which mediates endocytosis replication follows the positive stranded rna virus replication model positive stranded rna virus transcription is the method of transcription translation takes place by 1 ribosomal frameshifting viral initiation and ribosomal skipping the virus exits the host cell by lysis and viroporins human and vertebrates serve as the natural host transmission routes are zoonosis and fomite the 3 end of the genome encodes a polya tail while the

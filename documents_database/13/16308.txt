when they do transmit nodes transmit their packet data in its entirety it is particularly important for wireless networks where the collision detection of the alternative csma cd is not possible due to wireless transmitters desensing their receivers during packet transmission csma ca is unreliable due to the hidden node problem csma ca is a protocol that operates in the data link layer layer 2 of the osi model collision avoidance is used to improve the performance of the csma method by attempting to divide the channel somewhat equally among all transmitting nodes within the collision domain although csma ca has been used in a variety of wired communication systems it is particularly beneficial in a wireless lan due to a common problem of multiple stations being able to see the access point but not each other this is due to differences in transmit power and receive sensitivity as well as distance and location with respect to the ap this will cause a station to not be able to hear another station s broadcast this is the so called hidden node or hidden station problem devices utilizing 802 11 based standards can enjoy the benefits of collision avoidance rts cts

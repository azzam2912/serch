respiratory failure occurs when inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system occurs with a low oxygen level or a high carbon dioxide level patients in acute care hospitals particularly those with respiratory conditions are at risk for developing respiratory compromise respiratory failure requiring emergency mechanical ventilation occurs in over 40 000 patients per year in the united states in postoperative patients in the united states the national surgical quality improvement program reports that 1 03 of all surgical patients require an unplanned intubation postoperatively although respiratory compromise may develop de novo during hospitalization in patients without preexisting lung disease in other patients it develops as a complication of chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd although respiratory failure is caused by a heterogeneous group of processes there are subsets of patients who manifest similar physiologic patterns of deterioration the term respiratory compromise is used to describe various intensities of respiratory dysfunction that can range from a chronic state of respiratory insufficiency to conditions that require emergency resuscitation and a breathing machine risk factors include a variety of substances conditions and environments in addition to the lung deterioration observed for the various etiologies and mechanisms of respiratory compromise

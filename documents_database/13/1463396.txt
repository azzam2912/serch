the existence of these genotypes is likely due to evolutionary pressure exerted by parasites of the genus plasmodium which cause malaria since malaria infects red blood cells these genetic changes are most commonly alterations to molecules essential for red blood cell function and therefore parasite survival such as hemoglobin or other cellular proteins or enzymes of red blood cells these alterations generally protect red blood cells from invasion by plasmodium parasites or replication of parasites within the red blood cell these inherited changes to hemoglobin or other characteristic proteins which are critical and rather invariant features of mammalian biochemistry usually cause some kind of inherited disease therefore they are commonly referred to by the names of the blood disorders associated with them including sickle cell disease thalassemia glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and others these blood disorders cause increased morbidity and mortality in areas of the world where malaria is less prevalent microscopic parasites like viruses protozoans that cause malaria and others cannot replicate on their own and rely on a host to continue their life cycles they replicate by invading the hosts cells and usurping the cellular machinery to replicate themselves eventually unchecked replication causes the cells to burst

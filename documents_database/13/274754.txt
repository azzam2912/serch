it was invented in 1874 by herbert mcleod 1841 1923 mcleod gauges were once commonly found attached to equipment that operates under vacuum such as a lyophilizer today however these gauges have largely been replaced by electronic vacuum gauges the design of a mcleod gauge is somewhat similar to that of a mercury column manometer typically it is filled with mercury if used incorrectly this mercury can escape and contaminate the vacuum system attached to the gauge mcleod gauges operate by taking in a sample volume of gas from a vacuum chamber then compressing it by tilting and infilling with mercury the pressure in this smaller volume is then measured by a mercury manometer and knowing the compression ratio the ratio of the initial and final volumes the pressure of the original vacuum can be determined by applying boyle s law this method is fairly accurate for non condensible gases such as oxygen and nitrogen however condensible gases such as water vapour ammonia carbon dioxide and pump oil vapors may be in gaseous form in the low pressure of the vacuum chamber but will condense when compressed by the mcleod gauge the result is an erroneous reading showing a pressure

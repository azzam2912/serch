let and be the interior angles at the vertices of the triangle if any of and are greater than zero then the schwarz triangle function can be given in terms of hypergeometric functions as where a 1 2 b 1 2 c 1 a a c 1 1 2 b b c 1 1 2 and c 2 c 1 this mapping has singular points at z 0 1 and corresponding to the vertices of the triangle with angles and respectively at these singular points formula 2 and formula 3 this formula can be derived using the schwarzian derivative this function can be used to map the upper half plane to a spherical triangle on the riemann sphere if 1 or a hyperbolic triangle on the poincar disk if schwarz christoffel transformation in the special case of ideal triangles where all the angles are zero the triangle function yields the modular lambda function this function was introduced by h a schwarz as the inverse function of the conformal mapping uniformizing a schwarz triangle applying successive hyperbolic reflections in its sides such a triangle generates a tessellation of the upper half plane or the unit disk after composition with the cayley

the flash point is sometimes confused with the autoignition temperature the temperature that results in spontaneous autoignition the fire point is the lowest temperature at which vapors of the material will keep burning after the ignition source is removed the fire point is higher than the flash point because at the flash point more vapor may not be produced rapidly enough to sustain combustion neither flash point nor fire point depends directly on the ignition source temperature but ignition source temperature is far higher than either the flash or fire point the flash point is a descriptive characteristic that is used to distinguish between flammable fuels such as petrol gasoline in the us and combustible fuels such as diesel it is also used to characterize the fire hazards of fuels fuels which have a flash point less than are called flammable whereas fuels having a flash point above that temperature are called combustible all liquids have a specific vapor pressure which is a function of that liquid s temperature and is subject to boyle s law as temperature increases vapor pressure increases as vapor pressure increases the concentration of vapor of a flammable or combustible liquid in the air increases

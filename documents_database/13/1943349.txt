with the rising tension between the greeks and the jews the alexandrines had organized a public assembly to deliberate about an embassy to nero and a great number of jews came flocking to the amphitheater when the alexandrines saw the jews they attacked them they killed the majority of the jews and those who were captured were burned alive the jews wanted retaliation for what the greeks had done and threatened to do it with violence however tiberius julius alexander governor of the city was able to restrain them tiberius privately sent for the principal men of the jews and convinced them to be quiet and not provoke the roman army against them but the seditious did not take the threat seriously and reproached him for so uttering threats the governor now understood that those who were most riotous would not be pacified unless some great calamity would overtake them he sent out the two roman legions that were in the city legio iii cyrenaica and the legio xxii deiotariana together with 5 000 other soldiers to punish the jews they were permitted not only to kill them but to plunder them of what they had and to set fire

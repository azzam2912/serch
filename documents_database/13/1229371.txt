consider a simple example where we draw three points on a plane and calculate the distance between each of the three points if the points are placed randomly then in general all of these distances will be different however if the points are arranged so that a rotation by 120 degrees leaves the picture invariant then the distances between them will all be equal as this situation obviously describes an equilateral triangle the observed degeneracy boils down to the fact that the system has a d symmetry in quantum mechanics calculations at least formally boil down to the diagonalization of hermitian matrices in particular the hamiltonian or in the continuous case the solution of linear differential equations again observed degeneracies in the eigenspectrum are a consequence of discrete or continuous symmetries in the latter case noether s theorem also guarantees a conserved current accidental symmetry is the name given to observed degeneracies that are apparently not a consequence of symmetry the term is misleading as often the observed degeneracy is not accidental at all and is a consequence of a hidden symmetry which is not immediately obvious from the hamiltonian in a given basis the non relativistic hydrogen atoms a

the cep89 gene produces a 54 4 kda protein composed of 476 amino acids the structure of the protein has been found to be similar to a ring it is associated and dependent on the orientation of centrioles which are attached in the exterior region the protein contains two coiled coil domains and a putative mitochondrial targeting signal experiments have shown that cep89 is found within the intermembrane space as well as the cytosol of the mitochondria the cep89 gene encodes for a protein required for ciliogenesis it plays a role in mitochondrial metabolism by modulating complex iv activity cep89 has also been shown to be responsible for the integrity of the mitochondria membrane depolarization synaptic transmission of photoreceptor neurons and for the synaptic organization of the larval neuromuscular junction variants of cep89 have been associated with the mitochonrdial complex iv deficiency a deficiency in an enzyme complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain which catalyzes the oxidation of cytochrome c utilizing molecular oxygen the deficiency is characterized by heterogeneous phenotypes ranging from isolated myopathy to severe multisystem disease affecting several tissues and organs other clinical manifestations include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction hypotonia muscle weakness exercise intolerance developmental delay

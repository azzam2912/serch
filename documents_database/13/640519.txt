more specifically an formula 1 king s graph is a king s graph of an formula 1 chessboard it is the map graph formed from the squares of a chessboard by making a vertex for each square and an edge for each two squares that share an edge or a corner it can also be constructed as the strong product of two path graphs for a formula 1 king s graph the total number of vertices is formula 4 and the number of edges is formula 5 for a square formula 6 king s graph the total number of vertices is formula 7 and the total number of edges is formula 8 the neighbourhood of a vertex in the king s graph corresponds to the moore neighborhood for cellular automata a generalization of the king s graph called a kinggraph is formed from a squaregraph a planar graph in which each bounded face is a quadrilateral and each interior vertex has at least four neighbors by adding the two diagonals of every quadrilateral face of the squaregraph

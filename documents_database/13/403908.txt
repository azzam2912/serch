each such chemical has at least one silicon chlorine bond trichlorosilane is produced on the largest scale the parent chlorosilane is silicon tetrachloride they are prepared by the m ller rochow process which involves treating silicon with hydrogen chloride at elevated temperatures in the presence of a copper catalyst the idealized equation is trichlorosilane hsicl is the main product dichlorosilane hsicl and silicon tetrachloride sicl are obtained as byproducts the process was independently discovered by eugene g rochow and richard m ller in 1940 methyltrichlorosilane chsicl dimethyldichlorosilane ch sicl and trimethylsilyl chloride ch sicl are produced by the direct process they are key reagents in organosilicon chemistry chlorosilanes react with water to produce hydrogen chloride giving siloxanes and eventually silicon dioxide in the case of trimethylsilyl chloride the hydrolyzed product is hexamethyldisiloxane the analogous reaction of dimethyldichlorosilane gives siloxane polymers or rings silicon tetrachloride and trichlorosilane are intermediates in the production of ultrapure silicon in the semiconductor industry chlorosilanes obtained from crude silicon are purified by fractional distillation techniques and then reduced with hydrogen to give silicon of purity organic chlorosilanes are frequently used as coatings for silicon and glass surfaces and in the production of silicone polysiloxane polymers while

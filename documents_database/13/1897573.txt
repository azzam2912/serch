this spontaneous organization can be due to direct specific interaction collective effects and or occur indirectly through their environment this definition mirrors the one provided by nature com and is applicable to a variety of components regardless of their dimensions the thermodynamics based definition of self assembly was introduced by nicholas a kotov and describes self assembly as a process where components of the system acquire non random spatial distribution with respect to each other and the boundaries of the system this definition allows one to account for mass and energy fluxes taking place in the self assembly processes and is specifically applicable to the processes of spontaneous organization of nanoparticles with each other and with the boundaries of the system due to the proliferation of nanoparticle synthesis techniques the study and design of nanoparticle self assembly has become widespread the spatial arrangements of these self assembled nanoparticles can be potentially used to build increasingly complex structures leading to a wide variety of materials that can be used for different purposes at the molecular level intermolecular force hold the spontaneous gathering of molecules into a well defined and stable structure together in chemical solutions self assembly is an outcome of

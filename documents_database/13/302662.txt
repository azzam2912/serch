a computer may also be said to act as a diskless node if its disks are unused and network booting is used diskless nodes or computers acting as such are sometimes known as network computers or hybrid clients hybrid client may either just mean diskless node or it may be used in a more particular sense to mean a diskless node which runs some but not all applications remotely as in the thin client computing architecture advantages of diskless nodes can include lower production cost lower running costs quieter operation and manageability advantages for example centrally managed software installation in many universities and in some large organizations pcs are used in a similar configuration with some or all applications stored remotely but executed locally again for manageability reasons however these are not diskless nodes if they still boot from a local hard drive diskless nodes process data thus using their own cpu and ram to run software but do not store data persistently that task is handed off to a server this is distinct from thin clients in which all significant processing happens remotely on the server the only software that runs on a thin client is the thin i

this is a widely used method for classifying streams and rivers based on common patterns of channel morphology the specific objectives of this stream classification system are as follows 1 predict a rivers behavior from its appearance 2 develop specific hydrologic and sediment relationships for a given stream type and its state 3 provide mechanisms to extrapolate site specific data to stream reaches having similar characteristics and 4 provide a consistent frame of reference for communicating stream morphology and condition among a variety of disciplines and interested parties these objectives are met through rosgen s four hierarchical levels i iv of river morphology level i categorize stream types into letters a g based on their geomorphic characteristics that result from the integration of basin relief land form and valley morphology this is a general way in which the morphology of a stream can be described many of the level i criteria can be determined through topographic and landform maps aerial imagery and geospatial data level ii characterizes stream type by using numbers 1 6 in addition to letters a g to include the assessments of the channel cross section longitudinal profile and plan form pattern cross section measurements include a

settlers with large herds of sheep and cattle were pushing beyond the official limits of location into the grasslands that had been maintained for thousands of years through aboriginal firestick farming conflict with resident aboriginals and disputes between the pastoralists in these frontier areas forced the government of new south wales in 1839 to legislate for a new paramilitary policing body that would control these issues this force was called the border police the border police was organised into a number of sections and these were deployed to the various districts along the frontier each section was under the authority of the commissioner of crown lands for that particular district and each commissioner had about 10 troopers to enforce colonial rule in order to reduce the cost of the force as much as possible the troopers were taken from the population of convicts that existed in the colony at that time the convicts assigned were usually ex soldiers who had been transported to australia due to crimes of military indiscipline they were supplied with horses equipment and rations but were otherwise unpaid and had to construct their own barracks the force was funded by a levy imposed on the squatters

the doublet earthquake registered respective magnitudes of 6 0 and 5 9 on the moment magnitude scale the earthquakes were located at a depth of and tremors continued to be felt more than three months after the initial shocks the tectonic structure of south central oregon is riddled with fault lines the west klamath lake fault zone is capable of earthquakes up to richter magnitude 7 3 the magnitude 5 4 coos bay earthquake which preceded a later 2002 klamath falls earthquake occurred along the northern segment of the blanco fracture zone which is separate from the inland klamath basin and range geological province these fault networks have caused several previous earthquakes in the klamath falls area records from 1945 indicate approximately fifteen seismic events prior to the 1993 events circulating within a radius of klamath falls however of those observed during the preceding fifty years only six were considered significant previously most tremors measured less than 4 m with the strongest being 4 3 m in 1948 the september 1993 earthquakes began striking at approximately 8 16 p m local time the first major quake registered 5 9 on the moment magnitude scale with a foreshock registering 4 2

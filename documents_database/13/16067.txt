in type theory every term has a type and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type type theory is closely related to and in some cases overlaps with type systems which are a programming language feature used to reduce bugs type theory was created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal logics and rewrite systems two well known type theories that can serve as mathematical foundations are alonzo church s typed calculus and per martin l f s intuitionistic type theory between 1902 and 1908 bertrand russell proposed various theories of type in response to his discovery that gottlob frege s version of naive set theory was afflicted with russell s paradox by 1908 russell arrived at a ramified theory of types together with an axiom of reducibility both of which featured prominently in whitehead and russell s principia mathematica published between 1910 and 1913 they attempted to resolve russell s paradox by first creating a hierarchy of types then assigning each concrete mathematical and possibly other entity to a type entities of a given type are built exclusively from entities of those types that are lower in their hierarchy thus preventing an entity from being assigned

the plasmid contains several reporter genes most notably for the green fluorescent protein gfp and the ampicillin resistance gene gfp was isolated from the jelly fish aequorea victoria because it shares a bidirectional promoter with a gene for metabolizing arabinose the gfp gene is expressed in the presence of arabinose which makes the transgenic organism express its fluorescence under uv light gfp can be induced in bacteria containing the pglo plasmid by growing them on arabinose plates pglo is made by bio rad laboratories pglo is made up of three genes that are joined together using recombinant dna technology they are as follows like most other circular plasmids the pglo plasmid contains an origin ori which is a region of the plasmid where replication will originate the pglo plasmid was made famous by researchers in france who used it to produce a green fluorescent rabbit named alba other features on pglo like most other plasmids include a selectable marker ori origin of replication and an mcs multiple cloning site located at the end of the gfp gene the plasmid is 5371 base pairs long in supercoiled form it runs on an agarose gel in the 4200 4500 range

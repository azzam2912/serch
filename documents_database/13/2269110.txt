chkareuli is primarily known for family symmetries extended grand unified theories and emergent gauge and gravity theories these developments include an introduction of the chiral family symmetry su 3 for quark lepton generations and its application to the flavor mixing of quarks and leptons a novel missing vev mechanism in the supersymmetric su 8 grand unified theory suggesting a simultaneous solution to the gauge hierarchy problem and unification of flavor new nonlinear sigma models for emergent gauge and gravity theories leading to dynamical generation of local internal and spacetime symmetries with gauge fields and gravitons as massless vector tensor goldstone bosons conferences and symposia j l chkareuli was an organizer and co organizer of some notable conferences and workshops on high energy physics annual georgian winter school on particle physics and cosmology bakuriani georgia 1970 1993 having been one of the most popular scientific meetings in the ussr international seminar standard model and beyond tbilisi 1996 international conference low dimensional physics and gauge principles yerevan tbilisi 2011 he also was an invited speaker at many leading particle physics conferences including ichep 1994 1998 in glasgow and vancouver quarks 2000 in saint petersburg susy 2012 in beijing and others royal society

paralogs of this gene include fam129a and fam129b its aliases include b cell novel protein 1 bcnp1 and family with sequence similarity 129 member c fam129c the fam129c gene is 30 538 base pairs long and is mapped to 19p 13 112 on chromosome 19 nc 000019 10 from 17523301 to 17553839 in humans chromosome 19 has highest gene density of all human chromosomes and large clustered gene families corresponding to high g c content cpg islands and high density repetitive dna suggest evolutionary significance for genes located here based on location and expression of fam129c gene this would suggest it has a role in immune system function true orthologs of fam129c seem to be highly conserved in mammals reptiles marsupials bony and cartilaginous fish the most distant ortholog of fam129c were found to be in a cellular slime mould polysphondyllum pallidum and even a species of barley hordeum vulgare in normal tissues the highest expression was in lymph bone marrow and spleen tissue with low expression in other parts of the human body fam129c contains pleckstrin homology domain that may cause the protein to associate with the plasma membrane it is expressed in early stages of b cell differentiation

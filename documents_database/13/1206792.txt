the cause s for the failure can be linked to improper design poor construction or lack of expertise all countries that have had a nuclear weapons testing program have experienced some fizzles a fizzle can spread radioactive material throughout the surrounding area involve a partial fission reaction of the fissile material or both for practical purposes a fizzle can still have considerable explosive yield when compared to conventional weapons in multistage fission fusion weapons full yield of the fission primary that fails to initiate fusion ignition in the fusion secondary is also considered a fizzle as the weapon failed to reach its design yield despite the fission primary working correctly such fizzles can have very high yields as in the case of castle koon where the secondary stage of a device with a 1 megaton design fizzled but its primary still generated a yield of 110 kilotons if a deuterium tritium mixture is placed at the center of the device to be compressed and heated by the fission explosion a fission yield of 250 tons is sufficient to cause d t fusion releasing high energy fusion neutrons which will then fission much of the remaining fission fuel this is known

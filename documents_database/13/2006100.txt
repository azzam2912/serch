it will be powered by four rl10c 3 engines burning liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to produce a total of thrust the sls block 1b will provide thrust of the eus is expected to first fly on artemis 3 the block 1 configuration of sls will have a core stage powered by four rs 25 engines two space shuttle derived five segment solid rocket boosters and an interim cryogenic propulsion stage upper stage nasa will develop the eus to increase sls performance beyond block 1 specifications the improved upper stage was originally named the dual use upper stage duus pronounced duce but was later renamed the exploration upper stage eus due to duus sounding like a profanity in japanese in 2014 nasa announced that it would proceed with development of block 1b with the eus in april 2016 it was reported that nasa has chosen to use a design based on four rl10 c3 engines for the eus and in october 2016 nasa confirmed they had ordered 10 of the engines the eus is to complete the sls s ascent phase and then re ignite to send its payload to destinations beyond low earth orbit this is a similar function

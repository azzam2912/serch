it is defined as the polarity produced in the molecule by the interaction of two pi bonds or between a pi bond and lone pair of electrons present on an adjacent atom the effect is used in a qualitative way and describes the electron withdrawing or releasing properties of substituents based on relevant resonance structures and is symbolized by the letter m the mesomeric effect is negative m when the substituent is an electron withdrawing group and the effect is positive m when the substituent is an electron releasing group m effect orders o nh nhr or nhcor ocor ph f cl br i m effect order no cn s o 2 oh cho c o coocor coor cooh conh coo the net electron flow from or to the substituent is determined also by the inductive effect the mesomeric effect as a result of p orbital overlap resonance has absolutely no effect on this inductive effect as the inductive effect has purely to do with the electronegativity of the atoms and their topology in the molecule which atoms are connected to which the concepts of mesomeric effect mesomerism and mesomer were introduced by ingold in 1938 as an alternative to

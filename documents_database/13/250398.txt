amorphous carbon materials may be stabilized by terminating dangling bonds with hydrogen as with other amorphous solids some short range order can be observed amorphous carbon is often abbreviated to ac for general amorphous carbon ac h or hac for hydrogenated amorphous carbon or to ta c for tetrahedral amorphous carbon also called diamond like carbon in mineralogy amorphous carbon is the name used for coal soot carbide derived carbon and other impure forms of carbon that are neither graphite nor diamond in a crystallographic sense however the materials are not truly amorphous but rather polycrystalline materials of graphite or diamond within an amorphous carbon matrix commercial carbon also usually contains significant quantities of other elements which may also form crystalline impurities with the development of modern thin film deposition and growth techniques in the latter half of the 20th century such as chemical vapour deposition sputter deposition and cathodic arc deposition it became possible to fabricate truly amorphous carbon materials true amorphous carbon has localized electrons as opposed to the aromatic bonds in graphite and its bonds form with lengths and distances that are inconsistent with any other allotrope of carbon it also contains a high concentration of dangling

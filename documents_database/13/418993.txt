it is a white crystalline material but often is encountered in an impure form that is brown and non crystalline powder it is generated industrially in the production of metallic iron mgs is formed by the reaction of sulfur or hydrogen sulfide with magnesium it crystallizes in the rock salt structure as its most stable phase its zinc blende and wurtzite structures can be prepared by molecular beam epitaxy the chemical properties of mgs resemble those of related ionic sulfides such as those of sodium barium or calcium it reacts with oxygen to form the corresponding sulfate magnesium sulfate mgs reacts with water to give hydrogen sulfide and magnesium hydroxide in the bos steelmaking process sulfur is the first element to be removed sulfur is removed from the impure blast furnace iron by the addition of several hundred kilograms of magnesium powder by a lance magnesium sulfide is formed which then floats on the molten iron and is removed mgs is a wide band gap direct semiconductor of interest as a blue green emitter a property that has been known since the early 1900s the wide band gap property also allows the use of mgs as photo detector for short

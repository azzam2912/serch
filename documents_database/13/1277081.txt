for example bergapten has been extracted from 24 species of the genus heracleum in the family apiaceae in the family rutaceae various citrus species contain significant amounts of bergapten especially the papeda citrus micrantha the bergamot orange c bergamia and certain varieties of lime and bitter orange bergapten belongs to a class of chemical compounds known as the furanocoumarins in 1834 kalbrunner isolated 5 methoxypsoralen from bergamot essential oil hence the common name bergapten it was the first furanocoumarin to be isolated and identified bergapten is a derivative of psoralen the parent compound of a family of naturally occurring organic compounds known as the linear furanocoumarins so called since they exhibit a linear chemical structure some of the linear furanocoumarins including bergapten act as strong photosensitizers when applied topically to the skin bergapten is often found in plants associated with phytophotodermatitis a potentially serious skin inflammation contact with plant parts containing bergapten and other linear furanocoumarins followed by exposure to ultraviolet light may lead to phytophotodermatitis in particular bergapten appears to be the primary phototoxic compound responsible for citrus induced phytophotodermatitis bergapten and other linear furanocoumarins induce a loss of template activity for rna synthesis 5 methoxypsoralen has also been

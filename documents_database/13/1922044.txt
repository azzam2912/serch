as the unit moves around and new coordinates are therefore determined the map moves to keep its position at the center of the display mechanical moving map displays using paper charts were first introduced in the 1950s and became common in some roles during the 1960s mechanically moved paper maps were replaced by digital maps during the 1970s and 80s with resolution and detail improving along with computer imagery and the computer memory systems that held the data a common example of a moving map display today is the map display in a smart phone which uses gps to determine its current position and then recalls the map data from the device s memory or from the internet in real time a symbol representing the location of the gps device carried by a person or inside a vehicle remains stationary on the display screen while a map or chart image moves beneath the symbol the display thus portrays the physical movement of the device on the displayed map or chart the portrayal typically shows a simulated overhead view of the device location on the moving map but some devices also simulate a three dimensional view from the perspective of the

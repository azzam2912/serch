the spectral lines include some in the visible light and they extend into ultraviolet the lines get closer and closer together as the frequency increases never exceeding the series limit the sharp series was important in the development of the understanding of electron shells and subshells in atoms the sharp series has given the letter s to the s atomic orbital or subshell the sharp series has a limit given by formula 1 the series is caused by transitions from the lowest p state to higher energy s orbitals one terminology to identify the lines is 1p ms but note that 1p just means the lowest p state in an atom and that the modern designation would start at 2p and is larger for higher atomic numbered atoms the terms can have different designations ms for single line systems m for doublets and ms for triplets since the p state is not the lowest energy level for the alkali atom the s is the sharp series will not show up as absorption in a cool gas however it shows up as emission lines the rydberg correction is largest for the s term as the electron penetrates the inner core of

the technique allows the production of light pulses with extremely high gigawatt peak power much higher than would be produced by the same laser if it were operating in a continuous wave constant output mode compared to modelocking another technique for pulse generation with lasers q switching leads to much lower pulse repetition rates much higher pulse energies and much longer pulse durations the two techniques are sometimes applied together q switching was first proposed in 1958 by gordon gould and independently discovered and demonstrated in 1961 or 1962 by r w hellwarth and f j mcclung using electrically switched kerr cell shutters in a ruby laser q switching is achieved by putting some type of variable attenuator inside the laser s optical resonator when the attenuator is functioning light which leaves the gain medium does not return and lasing cannot begin this attenuation inside the cavity corresponds to a decrease in the q factor or quality factor of the optical resonator a high q factor corresponds to low resonator losses per roundtrip and vice versa the variable attenuator is commonly called a q switch when used for this purpose initially the laser medium is pumped while the q switch

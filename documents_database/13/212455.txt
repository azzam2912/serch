at room temperature it is a bright yellow odorless crystalline solid that becomes orange and red when heated it was formerly called plumbous iodide the compound currently has a few specialized applications such as the manufacture of solar cells and x ray and gamma ray detectors its preparation is a popular demonstration in basic chemistry education to teach topics such as precipitation reactions and stoichiometry it is decomposed by light at moderately high temperatures and this effect has been used in a patented photographic process lead iodide was formerly employed as a yellow pigment in some paints with the name iodide yellow however that use has been largely discontinued due to its toxicity and poor stability is commonly synthesized via a precipitation reaction between potassium iodide and lead ii nitrate in water solution while the potassium nitrate is soluble the lead iodide is nearly insoluble at room temperature and thus precipitates out other soluble salts containing lead ii and iodide can be used instead for example lead ii acetate and sodium iodide the compound can also be synthesized by reacting iodine vapor with molten lead between 500 and 700 c a thin film of can also be prepared by depositing

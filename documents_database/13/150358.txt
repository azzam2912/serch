it possesses an inner cell mass icm which subsequently forms the embryo the outer layer of the blastocyst consists of cells collectively called the trophoblast this layer surrounds the inner cell mass and a fluid filled cavity known as the blastocoel the trophoblast gives rise to the placenta the name blastocyst arises from the greek blastos a sprout and kystis bladder capsule in humans blastocyst formation begins about 5 days after fertilization when a fluid filled cavity opens up in the morula a ball of cells the blastocyst has a diameter of about 0 1 0 2 mm and comprises 200 300 cells following rapid cleavage cell division about 1 day after blastocyst formation 5 6 days post fertilization which is when the blastocyst usually reaches the uterus the blastocyst begins to embed into the endometrium of the uterine wall where it will undergo further developmental processes including gastrulation embedding of the blastocyst into the endometrium requires that it hatches from the zona pellucida which prevents adherence to the fallopian tube as the pre embryo makes its way to the uterus the blastocyst is completely embedded in the endometrium only 11 12 days after fertilization the use of blastocysts in

it is developed from the primary oocyte by maturation oogenesis is initiated in the embryonic stage in mammals the first part of oogenesis starts in the germinal epithelium which gives rise to the development of ovarian follicles the functional unit of the ovary oogenesis consists of several sub processes oocytogenesis ootidogenesis and finally maturation to form an ovum oogenesis proper folliculogenesis is a separate sub process that accompanies and supports all three oogenetic sub processes oogonium oocytogenesis primary oocyte meiosis i first polar body discarded afterward secondary oocyte meiosis ii second polar body discarded afterward ovum oocyte meiosis important to all animal life cycles yet unlike all other instances of animal cell division occurs completely without the aid of spindle coordinating centrosomes the creation of oogonia traditionally doesn t belong to oogenesis proper but instead to the common process of gametogenesis which in the female human begins with the processes of folliculogenesis oocytogenesis and ootidogenesis oogonia enter meiosis during embryonic development becoming oocytes meiosis begins with dna replication and meiotic crossing over it then stops in early prophase mammalian oocytes are maintained in meiotic prophase arrest for a very long time months in mice years in humans initially the arrest

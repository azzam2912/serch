the scalar may either be a dimensionless mathematical number or a physical quantity in a physical context scalar fields are required to be independent of the choice of reference frame meaning that any two observers using the same units will agree on the value of the scalar field at the same absolute point in space or spacetime regardless of their respective points of origin examples used in physics include the temperature distribution throughout space the pressure distribution in a fluid and spin zero quantum fields such as the higgs field these fields are the subject of scalar field theory mathematically a scalar field on a region u is a real or complex valued function or distribution on u the region u may be a set in some euclidean space minkowski space or more generally a subset of a manifold and it is typical in mathematics to impose further conditions on the field such that it be continuous or often continuously differentiable to some order a scalar field is a tensor field of order zero and the term scalar field may be used to distinguish a function of this kind with a more general tensor field density or differential form physically

it was the company s first sampler and despite its low quality and technical limitations by modern standards marked a shift toward affordable samplers of better quality than its predecessors it is also considered to be one of the earliest multitimbral samplers using the technology developed for the 2000 sequential also produced the prophet 2002 a rack mounted version of the 2000 and the studio 440 a drum machine and sequencer that used a similar sampler at its core the prophet 3000 a rack mounted elaboration upon the 2000 and 2002 was released in limited quantities prior to the collapse of sequential the prophet 2000 was preceded by early samplers such as the ensoniq mirage and the e mu emulator which both helped to introduce samplers into general markets this was in part due to their incorporation of manipulation techniques familiar to users of analog synthesizers however these samplers operated at low fidelity with only 8 bits of depth the emulator ii was also an expensive machine at the time the prophet 2000 introduced a higher audio resolution at 12 bits and retailed for about making it relatively affordable the prophet 2000 was first demonstrated at the italian music fair

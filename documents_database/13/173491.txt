this game is played by three or more players all players start with six lives usually the players use a die to keep track of their lives counting down from 6 to 1 as they lose lives the first player rolls the dice and keeps their value concealed from the other players in or under the container the player then has three choices the concealed dice are then passed to the next player in a clockwise fashion the receiving player now has two options some players play with a third option pass the dice to the next player without rolling or looking at them announcing the same or a higher value this relieves the original passer of all responsibility this choice rests on the assumption that the previous player announced a lesser value than they rolled which may be a sensible choice if they want to get at a player further down the line note that each player must always announce a value greater than the previous value announced unless she or he is passed a mia in which case the round ends if mia is announced the next player has two choices the first player to lose all of

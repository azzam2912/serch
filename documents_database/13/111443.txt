to each point on a riemannian manifold it assigns a single real number determined by the intrinsic geometry of the manifold near that point specifically the scalar curvature represents the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball in a riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in euclidean space in two dimensions the scalar curvature is twice the gaussian curvature and completely characterizes the curvature of a surface in more than two dimensions however the curvature of riemannian manifolds involves more than one functionally independent quantity in general relativity the scalar curvature is the lagrangian density for the einstein hilbert action the euler lagrange equations for this lagrangian under variations in the metric constitute the vacuum einstein field equations and the stationary metrics are known as einstein metrics the scalar curvature of an n manifold is defined as the trace of the ricci tensor and it can be defined as n n 1 times the average of the sectional curvatures at a point at first sight the scalar curvature in dimension at least 3 seems to be a weak invariant with little influence on the global geometry of a manifold but in fact some deep

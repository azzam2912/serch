there are two main types of volcanic dams those created by the flow of molten lava and those created by the primary or secondary deposition of pyroclastic material and debris this classification generally excludes other often larger and longer lived dam type geologic features separately termed crater lakes although these volcanic centers may be associated with the source of material for volcanic dams and the lowest portion of its confining rim may be considered as such a dam especially if the lake level within the crater is relatively high volcanic dams generally occur worldwide in association with former and active volcanic provinces and are known to have existed in the geologic record in historic times and occur in the present day their removal or failure is similarly recorded the longevity and extent varies widely having periods ranging from a few days weeks or years to several hundred thousand years or more and dimensions ranging from a few meters to hundreds to several thousand the emplacement internal structure distribution and longevity of such dams can be related variously to the amount rapidity and duration of primary geothermal energy released and the rock material made available other considerations include the rock types

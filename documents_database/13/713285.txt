the number of useful information bits delivered by the network to a certain destination per unit of time the amount of data considered excludes protocol overhead bits as well as retransmitted data packets this is related to the amount of time from the first bit of the first packet sent or delivered until the last bit of the last packet is delivered for example if a file is transferred the goodput that the user experiences corresponds to the file size in bits divided by the file transfer time the goodput is always lower than the throughput the gross bit rate that is transferred physically which generally is lower than network access connection speed the channel capacity or bandwidth examples of factors that cause lower goodput than throughput are imagine that a file is being transferred using http over a switched ethernet connection with a total channel capacity of 100 megabits per second the file cannot be transferred over ethernet as a single continuous stream instead it must be broken down into individual chunks these chunks must be no larger than the maximum transmission unit of ip over ethernet which is 1500 bytes each packet requires 20 bytes of ipv4 header

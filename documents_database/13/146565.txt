these include the representation via von neumann ordinals commonly employed in axiomatic set theory and a system based on equinumerosity that was proposed by gottlob frege and by bertrand russell in zermelo fraenkel zf set theory the natural numbers are defined recursively by letting be the empty set and for each n in this way n 0 1 n 1 for each natural number n the first few numbers defined this way are the set n of natural numbers is defined in this system as the smallest set containing 0 and closed under the successor function s defined by s n n n the structure n 0 s is a model of the peano axioms the existence of the set n follows from the axiom of infinity in zf set theory the set n and its elements when constructed this way are an initial part of the von neumann ordinals gottlob frege and bertrand russell each proposed defining a natural number n as the collection of all sets with n elements more formally a natural number is an equivalence class of finite sets under the equivalence relation of equinumerosity this definition may appear circular but it is not because equinumerosity

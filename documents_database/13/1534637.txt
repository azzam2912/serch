n watson 1918 p 133 has significant application within the theory on the asymptotic behavior of integrals let formula 1 be fixed assume formula 2 where formula 3 has an infinite number of derivatives in the neighborhood of formula 4 with formula 5 and formula 6 suppose in addition either that where formula 8 are independent of formula 9 or that then it is true that for all positive formula 11 that and that the following asymptotic equivalence holds see for instance for the original proof or for a more recent development we will prove the version of watson s lemma which assumes that formula 14 has at most exponential growth as formula 15 the basic idea behind the proof is that we will approximate formula 3 by finitely many terms of its taylor series since the derivatives of formula 17 are only assumed to exist in a neighborhood of the origin we will essentially proceed by removing the tail of the integral applying taylor s theorem with remainder in the remaining small interval then adding the tail back on in the end at each step we will carefully estimate how much we are throwing away or adding on this

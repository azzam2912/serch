examples of these causes include faults at power stations damage to electric transmission lines substations or other parts of the distribution system a short circuit cascading failure fuse or circuit breaker operation power failures are particularly critical at sites where the environment and public safety are at risk institutions such as hospitals sewage treatment plants and mines will usually have backup power sources such as standby generators which will automatically start up when electrical power is lost other critical systems such as telecommunication are also required to have emergency power the battery room of a telephone exchange usually has arrays of lead acid batteries for backup and also a socket for connecting a generator during extended periods of outage power outages are categorized into three different phenomena relating to the duration and effect of the outage in power supply networks the power generation and the electrical load demand must be very close to equal every second to avoid overloading of network components which can severely damage them protective relays and fuses are used to automatically detect overloads and to disconnect circuits at risk of damage under certain conditions a network component shutting down can cause current fluctuations in neighboring segments

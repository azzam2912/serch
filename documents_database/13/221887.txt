for example the gaussian family is conjugate to itself or self conjugate with respect to a gaussian likelihood function if the likelihood function is gaussian choosing a gaussian prior over the mean will ensure that the posterior distribution is also gaussian this means that the gaussian distribution is a conjugate prior for the likelihood that is also gaussian the concept as well as the term conjugate prior were introduced by howard raiffa and robert schlaifer in their work on bayesian decision theory a similar concept had been discovered independently by george alfred barnard consider the general problem of inferring a continuous distribution for a parameter given some datum or data x from bayes theorem the posterior distribution is equal to the product of the likelihood function formula 1 and prior formula 2 normalized divided by the probability of the data formula 3 let the likelihood function be considered fixed the likelihood function is usually well determined from a statement of the data generating process it is clear that different choices of the prior distribution p may make the integral more or less difficult to calculate and the product p x p may take one algebraic form or another for certain

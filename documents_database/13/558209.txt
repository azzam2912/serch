the specification of iec 61499 defines a generic model for distributed control systems and is based on the iec 61131 standard the concepts of iec 61499 are also explained by lewis and zoitl as well as vyatkin iec 61499 1 defines the architecture for distributed systems in iec 61499 the cyclic execution model of iec 61131 is replaced by an event driven execution model the event driven execution model allows an explicit specification of the execution order of function blocks if necessary periodically executed applications can be implemented by using the e cycle function block for the generation of periodic events as described in annex a of iec 61499 1 iec 61499 enables an application centric design in which one or more applications defined by networks of interconnected function blocks are created for the whole system and subsequently distributed to the available devices all devices within a system are described within a device model the topology of the system is reflected by the system model the distribution of an application is described within the mapping model therefore applications of a system are distributable but maintained together like iec 61131 3 function blocks iec 61499 function block types specify both an

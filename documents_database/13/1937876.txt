metal catalyzed c h borylation reactions utilize transition metals to directly convert a c h bond into a c b bond this route can be advantageous compared to traditional borylation reactions by making use of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon starting material limiting prefunctionalized organic compounds reducing toxic byproducts and streamlining the synthesis of biologically important molecules boronic acids and boronic esters are common boryl groups incorporated into organic molecules through borylation reactions boronic acids are trivalent boron containing organic compounds that possess one alkyl substituent and two hydroxyl groups similarly boronic esters possess one alkyl substituent and two ester groups boronic acids and esters are classified depending on the type of carbon group r directly bonded to boron for example alkyl alkenyl alkynyl and aryl boronic esters the most common type of starting materials that incorporate boronic esters into organic compounds for transition metal catalyzed borylation reactions have the general formula ro b b or for example bis pinacolato diboron bpin and bis catecholato diborane bcat are common boron sources of this general formula the boron atom of a boronic ester or acid is sp hybridized possessing a vacant p orbital enabling these groups to act as lewis acids the

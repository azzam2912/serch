prc1 is located in the nucleus during interphase becomes associated with the mitotic spindle in a highly dynamic manner during anaphase and localizes to the cell midbody during cytokinesis prc1 was first identified in 1998 using and in vitro phosphorylation screening method and shown to be a substrate of several cyclin dependent kinases cdks correspondingly ablation of prc1 has been shown to disrupt spindle midzone assembly in mammalian systems at least three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms of prc1 have been observed additionally prc1 has sequence homology with ase1 in yeasts spd 1 spindle defective 1 in c elegans feo in d melanogaster and map65 in plants all of which fall in a conserved family of nonmotor microtubule associated proteins maps the crystal structure of prc1 has only recently been characterized in vitro in 2013 prc1 was illustrated as a lengthy molecule consisting of a c terminal spectrin microtubule binding domain an extended rod domain and an n terminal dimerization domain consisting of an intricate arrangement of helices the rod domain together with the dimerization conducting n terminus cooperate to facilitate binding of other proteins such as kinesin 4 to prc1 prc1 s rod domain adopts multiple conformations

data acquisition systems abbreviated by the acronyms das or daq typically convert analog waveforms into digital values for processing the components of data acquisition systems include data acquisition applications are usually controlled by software programs developed using various general purpose programming languages such as assembly basic c c c fortran java labview lisp pascal etc stand alone data acquisition systems are often called data loggers there are also open source software packages providing all the necessary tools to acquire data from different hardware equipment these tools come from the scientific community where complex experiment requires fast flexible and adaptable software those packages are usually custom fit but more general daq packages like the maximum integrated data acquisition system can be easily tailored and is used in several physics experiments worldwide in 1963 ibm produced computers which specialized in data acquisition these include the ibm 7700 data acquisition system and its successor the ibm 1800 data acquisition and control system these expensive specialized systems were surpassed in 1974 by general purpose s 100 computers and data acquisitions cards produced by tecmar scientific solutions inc in 1981 ibm introduced the ibm personal computer and scientific solutions introduced the first pc data acquisition

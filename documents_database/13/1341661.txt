the method encompasses a steam generator which produces the steam and a connecting hose to direct the steam into a closed sealed vessel containing the hay exposing it to the steam when a professionally engineered and designed high temperature steaming method is used the temperature of the hay reaches over 100 c this has been scientifically proven to kill the bacteria mould and fungal spores thereby improving the hygienic quality of hay and dramatically reducing airborne respirable dust by up to 98 with hay steaming however if the required high temperatures are not reached it can have a detrimental effect on the hygiene quality of the hay by creating an incubator effect leading to a dramatic increase in observed bacteria expectation is that only hay steamers which are able to steam from the inside out specifically injecting steam via spikes from deep within the hay rather than from the outside in releasing the steam from underneath the hay and with the hay being steamed while placed in an insulated vessel are able to reach the requisite temperatures to avoid dramatically increasing bacteria a number of home made hay steamers have been tested usually consisting of a wheelie bin and a

inputs used in the calculation are the type of chromophores present the substituents on the chromophores known as auxochromes and shifts due to the solvent examples are conjugated carbonyl compounds conjugated dienes and polyenes one set of woodward fieser rules for dienes is outlined in table 1 a diene is either homoannular with both double bonds contained in one ring or heteroannular with two double bonds distributed between two rings with the aid of these rules the uv absorption maximum can be predicted for example in these two compounds in the compound on the left the base value is 214 nm a heteroannular diene this diene group has 4 alkyl substituents labeled 1 2 3 4 and the double bond in one ring is exocyclic to the other adding 5 nm for an exocyclic double bond in the compound on the right the diene is homoannular with 4 alkyl substituents both double bonds in the central b ring are exocyclic with respect to rings a and c for polyenes having more than 4 conjugated double bonds one must use fieser kuhn rules

a gene cluster is part of a gene family a gene cluster is a group of two or more genes found within an organism s dna that encode for similar polypeptides or proteins which collectively share a generalized function and are often located within a few thousand base pairs of each other the size of gene clusters can vary significantly from a few genes to several hundred genes portions of the dna sequence of each gene within a gene cluster are found to be identical however the resulting protein of each gene is distinctive from the resulting protein of another gene within the cluster genes found in a gene cluster may be observed near one another on the same chromosome or on different but homologous chromosomes an example of a gene cluster is the hox gene which is made up of eight genes and is part of the homeobox gene family historically four models have been proposed for the formation and persistence of gene clusters this model has been generally accepted since the mid 1970s it postulates that gene clusters were formed as a result of gene duplication and divergence these gene clusters include the hox gene cluster the human

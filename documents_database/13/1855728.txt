in other words while forward genetics seeks to find the genetic basis of a phenotype or trait reverse genetics seeks to find what phenotypes arise as a result of particular genetic sequences automated dna sequencing generates large volumes of genomic sequence data relatively rapidly many genetic sequences are discovered in advance of other less easily obtained biological information reverse genetics attempts to connect a given genetic sequence with specific effects on the organism in order to learn the influence a sequence has on phenotype or to discover its biological function researchers can engineer a change or disrupt the dna after this change has been made a researcher can look for the effect of such alterations in the whole organism there are several different methods of reverse genetics site directed mutagenesis is a sophisticated technique that can either change regulatory regions in the promoter of a gene or make subtle codon changes in the open reading frame to identify important amino residues for protein function alternatively the technique can be used to create null alleles so that the gene is not functional for example deletion of a gene by gene targeting gene knockout can be done in some organisms such as

gaussian elimination simplex algorithm etc to do certain calculations in the case of matrix algorithms a pivot entry is usually required to be at least distinct from zero and often distant from it in this case finding this element is called pivoting pivoting may be followed by an interchange of rows or columns to bring the pivot to a fixed position and allow the algorithm to proceed successfully and possibly to reduce round off error it is often used for verifying row echelon form pivoting might be thought of as swapping or sorting rows or columns in a matrix and thus it can be represented as multiplication by permutation matrices however algorithms rarely move the matrix elements because this would cost too much time instead they just keep track of the permutations overall pivoting adds more operations to the computational cost of an algorithm these additional operations are sometimes necessary for the algorithm to work at all other times these additional operations are worthwhile because they add numerical stability to the final result in the case of gaussian elimination the algorithm requires that pivot elements not be zero interchanging rows or columns in the case of a zero pivot element

the driving signal from the transmitter is applied or for receiving antennas the output signal to the receiver is taken between the lower end of the monopole and the ground plane one side of the antenna feedline is attached to the lower end of the monopole and the other side is attached to the ground plane which is often the earth this contrasts with a dipole antenna which consists of two identical rod conductors with the signal from the transmitter applied between the two halves of the antenna the monopole is a resonant antenna the rod functions as an open resonator for radio waves oscillating with standing waves of voltage and current along its length therefore the length of the antenna is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves it is used with the most common form is the quarter wave monopole in which the antenna is approximately one quarter of the wavelength of the radio waves however in broadcasting monopole antennas 5 8 0 625 wavelength long are also popular because at this length a monopole radiates a maximum amount of its power in horizontal directions the monopole antenna was invented in 1895 by radio pioneer guglielmo marconi

m capsulatus cells are encapsulated and tend to have a diplococcoid arrangement in addition to methane m capsulatus is able to oxidize some organic hydrogen containing compounds such as methanol m capsulatus has also been demonstrated to be thermotolerant that is it can grow well up to 50 c though its optimum growth temperature is 45 c in addition m capsulatus can live in conditions in which there is little molecular oxygen available methylococcus capsulatus is a type i methanotroph meaning that it is a member of the gammaproteobacteria and that it utilizes the ribulose monophosphate pathway rump for formaldehyde assimilation methane is first oxidized to methanol which then gets converted into formaldehyde formaldehyde can then be 1 further oxidized to formate and carbon dioxide for energy production or 2 assimilated into biomass the genome sequence of m capsulatus bath is available various strains of m capsulatus have been isolated and studied particularly m capsulatus bath m capsulatus texas and m capsulatus aberdeen in 1999 norferm a subsidiary of the norwegian oil company statoil opened a 10 000 tons per year plant to produce animal feed from natural gas from m capsulatus in tjeldbergodden norway the plant was shut down

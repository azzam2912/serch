the accompanying figure gives the structure for 9 s hete two other 9 hydroxy linoleic acid derivatives occur in nature the 10 e 12 e isomers of 9 s hode and 9 r hode viz 9 s hydroxy 10 e 12 e octadecadienoic acid 9 s ee hode and 9 r hydroxy 10 e 12 e octadecadienoic acid 13 r ee hode these two derivatives have their double bond at carbon 12 in the e or trans configuration as opposed to the z or cis configuration the four 9 hode isomers particularly under conditions of oxidative stress may form together in cells and tissues they have overlapping but not identical biological activities and significances because many studies have not distinguished between the s and r stereoisomers and particularly in identifying tissue levels the two ee isomers 9 hode is used here when the isomer studied is unclear a similar set of 13 hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid 13 hode metabolites 13 s hode 13 r hode 13 s ee hode and 13 r ee hode also occurs naturally and again particularly under conditions of oxidative stress may form concurrently with 9 hodes these 13 hodes also have overlapping and complementary but not identical

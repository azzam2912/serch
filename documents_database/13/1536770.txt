the name was suggested by a hobbs as colorfully write a caterpillar is a tree which metamorphoses into a path when its cocoon of endpoints is removed the following characterizations all describe the caterpillar trees a k tree is a chordal graph with exactly maximal cliques each containing vertices in a k tree that is not itself a each maximal clique either separates the graph into two or more components or it contains a single leaf vertex a vertex that belongs to only a single maximal clique a k path is a k tree with at most two leaves and a k caterpillar is a k tree that can be partitioned into a k path and some k leaves each adjacent to a separator k clique of the k path in this terminology a 1 caterpillar is the same thing as a caterpillar tree and k caterpillars are the edge maximal graphs with pathwidth k a lobster graph is a tree in which all the vertices are within distance 2 of a central path caterpillars provide one of the rare graph enumeration problems for which a precise formula can be given when n 3 the number of caterpillars with n

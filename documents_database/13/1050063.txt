a conventional single hop system uses direct transmission where a receiver decodes the information only based on the direct signal while regarding the relayed signal as interference whereas the cooperative diversity considers the other signal as contribution that is cooperative diversity decodes the information from the combination of two signals hence it can be seen that cooperative diversity is an antenna diversity that uses distributed antennas belonging to each node in a wireless network note that user cooperation is another definition of cooperative diversity user cooperation considers an additional fact that each user relays the other user s signal while cooperative diversity can be also achieved by multi hop relay networking systems the cooperative diversity technique is a kind of multi user mimo technique the simplest cooperative relaying network consists of three nodes namely source destination and a third node supporting the direct communication between source and destination denoted as relay if the direct transmission of a message from source to destination is not fully successful the overheard information from the source is forwarded by the relay to reach the destination via a different path since the two communications took a different path and take place one after another this

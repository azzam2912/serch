eight buttons are arrayed in a semicircle with a home key in the lower center above each response button is a small led light following an auditory warning tone and a delay one of the lights is illuminated and the participant releases their finger from the home button participants then move to initiate a button press at the illuminated location as quickly as possible rt is measured in two different ways the time elapsed between the light signal and the home button release and the time between the home button release and the target button press these separate measures were initially conceptualized as assessing decision time and movement time respectively however participants can shift decision time into the movement phase by releasing the home button while the decision making is still incomplete masking the stimulus light can eliminate this artifact several additional parameters can be extracted the slope of rts when 1 2 4 and 8 light choices are presented is used to index the rate of information processing variance or standard deviation in intra individual rts can be extracted to measure individual differences in response variability following hick s law rts slow as a function of the number of

most of new england consists geologically of volcanic island arcs that accreted onto the eastern edge of the laurentian craton in prehistoric times much of the bedrock found in new england is heavily metamorphosed due to the numerous mountain building events that occurred in the region these events culminated in the formation of pangaea the coastline as it exists today was created by rifting during the jurassic and cretaceous periods the most recent rock layers are glacial conglomerates the bedrock geology of new england was heavily influenced by various tectonic events that have occurred since the paleozoic era including the accretion of land masses that formed various continental terranes to the mesozoic rifting of the hartford basin in the archean eon western massachusetts and vermont were the eastern edge of laurentia now the canadian shield laurentia is believed to have originated at the end of the hadean making it one of the oldest regions with continental crust as evidenced by the discovery of acasta gneiss in canada at the end of the hadean massive eruptions of felsic lava became cool enough to form permanent crust the felsic nature of laurentia allowed it to float over the denser ocean basins that

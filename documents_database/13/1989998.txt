in contrast these network based analytics are obtained by constructing a team or league level player networks where individual players are nodes connected by the ball movement or by some measure of similarity then the metrics are obtained by calculating network properties such as degree density centrality clustering distance etc this approach enriches the analysis of basketball with new individual and team level statistics and offers a new way of assigning position to a player the biggest contribution to the team level metrics came from arizona state university researchers led by jennifer h fewell using 2010 nba first round playoff data they constructed the networks for each team using players as nodes and ball movement between them as links they distinguish the trade off between not necessarily mutually exclusive division of labor and team s unpredictability that are measured by uphill downhill flux and team entropy respectively team entropy a measure of unpredictability and variation in teams offense higher entropy meaning more variation it is calculated as aggregated individual shannon entropies where unpredictability is measured as uncertainty of the ball movement between any two nodes uphill downhill flux measures the division of labor or the expertize in moving the ball

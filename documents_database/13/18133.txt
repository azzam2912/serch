the bonding of metal ions to ligands involves this kind of interaction this type of interaction is central to lewis theory coordinate covalent bonding is pervasive in all metal aquo complexes m ho the bonding between water and the metal cation is described as a coordinate covalent bond metal ligand interactions in most organometallic compounds and most coordination compounds are described similarly the term dipolar bond is used in organic chemistry for compounds such as amine oxides for which the electronic structure can be described in terms of the basic amine donating two electrons to an oxygen atom the arrow indicates that both electrons in the bond originate from the amine moiety in a standard covalent bond each atom contributes one electron therefore an alternative description is that the amine gives away one electron to the oxygen atom which is then used with the remaining unpaired electron on the nitrogen atom to form a standard covalent bond the process of transferring the electron from nitrogen to oxygen creates formal charges so the electronic structure may also be depicted as this electronic structure has an electric dipole hence the name polar bond in reality the atoms carry fractional charges the more

roskamp and co workers in 1989 this reaction is very useful in synthesizing keto esters from aldehydes and diazoacetate using various lewis acids as catalysts such as bf sncl gecl the two most noteworthy aspects of roskamp reaction are mild conditions and selectivity usually it only takes no more than one hour at room temperature to completely convert the starting materials to products the first paper about roskamp reaction was published in journal of organic chemistry in 1989 at the very beginning they proposed that the reaction would convert aldehydes to alkenes via a pseudo wittig type reaction however keto esters were the only products they observed in their first published paper they observed that aliphatic aldehydes always have higher yield than aromatic aldehydes because of enolization also the mild reaction conditions shows advantages in preventing side reactions and increasing functional group tolerance then in 1992 roskamp and co workers expanded the scope of diazoacetate to diazo sulfones diazo phosphonates and diazo phosphine oxides diazo compounds are ambiphilic reagents according to its resonance structure the carbon adjacent to the diazo group has partial negative charge if r h this can be regarded as a hydride transfer process because the diazocarbonyl

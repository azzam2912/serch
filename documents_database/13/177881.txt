the turbine itself was designed primarily by rolls royce with significant marine engineering and test facility input from dcn with northrop grumman responsible for the intercooler the recuperator and system integration wr 21 development draws heavily on the technology of the successful rolls royce rb211 and trent families of gas turbines the original design and development of the wr 21 was carried out by westinghouse electric corporation later northrop grumman marine systems under a u s navy contract placed in december 1991 later the royal navy and the french navy became interested in the wr 21 leading to rolls royce and dcn involvement the wr 21 is the propulsion system of royal navy type 45 destroyers the wr 21 is the first aeroderivative gas turbine to incorporate gas compressor intercooler and exhaust heat recovery system technologies that deliver low specific fuel consumption across the engine s operating range it offers a reduction in fuel burn of 30 across the typical ship operating profile it is a candidate power plant for propulsion of cruise ships and other large commercial vessels where fuel efficiency and its small size mean improved operational flexibility and significant lifetime cost reductions to operators in 2009 it

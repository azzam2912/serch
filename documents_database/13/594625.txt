commercial samples usually are amber to red brown due to weak bromine contamination it is decomposed by water and alcohols boron tribromide is commercially available and is a strong lewis acid it is an excellent demethylating or dealkylating agent for the cleavage of ethers also with subsequent cyclization often in the production of pharmaceuticals the mechanism of dealkylation of tertiary alkyl ethers proceeds via the formation of a complex between the boron center and the ether oxygen followed by the elimination of an alkyl bromide to yield a dibromo organo borane aryl methyl ethers as well as activated primary alkyl ethers on the other hand are dealkylated through a bimolecular mechanism involving two bbr ether adducts the dibromo organo borane can then undergo hydrolysis to give a hydroxyl group boric acid and hydrogen bromide as products it also finds applications in olefin polymerization and in friedel crafts chemistry as a lewis acid catalyst the electronics industry uses boron tribromide as a boron source in pre deposition processes for doping in the manufacture of semiconductors boron tribromide also mediates the dealkylation of aryl alkyl ethers for example demethylation of 3 4 dimethoxystyrene into 3 4 dihydroxystyrene the reaction of boron carbide

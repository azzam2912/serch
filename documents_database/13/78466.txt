in other words a derangement is a permutation that has no fixed points the number of derangements of a set of size n is known as the subfactorial of n or the n th derangement number or n th de montmort number notations for subfactorials in common use include n d d or n one can show that n equals the nearest integer to n e where n denotes the factorial of n and e is euler s number the problem of counting derangements was first considered by pierre raymond de montmort in 1708 he solved it in 1713 as did nicholas bernoulli at about the same time suppose that a professor gave a test to 4 students a b c and d and wants to let them grade each other s tests of course no student should grade his or her own test how many ways could the professor hand the tests back to the students for grading such that no student received his or her own test back out of 4 for handing back the tests there are only 9 derangements shown in blue italics above in every other permutation of this 4 member set at least one

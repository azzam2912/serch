it uses lasers to form an electrically conductive laser induced plasma channel lipc a fraction of a second later a powerful electric current is sent down this plasma channel and delivered to the target thus functioning overall as a large scale high energy long distance version of the taser electroshock gun alternating current is sent through a series of step up transformers increasing the voltage and decreasing the current the final voltage may be between 10 and 10 volts this current is fed into the plasma channel created by the laser beam a laser induced plasma channel lipc is formed by the following process because a laser induced plasma channel relies on ionization gas must exist between the electrolaser weapon and its target if a laser beam is intense enough its electromagnetic field is strong enough to rip electrons off of air molecules or whatever gas happens to be in between creating plasma similar to lightning the rapid heating also creates a sonic boom methods of use because of the plasma channel an electrolaser may cause an accident if there is a thunderstorm or other electricity sources such as overhead powerlines about see taser for more information principles of operation

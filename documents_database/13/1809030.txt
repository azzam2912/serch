multiple comparisons to a control are also referred to as many to one comparisons dunnett s test was developed in 1955 an updated table of critical values was published in 1964 the multiple comparisons multiplicity or multiple testing problem occurs when one considers a set of statistical inferences simultaneously or infers a subset of parameters selected based on the observed values the major issue in any discussion of multiple comparison procedures is the question of the probability of type i errors most differences among alternative techniques result from different approaches to the question of how to control these errors the problem is in part technical but it is really much more a subjective question of how you want to define the error rate and how large you are willing to let the maximum possible error rate be dunnett s test are well known and widely used in multiple comparison procedure for simultaneously comparing by interval estimation or hypothesis testing all active treatments with a control when sampling from a distribution where the normality assumption is reasonable dunnett s test is designed to hold the familywise error rate at or below formula 1 when performing multiple comparisons of treatment group with

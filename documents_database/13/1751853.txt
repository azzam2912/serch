it was constructed between 2005 and 2009 with the generators being commissioned in 2009 and 2010 the station generates power by transferring water between an upper and lower reservoir when energy demand is high water from the upper reservoir is released and used to generate electricity before being discharged into the lower reservoir during times of low demand water from the lower reservoir is then pumped back up to replenish upper reservoir this process allows the station to meet peak energy demand and it can go from standstill to operational in three minutes the upper reservoir is located at an elevation of formed by two main dams and two auxiliary dams the main dams are and high concrete face rock fill dams cfrd helping to support the reservoir is an additional cfrd and a tall gravity dam the upper reservoir has a storage capacity of the lower reservoir sits at an elevation of and is north of the lower reservoir it is created by a tall rock fill dam which withholds a reservoir of located in the underground power station is four reversible francis pump turbines the difference in elevation between the two reservoirs affords a hydraulic head of the

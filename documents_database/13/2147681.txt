richard s is best known to electrical engineers for the eponymous richards transformation however much of his career was concerned with radiation transport and fluid flow notably he produced one of the earliest models of traffic waves on busy highways richards was born in orono maine in 1923 in 1943 he dropped out of his undergraduate course at harvard after the first year to work at the radio research laboratory rrl set up on the campus at harvard during world war ii to research electronic countermeasures at the end of the war richards was accepted back into harvard as a ph d student without first completing his bachelor s degree he received his ph d in physics in 1947 with a dissertation on commensurate line theory that marked the beginning of this field at rrl richards worked on microwave filters an important component of radar and countermeasures against it this work formed the background for his commensurate line theory although that theory was apparently not well developed enough at the time to be put to use in wartime work the culmination of this theory was in his 1948 paper resistor transmission line circuits after which richards left the field of

the plan was originally spearheaded by the tampa hillsborough expressway authority and would have provided an alternative to interstate 75 interstate 275 and parts of interstate 4 though the beltway still officially sits on the books there are currently no plans to build it in the near future the tampa bay area beltway was first proposed by the thea in the mid 1990s with some planning done during that time however plans were halted in 2004 when a span for reversible lanes being constructed for the lee roy selmon expressway collapsed in summer 2006 attention shifted back to the beltway plan and the thea began its efforts to lobby the local governments to support the plan however as of 2007 much of the lobbying efforts failed with most attention focusing on mass transit improvements including the proposal to build a regional rail system instead of a beltway that would adversely impact rural and environmentally sensitive lands environmental criticism has also been brought to attention due to the fear that the beltway would cause immense sprawl additionally governor charlie crist vetoed of a bill that would have provided startup money for a regional transportation authority now known as tbarta tampa mayor

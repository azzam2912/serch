he graduated with a master of science in physics from the indian institute of technology delhi in 1982 and completed his doctorate in physics at stanford university in 1986 under the supervision of leonard susskind and michael peskin ratra was a postdoctoral fellow at the stanford linear accelerator center princeton university the california institute of technology and the massachusetts institute of technology he joined kansas state university in 1996 as an assistant professor of physics he was promoted to associate professor in 2001 and professor in 2004 ratra has worked in a number of areas of cosmology and astroparticle and early universe physics in 1988 ratra and jim peebles of princeton university proposed the first dynamical dark energy scalar field or quintessence model dark energy is the leading candidate for the mechanism that is responsible for causing the observed accelerated cosmological expansion ratra s early universe research includes the first consistent semi classical computation of the spectrum of energy density perturbations from inflation he collaborated with willy fischler of the university of texas at austin and leonard susskind of stanford university on this computation ratra also proposed the first inflation model that can generate from quantum fluctuations a large enough

cantilevers can also be constructed with trusses or slabs when subjected to a structural load the cantilever carries the load to the support where it is forced against by a moment and shear stress cantilever construction allows overhanging structures without external bracing in contrast to constructions supported at both ends with loads applied between the supports such as a simply supported beam found in a post and lintel system cantilevers are widely found in construction notably in cantilever bridges and balconies see corbel in cantilever bridges the cantilevers are usually built as pairs with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section the forth bridge in scotland is an example of a cantilever truss bridge a cantilever in a traditionally timber framed building is called a jetty or forebay in the southern united states a historic barn type is the cantilever barn of log construction temporary cantilevers are often used in construction the partially constructed structure creates a cantilever but the completed structure does not act as a cantilever this is very helpful when temporary supports or falsework cannot be used to support the structure while it is being built e g over a busy roadway or

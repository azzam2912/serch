it is named after karl friedrich schmidt 1887 1971 who first reported it in 1924 by successfully converting benzophenone and hydrazoic acid to benzanilide surprisingly the intramolecular reaction was not reported until 1991 but has become important in the synthesis of natural products the reaction is effective with carboxylic acids to give amines above and with ketones to give amides below the reaction is closely related to the curtius rearrangement except that in this reaction the acyl azide is produced by reaction of the carboxylic acid with hydrazoic acid via the protonated carboxylic acid in a process akin to a fischer esterification an alternative involving the formation of an acylium ion becomes more important when the reaction takes place in concentrated acid 90 sulfuric acid in the curtius rearrangement sodium azide and an acyl chloride are combined to quantitatively generate the acyl azide intermediate and the rest of the reaction takes place under neutral conditions the carboxylic acid schmidt reaction starts with acylium ion 1 obtained from protonation and loss of water reaction with hydrazoic acid forms the protonated azido ketone 2 which goes through a rearrangement reaction with the alkyl group r migrating over the c n bond with

he is a professor at stanford linear accelerator center slac dixon received in 1982 his b s in physics and applied mathematics from caltech and received in 1986 his doctorate from princeton university as a postdoc he was at slac from 1987 he was assistant professor at princeton university from 1989 he was a panofsky fellow at the slac and in 1992 he became an associate professor and in 1998 a full professor at slac he has been a visiting professor at the cole normale sup rieure and the university of cambridge clare hall starting in the 1990s dixon developed with zvi bern and others new methods generalized unitarity methods among others for the calculation of feynman diagrams in quantum chromodynamics qcd and other yang mills theories these new methods became more relevant with the requirements of the large hadron collider calculations in the 2000s and also provided new insights into the divergences in the supergravity perturbation series in 2014 with zvi bern and david kosower dixon received the sakurai prize for pathbreaking contributions to the calculation of perturbative scattering amplitudes which led to a deeper understanding of quantum field theory and to powerful new tools for computing qcd processes

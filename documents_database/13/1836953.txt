this bacterium is an obligate anaerobic chemolithotroph that undergoes anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox it can be used in the wastewater treatment industry in nitrogen reactors to remove nitrogenous wastes from wastewater without contributing to fixed nitrogen loss and greenhouse gas emission candidatus scalindua wagneri is a coccoid shaped bacterium with a diameter of 1 m like other planctomycetes s wagneri is gram negative and does not have peptidoglycan in its cell wall in addition the bacterium contains two inner membranes instead of having one inner membrane and one outer membrane that surrounds the cell wall some of the near neighbors are other species within the new scalindua genus such as candidatus s sorokinii and candidatus s brodae other neighbors include candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis and candidatus brocadia anammoxidans s wagneri and its genus share only about 85 similarity with other members in its evolutionary line which suggests that it is distantly related to other anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria markus schmid from the strous lab first discovered s wagneri in a landfill leachate treatment plant located in pitsea uk on august 1 2001 these bacteria doubled in number about every three weeks in laboratory conditions which made them very difficult to

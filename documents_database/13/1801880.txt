monometallic bimetallic and semiconductor nanoparticles have been synthesized using this method the primary use for den s is as a catalyst due to their extremely high surface area to volume ratio advantages that dens have over other nanoparticles is that they are monodisperse and easy to make the first component in den synthesis is the dendrimer itself by using different sizes or generations of dendrimers it is possible to control the size of the nanoparticle to be synthesized although there are many types of dendrimers the most common is the poly amidoamine pamam dendrimer these types of dendrimers are predominantly terminated with either amine or hydroxyl groups the notation for these dendrimers are in the form of gx r where x is generation of the dendrimer and r is the terminal group of the dendrimer in most cases r oh or nh when metal ions are introduced to a dendrimer in aqueous solution they form a complex with the tertiary amines of the dendrimer notated as gx r m where m refers to the metal ions used and n refers to the average number of metal ions complexed within each dendrimer after a complex has formed a reducing agent such

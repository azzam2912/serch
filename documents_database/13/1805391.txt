riders are arranged 2 across in 2 rows for a total of 24 riders per train the ride starts by dropping into a tunnel beneath the boardwalk after exiting the tunnel the ride climbs up the 110 foot lift hill before dropping 100 feet at a 50 degree angle reaching a maximum speed of 50 mph 80 km h the ride then goes off the boardwalk and towards the beach this ride was built over the beach because morey s piers ran out of room on the pier a rather special feature is that the ride lacks drive tires as the downward slope of the station run is enough to propel the train in the station this ride is being constantly checked out by inspectors and has its track replaced frequently this is one of the three 100 feet coasters at morey s and the only one that is a hybrid coaster the ride has been retracked by martin vleminckx

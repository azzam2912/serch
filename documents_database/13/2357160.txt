this chemical reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme rubisco and this enzyme catalyzed reaction creates the primary kinetic isotope effect of photosynthesis it is also largely responsible for the isotopic compositions of photosynthetic organisms and the heterotrophs that eat them understanding the intrinsic kie of rubisco is of interest to earth scientists botanists and ecologists because this isotopic biosignature can be used to reconstruct the evolution of photosynthesis and the rise of oxygen in the geologic record reconstruct past evolutionary relationships and environmental conditions and infer plant relationships and productivity in modern environments the fixation of by rubisco is a multi step process first a molecule that is not the molecule that is eventually fixed attaches to the uncharged amino group of lysine 201 in the active site to form a carbamate this carbamate then binds to the magnesium ion mg in rubisco s active site a molecule of rubp then binds to the mg ion the bound rubp then loses a proton to form a reactive enodiolate species the rate limiting step of the calvin benson cycle is the addition of co to this 2 3 enediol form of rubp this is the stage where the intrinsic kie of

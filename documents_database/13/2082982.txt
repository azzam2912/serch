energy quantities may also be labelled as power quantities in this context a root power quantity is a quantity such as voltage current sound pressure electric field strength speed or charge density the square of which in linear systems is proportional to power the term root power quantity was introduced in the it replaces and deprecates the term field quantity it is essential to know which category a measurement belongs to when using decibels db for comparing the levels of such quantities a change of one bel in the level corresponds to a 10 change in power so when comparing power quantities x and y the difference is defined to be 10 log y x decibel with root power quantities however the difference is defined as 20 log y x db in linear systems these definitions allow the distinction between root power quantities and power quantities to be ignored when specifying changes as levels an amplifier can be described as having 3 db of gain without needing to specify whether voltage or power are being compared for a given linear load e g an speaker such an increase will result in a 3 db increase in both the sound pressure

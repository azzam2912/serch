the concept is named after john p mills the mills ratio is related to the hazard rate h x which is defined as by if formula 1 has standard normal distribution then where the sign formula 9 means that the quotient of the two functions converges to 1 as formula 10 more precise asymptotics can be given the inverse mills ratio is the ratio of the probability density function to the cumulative distribution function of a distribution its use is often motivated by the following property of the truncated normal distribution if x is a random variable having a normal distribution with mean and variance then where formula 12 is a constant formula 13 denotes the standard normal density function and formula 14 is the standard normal cumulative distribution function the two fractions are the inverse mills ratios a common application of the inverse mills ratio sometimes also called non selection hazard arises in regression analysis to take account of a possible selection bias if a dependent variable is censored i e not for all observations a positive outcome is observed it causes a concentration of observations at zero values this problem was first acknowledged by tobin 1958 who showed

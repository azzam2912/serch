it is most often performed by scanning the entire genome for significant associations between a panel of snps which in many cases are spotted onto glass slides to create snp chips and a particular phenotype these associations must then be independently verified in order to show that they either a contribute to the trait of interest directly or b are linked to in linkage disequilibrium with a quantitative trait locus qtl that contributes to the trait of interest association mapping seeks to identify specific functional genetic variants loci alleles linked to phenotypic differences in a trait to facilitate detection of trait causing dna sequence polymorphisms and selection of genotypes that closely resemble the phenotype in order to identify these functional variants it requires high throughput markers like single nucleotide polymorphisms snps the advantage of association mapping is that it can map quantitative traits with high resolution in a way that is statistically very powerful association mapping however also requires extensive knowledge of snps within the genome of the organism of interest and is therefore difficult to perform in species that have not been well studied or do not have well annotated genomes association mapping has been most widely applied to

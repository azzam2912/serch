bacteria serve as the natural host with transmission achieved through passive diffusion there are currently five species in this genus including the type species enterobacteria phage sp6 group dsdna sp6likeviruses are non enveloped with a head and tail the head is approximately 60 to 65 nm in diameter the tail is non contractile and has six prominent spikes four of the five viruses genomes have been fully sequenced and are available on ncbi s website only enterobacteria phage k5 is unavailable they range between 43k and 46k nucleotides with 52 to 62 proteins all four complete genomes as well as several additional unclassified virus genomes are available here viral replication is cytoplasmic the virus attaches to the host cell using its tail fibers and ejects the viral dna into the host periplasm once the viral genes have been replicated new virions are assembled in the cell cytoplasm mature virions are released via lysis transmission route is passive diffusion according to ictv s 2009 report the genus sp6likevirus was first accepted under the name sp6 like viruses in the family podoviridae sub family autographivirinae the genus name was changed to sp6likevirus in 2012 it was moved into the subfamily peduovirinae upon

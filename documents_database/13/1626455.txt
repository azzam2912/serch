the study was designed to provide data for use in global climate models which scientists use to study global climate change ice reflects sunlight more readily than open water snow covered sea ice reflects about 80 of the incident sunlight seasonal changes in the arctic result in clear skies and radiational cooling from snow covered sea ice in the constantly dark arctic winter in spring with the return of sunlight melt pools begin to form and increase the rate of heat absorption from the sun in the summer during constant daylight clouds form which reflect light to the sky but impede heat flow from the ocean in order to quantify these effects over a large portion of earth s area the arctic ocean required a large scale scientific data gathering and analysis effort over the span of a year consequently the national science foundation together with other sponsors funded a study to better quantify these processes the scientific party traveled aboard the canadian coast guard ship des groseilliers to the arctic ocean it arrived at a location on 2 october 1997 where the plan was to allow the ship to become frozen in the pack ice and be the base

such relationships have been discovered from field studies for years qualitative and quantitative analyses of deformation structures are useful for understanding the distribution and transformation of paleostress fields controlled by sequential tectonic events deformation ranges from microscopic to regional scale and from brittle to ductile behaviour depending on the rheology of the rock orientation and magnitude of the stress etc therefore detailed observations in outcrops as well as in thin sections are important in reconstructing the paleostress trajectories inversions require assumptions in order to simplify the complex geological processes the stress field is assumed to be spatially uniform for a faulted rock mass and temporally stable over the concerned period of time when faulting occurred in that region in other words the effect of local fault slip is ignored in the variation in small scale stress field moreover the maximum shear stress resolved on the fault surface from the known stress field and the slip on each of the fault surface has the same direction and magnitude since the first introduction of the methods by wallace and bott in the 1950s similar assumptions have been used throughout the decades anderson was the first to utilize conjugate fault systems in interpreting

it is a biomolecularly engineered molecule consisting of the two main components 1 antibody 2 vaccine 1 the antibody component binds avec to the targeted molecule e g to epidermal growth factor receptor 2 her2 on breast cancer cells 2 the vaccine component elicits an immune response directed against the cancer cells bound by the antibody component e g immune response to the hbv vaccine mounted by the prophylactic immunity gained by vaccination it has the potential to be used to treat a variety of types of cancer including breast cancer ovarian cancer colorectal cancer and leukemias the mechanism of action of avec relies upon the immunity acquired through vaccination or natural illness against microbials e g viruses bacteria etc being redirected amplified and accelerated against the cancer cells for example a person vaccinated against hepatitis b virus but suffering from her2 breast cancer receives avec consisting of the antibody against her2 and vaccine against hbv avec anti her2 hbv since this persons immune system has already prepared a response to the hbv virus it will instantly attack any cell tagged by it in this case the breast cancer cells overexpressing her2 as such avec attracts the components of the

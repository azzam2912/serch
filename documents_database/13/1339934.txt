it was undoubtedly a flagellate marine eukaryote but beyond this its form is difficult to determine because the relationships of animal phyla are not completely understood all animals are posited by biologists to have evolved from a flagellated eukaryote their closest known living relatives are the choanoflagellates collared flagellates whose cell morphology is similar to the choanocyte cells of certain sponges molecular studies place animals in a supergroup called the opisthokonts which also include the choanoflagellates fungi and a few small parasitic protists the name comes from the posterior location of the flagellum in motile cells such as most animal spermatozoa whereas other eukaryotes tend to have anterior flagella five different hypotheses for the animals last common ancestor have been put forward the relationships between the different animal phyla themselves are not well resolved so discriminating between the hypotheses is difficult under the placula hypothesis the last common ancestor of animals was a somewhat amorphous blob lacking any form of symmetry or axis the centre of this blob became raised slightly from the sediment to create a cavity which assisted feeding on the sea floor below as this cavity developed it became deeper and deeper until the organisms resembled a

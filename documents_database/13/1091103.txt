manned models are small scale models that can carry and be handled by at least one person on an open expanse of water they must behave just like real ships giving the shiphandler the same sensations physical conditions such as wind currents waves water depths channels and berths must be reproduced realistically manned models are used for research e g ship behaviour engineering e g port layout and for training in shiphandling e g maritime pilots masters and officers they are usually at 1 25 scale worldwide manned model schools have chosen to apply the similitude law of william froude 1810 1879 for its manned models this means that gravity is considered to be preponderant over the other forces acting on the hull viscosity capillarity cavitation compressibility etc the different aspects of similitude may thus be defined as follows similitude of shape the model has exactly the same geometric shape as the real ship this means that all the length l dimensions of the real ship are divided by the same factor the scale factor the designers of port revel chose a scale s of 1 25 so s 25 smaller hence distance is 25 times less in this similitude

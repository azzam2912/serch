the field was pioneered by richard r ernst and kurt w thrich at the eth and by ad bax marius clore and angela gronenborn at the nih among others structure determination by nmr spectroscopy usually consists of several phases each using a separate set of highly specialized techniques the sample is prepared measurements are made interpretive approaches are applied and a structure is calculated and validated nmr involves the quantum mechanical properties of the central core nucleus of the atom these properties depend on the local molecular environment and their measurement provides a map of how the atoms are linked chemically how close they are in space and how rapidly they move with respect to each other these properties are fundamentally the same as those used in the more familiar magnetic resonance imaging mri but the molecular applications use a somewhat different approach appropriate to the change of scale from millimeters of interest to radiologists to nanometers bonded atoms are typically a fraction of a nanometer apart a factor of a million this change of scale requires much higher sensitivity of detection and stability for long term measurement in contrast to mri structural biology studies do not directly generate an

in layman s terms the total amount of energy is a loss it takes more energy to start the reaction than what you get out of it so the total energy is a negative net result for an overall gain in the net result see exergonic reaction another way to phrase this is that energy is absorbed from the surroundings into the workable system under constant temperature and constant pressure conditions this means that the change in the standard gibbs free energy would be positive for the reaction at standard state i e at standard pressure 1 bar and standard concentrations 1 molar of all the reagents in metabolism an endergonic process is anabolic meaning that energy is stored in many such anabolic processes energy is supplied by coupling the reaction to adenosine triphosphate atp and consequently resulting in a high energy negatively charged organic phosphate and positive adenosine diphosphate the equilibrium constant for the reaction is related to g by the relation where t is the absolute temperature and r is the gas constant a positive value of g therefore implies so that starting from molar stoichiometric quantities such a reaction would move backwards toward equilibrium not forwards nevertheless

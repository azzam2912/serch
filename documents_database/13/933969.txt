its rotation is due to the interaction between the windings and magnetic fields which produces a torque around the rotor s axis an early example of electromagnetic rotation was the first rotary machine built by nyos jedlik with electromagnets and a commutator in 1826 27 other pioneers in the field of electricity include hippolyte pixii who built an alternating current generator in 1832 and william ritchie s construction of an electromagnetic generator with four rotor coils a commutator and brushes also in 1832 development quickly included more useful applications such as moritz hermann jacobi s motor that could lift 10 to 12 pounds with a speed of one foot per second about 15 watts of mechanical power in 1834 in 1835 francis watkins describes an electrical toy he created he is generally regarded as one of the first to understand the interchangeability of motor and generator induction asynchronous motors generators and alternators synchronous have an electromagnetic system consisting of a stator and rotor there are two designs for the rotor in an induction motor squirrel cage and wound in generators and alternators the rotor designs are salient pole or cylindrical the squirrel cage rotor consists of laminated steel in the

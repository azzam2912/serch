at that time the main objective was to build home computers for the krg members in 1985 the group joined the russian fifth generation computer project start in which kronos became a platform for developing modular multiprocessor reconfigurable systems mars and played a leading role in the development of the first russian full 32 bit workstation and its software during 7 years 1984 1991 the group designed and implemented the project start was finished in 1988 during the post start years 1988 91 a number of russian industrial organizations had expressed interest in continuing the kronos development and some had been involved into facilitating the construction of kronos and mars prototypes including the design of a kronos on chip nevertheless changing in funding levels and the overall economic situation during perestroika did not allow those plans to be realized instruction set design was based on niklaus wirth s modula 2 workstation lilith developed at the swiss federal institute of technology of zurich which in turn was inspired by the legendary alto developed at xerox parc the modula 2 based kronos was quite amenable to the basic principles of mars as modula 2 is fundamentally modular allowing programs to be partitioned

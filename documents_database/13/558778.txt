these intrusions can be many kilometres in area covering from around to over and several hundred metres to over in thickness while most layered intrusions are archean to proterozoic in age for example the paleoproterozoic bushveld complex they may be any age such as the cenozoic skaergaard intrusion of east greenland or the rum layered intrusion in scotland although most are ultramafic to mafic in composition the ilimaussaq intrusive complex of greenland is an alkalic intrusion layered intrusions are typically found in ancient cratons and are rare but worldwide in distribution the intrusive complexes exhibit evidence of fractional crystallization and crystal segregation by settling or floating of minerals from a melt ideally the stratigraphic sequence of an ultramafic mafic intrusive complex consists of ultramafic peridotites and pyroxenites with associated chromitite layers toward the base with more mafic norites gabbros and anorthosites in the upper layers some include diorite and granophyre near the top of the bodies orebodies of platinum group elements chromite magnetite and ilmenite are often associated with these rare intrusions mafic ultramafic layered intrusions occur at all levels within the crust from depths in excess of to depths of as little as the depth at which an intrusion

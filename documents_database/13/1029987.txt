rheocles has a restricted distribution being found only in certain forested freshwater habitats in the central and eastern highlands of madagascar including the nosivolo river the genus appears to feed almost exclusively on allochthonous material primarily insects falling onto the water surface in a 1990 study this genus is monophyletic however in a 2004 analysis it was found that rheocles was paraphyletic forming two distinct clades r alaotrensis r lateralis and r wrightae all species that are not discernibly sexually dimorphic was recovered as the sister taxon of the rest of the bedotiids including bedotia sister to r vatosa r derhami r pellegrini and r sikorae were excluded from this study due to lack of available material however r sikorae is considered to be the sister taxon to r wrightae there are currently seven recognized species in this genus rheocles species are robust bedotiids with little lateral body compression r vatosa and r derhami are sexually dimorphic with males exhibiting larger adult size enhanced coloration and pigmentation as well as pronounced development of the unpaired fins its close association with forested biotopes suggests that like so many other rainforest adapted series rheocles is extremely vulnerable to deforestation pressure

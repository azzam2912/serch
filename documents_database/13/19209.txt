it occurs naturally and has the unusual property of greatly expanding when heated sufficiently it is an industrial mineral and a commercial product useful for its low density after processing perlite softens when it reaches temperatures of water trapped in the structure of the material vaporises and escapes and this causes the expansion of the material to 7 16 times its original volume the expanded material is a brilliant white due to the reflectivity of the trapped bubbles unexpanded raw perlite has a bulk density around 1100 kg m 1 1 g cm while typical expanded perlite has a bulk density of about 30 150 kg m 0 03 0 150 g cm perlite is a non renewable resource the world reserves of perlite are estimated at 700 million tonnes the confirmed resources of perlite existing in armenia amount to 150 million m whereas the total amount of projected resources reaches up to 3 billion m considering specific density of 1 1 ton m confirmed reserves in armenia amount to 136 mln tons other reported reserves are greece 120 mln tons turkey usa and hungary about 49 57 mln tons perlite world production led by china turkey greece usa armenia

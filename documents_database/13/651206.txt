used variously in situations where optical resolution is compromised due to lens aberrations or due to imaging through the turbulent atmosphere the strehl ratio has a value between 0 and 1 with a hypothetical perfectly unaberrated optical system having a strehl ratio of 1 the strehl ratio formula 1 is frequently defined as the ratio of the peak aberrated image intensity from a point source compared to the maximum attainable intensity using an ideal optical system limited only by diffraction over the system s aperture it is also often expressed in terms not of the peak intensity but the intensity at the image center intersection of the optical axis with the focal plane due to an on axis source in most important cases these definitions result in a very similar figure or identical figure when the point of peak intensity must be exactly at the center due to symmetry using the latter definition the strehl ratio formula 1 can be computed in terms of formula 3 the offset of the wavefront due to an on axis point source compared to that produced by an ideal focusing system over the aperture a x y using fraunhofer diffraction theory one computes the

while historically the town belongs to moravia it is now part of the south bohemian region the town has a traditional medieval renaissance city centre with sgraffito covered buildings dating from the 14th to 16th centuries the oldest dating to 1545 the sgraffito are the second oldest in the czech republic with older existing only in prague from 1544 the renaissance character of the town is due to a period of extreme wealth in the 14th to 16th century when slavonice was an important town on the route from prague to vienna when the route was relocated to the north passing through znojmo the town s source of wealth dried up as the local farming and forestry activities could never generate enough income the town is therefore very much preserved in its renaissance look the town and the surrounding countryside were lightly fortified in the period leading up to the second world war some of these small bunker complexes have been repaired and refurbished with mock battles of wehrmacht and czechoslovak forces taking place in summer the area and defences were never used against the third reich as the town and region had to be surrendered to the third reich

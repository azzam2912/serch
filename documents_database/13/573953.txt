douglas t ross is considered by many to be the father of apt as head of the newly created computer applications group of the servomechanisms laboratory at mit in 1956 he led its technical effort apt is a language and system that makes numerically controlled manufacturing possible this early language was used widely through the 1970s and is still a standard internationally derivatives of apt were later developed apt is used to program numerically controlled machine tools to create complex parts using a cutting tool moving in space it is used to calculate a path that a tool must follow to generate a desired form apt is a special purpose language and the predecessor to modern cam systems it was created and refined during the late 1950s and early 1960s to simplify the task of calculating geometry points that a tool must traverse in space to cut the complex parts required in the aerospace industry it was a direct result of the new numerical control technology becoming available at that time and the daunting task that a machinist or engineer faced calculating the movements of the machine for the complex parts for which it was capable its development was centered

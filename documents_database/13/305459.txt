the sun is not a solid body but is composed of a gaseous plasma different latitudes rotate at different periods differential rotation the source of this differential rotation is an area of current research in solar astronomy the rate of surface rotation is observed to be the fastest at the equator latitude and to decrease as latitude increases the solar rotation period is 24 47 days at the equator and almost 38 days at the poles the differential rotation rate is usually described by the equation where is the angular velocity in degrees per day is the solar latitude and a b and c are constants the values of a b and c differ depending on the techniques used to make the measurement as well as the time period studied a current set of accepted average values is at the equator the solar rotation period is 24 47 days this is called the sidereal rotation period and should not be confused with the synodic rotation period of 26 24 days which is the time for a fixed feature on the sun to rotate to the same apparent position as viewed from earth the synodic period is longer because the sun

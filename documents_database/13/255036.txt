the latter is described by the wavefunction where formula 2 is the position vector formula 3 formula 4 is the incoming plane wave with the wavenumber along the axis formula 5 is the outgoing spherical wave is the scattering angle and formula 6 is the scattering amplitude the dimension of the scattering amplitude is length the scattering amplitude is a probability amplitude the differential cross section as a function of scattering angle is given as its modulus squared in the partial wave expansion the scattering amplitude is represented as a sum over the partial waves where is the partial scattering amplitude and are the legendre polynomials the partial amplitude can be expressed via the partial wave s matrix element formula 9 and the scattering phase shift as then the differential cross section is given by and the total elastic cross section becomes where is the imaginary part of the scattering length for x rays is the thomson scattering length or classical electron radius the nuclear neutron scattering process involves the coherent neutron scattering length often described by a quantum mechanical approach is given by the s matrix formalism the scattering amplitude can be determined by the scattering length in the

pegylation is routinely achieved by the incubation of a reactive derivative of peg with the target molecule the covalent attachment of peg to a drug or therapeutic protein can mask the agent from the host s immune system reducing immunogenicity and antigenicity and increase its hydrodynamic size size in solution which prolongs its circulatory time by reducing renal clearance pegylation can also provide water solubility to hydrophobic drugs and proteins having proven its pharmacological advantages and acceptability pegylation technology is the foundation of a growing multibillion dollar industry pegylation is the process of attaching the strands of the polymer peg to molecules most typically peptides proteins and antibody fragments that can improve the safety and efficiency of many therapeutics it produces alterations in the physiochemical properties including changes in conformation electrostatic binding hydrophobicity etc these physical and chemical changes increase systemic retention of the therapeutic agent also it can influence the binding affinity of the therapeutic moiety to the cell receptors and can alter the absorption and distribution patterns pegylation by increasing the molecular weight of a molecule can impart several significant pharmacological advantages over the unmodified form such as improved drug solubility reduced dosage frequency without diminished efficacy with

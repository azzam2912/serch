t b jacobson determined in 1913 that carbohydrate ingestion results in blood glucose fluctuations hamman and hirschman first reported improvement of carbohydrate tolerance following repeated glucose administration in 1919 h staub in 1921 and k traugott in 1922 subsequently confirmed the improved reaction in healthy subjects and the phenomenon was named for them as this effect does not occur in diabetic subjects it became the basis for the glucose tolerance test abraira and lawrence describe the original discovery as being that when glucose loads are given in succession orally or intravenously significant and progressive improvement in glucose tolerance will occur in normal and nonketotic diabetic subjects this facilitated disposal of a glucose load is known as the staub traugott phenomenon this phenomenon drew considerable interest as it was demonstrated that the ingested glucose was still being processed by the gut at the same rate while being cleared much more rapidly in the bloodstream it is not surprising that when a large amount of readily diffusible glucose is suddenly introduced into the alimentary tract the rate of absorption should exceed the rate at which the tissues can abstract it from the blood but it is not so clear why the curve

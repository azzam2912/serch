when a one way anova is performed samples are assumed to have been drawn from distributions with equal variance if this assumption is not valid the resulting f test is invalid the brown forsythe test statistic is the f statistic resulting from an ordinary one way analysis of variance on the absolute deviations of the groups or treatments data from their individual medians the transformed response variable is constructed to measure the spread in each group let where formula 2 is the median of group j the brown forsythe test statistic is the model f statistic from a one way anova on z where p is the number of groups n is the number of observations in group j and n is the total number of observations also formula 4 are the group means of the formula 5 and formula 6 is the overall mean of the formula 5 this f statistic follows the f distribution with degrees of freedom formula 8 and formula 9 under the null hypothesis if the variances are indeed heterogeneous techniques that allow for this such as the welch one way anova may be used instead of the usual anova good 1994 2005 noting that

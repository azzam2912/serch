coral reefs form complex ecosystems with tremendous biodiversity among the myriad inhabitants the fish stand out as colourful and interesting to watch hundreds of species can exist in a small area of a healthy reef many of them hidden or well camouflaged reef fish have developed many ingenious specialisations adapted to survival on the reefs coral reefs occupy less than one percent of the surface area of the world oceans but still they provide a home for 25 percent of all marine fish species reef habitats are a sharp contrast to the open water habitats that make up the other 99 of the world oceans however loss and degradation of coral reef habitat increasing pollution and overfishing including the use of destructive fishing practices are threatening the survival of the coral reefs and the associated reef fish coral reefs are the result of millions of years of coevolution among algae invertebrates and fish they have become crowded and complex environments and the fish have evolved many ingenious ways of surviving most fishes found on coral reefs are ray finned fishes known for the characteristic sharp bony rays and spines in their fins these spines provide formidable defences and when erected

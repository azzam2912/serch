it does not require manual operator intervention or special configuration servers without zeroconf a network administrator must set up network services such as dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp and domain name system dns or configure each computer s network settings manually zeroconf is built on three core technologies automatic assignment of numeric network addresses for networked devices automatic distribution and resolution of computer hostnames and automatic location of network services such as printing devices computer networks use numerical network addresses to identify communications endpoints in a network of participating devices this is similar to the telephone network which assigns a string of digits to identify each telephone in modern networking protocols information to be transmitted is divided into a series of network packets every packet contains the source and destination addresses for the transmission network routers examine these addresses to determine the best network path in forwarding the data packet at each step toward its destination similarly to telephones being labeled with their telephone number it was a common practice in early networks to attach an address label to networked devices the dynamic nature of modern networks especially residential networks in which devices are powered up only when needed desire

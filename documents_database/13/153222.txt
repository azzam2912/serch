the periods permit explicit calculations in cyclotomic fields connected with galois theory and with harmonic analysis discrete fourier transform they are basic in the classical theory called cyclotomy closely related is the gauss sum a type of exponential sum which is a linear combination of periods as the name suggests the periods were introduced by gauss and were the basis for his theory of compass and straightedge construction for example the construction of the heptadecagon a formula that furthered his reputation depended on the algebra of such periods of which is an example involving the seventeenth root of unity given an integer n 1 let h be any subgroup of the multiplicative group of invertible residues modulo n and let a gaussian period p is a sum of the primitive n th roots of unity formula 5 where formula 6 runs through all of the elements in a fixed coset of h in g the definition of p can also be stated in terms of the field trace we have for some subfield l of q and some j coprime to n this corresponds to the previous definition by identifying g and h with the galois groups of q q

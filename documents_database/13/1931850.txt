fragilis and s viminalis varieties are used for the interwoven rods the living willow posts are driven into the bank to a depth of or more at intervals and the thinner rods are woven in between the rods are best woven at an angle slightly above horizontal to ensure good survival rates a row of stones gabions or wooden planks held by posts can be added to the bottom of each spile to prevent undercutting when the willow is establishing itself all works should be done during the dormant period winter in temperate zones a layer of seeded coir matting can be pegged onto the soil on top of the spiles to prevent the soil being washed out during flood events this method is an example of soft engineering techniques which tend to be less expensive and more sustainable than others

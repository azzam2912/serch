if it is affine it is called an affine toda field theory after the component of which decouples is removed and if it is hyperbolic it is called a hyperbolic toda field theory toda field theories are integrable models and their solutions describe solitons liouville field theory is associated to the a cartan matrix the sinh gordon model is the affine toda field theory with the generalized cartan matrix and a positive value for after we project out a component of which decouples the sine gordon model is the model with the same cartan matrix but an imaginary

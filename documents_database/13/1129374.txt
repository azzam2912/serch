in these instances the promoter and n terminal part of fus tls is translocated to the c terminal domain of various dna binding transcription factors eg chop conferring a strong transcriptional activation domain to the fusion proteins fus tls was independently identified as the hnrnp p2 protein a subunit of a complex involved in maturation of pre mrna fus tls is a member of the tet protein family that also includes the ews protein the tata binding protein tbp associated factor tafii68 taf15 and the drosophila cabeza sarf protein fus tls ews and tafii68 taf15 have a similar structure characterised by an n terminal qgsy rich region a highly conserved rna recognition motif rrm multiple rgg repeats which are extensively dimethylated at arginine residues and a c terminal zinc finger motif the n terminal end of fus appears to be involved in transcriptional activation while the c terminal end is involved in protein and rna binding in addition recognition sites for the transcription factors ap2 gcf sp1 have been identified in fus consistently in vitro studies have shown that fus tls binds rna single stranded dna and with lower affinity double stranded dna the sequence specificity of fus tls binding

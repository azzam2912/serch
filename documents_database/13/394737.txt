exostoses can cause chronic pain ranging from mild to debilitatingly severe depending on the shape size and location of the lesion it is most commonly found in places like the ribs where small bone growths form but sometimes larger growths can grow on places like the ankles knees shoulders elbows and hips very rarely are they on the skull exostoses are sometimes shaped like spurs such as calcaneal spurs osteomyelitis a bone infection may leave the adjacent bone with exostosis formation charcot foot the neuropathic breakdown of the feet seen primarily in diabetics can also leave bone spurs that may then become symptomatic they normally form on the bones of joints and can grow upwards for example if an extra bone formed on the ankle it might grow up to the shin when used in the phrases cartilaginous exostosis or osteocartilaginous exostosis the term is considered synonymous with osteochondroma some sources consider the two terms to mean the same thing even without qualifiers but this interpretation is not universal osteophytes are bone spurs that develop on the margins of joints secondary to external stimuli such as osteoarthritis however these are not always distinguished from exostoses in any definite way evidence

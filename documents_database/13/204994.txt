as such it is face transitive but with irregular face polygons it superficially resembles an inflated rhombic dodecahedron if one replaces each face of the rhombic dodecahedron with a single vertex and four triangles in a regular fashion one ends up with a disdyakis dodecahedron more formally the disdyakis dodecahedron is the kleetope of the rhombic dodecahedron it is the net of a rhombic dodecahedral pyramid it has o octahedral symmetry its collective edges represent the reflection planes of the symmetry it can also be seen in the corner and mid edge triangulation of the regular cube and octahedron and rhombic dodecahedron seen in stereographic projection the edges of the disdyakis dodecahedron form 9 circles or centrally radial lines in the plane the 9 circles can be divided into two groups of 3 and 6 drawn in purple and red representing in two orthogonal subgroups 2 2 and 3 3 if its smallest edges have length a its surface area and volume are the truncated cuboctahedron and its dual the disdyakis dodecahedron can be drawn in a number of symmetric orthogonal projective orientations between a polyhedron and its dual vertices and faces are swapped in positions and edges are perpendicular

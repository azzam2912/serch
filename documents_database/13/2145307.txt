there are two people alice and george with different tastes each person values the different parts of the cake differently the table below describes the parts and their values the last row rns point is explained afterwards the rns point of a piece of cake describes the relative values of the partners to that piece it has two coordinates one for alice and one for george for example the rns of a cake is just the set of all its rns points in the above cake this set contains three points 0 5 0 5 1 0 0 2 0 8 it can be represented by the segment 1 0 0 1 in effect the cake is decomposed and re constructed on the segment 1 0 0 1 there is a set formula 1 the cake and a set formula 2 which is a sigma algebra of subsets of formula 1 there are formula 4 partners every partner formula 5 has a personal value measure formula 6 this measure determines how much each subset of formula 1 is worth to that partner define the following measure note that each formula 9 is an absolutely continuous measure with respect to formula

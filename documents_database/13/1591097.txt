from 1876 to 1879 he was professor at the university of graz in 1882 he went to the graz university of technology and in 1884 he went to the university of vienna where he also was president of the university in 1903 04 together with emil weyr he founded the journal monatshefte f r mathematik und physik and together with ludwig boltzmann and emil m ller he founded the austrian mathematical society escherich died in vienna following eugenio beltrami s 1868 discussion of hyperbolic geometry escherich in 1874 published a paper named the geometry on surfaces of constant negative curvature he used coordinates initially introduced by christoph gudermann 1830 for spherical geometry which were adapted by escherich using hyperbolic functions for the case of translation of points on this surface of negative curvature escherich gave the following transformation on page 510 which can be identified with the relativistic velocity addition formula by setting or with a lorentz boost by setting these are in fact the relations between the coordinates of gudermann escherich in terms of the beltrami klein model and the weierstrass coordinates of the hyperboloid model this relation was pointed out by homersham cox 1882 p 186 see history

the oeo is characterized by having very high quality factor q and stability as well as other functional characteristics that are not readily achieved with electronic oscillators its unique behavior results from the use of electro optical e o and photonic components which are generally characterized with high efficiency high speed and low dispersion in the microwave frequency regime in an oeo the phase noise of the oscillator does not increase with the frequency that is subject to other implementations by electronic oscillators such as quartz crystal oscillators dielectric resonators sapphire resonators or air dielectric resonators oeo was introduced in the early 1990s since then the device s key properties have been continuously improved most oeos utilize the transmission characteristics of an optical modulator together with a fiber optic delay line to convert light energy into stable spectrally pure rf microwave reference signals light from a laser is introduced into an electro optic e o modulator the output of which is passed through a long optical fiber and detected with a photodetector the output of the photodetector is amplified and filtered and fed back to the electric port of the modulator this configuration supports self sustained oscillations at a frequency

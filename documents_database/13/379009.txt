although there were earlier dispersals probably over water the migration accelerated dramatically about 2 7 million years ma ago during the piacenzian age it resulted in the joining of the neotropic roughly south america and nearctic roughly north america ecozones definitively to form the americas the interchange is visible from observation of both biostratigraphy and nature neontology its most dramatic effect is on the zoogeography of mammals but it also gave an opportunity for reptiles amphibians arthropods weak flying or flightless birds and even freshwater fish to migrate the occurrence of the interchange was first discussed in 1876 by the father of biogeography alfred russel wallace wallace had spent 1848 1852 exploring and collecting specimens in the amazon basin others who made significant contributions to understanding the event in the century that followed include florentino ameghino w d matthew w b scott bryan patterson george gaylord simpson and s david webb the pliocene timing of the formation of the connection between north and south america was discussed in 1910 by henry fairfield osborn analogous interchanges occurred earlier in the cenozoic when the formerly isolated land masses of india and africa made contact with eurasia c 50 and 30 ma ago

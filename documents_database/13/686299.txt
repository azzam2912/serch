it is usually seen nowadays as a special case of the grothendieck spectral sequence let f x y be a continuous map of topological spaces which in particular gives a functor f from sheaves on x to sheaves on y composing this with the functor of taking sections on is the same as taking sections on by the definition of the direct image functor f thus the derived functors of compute the sheaf cohomology for x but because f and satisfy certain conditions there is a spectral sequence whose second page and which converges to this is called the leray spectral sequence for a proof of the existence of a spectral sequence under the conditions alluded to above see grothendieck spectral sequence let f x y be a continuous map of smooth manifolds if u u is an open cover of form the cech complex with respect to cover of the boundary maps d c c and maps of sheaves on x together give a boundary map on the double complex this double complex is also a single complex graded by with respect to which d is a boundary map if each finite intersection of the u is diffeomorphic to

they number around 20 extant genera containing over 400 described species and are found all over the world except in the polar regions the larvae of these solitary wasps feed on cockroaches and develop inside the egg cases oothecae of their hosts evaniidae have the metasoma attached very high above the hind coxae on the propodeum and the metasoma itself is quite small with a long one segmented tube like petiole and compressed laterally over most of its length segments 2 8 the ovipositor is short and thin when active these wasps jerk the metasoma up and down constantly as referenced in their common names the mesosoma is high short and heavily sclerotized with a ridged and pitted surface the head is largely immovable and attaches to the mesosoma on a short neck with usually 13 segmented antennae that do not differ between males and females apomorphies of ensign wasp wings and their venation are as far as is known ensign wasp larvae are predatory on the eggs of cockroaches but good host data are only known for a fraction of this family about 4 as of 2008 thus more unusual life history strategies likely exist host specificity and coevolution

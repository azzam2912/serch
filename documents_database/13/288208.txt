murids are not found in antarctica or many oceanic islands although none of them is native to the americas a few species notably the house mouse and black rat have been introduced worldwide murids occupy a broad range of ecosystems from tropical forests to tundras fossorial arboreal and semiaquatic murid species occur though most are terrestrial animals the extensive list of niches filled by murids helps to explain their relative abundance a broad range of feeding habits is found in murids ranging from herbivorous and omnivorous species to specialists that consume strictly earthworms certain species of fungi or aquatic insects most genera consume plant matter and small invertebrates often storing seeds and other plant matter for winter consumption murids have sciurognathous jaws an ancestral character in rodents and a diastema is present murids lack canines and premolars generally three molars though sometimes only one or two are found and the nature of the molars varies by genus and feeding habit some murids are highly social while others are solitary females commonly produce several litters annually in warm regions breeding may occur year round though the lifespans of most genera are generally less than two years murids have high reproductive potential

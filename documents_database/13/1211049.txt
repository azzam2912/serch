it copies data from one file or block device hard disk cd rom etc to another trying hard to rescue data in case of read errors gnu ddrescue is a program written in c that was initially released in 2004 and has since become available in most linux distributions gnu ddrescue is not a derivative of codice 1 nor is it related to codice 2 in any way except in that both can be used for copying data from one device to another the difference is that ddrescue uses a sophisticated algorithm to copy data from failing drives causing them as little additional damage as possible gnu ddrescue is considered to have the most sophisticated implementation of a block size changing algorithm in free and open source software and is considered an essential data recovery tool if one uses the codice 3 previously called logfile feature of ddrescue the data is rescued very efficiently only the needed blocks are read one can also interrupt the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point ddrescue does not write zeros to the output when it finds bad sectors in the input and does not truncate the output file

while it can be applied to most high dimensional data sets it has been most widely used in genomic applications it allows one to define modules clusters intramodular hubs and network nodes with regard to module membership to study the relationships between co expression modules and to compare the network topology of different networks differential network analysis wgcna can be used as a data reduction technique related to oblique factor analysis as a clustering method fuzzy clustering as a feature selection method e g as gene screening method as a framework for integrating complementary genomic data based on weighted correlations between quantitative variables and as a data exploratory technique although wgcna incorporates traditional data exploratory techniques its intuitive network language and analysis framework transcend any standard analysis technique since it uses network methodology and is well suited for integrating complementary genomic data sets it can be interpreted as systems biologic or systems genetic data analysis method by selecting intramodular hubs in consensus modules wgcna also gives rise to network based meta analysis techniques the wgcna method was developed by steve horvath a professor of human genetics at the david geffen school of medicine at ucla and of biostatistics at the

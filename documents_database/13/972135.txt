the format used flexible foil discs which spun at 1 500 rpm on a cushion of air ted never gained wide acceptance and could not compete against the emerging videocassette systems of the time initially known as the video disc or the teldec television disc ted television electronic disc was first announced at a press conference in berlin on june 24 1970 it was developed by a team from two german companies aeg telefunken and teldec program information was stored in the form of ridges in the surface of a thin flexible foil disc which was claimed to be sufficiently robust to withstand being played 1 000 times the main technological breakthrough was the vertical recording method that reduced the track pitch to 0 007 mm and increased the rotation speed to 1 500 rpm making it possible to record 130 150 grooves per millimeter compared with the typical 10 13 grooves on an audio disc this increased the available bandwidth from around 15 khz to 3 mhz the tracks were read by a pressure pick up which translated the surface of the ridges via a piezo electric crystal into an electrical signal tracking was controlled not by the pick

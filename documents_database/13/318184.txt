the essence of the method is mapping of strata based on identification of surfaces which are assumed to represent time lines e g subaerial unconformities maximum flooding surfaces and therefore placing stratigraphy in chronostratigraphic framework sequence stratigraphy is a useful alternative to a lithostratigraphic approach which emphasizes similarity of the lithology of rock units rather than time significance sequence stratigraphy deals with genetically related sedimentary strata bounded by unconformities the sequence part of the name refers to cyclic sedimentary deposits stratigraphy is the geologic knowledge about the processes by which sedimentary deposits form and how those deposits change through time and space on the earth s surface sequence boundaries are deemed the most significant surfaces sequence boundaries are defined as unconformities or their correlative conformities sequence boundaries are formed due to the sea level fall for example multi story fluvial sandstone packages often infill incised valleys formed by the sea level drop associated with sequence boundaries the incised valleys of sequence boundaries correlate laterally with interfluves palaeosols formed on the margins of incised valleys the valley infills are not genetically related to underlying depositional systems as previous interpretations thought there are four criteria distinguishing incised valley fills from other types

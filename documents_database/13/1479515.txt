it is located at a distance of approximately 47 light years from earth the star is about one fifth the radius of the sun with a surface temperature estimated to be its luminosity is only 0 33 that of the sun the estimate for the stellar radius is 15 larger than predicted by theoretical models it also shows a 1 intrinsic variability in the near infrared probably caused by stellar spots the star is rotating slowly with a period that is most likely an integer multiple of 53 days it is probably at least three billion years old and a member of the old disk although gj 1214 has a low to moderate level of magnetic activity it does undergo flares and is a source of x ray emission with a base luminosity of the temperature of the corona is estimated to be about in mid december 2009 a team of harvard smithsonian astronomers announced the discovery of a companion extrasolar planet gliese 1214 b potentially composed largely of water and having the mass and diameter of a super earth discovered by the mearth project and investigated further by the harps spectrograph on eso s 3 6 metre telescope at

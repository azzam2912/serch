an action is of the form if is true then do an action axiom tests a condition antecedent and if the condition has been met then consequent it suggests mandates an action from knowledge to action a decision model may also be a network of connected decisions information and knowledge that represents a decision making approach that can be used repeatedly such as one developed using the decision model and notation standard excepting very simple situations successful action axioms are used in an iterative manner for example for decision analysis the sole action axiom occurs in the evaluation stage of a four step cycle formulate evaluate interpret appraise refine decision models are used to model a decision being made once as well as to model a repeatable decision making approach that will be used over and over again formulation is the first and often most challenging stage in using formal decision methods and in decision analysis in particular the objective of the formulation stage is to develop a formal model of the given decision this may be represented as a network of decision making elements as a decision tree or in other ways depending on the specific situation the formulation

after branching off the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa it runs through the foramen spinosum to supply the dura mater the outer meningeal layer and the calvaria the middle meningeal artery is the largest of the three paired arteries that supply the meninges the others being the anterior meningeal artery and the posterior meningeal artery the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery runs beneath the pterion it is vulnerable to injury at this point where the skull is thin rupture of the artery may give rise to an epidural hematoma in the dry cranium the middle meningeal which runs within the dura mater surrounding the brain makes a deep groove in the calvarium the middle meningeal artery is intimately associated with the auriculotemporal nerve which wraps around the artery making the two easily identifiable in the dissection of human cadavers and also easily damaged in surgery it ascends between the sphenomandibular ligament and the lateral pterygoid muscle and between the two roots of the auriculotemporal nerve to the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid bone through which it enters the cranium it then runs forward in a groove on the great wing of the sphenoid bone and divides into

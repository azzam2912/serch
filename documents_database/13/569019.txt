because ukrainian canadians are largely descended from emigrants from the austro hungarian provinces of galicia and bukovina where some self identified as rusyns or ruthenians rather than ukrainians proper it is most similar to the dialects spoken in these areas not in the russian empire administered areas where ukrainian was spoken as such canadian ukrainian contains many more loanwords from polish german and romanian and fewer from russian than does modern standard ukrainian which is mostly based on the dialect spoken in central ukraine particularly in the cherkasy poltava and kiev areas the first two waves of immigrants 1882 1914 1918 1939 spoke the dialects of what is now western ukraine but they were cut off from their co linguists by wars and social changes and half the globe ukrainophones in canada were also exposed to speakers of many other languages in canada especially english as well the mostly impoverished peasants were introduced to many new technologies and concepts for which they had no words consequently canadian ukrainian began to develop in new directions from the language in the old country the vocabulary of the dialect circa the 1920s consisted of mostly of common ukrainian words dialecticisms from western ukraine

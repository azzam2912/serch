as such ruvabc is critical to bacterial dna repair ruva and ruvb bind to the four strand dna structure formed in the holliday junction intermediate and migrate the strands through each other using a putative spooling mechanism the ruvab complex can carry out dna helicase activity which helps unwind the duplex dna the binding of the ruvc protein to the ruvab complex is thought to cleave the dna strands thereby resolving the holliday junction ruva is a dna binding protein that binds holliday junctions with high affinity the structure of the complex has been variously elucidated through x ray crystallography and em data and suggest that the complex consists of either one or two ruva tetramers with charge lined grooves through which the incoming dna is channelled the structure also showed the presence of so called acidic pins in the centre of the tetramer which serve to separate the dna duplexes its crystal structure has been solved at 1 9a ruvb is an atpase that is only active in the presence of dna and compared to ruva ruvb has a low affinity for dna the ruvb proteins are thought to form hexameric rings on the exit points of the newly

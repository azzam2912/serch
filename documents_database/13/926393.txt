atomic domains are different from unique factorization domains in that this decomposition of an element into irreducibles need not be unique stated differently an irreducible element is not necessarily a prime element important examples of atomic domains include the class of all unique factorization domains and all noetherian domains more generally any integral domain satisfying the ascending chain condition on principal ideals i e the accp is an atomic domain although the converse is claimed to hold in cohn s paper this is known to be false the term atomic is due to p m cohn who called an irreducible element of an integral domain an atom in this section a ring can be viewed as merely an abstract set in which one can perform the operations of addition and multiplication analogous to the integers the ring of integers that is the set of integers with the natural operations of addition and multiplication satisfy many important properties one such property is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic thus when considering abstract rings a natural question to ask is under what conditions such a theorem holds since a unique factorization domain is precisely a ring in which an analogue of the fundamental

this formal power series is the generating function unlike an ordinary series this formal series is allowed to diverge meaning that the generating function is not always a true function and the variable is actually an indeterminate generating functions were first introduced by abraham de moivre in 1730 in order to solve the general linear recurrence problem one can generalize to formal series in more than one indeterminate to encode information about arrays of numbers indexed by several natural numbers there are various types of generating functions including ordinary generating functions exponential generating functions lambert series bell series and dirichlet series definitions and examples are given below every sequence in principle has a generating function of each type except that lambert and dirichlet series require indices to start at 1 rather than 0 but the ease with which they can be handled may differ considerably the particular generating function if any that is most useful in a given context will depend upon the nature of the sequence and the details of the problem being addressed generating functions are often expressed in closed form rather than as a series by some expression involving operations defined for formal series these expressions in

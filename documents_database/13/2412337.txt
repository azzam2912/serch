cdv3 has been considered as a potential target for gene therapy it encodes the protein histone h4 related gene families include plasma proteins and predicted intracellular proteins the cdv3 protein is also commonly known as tyrosine phosphorylated protein 36 tpp36 tpp36 isoforms have been found to be substrates of abl tyrosine kinase the cdv3 gene is on chromosome 3 3q22 1 there were variations in the listed number of exons in cdv3 between genetic databases the number of exons vary based on the isoform in question with most transcript isoforms having 5 exons the exons of human cdv3 gene s longest transcript isoform span 16 711 bp cdv3 has seven isoforms and more are continuously added to databases as they are discovered currently there are isoforms a f molecular weight 27 3 kd protein length 258 aa isoelectric point 5 89 a saps analysis on the human cdv3 protein sequence found one uncharged cluster segment from 28 75 aa there were no signs of high scoring hydrophobic segments one high scoring transmembrane segment was found from 28 55 aa cdv3 was found to have significant maximal spacing from 27 76 aa the following repetitive structures were found for the protein

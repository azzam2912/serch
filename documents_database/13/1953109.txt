it was the first known antiandrogen to be studied in humans it is taken by mouth or by application to skin benorterone is an antiandrogen or an antagonist of the androgen receptor ar the biological target of the androgen sex hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in one study the affinity of benorterone for the ar was found to be about 5 fold greater than that of cyproterone acetate in rat prostate cytosol the k values were 0 7 nm for benorterone and 3 7 nm for cyproterone acetate which were 243 and 46 of those of testosterone k 1 7 nm respectively however another study found that benorterone had only 11 of the affinity of dihydrotestosterone for the androgen receptor although an antiandrogen benorterone actually is a very weak partial agonist of the ar and has been reported to possess weak androgenic activity the same is true for cyproterone acetate and other steroidal antiandrogens unlike certain other steroidal antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate benorterone is not also a progestogen instead being described as a selective and pure ar antagonist similarly to nonsteroidal antiandrogens such as flutamide and bicalutamide however although it is described as not being a progestogen benorterone was found

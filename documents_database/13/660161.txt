cyp2c9 makes up about 18 of the cytochrome p450 protein in liver microsomes data only for antifungal some 100 therapeutic drugs are metabolized by cyp2c9 including drugs with a narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin and phenytoin and other routinely prescribed drugs such as acenocoumarol tolbutamide losartan glipizide and some nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs by contrast the known extrahepatic cyp2c9 often metabolizes important endogenous compounds such as serotonin and owing to its epoxygenase activity various polyunsaturated fatty acids converting these fatty acids to a wide range of biological active products in particular cyp2c9 metabolizes arachidonic acid to the following eicosatrienoic acid epoxide eets stereoisomer sets 5 r 6 s epoxy 8z 11z 14z eicosatetrienoic and 5 s 6 r epoxy 8z 11z 14z eicosatetrienoic acids 11 r 12 s epoxy 8z 11z 14z eicosatetrienoic and 11 s 12 r epoxy 5z 8z 14z eicosatetrienoic acids and 14 r 15 s epoxy 5z 8z 11z eicosatetrainoic and 14 s 15 r epoxy 5z 8z 11z eicosatetrainoic acids it likewise metablizes docosahexaenoic acid to epoxydocosapentaenoic acids edps primarily 19 20 epoxy eicosapentaenoic acid isomers i e 10 11 edps and eicosapentaenoic acid to epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids eeqs primarily 17 18 eeq and 14

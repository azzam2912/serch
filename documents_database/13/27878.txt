the program was managed by nasa s ames research center the pioneer venus orbiter entered orbit around venus on december 4 1978 and performed observations to characterize the atmosphere and surface of venus it continued to transmit data until october 1992 the pioneer venus multiprobe deployed four small probes into the venusian atmosphere on december 9 1978 all four probes transmitted data throughout their descent to the surface one probe survived landing and transmitted data from the surface for over an hour the pioneer mission consisted of two components launched separately an orbiter and a multiprobe the orbiter was launched on 20 may 1978 with an atlas centaur rocket the orbiter s mass was the pioneer venus orbiter was inserted into an elliptical orbit around venus on december 4 1978 it carried 17 experiments with a total mass of 45 kg in may 1992 the orbiter began the final phase of its mission in which the periapsis was held between 150 and 250 km until the fuel ran out and atmospheric entry destroyed the spacecraft in august 1992 the pioneer venus multiprobe was launched on august 8 1978 on an atlas centaur rocket it consisted of a 290 kg bus

it is the second reaction in the mevalonate dependent isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway hmg coa is an intermediate in both cholesterol synthesis and ketogenesis this reaction is over activated in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 if left untreated due to prolonged insulin deficiency and the exhaustion of substrates for gluconeogenesis and the tca cycle notably oxaloacetate this results in shunting of excess acetyl coa into the ketone synthesis pathway via hmg coa leading to the development of diabetic ketoacidosis the 3 substrates of this enzyme are acetyl coa ho and acetoacetyl coa whereas its two products are s 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa and coa in humans the protein is encoded by the hmgcs1 gene on chromosome 5 this enzyme belongs to the family of transferases specifically those acyltransferases that convert acyl groups into alkyl groups on transfer the systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl coa acetoacetyl coa c acetyltransferase thioester hydrolysing carboxymethyl forming other names in common use include s 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa acetoacetyl coa lyase coa acetylating 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa synthetase 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme a synthase 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme a synthetase 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa synthase 3

it was originally defined in the early 20th century by jan ukasiewicz as a three valued logic it was later generalized to n valued for all finite n as well as infinitely many valued valued variants both propositional and first order the valued version was published in 1930 by ukasiewicz and alfred tarski consequently it is sometimes called the ukasiewicztarski logic it belongs to the classes of t norm fuzzy logics and substructural logics this article presents the ukasiewicz tarski logic in its full generality i e as an infinite valued logic for an elementary introduction to the three valued instantiation see three valued logic the propositional connectives of ukasiewicz logic are implication formula 1 negation formula 2 equivalence formula 3 weak conjunction formula 4 strong conjunction formula 5 weak disjunction formula 6 strong disjunction formula 7 and propositional constants formula 8 and formula 9 the presence of conjunction and disjunction is a common feature of substructural logics without the rule of contraction to which ukasiewicz logic belongs the original system of axioms for propositional infinite valued ukasiewicz logic used implication and negation as the primitive connectives propositional infinite valued ukasiewicz logic can also be axiomatized by adding the following

segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying data found in a digitally sampled representation typically the sampled representation is an image acquired from such medical instrumentation as ct or mri scanners registration is the task of aligning or developing correspondences between data for example in the medical environment a ct scan may be aligned with an mri scan in order to combine the information contained in both itk was developed with funding from the national library of medicine u s as an open resource of algorithms for analyzing the images of the visible human project itk stands for the insight segmentation and registration toolkit the toolkit provides leading edge segmentation and registration algorithms in two three and more dimensions itk uses the cmake build environment to manage the configuration process the software is implemented in c and it is wrapped for python an offshoot of the itk project providing a simplified interface to itk in eight programming languages simpleitk is also under active development in 1999 the us national library of medicine of the national institutes of health awarded a three year contract to develop an open source registration and segmentation toolkit which eventually came to be known as

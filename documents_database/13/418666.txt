it was launched by pharmacia in 1959 after development work by jerker porath and per flodin the name is derived from separation pharmacia dextran it is normally manufactured in a bead form and most commonly used for gel filtration columns by varying the degree of cross linking the fractionation properties of the gel can be altered these highly specialized gel filtration and chromatographic media are composed of macroscopic beads synthetically derived from the polysaccharide dextran the organic chains are cross linked to give a three dimensional network having functional ionic groups attached by ether linkages to glucose units of the polysaccharide chains available forms include anion and cation exchangers as well as gel filtration resins with varying degrees of porosity bead sizes fall in discrete ranges between 20 and 300 m sephadex is also used for ion exchange chromatography sephadex is used to separate molecules by molecular weight sephadex is a faster alternative to dialysis de salting requiring a low dilution factor as little as 1 4 1 with high activity recoveries sephadex is also used for buffer exchange and the removal of small molecules during the preparation of large biomolecules such as ampholytes detergents radioactive or fluorescent labels and

the length of the shell measures between 7 5 mm and 10 mm the protoconch contains three whorls these are large helicoid rather elevated and smooth they have their axis at a right angle to the axis of the later whorls and are about one fourth immersed in the first of them the twelve scarcely convex whorls of the teleoconch are ornamented between the sutures by three strong moderately rounded raised spiral keels which are separated by channels of about the same width the first keel is at the summit of the whorl these raised keels are marked axially by irregular lines of growth while the depressed channels are crossed by numerous more or less equally developed and equally spaced slender axial bands a trace of the first keel anterior to the periphery may be seen above the suture in several of the last whorls the white interstices are striate the periphery of the body whorl is marked by the anterior edge of the third channel the next keel anterior to this is like those between the sutures the remainder of the short base is marked by five less strongly developed keels and channels the space about the umbilical region

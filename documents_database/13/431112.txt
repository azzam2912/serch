shirow s characterization of batou in the manga and indeed the other members of section 9 is notably more light hearted than the characterization used in mamoru oshii s films of the same name his eyes though prosthetic often bulge comically when he is alarmed he frequently jokes with motoko togusa the tachikomas and practically everyone else who crosses his path his serious side becomes much more pronounced in a chapter of the manga where yano a trainee of batou s is murdered by a cybercriminal named koil krasnov batou loses his temper and impulsively calls up section 9 chief aramaki demanding an explanation for yano s death then storms off announcing in the english translation that koil is dead meat batou had seemingly hated anyone who tried to make section 9 fix the mess of another organization such as the ai hijacking of the jigabachi choppers in the sac series however in the ghost in the shell movie he appears more stoic and silent than his tv and manga counterpart particularly in ghost in the shell 2 innocence batou also appears moderately distant and possibly bitter in addition he jokes around with a hint of irony being mentioned stand

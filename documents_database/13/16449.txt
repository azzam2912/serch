task of building coherent services for users when the individual components are technically different and managed by different organizations if two or more systems use a common data formats and communication protocols and are capable of communicating with each other they exhibit syntactic interoperability xml and sql are examples of common data formats and protocols lower level data formats also contribute to syntactic interoperability ensuring that alphabetical characters are stored in a same ascii or a unicode format in all the communicating systems beyond the ability of two or more computer systems to exchange information semantic interoperability is the ability to automatically interpret the information exchanged meaningfully and accurately in order to produce useful results as defined by the end users of both systems to achieve semantic interoperability both sides must refer to a common information exchange reference model the content of the information exchange requests are unambiguously defined what is sent is the same as what is understood the possibility of promoting this result by user driven convergence of disparate interpretations of the same information has been object of study by research prototypes such as s3db cross domain interoperability involves multiple social organizational political legal entities working together for

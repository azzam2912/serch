a person who blows glass is called a glassblower glassmith or gaffer a lampworker often also called a glassblower or glassworker manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of borosilicate glass as a novel glass forming technique created in the middle of the 1st century bc glassblowing exploited a working property of glass that was previously unknown to glassworkers inflation which is the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air to it that is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network therefore molten glass is viscous enough to be blown and gradually hardens as it loses heat to increase the stiffness of the molten glass which in turn facilitates the process of blowing there was a subtle change in the composition of glass with reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from sepphoris of israel fischer and mccray postulated that the concentration of natron which acts as flux in glass is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting lower

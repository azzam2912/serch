the formula 11th schr der number is the number of schr der paths of length formula 11 the following figure shows the 6 schr der paths of length 2 similarly the schr der numbers count the number of ways to divide a rectangle into formula 20 smaller rectangles using formula 11 cuts through formula 11 points given inside the rectangle in general position each cut intersecting one of the points and dividing only a single rectangle in two this is similar to the process of triangulation in which a shape is divided into nonoverlapping triangles instead of rectangles the following figure shows the 6 such dissections of a rectangle into 3 rectangles using two cuts pictured below are the 22 dissections of a rectangle into 4 rectangles using three cuts the schr der number formula 23 also counts the separable permutations of length formula 24 schr der numbers are sometimes called large or big schr der numbers because there is another schr der sequence the little schr der numbers also known as the schr der hipparchus numbers or the super catalan numbers the connections between these paths can be seen in a few ways schr der paths are similar to

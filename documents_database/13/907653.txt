however the condition that the manifold be haken is unnecessarily strong thurston s hyperbolization conjecture states that a closed irreducible atoroidal 3 manifold with infinite fundamental group is hyperbolic and this follows from perelman s proof of the thurston geometrization conjecture showed that if a compact 3 manifold is prime homotopically atoroidal and has non empty boundary then it has a complete hyperbolic structure unless it is homeomorphic to a certain manifold t 0 1 z 2z with boundary t a hyperbolic structure on the interior of a compact orientable 3 manifold has finite volume if and only if all boundary components are tori except for the manifold t 0 1 which has a hyperbolic structure but none of finite volume thurston never published a complete proof of his theorem for reasons that he explained in though parts of his argument are contained in and gave summaries of thurston s proof gave a proof in the case of manifolds that fiber over the circle and and gave proofs for the generic case of manifolds that do not fiber over the circle thurston s geometrization theorem also follows from perelman s proof using ricci flow of the more general thurston geometrization

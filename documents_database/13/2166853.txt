it is a non saccharomyces yeast and plays an important role in the vinification of wine when it is present on grapes or winery equipment and has historically seen use in south africa s wine industry it is also being studied at the university of bath as a possible alternative to the use of palm oil and early results show promise m pulcherrima is ovoid to ellipsoidal in shape and reproduces by budding its cells are globose and thick walled holding a single large oil droplet of high refractive index as the result of incomplete budding where cells remain attached after division pseudohyphae may form under anaerobic conditions the strains of m pulcherrima show strong biocontrol activity against various microorganisms its value to the wine industry lies in its antagonistic behaviour to other undesirable yeast species involved in winemaking in a 2014 study 7 strains of m pulcherrima were examined for their activity against a large range of yeast strains including pichia candida hanseniaspora kluyveromyces saccharomycodes torulaspora brettanomyces and saccharomyces genera a variety of inter generic and intra generic interactions were observed one of the notable results was its lack of antimicrobial activity on the growth of saccharomyces cerevisiae while

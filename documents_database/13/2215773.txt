it is capable of running on top of tensorflow microsoft cognitive toolkit theano or plaidml designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks it focuses on being user friendly modular and extensible it was developed as part of the research effort of project oneiros open ended neuro electronic intelligent robot operating system and its primary author and maintainer is fran ois chollet a google engineer chollet also is the author of the xception deep neural network model in 2017 google s tensorflow team decided to support keras in tensorflow s core library chollet explained that keras was conceived to be an interface rather than a standalone machine learning framework it offers a higher level more intuitive set of abstractions that make it easy to develop deep learning models regardless of the computational backend used microsoft added a cntk backend to keras as well available as of cntk v2 0 keras contains numerous implementations of commonly used neural network building blocks such as layers objectives activation functions optimizers and a host of tools to make working with image and text data easier the code is hosted on github and community support forums include the github issues page and a slack

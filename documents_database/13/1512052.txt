he made a lasting impact on the interpretation of pollen diagrams including the use of modern pollen deposition in moss polsters to aid interpretation and the consideration of pollen productivity in different types of vegetation he studied natural history at the university of copenhagen and obtained his m sc cand mag in 1931 he then became an assistant to knud jessen who was the professor of botany at the university of copenhagen and director of the copenhagen botanical garden and one of the pioneers of pollen analysis in quaternary geology he assisted jessen in his work on irish vegetation history jonassen s list of papers is short nevertheless his doctoral dissertation from 1950 had a lasting impact on its field in two respects jonassen pioneered the use pollen collected from moss polsters to assess the modern pollen rain and by comparison with the species composition of surrounding vegetation he was able to infer past vegetation from fossil pollen spectra much more accurately than before hence he concluded that 1 cultivated crops such as cereals except rye beet clover and lucerne had very low pollen production and the pollen signal from such areas would have a much higher detection limit than

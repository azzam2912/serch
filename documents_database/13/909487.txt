test fixtures can be found when testing electronics software and physical devices in testing electronic equipment such as circuit boards electronic components and chips a test fixture is a device or setup designed to hold the device under test in place and allow it to be tested by being subjected to controlled electronic test signals examples are a bed of nails tester or smartfixture a software test fixture sets up the system for the testing process by providing it with all the necessary code to initialize it thereby satisfying whatever preconditions there may be an example could be loading up a database with known parameters from a customer site before running your test the ruby on rails web framework uses yaml to initialize a database before running a test this allows for tests to be repeatable which is one of the key features of an effective test framework test fixtures can be set up three different ways in line delegate and implicit the advantage of a test fixture is that it allows for tests to be repeatable since one is always starting with the same setup every time test fixtures also ease test code design by allowing the developer to

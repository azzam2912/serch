they are not a natural taxonomic grouping but are united by possession of a squat body adapted for fossorial activity all belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals the 11 species of mustelid badgers are grouped in four subfamilies melinae 4 species including the european badger helictidinae 5 species of ferret badger mellivorinae the honey badger or ratel and taxideinae the american badger the respective genera are arctonyx meles melogale mellivora and taxidea badgers include the most basal mustelids the american badger is the most basal of all followed successively by the ratel and melinae the estimated split dates are about 17 8 15 5 and 14 8 million years ago respectively the two species of asiatic stink badgers of the genus mydaus were formerly included within melinae and thus mustelidae but more recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family badger mandibular condyles connect to long cavities in their skulls which gives resistance to jaw dislocation and increases their bite grip strength this in turn limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut or sliding from side to side but it does not hamper the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most mammals

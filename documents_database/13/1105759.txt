devs is a timed event system devs is a formalism for modeling and analysis of discrete event systems dess the devs formalism was invented by bernard p zeigler who is emeritus professor at the university of arizona devs was introduced to the public in zeigler s first book theory of modeling and simulation in 1976 while zeigler was an associate professor at university of michigan devs can be seen as an extension of the moore machine formalism which is a finite state automaton where the outputs are determined by the current state alone and do not depend directly on the input the extension was done by since the lifespan of each state is a real number more precisely non negative real or infinity it is distinguished from discrete time systems sequential machines and moore machines in which time is determined by a tick time multiplied by non negative integers moreover the lifespan can be a random variable for example the lifespan of a given state can be distributed exponentially or uniformly the state transition and output functions of devs can also be stochastic zeigler proposed a hierarchical algorithm for devs model simulation in 1984 zeigler84 which was published in simulation

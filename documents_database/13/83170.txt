he believed that mathematical models of physical phenomena should have the properties that examples of archetypal well posed problems include the dirichlet problem for laplace s equation and the heat equation with specified initial conditions these might be regarded as natural problems in that there are physical processes modelled by these problems problems that are not well posed in the sense of hadamard are termed ill posed inverse problems are often ill posed for example the inverse heat equation deducing a previous distribution of temperature from final data is not well posed in that the solution is highly sensitive to changes in the final data continuum models must often be discretized in order to obtain a numerical solution while solutions may be continuous with respect to the initial conditions they may suffer from numerical instability when solved with finite precision or with errors in the data even if a problem is well posed it may still be ill conditioned meaning that a small error in the initial data can result in much larger errors in the answers problems in nonlinear complex systems so called chaotic systems provide well known examples of instability an ill conditioned problem is indicated by a

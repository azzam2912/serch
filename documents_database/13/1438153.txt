the premise states that a crocodile who has stolen a child promises the father mother that their child will be returned if and only if they correctly predict what the crocodile will do next the transaction is logically smooth but unpredictable if the parent guesses that the child will be returned but a dilemma arises for the crocodile if the parent guesses that the child will not be returned in the case that the crocodile decides to keep the child he violates his terms the parent s prediction has been validated and the child should be returned however in the case that the crocodile decides to give back the child he still violates his terms even if this decision is based on the previous result the parent s prediction has been falsified and the child should not be returned the question of what the crocodile should do is therefore paradoxical and there is no justifiable solution the crocodile dilemma serves to expose some of the logical problems presented by metaknowledge in this regard it is similar in construction to the unexpected hanging paradox which richard montague 1960 used to demonstrate that the following assumptions about knowledge are inconsistent when tested

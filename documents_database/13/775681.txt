skew polygons must have at least 4 vertices the interior surface or area of such a polygon is not uniquely defined skew infinite polygons apeirogons have vertices which are not all collinear a zig zag skew polygon or antiprismatic polygon has vertices which alternate on two parallel planes and thus must be even sided regular skew polygons in 3 dimensions and regular skew apeirogons in two dimensions are always zig zag a regular skew polygon is isogonal with equal edge lengths in 3 dimensions a regular skew polygon is a zig zag skew or antiprismatic polygon with vertices alternating between two parallel planes the sides of an n antiprism can define a regular skew 2 n gons a regular skew n gonal can be given a symbol p as a blend of a regular polygon p and an orthogonal line segment the symmetry operation between sequential vertices is glide reflection examples are shown on the uniform square and pentagon antiprisms the star antiprisms also generate regular skew polygons with different connection order of the top and bottom polygons the filled top and bottom polygons are drawn for structural clarity and are not part of the skew polygons a regular compound

thus for large enough data sets chebychev s inequality is more useful samuelson s inequality may be considered a reason why studentization of residuals should be done externally samuelson was not the first to describe this relationship the first was probably laguerre in 1880 while investigating the roots zeros of polynomials consider a polynomial with all roots real without loss of generality let formula 9 and let then and in terms of the coefficients laguerre showed that the roots of this polynomial were bounded by where inspection shows that formula 17 is the mean of the roots and that b is the standard deviation of the roots laguerre failed to notice this relationship with the means and standard deviations of the roots being more interested in the bounds themselves this relationship permits a rapid estimate of the bounds of the roots and may be of use in their location when the coefficients formula 18 and formula 19 are both zero no information can be obtained about the location of the roots because not all roots are real as can be seen from descartes rule of signs unless the constant term is also zero

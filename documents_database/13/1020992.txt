such applications require teraflops of parallel computing performance to process terabytes of data quickly parallelism is the concept of performing multiple tasks simultaneously utilizing parallelism will not only increase the efficiency of computer processing units cpus but also increase the bytes of data analyzed each second in order to appropriately apply parallelism the cpu must be able to handle multiple threads and to do so the cpu must consist of multiple cores the conventional amount of cores in consumer grade computers are 2 8 cores while workstation grade computers can have even greater amounts however even the current amount of cores aren t great enough to perform at teraflops performance leading to an even greater amount of cores that must be added as a result of the program two prototypes have been manufactured that were used to test the feasibility of having many more cores than the conventional amount and proved to be successful teraflops research chip polaris is an 80 core prototype processor developed by intel in 2007 it represents intel s first public attempt at creating a tera scale processor the polaris processor requires to be run at 3 13 ghz and 1v in order to maintain its

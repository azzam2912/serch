it is localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane and has four transmembrane domains the human gene march5 also known as mitol or rnf153 has 7 exons and locates at the chromosome band 10q23 32 q23 33 the human e3 ubiquitin protein ligase march5 protein a member of the transmembrane ring finger protein family is 31 kda in size and composed of 278 amino acids with a n terminal zinc finger domain at amino acid sequence 6 75 and four c terminal transmembrane spans the theoretical pi of this protein is 9 00 as a e3 ubiquitin ligases enzyme march 5 catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from an e2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme to an identified protein substrate march5 was firstly identified as a mitofusin 2 and drp1 binding protein march5 promotes ubiquitination of drp1 and a knockdown of march5 is by rnai led to abnormal mitochondrial fusion further evidences show that march 5 specifically interacts with mitofusin 1 by reducing the levels of it during certain phases of the cell cycle given the facts that march5 regulates the protein proteostasis of drp1 mitofusin 1 and mitofusin 2 that are pivotal regulators of mitochondrial fusion and fission march5 is critical for the

the compounds are structurally related to acid anhydrides although imides are more resistant toward hydrolysis in terms of commercial applications imides are best known as components of high strength polymers called polyimides most imides are cyclic compounds derived from dicarboxylic acids and their names reflect the parent acid examples are succinimide derived from succinic acid and phthalimide derived from phthalic acid for imides derived from amines as opposed to ammonia the n substituent is indicated by a prefix for example n ethylsuccinimide is derived from succinic acid and ethylamine isoimides are isomeric with normal imides and have the formula rc o oc nr r they are often intermediates that convert to the more symmetrical imides organic compounds called carbodiimides have the formula rn c nr they are unrelated to imides the pubchem links gives access to more information on the compounds including other names ids toxicity and safety being highly polar imides exhibit good solubility in polar media the n h center for imides derived from ammonia is acidic and can participate in hydrogen bonding unlike the structurally related acid anhydrides they resist hydrolysis and some can even be recrystallized from boiling water many high strength or electrically conductive polymers

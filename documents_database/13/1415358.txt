precise focusing of telescopes and astrographs is critical to performing astrophotography the telescope is pointed at a bright star and a mask is placed in front of the telescope s objective e g primary mirror the mask consists of three separate grids positioned in such a way that the grids produce three angled diffraction spikes at the focal plane of the instrument for each bright image element as the instrument s focus is changed the central spike appears to move from one side of the star to the other in reality all three spikes move but the central spike moves in the opposite direction to the two spikes forming the x optimal focus is achieved when the middle spike is centered between the other two spikes small deviations from optimal focus are easily visible for astrophotography a digital image can be analyzed by software to locate the alignment of the spikes to sub pixel resolution the direction of this displacement indicates the direction of the necessary focus correction rotating the mask through 180 will reverse the direction of spike movement so it is easier to use if placed on the telescope with consistent orientation the mask must be removed after

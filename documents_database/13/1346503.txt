in combination with physical device profiling it allows for reproducible representations of color in both analog and digital representations a color space may be arbitrary with particular colors assigned to a set of physical color swatches and corresponding assigned color names or numbers such as with the pantone collection or structured mathematically as with the ncs system adobe rgb and srgb a color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers e g triples in rgb or quadruples in cmyk however a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation adding a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space establishes within the reference color space a definite footprint known as a gamut and for a given color model this defines a color space for example adobe rgb and srgb are two different absolute color spaces both based on the rgb color model when defining a color space the usual reference standard is the cielab or ciexyz color spaces which were specifically designed to

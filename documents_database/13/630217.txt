they are plant viruses that as a group have a very wide host range infecting dicotyledonous plants worldwide they are responsible for a considerable amount of economic damage to many important crops such as tomatoes beans squash cassava and cotton there are currently 322 species in this genus including the type species bean golden yellow mosaic virus virus particles are non enveloped the nucleocapsid is 38 nanometers nm long and 15 22 nm in diameter while particles have basic icosahedral symmetry they consist of two incomplete icosahedra missing one vertex joined together there are 22 capsomeres per nucleocapsid single stranded closed circular dna many begomoviruses have a bipartite genome this means that the genome is segmented into two segments referred to as dna a and dna b that are packaged into separate particles both segments are generally required for successful symptomatic infection in a host cell but dna b is dependent for its replication upon dna a which can in some begomoviruses apparently cause normal infections on its own the dna a segment typically encodes five to six proteins including replication protein rep coat protein and transport and or regulatory proteins this component is homologous to the genomes of all

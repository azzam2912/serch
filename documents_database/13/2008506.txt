the defining characters are mainly in the male genitalia and subgenital plate so externally the species of the genus are not clearly separable by a common denominator from the remaining species still in the genera ectobius or phyllodromica from the start three subgenera are defined to further group the species within the genus planuncus containing the species listed below types are listed in bold this subgenus comprises the species that might previously have been addressed as the tingitanus group of the genus ectobius including the recently described ectobius vinzi formal classification of the species in this group awaits further research and some or all may or may not prove to be synonymous in the near future for the time being the species group or subgenus for that matter might also be addressed as planuncus tingitanus s l all species in the subgenus had previously been classified in the genus ectobius this is basically the baetica group of the genus phyllodromica as had been previously formalized by bohn 1992 but now classified under planuncus to better reflect the affinities to other species all species in this subgenus had previously been classified in the genus phyllodromica this at its inception monotypic subgenus

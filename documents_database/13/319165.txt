it may combine different modes of transport for example walking and car to model multi modal journeys transport network analysis falls within the field of transport engineering traffic has been studied extensively using statistical physics methods recently a real transport network of beijing was studied using network approach and percolation theory the research showed that one can characterize the quality of traffic in a city at each time in the day using percolation threshold see fig 1 in recent articles percolation theory has been applied to study traffic congestion in a city the quality of the global traffic in a city at a given time is by a single parameter the percolation critical threshold the critical threshold represent the velocity below which one can travel in a large fraction of city network the method is able to identify repetitive traffic bottlenecks critical exponents characterizing the cluster size distribution of good traffic are similar to those of percolation theory an empirical study regarding the size distribution of traffic jams has been performed recently by zhang et al they found an approximate universal power law for the jam sizes distribution

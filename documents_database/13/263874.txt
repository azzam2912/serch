this phrasing emphasizes an interpretation in terms of projection onto the sublattice a fact known as the diamond isomorphism theorem an alternative phrasing exchanging the roles of and instead emphasizes that modular lattices form a variety in the sense of universal algebra modular lattices arise naturally in algebra and in many other areas of mathematics in these scenarios modularity is an abstraction of the 2 isomorphism theorem for example the subspaces of a vector space and more generally the submodules of a module over a ring form a modular lattice in a not necessarily modular lattice there may still be elements for which the modular law holds in connection with arbitrary elements and for such an element is called a modular element even more generally the modular law may hold for any and a fixed pair such a pair is called a modular pair and there are various generalizations of modularity related to this notion and to semimodularity modular lattices are sometimes called dedekind lattices after richard dedekind who discovered the modular identity in several motivating examples the modular law can be seen as a restricted associative law that connects the two lattice operations similarly to the way in which

it was launched into earth orbit on august 30 1991 by the m 3s 5 rocket from kagoshima space center it took its first soft x ray image on september 13 1991 21 53 40 and movie representations of the x ray corona over 1991 2001 are available at the yohkoh legacy site the satellite was three axis stabilized and in a near circular orbit it carried four instruments a soft x ray telescope sxt a hard x ray telescope hxt a bragg crystal spectrometer bcs and a wide band spectrometer wbs about 50 mb were generated each day and stored on board by a 10 5 mb bubble memory recorder because sxt utilized a charge coupled device ccd as its readout device perhaps being the first x ray astronomical telescope to do so its data cube of images was both extensive and convenient and it revealed much interesting detail about the behavior of the solar corona previous solar soft x ray observations such as those of skylab had been restricted to film as a readout device yohkoh therefore returned many novel scientific results especially regarding solar flares and other forms of magnetic activity the mission ended after more than

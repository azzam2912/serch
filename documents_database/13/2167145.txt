active chemical cycling is known to occur in stars many planets and natural satellites chemical cycling plays a large role in sustaining planetary atmospheres liquids and biological processes and can greatly influence weather and climate some chemical cycles release renewable energy others may give rise to complex chemical reactions organic compounds and prebiotic chemistry on terrestrial bodies such as the earth chemical cycles involving the lithosphere are known as geochemical cycles ongoing geochemical cycles are one of the main attributes of geologically active worlds a chemical cycle involving a biosphere is known as a biogeochemical cycle in most hydrogen fusing stars including the sun a chemical cycle involved in stellar nucleosynthesis occurs which is known as a carbon nitrogen oxygen or cno cycle in addition to this cycle stars also have a helium cycle various cycles involving gas and dust have been found to occur in galaxies the majority of known chemical cycles on venus involve its dense atmosphere and compounds of carbon and sulphur the most significant being a strong carbon dioxide cycle the lack of a complete carbon cycle including a geochemical carbon cycle for example is thought to be a cause of its runaway greenhouse effect due

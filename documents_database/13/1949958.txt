it is an alkyl analogue of rimantadine and is similar to rimantadine in its antiviral activity but possesses a broader spectrum of action being effective against influenza viruses of both type a and b strains of type a influenza virus with resistance to adapromine and rimantadine and the related drug deitiforine were encountered in mongolia and the soviet union in the 1980s electroencephalography eeg studies of animals suggest that adapromine and related adamantanes including amantadine bromantane 1 amino 2 bromophenyladamantane and memantine have psychostimulant like and possibly antidepressant like effects and that these effects may be mediated via catecholaminergic processes these psychostimulant effects differ qualitatively from those of conventional psychostimulants like amphetamine however and the adamantane derivatives have been described contrarily as adaptogens and as actoprotectors in 2004 it was discovered that amantadine and memantine bind to and act as agonists of the receptor k 7 44 m and 2 60 m respectively and that activation of the receptor is involved in the dopaminergic effects of amantadine at therapeutically relevant concentrations these findings might also extend to the other adamantanes such as adapromine rimantadine and bromantane and could explain the psychostimulant like effects of this family of compounds

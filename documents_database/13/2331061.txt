it is expressed in a variety of human tissues and is thought to play a role in actin regulation of ectoplasmic specialization establishment of sperm polarity and sperm adhesion it may also promote the integrity of sertoli cell tight junctions at the blood testis barrier rai14 contains 15 exons and is located on the plus strand of chromosome number 5 at position 5p13 2 it spans 5 068 base pairs from position 34 656 328 to 34 832 612 genes ttc23l and loc105374721 neighbor rai14 on chromosome 5 rai14 is expressed within a wide range of human tissues some areas of the highest expression by tpm transcripts per million include tissues of the endometrium smooth muscle cervix cervix testis and spleen within the human brain rai14 expression is abundant in the area around the brain stem and medulla the highest expression levels came from the myelencephalon a region of the embryonic brain that would later become the medulla oblongata rai14 does not have any paralogs most of the entire sequence of the ankycorbin protein is well conserved between the majority of mammals and vertebrates more distantly related orthologs such as sharks begin to lose similarity and become less conserved in

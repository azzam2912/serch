h c n etc to another via cross relaxation a phenomenological definition of the noe in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr is the change in the integrated intensity positive or negative of one nmr resonance that occurs when another is saturated by irradiation with an rf field the change in resonance intensity of a nucleus is a consequence of the nucleus being close in space to those directly affected by the rf perturbation the noe is particularly important in the assignment of nmr resonances and the elucidation and confirmation of the structures or configurations of organic and biological molecules the two dimensional noe experiment noesy is an important tool to identify stereochemistry of proteins and other biomolecules in solution whereas in solid form crystal x ray diffraction must be used to identify the stereochemistry the noe developed from the theoretical work of american physicist albert overhauser who in 1953 proposed that nuclear spin polarization could be enhanced by the microwave irradiation of the conduction electrons in certain metals the electron nuclear enhancement predicted by overhauser was experimentally demonstrated in li metal by t r carver and c p slichter also in 1953 richard r ernst was awarded the 1991 nobel

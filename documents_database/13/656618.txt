a mileikovsky in 1971 the rule was originally established for marine bottom invertebrates but it also applies to a group of parasitic flatworms monogenean ectoparasites on the gills of marine fish most low latitude species of monogenea produce large numbers of ciliated larvae however at high latitudes species of the entirely viviparous family gyrodactylidae which produce few nonciliated offspring and are very rare at low latitudes represent the majority of gill monogenea i e about 80 90 of all species at high northern latitudes and about one third of all species in antarctic and sub antarctic waters against less than 1 in tropical waters data compiled by a v gusev in 1978 indicates that gyrodactylidae may also be more common in cold than tropical freshwater systems suggesting that thorson s rule may apply to freshwater invertebrates there are exceptions to the rule such as ascoglossan snails tropical ascoglossans have a higher incidence of lecithotrophy and direct development than temperate species a study in 2001 indicated that two factors are important for thorson s rule to be valid for marine gastropods 1 the habitat must include rocky substrates because soft bottom habitats appear to favour non pelagic development and 2 a

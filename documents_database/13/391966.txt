the corresponding measuring device is called a densitometer absorptiometer the decadic base 10 logarithm of the reciprocal of the transmittance is called the absorbance or density dmax and dmin refer to the maximum and minimum density that can be produced by the material the difference between the two is the density range the density range is related to the exposure range dynamic range which is the range of light intensity that is represented by the recording via the hurter driffield curve in the context of photography the dynamic range is often measured in stops which is the binary logarithm of the ratio of highest and lowest distinguishable exposures in an engineering context the dynamic range is usually given by its decadic logarithm expressed in decibels according to the principle of operation of the densitometer one can have dual energy x ray absorptiometry is used in medicine to evaluate calcium bone density which is altered in several diseases such as osteopenia and osteoporosis special devices have been developed and are in current use for clinical diagnosis called bone densitometers

however the name is usually used to refer to the tetraoxidomanganate 2 anion mno also known as manganate vi because it contains manganese in the 6 oxidation state manganates are the only known manganese vi compounds other manganates include hypomanganate or manganate v permanganate or manganate vii and the dimanganite or dimanganate iii a manganate iv anion has been prepared by radiolysis of dilute solutions of permanganate it is mononuclear in dilute solution and shows a strong absorption in the ultraviolet and a weaker absorption at 650 nm the manganate vi ion is tetrahedral similar to sulfate or chromate indeed manganates are often isostructural with sulfates and chromates a fact first noted by mitscherlich in 1831 the manganese oxygen distance is 165 9 pm about 3 pm longer than in permanganate as a d ion it is paramagnetic but any jahn teller distortion is too small to be detected by x ray crystallography manganates are dark green in colour with a visible absorption maximum of 606 nm the raman spectrum has also been reported sodium and potassium manganates are usually prepared in the laboratory by stirring the equivalent permanganate in a concentrated solution 5 10 m of the hydroxide for

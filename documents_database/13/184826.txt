implemented as a toolset and class library on top of the java programming language its primary use is for the design of digital circuits for implementation in field programmable gate arrays fpgas particular attention was paid to supporting the xilinx series of chips when the design is ready to be placed in a fabric the developer simply generates an electronic design interchange format edif netlist and imports it into a toolkit once the netlist is imported the developer should be able to transfer the circuit via a joint test action group jtag cable edif netlisting is supported for the xc4000 virtex and virtex ii series of fpgas jhdl was developed at byu in the configurable computing laboratory the project initiated in 1997 as of july 2013 the latest update to the jhdl project was made in may 2006 according to the official jdhl website the jhdl language features include behavioral synthesis is not yet fully supported the integrated jhdl workbench environment is designed to allow developers to graphically test and trace their circuit designs this tool includes originally the j in jhdl stood for java however to prevent trademark issues the name has been backronymed to stand for just another

cooke and schneider 1983 defined it as calculation of the earth s structure and physical parameters from some set of observed seismic data the underlying assumption in this method is that the collected seismic data are from an earth structure that matches the cross section computed from the inversion algorithm some common earth properties that are inverted for include acoustic velocity formation and fluid densities acoustic impedance poisson s ratio formation compressibility shear rigidity porosity and fluid saturation the method has long been useful for geophysicists and can be categorized into two broad types deterministic and stochastic inversion deterministic inversion methods are based on comparison of the output from an earth model with the observed field data and continuously updating the earth model parameters to minimize a function which is usually some form of difference between model output and field observation as such this method of inversion to which linear inversion falls under is posed as an minimization problem and the accepted earth model is the set of model parameters that minimizes the objective function in producing a numerical seismogram which best compares with collected field seismic data on the other hand stochastic inversion methods are used to generate constrained

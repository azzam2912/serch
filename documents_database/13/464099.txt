these compounds occur naturally in several fungi as with other chemical compound targets in organic chemistry the organic synthesis of aflatoxins serves various purposes traditionally it served to prove the structure of a complex biocompound in addition to evidence obtained from spectroscopy it also demonstrates new concepts in organic chemistry reagents reaction types and opens the way to molecular derivatives not found in nature and for practical purposes a synthetic biocompound is a commercial alternative to isolating the compound from natural resources aflatoxins in particular add another dimension because it is suspected that they have been mass produced in the past from biological sources as part of a biological weapons program the synthesis of racemic aflatoxin b1 has been reported by buechi et al in 1967 and that of racemic aflatoxin b2 by roberts et al in 1968 the group of barry trost of stanford university is responsible for the enantioselective total synthesis of aflatoxin b and b in 2003 in 2005 the group of e j corey of harvard university presented the enantioselective synthesis of aflatoxin b the total synthesis of aflatoxin b2 is a multistep sequence that begins with a 2 3 cycloaddition between the quinone 1 and

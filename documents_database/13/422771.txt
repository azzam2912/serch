lutein is synthesized only by plants and like other xanthophylls is found in high quantities in green leafy vegetables such as spinach kale and yellow carrots in green plants xanthophylls act to modulate light energy and serve as non photochemical quenching agents to deal with triplet chlorophyll an excited form of chlorophyll which is overproduced at very high light levels during photosynthesis see xanthophyll cycle for this topic lutein is obtained by animals by ingesting plants in the human retina lutein is absorbed from blood specifically into the macula lutea although its precise role in the body is unknown lutein is also found in egg yolks and animal fats lutein is isomeric with zeaxanthin differing only in the placement of one double bond lutein and zeaxanthin can be interconverted in the body through an intermediate called meso zeaxanthin the principal natural stereoisomer of lutein is beta epsilon carotene 3 3 diol lutein is a lipophilic molecule and is generally insoluble in water the presence of the long chromophore of conjugated double bonds polyene chain provides the distinctive light absorbing properties the polyene chain is susceptible to oxidative degradation by light or heat and is chemically unstable in acids lutein is

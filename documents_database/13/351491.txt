the phrase group of lie type does not have a widely accepted precise definition but the important collection of finite simple groups of lie type does have a precise definition and they make up most of the groups in the classification of finite simple groups the name groups of lie type is due to the close relationship with the infinite lie groups since a compact lie group may be viewed as the rational points of a reductive linear algebraic group over the field of real numbers and are standard references for groups of lie type an initial approach to this question was the definition and detailed study of the so called classical groups over finite and other fields by these groups were studied by l e dickson and jean dieudonn emil artin investigated the orders of such groups with a view to classifying cases of coincidence a classical group is roughly speaking a special linear orthogonal symplectic or unitary group there are several minor variations of these given by taking derived subgroups or central quotients the latter yielding projective linear groups they can be constructed over finite fields or any other field in much the same way that they are

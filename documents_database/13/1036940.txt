the coherence of the image got lost because of the relative movement a function of the wavelength of the signal and the swell of the source and receiver during the recording in normal seismic recordings the term swell filter refers to filtering the acoustic noise created by waves out of the seismic recording very high resolution seismics reflection seismology is applied to make detailed acoustic profiles of a sea floor or lake floor acoustic sources used include air gun water gun sleeve gun sparker and boomer the frequency used in this field ranges from 100 hz to 10 000 hz subbottom profiling is a technique used in acoustical oceanography sonars or echo sounder are typical sources for very high resolution imaging also used in this field are parametric echosounders the main difference with the high resolution seismics is the type of source used when the movement of the platform and equipment due to swell is too heavy during a seismic recording the coherence of the image gets lost the reason why it gets lost is because the movement of source and receiver is larger than the wavelength of the signal produced by the source as such the seismic reflectors do

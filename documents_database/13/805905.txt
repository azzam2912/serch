it is used to separate one chemical compound or one class of chemical compounds from one or more other chemical compounds to provide significant quantities of the purified or enriched material at a lower cost than could be obtained using simple batch chromatography it cannot provide any separation or purification that cannot be done by a simple column purification the process is rather complicated the single advantage which it brings to a chromatographic purification is that it allows the production of large quantities of highly purified material at a dramatically reduced cost the cost reductions come about as a result of the use of a smaller amount of chromatographic separation media stationary phase a continuous and high rate of production and decreased solvent and energy requirements this improved economic performance is brought about by a valve and column arrangement that is used to lengthen the stationary phase indefinitely and allow very high solute loadings to the process in the conventional moving bed technique of production chromatography the feed entry and the analyte recovery are simultaneous and continuous but because of practical difficulties with a continuously moving bed the simulated moving bed technique was proposed in the simulated moving bed technique

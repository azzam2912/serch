as the area warmed around 14 000 years ago the ice sheet began to melt resulting in a torrent of meltwater that carried with it debris previously caught up in the glacial ice this debris consisting of rocks and boulders is thought likely to be the most important component of the formation of burn o vat it is thought that a rock from the meltwater stream became lodged in a small hollow on the river bed causing the meltwater to flow around it in a spiralling motion this spiralling motion caused the bed underneath the rock to erode over a long period of time creating a feature known as a pothole around 13 500 years ago the volume of meltwater decreased to such a level that the stream began to deposit more than it was eroding this change resulted in the deposition of sand and gravel into the bottom of the pothole it is believed that this sediment extends down around 5 7 metres below the current ground level though no one can be certain of the true value the pothole known locally as the vat measures 18 metres across and 13 metres high from present ground level approximately 12

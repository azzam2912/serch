the thrust belt consists of a series of thrust faults that branch off the moine thrust itself topographically the belt marks a change from rugged terraced mountains with steep sides sculptured from weathered igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rocks in the west to an extensive landscape of rolling hills over a metamorphic rock base to the east mountains within the belt display complexly folded and faulted layers and the width of the main part of the zone varies up to although it is significantly wider on skye the presence of metamorphic gneisses and schists lying apparently stratigraphically above sedimentary rocks of lower paleozoic age in the northwest highlands had been known since the early 19th century convincing roderick murchison that the change was a purely metamorphic effect and that the upper gneiss was younger than the sediments beneath initially he was supported in this interpretation by archibald geikie and james nicol after further fieldwork nicol changed his mind and advocated instead that the contact at the base of the upper gneisses was tectonic starting what was known as the highlands controversy a tectonic interpretation was supported by amongst others charles lapworth who had corresponded with albert heim on similar structures in

the anal notch lies behind the periphery or at the suture the sculpture is delicate and consists of spiral keels or threads and often oblique riblets on the shoulder of the whorls the peripheral keel if present is not recurved the operculum is thin nucleus apical scar of attachment small the larval shell is glassy rounded or keeled the other shell characters are as in pleurotoma the species type is pleurotoma verrillii dall this group is intended to contain the operculated species of pleurotomida which are so characteristic of the archibenthal region they are distinctly contrasted with the coarse spotted or maculated shallow water species of pleuroma proper by their thin white delicately sculptured shells they are apart from drillia by having no subtubular projection of the anal notch when adult and no thick varix to mark their maturity they are separable from the archibenthal drillias also by their larger shells longer siphonal canal and more inflated habit the anal notch is generally wider more rounded and nearer the suture than in the typical pleurotoma and the operculum proportionally wider and more delicate species within the genus leucosyrinx include

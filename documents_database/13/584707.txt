it is a colorless pyrophoric liquid its chemical formula is ch b abbreviated etb it is soluble in organic solvents tetrahydrofuran and hexane triethylborane is prepared by the reaction of trimethyl borate with triethylaluminium the molecule is monomeric unlike hb and etal which tend to dimerize it has a planar bc core triethylborane was used to ignite the jp 7 fuel in the pratt whitney j58 turbojet ramjet engines powering the lockheed sr 71 and its predecessor a 12 oxcart triethylborane is suitable for this because of its pyrophoric properties especially the fact that it burns with a very high temperature it was chosen as an ignition method for reliability reasons and in the case of the blackbird because the jp 7 fuel has very low volatility and is difficult to ignite conventional ignition plugs posed a high risk of malfunction it was used to start each engine and to ignite the afterburners mixed with 10 15 triethylaluminium it was used before lift off to ignite the f 1 engines on the saturn v rocket the spacex falcon 9 rocket also uses a triethylaluminium triethylborane mixture as a first and second stage ignitor industrially triethylborane is used as an initiator

if g is a reductive algebraic group and formula 1 is the langlands decomposition of a parabolic subgroup p then parabolic induction consists of taking a representation of formula 2 extending it to p by letting n act trivially and inducing the result from p to g there are some generalizations of parabolic induction using cohomology such as cohomological parabolic induction and deligne lusztig theory the philosophy of cusp forms was a slogan of harish chandra expressing his idea of a kind of reverse engineering of automorphic form theory from the point of view of representation theory the discrete group fundamental to the classical theory disappears superficially what remains is the basic idea that representations in general are to be constructed by parabolic induction of cuspidal representations a similar philosophy was enunciated by israel gelfand and the philosophy is a precursor of the langlands program a consequence for thinking about representation theory is that cuspidal representations are the fundamental class of objects from which other representations may be constructed by procedures of induction according to nolan wallach put in the simplest terms the philosophy of cusp forms says that for each conjugacy classes of q rational parabolic subgroups one should

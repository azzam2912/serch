spectro temporal refers most commonly to audition where the neuron s response depends on frequency versus time while spatio temporal refers to vision where the neuron s response depends on spatial location versus time thus they are not exactly the same concept but both referred to as strf and serving a similar role in the analysis of neural responses if linearity is assumed the neuron can be modelled as having a time varying firing rate equal to the convolution of the stimulus with the strf the example strf here is for an auditory neuron from the area cm caudal medial of a male zebra finch when played conspecific birdsong the colour of this plot shows the effect of sound on this neuron this neuron tends to be excited by sound from about 2 5 khz to 7 khz heard by the animal 12 ms ago but it is inhibited by sound in the same frequency range from about 18 ms ago see a computational theory for early auditory receptive fields can be expressed from normative physical mathematical and perceptual arguments permitting axiomatic derivation of auditory receptive fields in two stages these shapes of the receptive field functions in these models

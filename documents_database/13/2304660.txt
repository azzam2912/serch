this proteins are part of a multigene family pf08031 that can be found in plants fungi and bacteria bbe like enzymes family form a large subgroup that have a special c terminal structural element adjacent to the substrate binding region an homonym of this family is the s reticuline oxidase or berberine bridge enzyme from california poppy eschscholzia californica the responsible of catalyzing the conversion of s reticuline to s scoulerine this conversion is made by an oxidative ring closure reaction the product of this reaction is the c c bond and is referred to as the berberine bridge also marks a branch point in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids as mentioned above bbe like enzymes are in the large family of fad linked oxidases regarding the structure of this particular family they have a fad binding module formed by the n and c terminal parts of the protein there is a substrate binding module that in collaboration with isoalloxazine ring of fad disposes the environment for efficient substrate binding and oxidation cell cultures of berberis beaniana b beaniana which in this certain experiment are taken as an example were harvested 10 12 days contained large amounts of proto berberines

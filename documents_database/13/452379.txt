there are many different forms of oenochoe sir john beazley distinguished ten types the earliest is the olpe olp with no distinct shoulder and usually a handle rising above the lip the type 8 oenochoe is what one would call a mug with no single pouring point and a slightly curved profile the chous pl choes was a squat rounded form with trefoil mouth small examples with scenes of children as in the example illustrated were placed in the graves of children oenochoai may be decorated or undecorated oenochoai typically have only one handle at the back and may include a trefoil mouth and pouring spout their size also varies considerably most at up to 25 cm tall could be comfortably held and poured with one hand but there are much larger examples most greek oenochoe were in painted terracotta pottery but metal oenochoai were probably also common among the better off though as with other vessel shapes few have survived again as with other shapes large versions in stone were sometimes used as grave markers often carved with reliefs in pottery some oinochoai are plastic with the body formed as sculpture usually one or more human heads

that is the relative probability assigned to a volume of a probability space using a jeffreys prior will be the same regardless of the parameterization used to define the jeffreys prior this makes it of special interest for use with scale parameters for an alternative parameterization formula 3 we can derive from using the change of variables theorem for transformations and the definition of fisher information for an alternative parameterization formula 7 we can derive from using the change of variables theorem for transformations the definition of fisher information and that the product of determinants is the determinant of the matrix product from a practical and mathematical standpoint a valid reason to use this non informative prior instead of others like the ones obtained through a limit in conjugate families of distributions is that the relative probability of a volume of the probability space is not dependent upon the set of parameter variables that is chosen to describe parameter space sometimes the jeffreys prior cannot be normalized and is thus an improper prior for example the jeffreys prior for the distribution mean is uniform over the entire real line in the case of a gaussian distribution of known variance use

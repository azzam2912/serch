the main goal was to create an agricultural aircraft with increased useful load works were carried out by a team led by stanis aw lassota behind two crew seats there was installed a container for 500 kg of chemicals with a hump above a fuselage because a center of gravity moved rearwards the plane was fitted with new swept wings with significant vertical end plates to improve air flow later in most of the aircraft they were removed because they increased side surface making landing very tricky in crosswind main landing gear was also shifted rearwards comparing with yak 12 equipment was also simplified and lightened to increase useful load e g the right door was removed the first prototype flew on april 14 1958 and the production of the pzl 101 started in 1960 from 1962 the pzl 101a variant was produced with improved equipment pilot s seat raised and a right side door added from 1965 a further improved pzl 101b was produced visible changes were lack of hump above the fuselage and a bigger air intake below engine apart from agricultural planes there were made four seater utility planes and air ambulances until production end in 1968

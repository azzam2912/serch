its application is important in areas such as radiation protection ion implantation and nuclear medicine both charged and uncharged particles lose energy while passing through matter positive ions are considered in most cases below the stopping power depends on the type and energy of the radiation and on the properties of the material it passes since the production of an ion pair usually a positive ion and a negative electron requires a fixed amount of energy for example 33 97 ev in dry air the number of ionizations per path length is proportional to the stopping power the stopping power of the material is numerically equal to the loss of energy e per unit path length x the minus sign makes s positive the equation above defines the linear stopping power which in the international system is expressed in n but is usually indicated in other units like mev mm or similar if a substance is compared in gaseous and solid form then the linear stopping powers of the two states are very different just because of the different density one therefore often divides the force by the density of the material to obtain the mass stopping power which in

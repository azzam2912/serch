it was a member of the delta family of rockets several variants existed which were differentiated by a four digit numerical code the first stage was the rs 27 powered extended long tank thor first flown on the 2000 series three or nine castor 4 solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift off replacing the less powerful castor 2 boosters used on earlier models two second stages were available the delta p which had been flown on the delta 1000 and 2000 series or the delta k an uprated version with the aerojet engine some launches used a three stage configuration in order to reach higher orbits a star 37d star 37e or star 48b pam d could be used as an upper stage launches with pam d upper stages were designated delta 3xx0 pam d rather than assigning a code to the upper stage for use in the four digit sequence from the 4000 series onwards the pam d received the upper stage code 5 however this was not applied retrospectively to 3000 series rockets which were still in service at the time the delta 3000 could put a payload of 954 kg 2 103 lb

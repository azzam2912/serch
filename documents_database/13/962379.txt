it is a definitive procedure that produces a test result in order to ensure accurate and relevant test results a test method should be explicit unambiguous and experimentally feasible as well as effective and reproducible a test can be considered an observation or experiment that determines one or more characteristics of a given sample product process or service the purpose of testing involves a prior determination of expected observation and a comparison of that expectation to what one actually observes the results of testing can be qualitative yes no quantitative a measured value or categorical and can be derived from personal observation or the output of a precision measuring instrument usually the test result is the dependent variable the measured response based on the particular conditions of the test or the level of the independent variable some tests however may involve changing the independent variable to determine the level at which a certain response occurs in this case the test result is the independent variable in software development engineering science manufacturing and business its developers researchers manufacturers and related personnel must understand and agree upon methods of obtaining data and making measurements it is common for a physical property to

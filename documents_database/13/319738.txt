the most common form of laser rangefinder operates on the time of flight principle by sending a laser pulse in a narrow beam towards the object and measuring the time taken by the pulse to be reflected off the target and returned to the sender due to the high speed of light this technique is not appropriate for high precision sub millimeter measurements where triangulation and other techniques are often used the pulse may be coded to reduce the chance that the rangefinder can be jammed it is possible to use doppler effect techniques to judge whether the object is moving towards or away from the rangefinder and if so how fast the precision of the instrument is determined by the rise or fall time of the laser pulse and the speed of the receiver one that uses very sharp laser pulses and has a very fast detector can range an object to within a few millimeters despite the beam being narrow it will eventually spread over long distances due to the divergence of the laser beam as well as due to scintillation and beam wander effects caused by the presence of air bubbles in the air acting as lenses

in terms of numbers of species the asteraceae are rivaled only by the orchidaceae which of the two families is actually larger is unclear owing to uncertainty about exactly how many species exist in each family nearly all members bear their flowers in dense heads capitula or pseudanthia surrounded by involucral bracts when viewed from a distance each capitulum may have the appearance of being a single flower enlarged outer peripheral flowers in the capitula may resemble petals and the involucral bracts may look like a calyx the name asteraceae comes from the type genus aster from the ancient greek meaning star and refers to the star like form of the inflorescence compositae is an older but still valid name that refers to the composite nature of the capitula which consist of few to many individual flowers most members of asteraceae are annual or perennial herbs but a significant number are also shrubs vines or trees the family has a worldwide distribution from the polar regions to the tropics colonizing a wide variety of habitats it is most common in the arid and semiarid regions of subtropical and lower temperate latitudes the asteraceae may represent as much as 10 of

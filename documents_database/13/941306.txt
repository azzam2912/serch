this equivalence is an easy corollary of cartan ambrose hicks theorem equivalently it is a manifold equipped with an atlas called the affine structure such that all transition functions between charts are affine transformations that is have constant jacobian matrix two atlases are equivalent if the manifold admits an atlas subjugated to both with transitions from both atlases to a smaller atlas being affine a manifold having a distinguished affine structure is called an affine manifold and the charts which are affinely related to those of the affine structure are called affine charts in each affine coordinate domain the coordinate vector fields form a parallelization of that domain so there is an associated connection on each domain these locally defined connections are the same on overlapping parts so there is a unique connection associated with an affine structure note there is a link between linear connection also called affine connection and a web an affine manifold formula 2 is a real manifold with charts formula 3 such that formula 4 for all formula 5 where formula 6 denotes the lie group of affine transformations in fancier words it is a g x manifold where formula 7 and formula 8 is

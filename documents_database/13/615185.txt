ice supposes that the red queen process which is characterized by a never ending antagonistic evolutionary arms race does not only apply to species but also to genes within the genome of a species because sexual recombination allows different gene loci to evolve semi autonomously genes have the potential to coevolve antagonistically ice occurs when an allelic substitution at one locus selects for a new allele at the interacting locus and vice versa as a result ice can lead to a chain reaction of perpetual gene substitution at antagonistically interacting loci and no stable equilibrium can be achieved the rate of evolution thus increases at that locus ice is thought to be the dominant mode of evolution for genes controlling social behavior the ice process can explain many biological phenomena including intersexual conflict parent offspring conflict and interference competition a fundamental conflict between the sexes lies in differences in investment males generally invest predominantly in fertilization while females invest predominantly in offspring this conflict manifests itself in many traits associated with sexual reproduction genes expressed in only one sex are selectively neutral in the other sex male and female linked genes can therefore be acted upon separated by selection and

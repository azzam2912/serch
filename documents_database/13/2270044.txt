it was developed for the vertical take off and landing experimental aircraft program on 3 march 2016 darpa awarded aurora flight sciences 89 4 million to build and demonstrate their lightningstrike concept beating out the other three competitors phase ii of the vtol x plane project will fabricate two air vehicles before flight testing planned by september 2018 a 20 percent scale demonstrator weighing 325 lb 147 kg using wings and canards made of carbon composites and 3d printed plastics was flown on 29 march 2016 the full scale aircraft will be designated the xv 24a in april 2018 after the subscale demonstrator achieved the vtol x plane major objectives darpa cancelled the project before flight testing due to no successor to inherit the program and growing commercial interest as electric distributed propulsion is used in aurora s evtol aircraft developed with uber elevate the lightningstrike is a tilting wing design powered by one rolls royce ae1107c turboshaft engine the same type used on the v 22 osprey that generates electric power via three honeywell generators to run 24 distributed ducted fans three each in the forward canards and 18 across the main wing rather than using conventional engines like

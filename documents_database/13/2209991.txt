chambers said the song has all my insecurities and vulnerability and broken hearts in there and i still don t know what the f i am doing half the time but now i also have strength elsewhere chambers said it s the first song in my life i truly feel wrote me rather than me writing it i wrote it a few years back and never connected to it much because i honestly felt like i wasn t strong enough personally or vocally to really own it i grew into the song throughout a lot of personal growth and after vocal surgery having two nodules removed from my vocal cords i found a new strength and power within myself as a singer and a woman it became a theme to new life and i feel is the most important song i ve ever written daniel patrin from renowned for sound gave the extended play 4 out of 5 saying it s a well thought sampler of hand plucked aussie country jams even featuring a track with keith urban the ep covers many different moods in its short time doing well to encapsulate feelings of modernism with a classic country appeal

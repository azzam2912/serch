a sample containing cells or particles is suspended in a fluid and injected into the flow cytometer instrument the sample is focused to ideally flow one cell at a time through a laser beam and the light scattered is characteristic to the cells and their components cells are often labeled with fluorescent markers so that light is first absorbed and then emitted in a band of wavelengths tens of thousands of cells can be quickly examined and the data gathered are processed by a computer flow cytometry is routinely used in basic research clinical practice and clinical trials uses for flow cytometry include a flow cytometry analyzer is an instrument that provides quantifiable data from a sample other instruments using flow cytometry include cell sorters which physically separate and thereby purify cells of interest based on their optical properties the first impedance based flow cytometry device using the coulter principle was disclosed in u s patent 2 656 508 issued in 1953 to wallace h coulter mack fulwyler was the inventor of the forerunner to today s flow cytometers particularly the cell sorter fulwyler developed this in 1965 with his publication in science the first fluorescence based flow cytometry device

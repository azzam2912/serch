fins typically function as foils that produce lift or thrust or provide the ability to steer or stabilize motion while traveling in water air or other fluids fins are also used to increase surface areas for heat transfer purposes or simply as ornamentation fins first evolved on fish as a means of locomotion fish fins are used to generate thrust and control the subsequent motion fish and other aquatic animals such as cetaceans actively propel and steer themselves with pectoral and tail fins as they swim they use other fins such as dorsal and anal fins to achieve stability and refine their maneuvering foil shaped fins generate thrust when moved the lift of the fin sets water or air in motion and pushes the fin in the opposite direction aquatic animals get significant thrust by moving fins back and forth in water often the tail fin is used but some aquatic animals generate thrust from pectoral fins fins can also generate thrust if they are rotated in air or water turbines and propellers and sometimes fans and pumps use a number of rotating fins also called foils wings arms or blades propellers use the fins to translate torquing force to

by using this technology up to 95 of pollutants can be absorbed before being emitted to the atmosphere circulating fluidized bed is a relatively new technology with the ability to achieve lower emission of pollutants extensive research has been conducted on this technology within the past 15 years due to increasing concerns over pollution caused by traditional methods of combusting coal and its sustainability the importance of this technology has grown recently because of tightened environmental regulations for pollutant emission the mercury and air toxic standards mats enacted in december 2011 by the epa have forced all the countries in europe and america to strictly adhere to this policy this means that emissions such as metals acid gases organic compound flue gas acids and other pollutants from power plants or industrial facilities have to meet the requirements set by epa and upgrades have to be done for facilities that do not meet the standards as a result the demand for circulating fluidized bed technology is predicted to sky rocket in 1923 winkler s coal gasifier represented the first significant large scale industrial application of fluidized bed kunii and levenspiel 1991 cfb combustion technology continues to grow strongly in large utility

it is an example of pseudoscience or pseudoarchaeology that employs contrived calculations involving many free parameters to achieve an impressive looking result the word archaeocryptography is derived from archaeology which is the study of human activity in the past and cryptography which is the study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties archaeocryptologists try to find underlying correlations in respect that which is being studied or decoded some factors taken into consideration while deciphering an object structure or megalithic monument can include the features such as faces stairs sides and terraces the geolocation or mathematical operations are performed on latitude and longitude coordinates as well as astronomical alignments such as are found with archaeoastronomy the incorporation of grids the use of numerical ordering mathematical constants biblical gematria and any other re occurring number that might stand out from the decoding process are determining factors archaeocryptologists then can use different mathematical formulas to find correlations within that which is being studied or between other monuments or structures that share any underlying factors popular examples are the orion correlation theory between the giza pyramid complex and the three middle stars of the constellation orion and also theories about

in many cases bioremediation is less expensive and more sustainable than other remediation alternatives biological treatment is a similar approach used to treat wastes including wastewater industrial waste and solid waste most bioremediation processes involve oxidation reduction reactions where either an electron acceptor commonly oxygen is added to stimulate oxidation of a reduced pollutant e g hydrocarbons or an electron donor commonly an organic substrate is added to reduce oxidized pollutants nitrate perchlorate oxidized metals chlorinated solvents explosives and propellants in both these approaches additional nutrients vitamins minerals and ph buffers may be added to optimize conditions for the microorganisms in some cases specialized microbial cultures are added bioaugmentation to further enhance biodegradation some examples of bioremediation related technologies are phytoremediation mycoremediation bioventing bioleaching landfarming bioreactor composting bioaugmentation rhizofiltration and biostimulation most bioremediation processes involve oxidation reduction redox reactions where a chemical species donates an electron electron donor to a different species that accepts the electron electron acceptor during this process the electron donor is said to be oxidized while the electron acceptor is reduced common electron acceptors in bioremediation processes include oxygen nitrate manganese iii and iv iron iii sulfate carbon dioxide and some pollutants chlorinated solvents explosives oxidized

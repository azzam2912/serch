in chocolate compound chocolate and similar coatings pgpr is mainly used with another substance like lecithin to reduce viscosity it is used at low levels below 0 5 and works by decreasing the friction between the solid particles e g cacao sugar milk in molten chocolate reducing the yield stress so that it flows more easily approaching the behaviour of a newtonian fluid it can also be used as an emulsifier in spreads and in salad dressings or to improve the texture of baked goods it is made up of a short chain of glycerol molecules connected by ether bonds with ricinoleic acid side chains connected by ester bonds pgpr is a yellowish viscous liquid and is strongly lipophilic it is soluble in fats and oils and insoluble in water and ethanol glycerol is heated to above 200 c in a reactor in the presence of an alkaline catalyst to create polyglycerol castor oil fatty acids are separately heated to above 200 c to create interesterified ricinoleic fatty acids the polyglycerol and the interesterified ricinoleic fatty acids are then mixed to create pgpr because pgpr improves the flow characteristics of chocolate and compound chocolate especially near the melting point it

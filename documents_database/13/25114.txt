according to strategist william s lind combined arms can be distinguished from the concept of supporting arms as follows combined arms hits the enemy with two or more arms simultaneously in such a manner that the actions he must take to defend himself from one make him more vulnerable to another in contrast supporting arms is hitting the enemy with two or more arms in sequence or if simultaneously then in such combination that the actions the enemy must take to defend himself from one also defends himself from the other s though the lower echelon units of a combined arms team may be of similar types a balanced mixture of such units are combined into an effective higher echelon unit whether formally in a table of organization or informally in an ad hoc solution to a battlefield problem for example an armored division the modern paragon of combined arms doctrine consists of a mixture of infantry tank artillery reconnaissance and perhaps even helicopter units all coordinated and directed by a unified command structure also most modern military units can if the situation requires it call on yet more branches of the military such as infantry requesting bombing or shelling

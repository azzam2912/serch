it is encoded by a gene of the same name belonging to the herc family which typically encodes large protein products with c terminal hect domains and one or more rcc1 like rld domains herc2 previously referred to as the rjs gene locus was first identified in 1990 as the gene responsible for two phenotypes in mice the runty jerky sterile rjs phenotype and the juvenile development and fertility 2 jdf2 phenotype mutant alleles are known to cause hypo pigmentation and pink eye phenotypes as well reduced growth jerky gait male sterility female semi sterility and maternal behaviour defects in mice the full herc2 gene is located at 15q13 encoded by 93 exons and its transcription is under the control of a cpg rich promoter this region on chromosome 15 is susceptible to breaks during chromosomal rearrangement and there are at least 12 partial duplicates of herc2 between 15q11 15q13 at least 15 herc2 snps have been identified and they are strongly associated with human iris colour variability functioning to repress expression of oca2 s product herc2 encodes a 4834 amino acid protein with a theoretical size of 528 kda while a full structure has not yet been elucidated potentially

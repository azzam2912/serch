the opposite of rigidity is flexibility in structural rigidity theory structures are formed by collections of objects that are themselves rigid bodies often assumed to take simple geometric forms such as straight rods line segments with pairs of objects connected by flexible hinges a structure is rigid if it cannot flex that is if there is no continuous motion of the structure that preserves the shape of its rigid components and the pattern of their connections at the hinges there are two essentially different kinds of rigidity finite or macroscopic rigidity means that the structure will not flex fold or bend by a positive amount infinitesimal rigidity means that the structure will not flex by even an amount that is too small to be detected even in theory technically that means certain differential equations have no nonzero solutions the importance of finite rigidity is obvious but infinitesimal rigidity is also crucial because infinitesimal flexibility in theory corresponds to real world minuscule flexing and consequent deterioration of the structure a rigid graph is an embedding of a graph in a euclidean space which is structurally rigid that is a graph is rigid if the structure formed by replacing the edges by

if a viewer s eye is outside this distance a reduced field of view will be obtained the calculation of eye relief is complex though generally the higher the magnification and the larger the intended field of view the shorter the eye relief the eye relief property should not be confused with the exit pupil width of an instrument that is best described as the width of the cone of light that is available to the viewer at the exact eye relief distance an exit pupil larger than the observer s pupil wastes some light but allows for some fumbling in side to side movement without vignetting or clipping conversely an exit pupil smaller than the eye s pupil will have all of its available light used but since it cannot tolerate much side to side error in eye alignment will often result in a vignetted or clipped image the exit pupil width of say a binocular can be calculated as the objective diameter divided by the magnification and gives the width of the exit cone of light in the same dimensions as the objective for example a 10 42 binocular has a 4 2 mm wide exit cone and

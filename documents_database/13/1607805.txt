separation occurs if the predictor or a linear combination of some subset of the predictors is associated with only one outcome value when the predictor is greater than some constant for example if the predictor x is continuous and the outcome y 1 for all observed x 2 if the outcome values are perfectly determined by the predictor e g y 0 when x 2 then the condition complete separation is said to occur if instead there is some overlap e g y 0 when x standard error methods to fit these models include exact logistic regression and firth logistic regression a bias reduction method based on a penalized likelihood

during the earlier period of bowling a pinsetter commonly known as a pin boy was originally a person who manually set the pins and returned the ball to the bowler through simple ball return rails the first mechanical pinsetter was invented by gottfried fred schmidt who sold the patent in 1941 to amf which largely did away with pinsetting as a manual profession although a small number of bowling alleys still use human pinsetters while humans usually no longer set the pins a pinchaser or in slang pin monkey often is stationed near the equipment to ensure that it is clean and working properly and to clear minor jams beginning in the 1970s modern pinsetters are integrated with electronic scoring systems of varying sophistication while many pinsetters have a manual reset button to use in case the pinsetter does not automatically activate at the correct time other types have no automatic tracking of the state of the game especially for the candlepin and duckpin bowling sports which use smaller balls and are almost always manually activated the design of the machines varies depending both in individual company s hardware designs and for the particular bowling sport s playing rules and

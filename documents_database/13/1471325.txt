in ionic compounds salts such an atom may occur as a separate cation positive ion denoted by fe the adjective ferrous or the prefix ferro is often used to specify such compounds as in ferrous chloride for iron ii chloride the adjective ferric is used instead for iron iii salts containing the cation or fe the word ferrous is derived from the latin word ferrum for iron iron ii atoms may also occur as coordination complexes such as the polymer iron ii oxalate dihydrate or and organometallic compounds such as the neutral molecule ferrocene or iron is almost always encountered in the oxidation states 0 as in the metal 2 or 3 solid iron ii salts are relatively stable in air but in the presence of air and water they tend to oxidize to iron iii salts that include hydroxide or oxide anions all known forms of life require iron many proteins in living beings contain bound iron ions those are an important subclass of the metalloproteins examples include hemoglobin ferredoxin and the cytochromes these proteins perform their vital functions thanks to the relatively easy switching of the iron atom between the 2 and 3 states hemoglobin for example carries

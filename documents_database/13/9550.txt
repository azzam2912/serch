in most eukaryotes this takes place inside mitochondria almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation this pathway is so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis during oxidative phosphorylation electrons are transferred from electron donors to electron acceptors such as oxygen in redox reactions these redox reactions release energy which is used to form atp in eukaryotes these redox reactions are carried out by a series of protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell s mitochondria whereas in prokaryotes these proteins are located in the cells intermembrane space these linked sets of proteins are called electron transport chains in eukaryotes five main protein complexes are involved whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present using a variety of electron donors and acceptors the energy released by electrons flowing through this electron transport chain is used to transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane in a process called electron transport this generates potential energy in the form of a ph gradient and an electrical potential across this membrane this store of energy is tapped when protons flow back across the membrane and down the potential

the kdel sequence prevents a protein from being secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum er and facilitates its return if it is accidentally exported the similar sequence hdel performs the same function in yeasts while plants are known to utilize both kdel and hdel signaling sequences a protein with a functional kdel motif will be retrieved from the golgi apparatus by retrograde transport to the er lumen it also targets proteins from other locations such as the cytoplasm to the er proteins can only leave the er after this sequence has been cleaved off the abbreviation kdel is formed by the corresponding letters to each amino acid this letter system was defined by the iupac and iubmb in 1983 and is as follows therefore the kdel sequence in three letter code is lys asp glu leu the abbreviation hdel follows the same notation as kdel three letter code is his asp glu leu the soluble resident protein will remain in the er as long as it contains a kdel signal sequence on the c terminal end of the protein however since vesicle budding is such a dynamic process and there is a high concentration of soluble proteins in the er soluble

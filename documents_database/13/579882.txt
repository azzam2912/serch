while engines and motors have a large range of operating speeds the power band is usually a much smaller range of engine speed only half or less of the total engine speed range electric motors are an exception see the section on electric motors below specifically power band is the range of rpm around peak power output the power band of an internal combustion gasoline automobile engine typically starts at midrange engine speeds around 4 000 rpm where maximum torque is produced and ends close to the redline after reaching maximum power between 5 000 and 6 500 rpm diesel engines in cars and small trucks may develop maximum torque below 2 000 rpm with the power peak below 5 000 rpm a mechanical transmission with a selection of different gear ratios is designed to make satisfactory power available over the full range of vehicle speeds the goal of the selection of gear ratios is to keep the engine operating in its power band the narrower the band the more gears are needed closer together in ratio by careful gear selection an engine can be operated in its power band throughout all vehicle speeds such use prevents the engine from

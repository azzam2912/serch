created by peltarion synapse allows data mining statistical analysis visualization preprocessing design and training of neural networks and adaptive systems and the deployment of them it utilizes a plug in based architecture making it a general platform for signal processing the first version of the product was released in may 2006 due to its plug in based design the usage of synapse can be very general synapse is based on the microsoft net framework and all synapse components are also net components although peltarion has yet to release an official api for the synapse platform user made components are emerging some of them being original demonstrating the openness of the platform the development cycle in synapse is based on the canonical data mining cycle a notable difference however is that in synapse that cycle is not linear but supports an iterative approach where the user can freely move between the steps synapse features four different operating modes that make up the development cycle the preprocessing mode is for data mining and data preparation in this mode the user can import visualize explore and transform data in a variety of ways data is imported through the use of format components the

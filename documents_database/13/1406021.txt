as josepher describes the faux history differs from earlier approaches the faux historian begins like the authentic historian with an investigation the historian studies the facts of the case the facts of the case don t form a coherent researchable story the reasons for this are many the facts are few the facts are dubious the facts are disinformative for historians rooted to the historical method this conclusion closes the door on the case without facts what is history without facts what is a historian without facts what separates the historian from the fiction writer the faux history at this point in the proceedings picks up steam imagination replaces reality invention substitutes for truth fabrication kicks in but unlike earlier forms of historical fabrication historical fiction or alternative fiction the faux history maintains the shape of a thoroughly researched history josepher s latest work satan s synagogue 2019 chronicles 2 000 years of history the story follows a circuitous route from brooklyn to vienna to jerusalem to nazareth from elie wiesel to auschwitz to the holocaust from mark to jesus to josephus from josephus to franz joseph to josepher along the way ancient documents resurface and an assassination attempt explodes

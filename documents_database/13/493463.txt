in its basic form an armored jacket will include shoulder and elbow armor trousers will include hip and knee protection this armour is either closed cell or open cell foam and in various densities all the way up to a fairly hard foam used in helmets hard foams absorb impact shock by destructive decomposition so they can only be used to protect for one incident and must be replaced soft foams offer little protection with close cell foams providing a bit more protection than open cell foams of foam type armors memory foam armor achieves a higher level of impact absorption compared to open closed cell types above memory foam rebounds slowly after compression it is a very dense foam these are gel type impact shock absorbers they are produced in various densities and generally used close to the body for comfort hard armour usually consists of a hard plastic and is designed to resist abrasive and puncture injuries hard armour generally is used in conjunction with some impact absorbing foam or other material on the inner surfaces facing the body this is because hard armour by itself does not provide impact shock absorption qualities the use of viscoelastic materials

their main uses are in video games typically as middleware in which case the simulations are in real time the term is sometimes used more generally to describe any software system for simulating physical phenomena such as high performance scientific simulation there are generally two classes of physics engines real time and high precision high precision physics engines require more processing power to calculate very precise physics and are usually used by scientists and computer animated movies real time physics engines as used in video games and other forms of interactive computing use simplified calculations and decreased accuracy to compute in time for the game to respond at an appropriate rate for game play one of the first general purpose computers eniac was used as a very simple type of physics engine it was used to design ballistics tables to help the united states military estimate where artillery shells of various mass would land when fired at varying angles and gunpowder charges also accounting for drift caused by wind the results were calculated a single time only and were tabulated into printed tables handed out to the artillery commanders physics engines have been commonly used on supercomputers since the 1980s

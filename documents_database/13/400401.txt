some examples of subalgebras are subgroups submonoids subrings subfields subalgebras of algebras over a field or induced subgraphs shifting the point of view the larger structure is called an extension or a superstructure of its substructure in model theory the term submodel is often used as a synonym for substructure especially when the context suggests a theory of which both structures are models in the presence of relations i e for structures such as ordered groups or graphs whose signature is not functional it may make sense to relax the conditions on a subalgebra so that the relations on a weak substructure or weak subalgebra are at most those induced from the bigger structure subgraphs are an example where the distinction matters and the term subgraph does indeed refer to weak substructures ordered groups on the other hand have the special property that every substructure of an ordered group which is itself an ordered group is an induced substructure given two structures a and b of the same signature a is said to be a weak substructure of b or a weak subalgebra of b if a is said to be a substructure of b or a subalgebra of b

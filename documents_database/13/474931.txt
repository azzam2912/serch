the gram suffix derives from gramm meaning line in general an octagram is any self intersecting octagon 8 sided polygon the regular octagram is labeled by the schl fli symbol 8 3 which means an 8 sided star connected by every third point these variations have a lower dihedral dih symmetry the symbol rub el hizb is a unicode glyph at u 06de deeper truncations of the square can produce isogonal vertex transitive intermediate star polygon forms with equal spaced vertices and two edge lengths a truncated square is an octagon t 4 8 a quasitruncated square inverted as 4 3 is an octagram t 4 3 8 3 the uniform star polyhedron stellated truncated hexahedron t 4 3 t 4 3 3 has octagram faces constructed from the cube in this way there are two regular octagrammic star figures compounds of the form 8 k the first constructed as two squares 8 2 2 4 and second as four degenerate digons 8 4 4 2 there are other isogonal and isotoxal compounds including rectangular and rhombic forms an octagonal star can be seen as a concave hexadecagon with internal intersecting geometry erased it can also be dissected by radial

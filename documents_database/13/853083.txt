it shakes and weakens the rocks leaving them open to attack from hydraulic action and abrasion eroded material gets carried away by the wave wave pounding is particularly fierce in a storm where the waves are exceptionally large and have a lot of energy it is an important engineering consideration in the construction of structures such as seawalls and dams wave pounding is a force of erosion along coast lines the effects of wave pounding are influenced by wave shape ocean chemistry rock type and morphology of the coastal landscape there are three different types of waves to consider in this process spilling plunging and surging waves spilling waves have the least amount of energy associated with them due to their shallow ocean floor plunging and surging waves contain the energy associated with wave pounding plunging and surging waves occur on moderate to steep angled beach plains along with energy the water chemistry will also affect the rock exposed to the erosion salt calcium and acid levels in the ocean have adverse effects on specific rock types the chemical weathering due to wave processes is part of why wave pounding is so damaging wave pounding is not primarily caused by

the chen fox lyndon theorem states that the lyndon words furnish a factorisation the sch tzenberger theorem relates the definition in terms of a multiplicative property to an additive property let a be the free monoid on an alphabet a let x be a sequence of subsets of a indexed by a totally ordered index set i a factorisation of a word w in a is an expression with formula 2 and formula 3 a lyndon word over a totally ordered alphabet a is a word which is lexicographically less than all its rotations the chen fox lyndon theorem states that every string may be formed in a unique way by concatenating a non increasing sequence of lyndon words hence taking x to be the singleton set l for each lyndon word l with the index set l of lyndon words ordered lexicographically we obtain a factorisation of a such a factorisation can be found in linear time a bisection of a free monoid is a factorisation with just two classes x x examples if x y are disjoint sets of non empty words then x y is a bisection of a if and only if as a consequence for

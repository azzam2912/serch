it is the only well characterised oxide of palladium it is prepared by treating the metal with oxygen above about 900 c the oxide reverts to palladium metal and oxygen gas it is not attacked by acids the structure of pdo is tetragonal p 42 mmc a 3 044 c 5 328 the pd atoms are square planar as expected for a d metal ion and the oxygen atoms are approximately tetrahedral the closest pd pd distance is 3 044 and is almost within the range which can be considered a bonding distance pdo is often obtained as a poorly defined material that is generated for applications as a catalyst palladium oxide is prepared by heating palladium sponge metal in oxygen at 350 c the oxide is obtained as a black powder the oxide also may be prepared specially for catalytic use by heating variously a mixture of palladium ii chloride and potassium nitrate or the product of dissolving palladium in aqua regia followed by the addition of sodium nitrate at 600 c a hydrated form of the oxide which dissolves in acid can be prepared by precipitation from solution for example by hydrolysis of palladium nitrate or reaction of

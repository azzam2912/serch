a lens with a larger maximum aperture that is a smaller minimum f number is called a fast lens because it can achieve the same exposure with a faster shutter speed conversely a smaller maximum aperture larger minimum f number is slow because it delivers less light intensity and requires a slower longer shutter speed a fast lens speed is desirable in taking pictures in dim light or with long telephoto lenses and for controlling depth of field and bokeh especially in portrait photography and for sports photography and photojournalism lenses may also be referred to as being faster or slower than one another so an lens can be described as faster than an 5 6 attaining maximum lens speed requires engineering tradeoffs and as such prime fixed focal length lenses are generally faster than zoom lenses and modern manual focus lenses are generally faster than their autofocus counterparts with 35mm cameras the fastest lenses are typically in the normal lens range near 50mm and there are several high quality fast lenses available that are relatively inexpensive for example the canon ef 50mm 1 8 ii or nikon af nikkor 50mm 1 8d are very inexpensive but quite fast and

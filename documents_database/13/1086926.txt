the galaxy known as ngc 3842 is the brightest member of this cluster along with the coma cluster it is one of the two major clusters comprising the coma supercluster which in turn is part of the cfa2 great wall which is hundreds of millions light years long and is one of the largest known structures in the universe a team of scientists decided to observe the leo cluster with the intention of creating a catalog of extended ionized gas clouds or eigs this data also led to the discovery of many star forming parents galaxies within the cluster these star forming galaxies turned out to be very similar to those found in the neighboring coma cluster the eigs in the leo cluster however turned out to be longer in the leo cluster compared to the coma cluster this likely means that the leo cluster and its stars are probably younger than most comparable clusters in the universe and evolve at a different pace most dense galaxy clusters are composed mostly of elliptical galaxies the leo cluster however mostly contains spiral galaxies suggesting that it is much younger than other comparable clusters such as the coma cluster it is also

humans cannot synthesize neu5gc because the human gene cmah is irreversibly mutated though it is found in apes it is absent in human tissues because of inactivation of gene encoding cmp n acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase the gene cmah encodes for cmp n acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase which is the enzyme responsible for cmp neu5gc from cmp n acetylneuraminic cmp neu5ac acid this loss of cmah is estimated to have occurred 2 3 million years ago just before the emergence of the genus homo neu5gc is closely related to the commonly known n acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac neu5ac differs by a single oxygen atom that is added by the cmah enzyme in the cytosol of a cell in many mammals both of these molecules are transferred into the golgi so that they may be added to many glycoconjugates however in humans neu5gc is not present with the loss of neu5gc gene and gain of excess neu5ac it should have affected the interactions of pathogens and humans humans should have been less susceptible to neu5gc binding pathogens and more susceptible to neu5ac binding pathogens it is suggested that human ancestors lacking neu5gc production survived a then prevailing malaria epidemic however with the rise of

although these anabolic reactions occur throughout the body most sam e is produced and consumed in the liver more than 40 methyl transfers from sam e are known to various substrates such as nucleic acids proteins lipids and secondary metabolites it is made from adenosine triphosphate atp and methionine by methionine adenosyltransferase ec 2 5 1 6 sam was first discovered by giulio cantoni in 1952 in bacteria sam e is bound by the sam riboswitch which regulates genes involved in methionine or cysteine biosynthesis in eukaryotic cells sam e serves as a regulator of a variety of processes including dna trna and rrna methylation immune response amino acid metabolism transsulfuration and more in plants sam e is crucial to the biosynthesis of ethylene an important plant hormone and signaling molecule the reactions that produce consume and regenerate sam e are called the sam e cycle in the first step of this cycle the sam dependent methylases ec 2 1 1 that use sam e as a substrate produce s adenosyl homocysteine as a product s adenosyl homocysteine is a strong negative regulator of nearly all sam dependent methylases despite their biological diversity this is hydrolysed to homocysteine and adenosine

magnetostriction is a property of all electrical non conductors or dielectrics that causes them to change their shape under the application of an electric field electrostriction is a property of all dielectric materials and is caused by displacement of ions in the crystal lattice upon being exposed to an external electric field positive ions will be displaced in the direction of the field while negative ions will be displaced in the opposite direction this displacement will accumulate throughout the bulk material and result in an overall strain elongation in the direction of the field the thickness will be reduced in the orthogonal directions characterized by poisson s ratio all insulating materials consisting of more than one type of atom will be ionic to some extent due to the difference of electronegativity of the atoms and therefore exhibit electrostriction the resulting strain ratio of deformation to the original dimension is proportional to the square of the polarization reversal of the electric field does not reverse the direction of the deformation more formally the electrostriction coefficient is a fourth rank tensor formula 1 relating the second order strain tensor formula 2 and the first order electric polarization density formula 3 formula 4

dmr theory was first developed by anthropologist harvey whitehouse following his ethnographic fieldwork in papua new guinea the theory proposes that religions tend to coalesce around two divergent modes termed imagistic and doctrinal which are distinguished primarily by their ritual practices the imagistic mode is characterized by infrequently performed high arousal rituals e g initiation rites and is associated with small scale exclusive religious groups in contrast the doctrinal mode is characterized by frequently performed low arousal rituals e g daily recitations of sacred texts and is associated with larger inclusive communities as found in the major world religions the theory posits that these differing ritual patterns promote the transmission of religious traditions by exploiting core memory processes imagistic rituals arouse strong emotion and generate vivid flashbulb like episodic memories while doctrinal rituals repetitive nature means that rather than individual events the experiences over time are stored in procedural and semantic memories later formulations of the theory also emphasised the different forms of group cohesion that are generated by the two modes with imagistic rituals promoting intense relational bonds with the other ritual participants and doctrinal rituals promoting more diffuse categorical bonds with larger communities who share the same identity

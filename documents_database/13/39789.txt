the reverse process deplasmolysis or cytolysis can occur if the cell is in a hypotonic solution resulting in a lower external osmotic pressure and a net flow of water into the cell through observation of plasmolysis and deplasmolysis it is possible to determine the tonicity of the cell s environment as well as the rate solute molecules cross the cellular membrane a plant cell in hypotonic solution will absorb water by endosmosis so that the increased volume of water in the cell will increase pressure making the protoplasm push against the cell wall a condition known as turgor turgor makes plant cells push against each other in the same way and is the main line method of support in non woody plant tissue plant cell walls resist further water entry after a certain point known as full turgor which stops plant cells from bursting as animal cells do in the same conditions this is also the reason that plants stand upright without the stiffness of the plant cells the plant would fall under its own weight turgor pressure allows plants to stay firm and erect and plants without turgor pressure known as flaccid wilt a cell will begin to decline

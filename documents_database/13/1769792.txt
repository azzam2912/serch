it can be extracted from the periplasm of the gram negative bacterium thiobacillus ferrooxidans t ferrooxidans also known as acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans at ferrooxidans rusticyanin is also found in the membrane bound form in the surface of t ferrooxidans it is a part of an electron transfer chain for fe ii oxidation as t ferrooxidans can grow aerobically at ph values of 1 6 to 3 5 it obtains its energy for chemolithotrophic growth on soluble ferrous ions rusticyanin is involved in the respiratory oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric ions producing three protons for every ferrous ion oxidized the mechanism of electron transfer in the respiratory oxidation pathway of fe in t ferrooxidans is still unclear despite decades of research in this area however the involvement of rusticyanin in shuttling electrons from a cytochrome c2 to another cytochrome c4 during the oxidation of ferrous to ferric ions is experimentally shown rusticyanin is thought to shuttle electrons from high molecular weight cytochrome via cytochrome c552 to cytochrome oxidase predicted functional partners include coxd cytochrome c oxidase aa3 type subunit iv 64 amino acids coxc cytochrome c oxidase aa3 type subunit iii 184 amino acids ctab protoheme ix farnesyltransferase cytochrome c 485

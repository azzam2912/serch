the term unsaturated means more hydrogen atoms may be added to the hydrocarbon to make it saturated i e consisting all single bonds the configuration of an unsaturated carbons include straight chain such as alkenes and alkynes as well as branched chains and aromatic compounds except for aromatic compounds unsaturated hydrocarbons are mostly reactive and undergo multiple reactions to their multiple bonds for the sake of clearer communication and less misunderstanding a consistent naming system is necessary which gives rise to the iupac nomenclature some standard steps to follow when naming unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules with iupac nomenclature are elaborated below in organic chemistry cis and trans prefixes are used to describe the position of functional groups attached to carbon atoms in a double bond in latin cis and trans mean on this side of and on the other side of respectively therefore if the functional groups are on the same side of the carbon chain the bond is assigned cis configuration otherwise i e the functional groups are on the opposite side of the carbon chain the bond is assigned trans configuration the cis and trans configuration requires the existence of a carbon chain or that at least one functional

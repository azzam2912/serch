this can conserve flight distance reduce congestion and allow flights into airports without beacons area navigation used to be called random navigation hence the acronym rnav rnav can be defined as a method of navigation that permits aircraft operation on any desired course within the coverage of station referenced navigation signals or within the limits of a self contained system capability or a combination of these in the united states rnav was developed in the 1960s and the first such routes were published in the 1970s in january 1983 the federal aviation administration revoked all rnav routes in the contiguous united states due to findings that aircraft were using inertial navigation systems rather than the ground based beacons and so cost benefit analysis was not in favour of maintaining the rnav routes system rnav was reintroduced after the large scale introduction of satellite navigation the continuing growth of aviation increases demands on airspace capacity thus emphasising the need for optimum utilisation of available airspace improved operational efficiency derived from the application of area navigation techniques has resulted in the development of navigation applications in various regions worldwide and for all phases of flight these applications could potentially be expanded to

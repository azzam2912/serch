two events will be simultaneous when they are on a line hyperbolically orthogonal to a particular time line this dependence on a certain time line is determined by velocity and is the basis for the relativity of simultaneity two lines are hyperbolic orthogonal when they are reflections of each other over the asymptote of a given hyperbola two particular hyperbolas are frequently used in the plane the relation of hyperbolic orthogonality actually applies to classes of parallel lines in the plane where any particular line can represent the class thus for a given hyperbola and asymptote a a pair of lines a b are hyperbolic orthogonal if there is a pair c d such that formula 1 and c is the reflection of d across a similar to the perpendularity of a circle radius to the tangent a radius to a hyperbola is hyperbolic orthogonal to a tangent to the hyperbola a bilinear form is used to describe orthogonality in analytic geometry with two elements orthogonal when their bilinear form vanishes in the plane of complex numbers formula 2 the bilinear form is formula 3 while in the plane of hyperbolic numbers formula 4 the bilinear form is formula 5

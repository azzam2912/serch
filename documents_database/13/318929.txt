the name is an acronym of the names of people who discovered it de bruijn van aardenne ehrenfest smith and tutte let g v e be a directed graph an eulerian circuit is a directed closed path which visits each edge exactly once in 1736 euler showed that g has an eulerian circuit if and only if g is connected and the indegree is equal to outdegree at every vertex in this case g is called eulerian we denote the indegree of a vertex v by deg v the best theorem states that the number ec g of eulerian circuits in a connected eulerian graph g is given by the formula here t g is the number of arborescences which are trees directed towards the root at a fixed vertex w in g the number t g can be computed as a determinant by the version of the matrix tree theorem for directed graphs it is a property of eulerian graphs that t g t g for every two vertices v and w in a connected eulerian graph g the best theorem shows that the number of eulerian circuits in directed graphs can be computed in polynomial time a problem

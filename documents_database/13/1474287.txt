their name comes from their ability to bind calcium in birds and mammals they consist of three family members cst1 2 and 3 in nematodes one ortholog casy 1 originally cdh11 is known cst1 clstn1 was first shown to be predominantly expressed in postsynaptic membranes of excitatory neurons cst2 and 3 were found in an increased manner in inhibitory gabaergic neurons in adult and embryonic tissue calsyntenins interact with numerous proteins such as with kinesin 1 and the app linker protein x11l mint2 and were shown to have multi purpose functions both within and outside the nervous system shortly after the calsyntenins were discovered they were found to regulate postsynaptic calcium concentration later it was found that another key function is to link vesicles to kinesin light chain klc and thus to co determine transport of distinct cargo recent studies identified a role for calsyntenin 1 in the regulation of vesicular trafficking of guidance receptors in di1 axons at choice points in cooperation with rabgdi guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor calsyntenin 1 shuttles rab11 positive vesicles containing robo1 to the growth cone surface in a precisely regulated manner by contrast calsyntenin 1 mediated trafficking of frizzled 3 a guidance receptor in

a calibration curve is one approach to the problem of instrument calibration other standard approaches may mix the standard into the unknown giving an internal standard the calibration curve is a plot of how the instrumental response the so called analytical signal changes with the concentration of the analyte the substance to be measured the operator prepares a series of standards across a range of concentrations near the expected concentration of analyte in the unknown the concentrations of the standards must lie within the working range of the technique instrumentation they are using analyzing each of these standards using the chosen technique will produce a series of measurements for most analyses a plot of instrument response vs concentration will show a linear relationship the operator can measure the response of the unknown and using the calibration curve can interpolate to find the concentration of analyte in more general use a calibration curve is a curve or table for a measuring instrument which measures some parameter indirectly giving values for the desired quantity as a function of values of sensor output for example a calibration curve can be made for a particular pressure transducer to determine applied pressure from transducer output

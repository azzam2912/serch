the ihy will focus on advancements in all aspects of the heliosphere and its interaction with the interstellar medium this effort culminates in the international heliophysical year ihy in 2007 2008 the ihy concluded in february 2009 but was largely continued via the international space weather initiative iswi the term heliophysical was coined to refer specifically to this activity of studying the interconnectedness of the entire solar heliospheric planetary system it is a broadening of the concept geophysical extending the connections from the earth to the sun interplanetary space on the 50th anniversary of the international geophysical year the 2007 ihy activities will build on the success of igy 1957 by continuing its legacy of system sides studies of the extended heliophysical domain the ihy 2007 has been planned to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the international geophysical year igy in 1957 1958 one of the most successful international science programs of all time the igy was a broad based and all encompassing effort to push the frontiers of geophysics and resulted in tremendous progress in space physics sun earth connections planetary science and the heliosphere in general the tradition of international science years began almost 125 years ago

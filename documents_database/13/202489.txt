a shaft is supported by a compliant spring loaded foil journal lining once the shaft is spinning fast enough the working fluid usually air pushes the foil away from the shaft so that no contact occurs the shaft and foil are separated by the air s high pressure which is generated by the rotation that pulls gas into the bearing via viscosity effects a high speed of the shaft with respect to the foil is required to initiate the air gap and once this has been achieved no wear occurs unlike aerostatic or hydrostatic bearings foil bearings require no external pressurisation system for the working fluid so the hydrodynamic bearing is self starting foil bearings were first developed in the late 1950s by airesearch mfg co of the garrett corporation using independent r d funds to serve military and space applications they were first tested for commercial use in united airlines boeing 727 and boeing 737 cooling turbines in the early and mid 1960s garrett airesearch air cycle machine foil bearings were first installed as original equipment in 1969 in the dc 10 s environmental control systems garrett airesearch foil bearings were installed on all us military aircraft to replace

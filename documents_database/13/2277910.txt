they are known from isolated sclerites but are believed to have a scleritomous halkieria like construction dailyatia and camenella have distinct dorsal symmetrical and lateral asymmetric sclerite morphologies the same has been asserted for lapworthella even though that has not always been the common perception it has been argued that camenella kelanella and lapworthella assuming a slug like anatomy had an anterior head valve followed by pairs of asymmetric valves running in pairs along their dorsal surface the head valve in lapworthella that is the bilaterally symmetric morph a valve is thought to have fused from two ontogenetically separate sclerites dailyatia has a similar double mounded structure at the tip of its a type sclerites growth rings in all are marked out by prominent external ridges two families kennardiidae three sclerite morphs one of which conventionally termed the a morph is bilaterally symmetrical the other two occurring in sinistral and dextral variants includes kennardia and dailyatia and questionably shetlandia lapworthellidae sclerites occur in something of a morphological continuum but essentially form a single type with a sinistral and dextral version possibly with the anterior most pair of sclerites fusing into a single bilaterally symmetrical dual tipped sclerite dailyatia species

they are slow moving bottom dwellers the largest species is the atlantic torpedo tetronarce nobiliana which can grow to a weight of and deliver a 220 volt electric shock electric rays have patches of modified muscle cells called electroplaques that make up an electric organ these generate an electric gradient similar to the normal electric potential across most cell membranes but amplified greatly by its concentration into a very small area the electricity can be stored in the tissues which act as a battery the shock can be discharged in pulses a ray can emit a shock into the body of a prey animal to stun it and make it easier to capture and eat or into the body of a predator tissue from electric rays is often used in neurobiological research because of its unique properties torpedo rays are flat like other rays disc shaped with caudal fins that vary in length their mouths and gill slits are located on their undersides males have claspers near the base of the tail females are ovoviviparous meaning they form eggs but do not lay them the young emerge from the eggs within the body of the female and she gives live

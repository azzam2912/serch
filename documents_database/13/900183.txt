the book was unavailable for many years then made available on line and finally reprinted in 2009 with additional chapters on current applications in clinical medicine the stewart approach models the complex chemical equilibrium system known as acid base balance stewart introduced the term strong ion difference or sid to mean the concentration of strongly dissociating cations minus the concentration of strongly dissociating anions he characterised this the total weak acid concentration and the partial pressure of co as independent variables and formulated a quartic equation relating h to these three independent variables the quartic equation was solved numerically by computer and has never been validated by titration or physiological experiments the model ignores intracellular and extravascular compartments the impact of the stewart analysis has been slow in coming but there has been a recent resurgence in interest particularly as this approach provides explanations for several areas which are otherwise difficult to understand e g dilutional acidosis acid base disorders related to changes in plasma albumin concentration ole siggaard andersen author of the textbook the acid base status of the blood wrote the stewart approach is absurd and anachronistic this is because stewart began by characterising sid a and p

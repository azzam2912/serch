it was developed by the chemist chaim weizmann and was the primary process used to make acetone during world war i such as to produce cordite a substance essential for the british war industry the process may be likened to how yeast ferments sugars to produce ethanol for wine beer or fuel but the organisms that carry out the abe fermentation are strictly anaerobic obligate anaerobes the abe fermentation produces solvents in a ratio of 3 parts acetone 6 parts butanol to 1 part ethanol it usually uses a strain of bacteria from the class clostridia family clostridiaceae clostridium acetobutylicum is the most well studied and widely used species although clostridium beijerinckii has also been used with good results for gas stripping the most common gases used are the off gases from the fermentation itself a mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas the production of butanol by biological means was first performed by louis pasteur in 1861 in 1905 austrian biochemist franz schardinger found that acetone could similarly be produced in 1910 auguste fernbach 1860 1939 developed a bacterial fermentation process using potato starch as a feedstock in the production of butanol industrial exploitation of abe fermentation started in

in first order logic with identity the sentence x x x is a ground formula a ground expression is a ground term or ground formula consider the following expressions from first order logic over a signature containing a constant symbol 0 for the number 0 a unary function symbol s for the successor function and a binary function symbol for addition what follows is a formal definition for first order languages let a first order language be given with formula 1 the set of constant symbols formula 2 the set of individual variables formula 3 the set of functional operators and formula 4 the set of predicate symbols ground terms are terms that contain no variables they may be defined by logical recursion formula recursion roughly speaking the herbrand universe is the set of all ground terms a ground predicate or ground atom or ground literal is an atomic formula all of whose argument terms are ground terms if p p is an n ary predicate symbol and are ground terms then p is a ground predicate or ground atom roughly speaking the herbrand base is the set of all ground atoms while a herbrand interpretation assigns a truth value

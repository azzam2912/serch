this is one of various proposals that have been made to quantify the relative costs of using different radices in representing numbers especially in computer systems radix economy also has implications for organizational structure networking and other fields the radix economy e b n for any particular number n in a given base b is defined as where we use the floor function formula 2 and the base b logarithm formula 3 if both b and n are positive integers then the radix economy formula 4 is equal to the number of digits needed to express the number n in base b multiplied by base b the radix economy thus measures the cost of storing or processing the number n in base b if the cost of each digit is proportional to b a base with a lower average radix economy is therefore in some senses more efficient than a base with a higher average radix economy for example 100 in decimal has three digits so its radix economy is 10 3 30 its binary representation has seven digits 1100100 so it has radix economy 2 7 14 in base 2 in base 3 its representation has five digits 10201

the new bridge replaced a bascule bridge that was built in 1936 the bascule bridge was demolished in the early 2000 s as it was considered structural deficient and unsafe the mass dot then erected a temporary vertical lift bridge rising to 200 which stayed in place until the new bridge was completed in 2018 the replacement fore river vertical lift bridge has an increased vertical clearance of 60 in the closed position and over 220 in the open position this will help reduce the number of openings during the busy summer months the navigable channel horizontal clearance increased the previous width of 175 to 250 and can now accommodate larger marine freighters providing better access to the fore river s designated port area in addition dolphins and fenders were installed to protect the new bridge structure from ship collision the total length of the bridge including the approaches is 2 216 the bridge architecture of the new vertical lift bridge is inspired in the art deco features on the demolished 1936 previous bridge but has been interpreted for modern times the bridge includes a signature light grey color a stainless steel mesh enclosure that wraps around the access stairs

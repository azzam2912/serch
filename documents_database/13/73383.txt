it was instrumented by dr james van allen s group the department of defense s advanced research projects agency had initially planned two satellites for the purposes of studying the van allen radiation belts and the effects of nuclear explosions upon these belts and the earth s magnetosphere in general however explorer 4 was the only such satellite launched as the other explorer 5 suffered launch failure explorer 4 was a cylindrically shaped satellite instrumented to make the first detailed measurements of charged particles protons and electrons trapped in the terrestrial radiation belts launched from a juno i rocket the mission remained secret from the public for six months the satellite telemetry was analyzed for three operation argus nuclear weapons tests at high altitude an unexpected tumble motion of the satellite made the interpretation of the detector data very difficult the low power transmitter and the plastic scintillator detector failed september 3 1958 the two geiger m ller tubes and the caesium iodide crystal detectors continued to operate normally until september 19 1958 the high power transmitter ceased sending signals on october 5 1958 it is believed that exhaustion of the power batteries caused these failures the spacecraft decayed from

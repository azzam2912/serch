the integration of the plasmid into the cell s chromosome is through homologous recombination a conjugative plasmid capable of chromosome integration is also called an episome a segment of dna that can exist as a plasmid or become integrated into the chromosome when conjugation occurs hfr cells are very efficient in delivering chromosomal genes of the cell into recipient f cells which lack the episome the hfr strain was first characterized by luca cavalli sforza william hayes also isolated another hfr strain independently an hfr cell can transfer a portion of the bacterial genome despite being integrated into the chromosomal dna of the bacteria the f factor of hfr cells can still initiate conjugative transfer without being excised from the bacterial chromosome first due to the f factor s inherent tendency to transfer itself during conjugation the rest of the bacterial genome is dragged along with it therefore unlike a normal f cell hfr strains will attempt to transfer their entire dna through the mating bridge in a fashion similar to the normal conjugation in a typical conjugation the recipient cell also becomes f after conjugation as it receives an entire copy of the f factor plasmid but this is

introduced by the russian mathematician ivan ivanovich zhegalkin in 1927 they are the polynomial ring over the integers modulo 2 the resulting degeneracies of modular arithmetic result in zhegalkin polynomials being simpler than ordinary polynomials requiring neither coefficients nor exponents coefficients are redundant because 1 is the only nonzero coefficient exponents are redundant because in arithmetic mod 2 x x hence a polynomial such as 3 x y z is congruent to and can therefore be rewritten as xyz prior to 1927 boolean algebra had been considered a calculus of logical values with logical operations of conjunction disjunction negation etc zhegalkin showed that all boolean operations could be written as ordinary numeric polynomials thinking of the logical constants 0 and 1 as integers mod 2 the logical operation of conjunction is realized as the arithmetic operation of multiplication xy and logical exclusive or as arithmetic addition mod 2 written here as x y to avoid confusion with the common use of as a synonym for inclusive or logical complement x is then derived from 1 and as x 1 since and form a sufficient basis for the whole of boolean algebra meaning that all other logical operations are obtainable as

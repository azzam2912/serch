while the o m standard was developed in the context of geographic information systems the model is derived from generic patterns proposed by fowler and odell and is not limited to spatial information o m is one of the core standards in the ogc sensor web enablement suite providing the response model for sensor observation service sos the core of the standard provides the observation schema an observation is an act that results in the estimation of the value of a feature property and involves application of a specified procedure such as a sensor instrument algorithm or process chain the procedure may be applied in situ remotely or ex situ with respect to the sampling location use of a common model for observation metadata allows data to be combined unambiguously across discipline boundaries observation details are also important for data discovery and for data quality estimation an observation is defined in terms of the set of properties that support these applications o m defines a core set of properties for an observation the key to the model is the division of the observation and its feature of interest separating the concerns so that the appropriate information associated with the description

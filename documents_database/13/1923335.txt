the process is widely used to convert oxides to sulfides but is also related to corrosion and surface modification sulfidation is relevant to the formation of sulfide minerals a large scale application of sulfidation is the conversion of molybdenum oxides to the corresponding sulfides this conversion is a step in the preparation of catalysts for hydrodesulfurization wherein alumina impregnated with molybdate salts are converted to molybdenum disulfide by the action of hydrogen sulfide in organosulfur chemistry sulfiding is often called thiation the preparation of thioamides from amides involves thiation a typical reagent is phosphorus pentasulfide ps the idealized equation for this conversion is the process involves no redox reaction it is known that aluminum improves the sulfidation resistance of iron alloys the sulfidation of tungsten is a multiple step process the first step is an oxidation reaction converting the tungsten to a tungsten bronze on the surface of the object the tungsten bronze coating is then converted to a sulfide one commonly encountered occurrence of sulfidation in manufacturing environments involves the sulfidic corrosion of metal piping the increased resistance to corrosion found in stainless steel is attributed to a layer of chromium oxide that forms due to oxidation of the

perennial streams are contrasted with intermittent streams which normally cease flowing for weeks or months each year and with ephemeral channels that flow only for hours or days following rainfall during unusually dry years a normally perennial stream may cease flowing becoming intermittent for days weeks or months depending on severity of the drought the boundaries between perennial intermittent and ephemeral channels are not defined and subject to a variety of identification methods adopted by local governments academics and others with a need to classify stream flow permanence as stream flow decreases in dry weather visible flow above the stream bed may not be readily evident especially in streams with coarse substrate gravel and rocks where water is flowing beneath and between these particles hyporheic flow from a biological perspective a stream may be considered flowing if sufficient water is available to support flow dependent aquatic life including fish and gill breathing amphibians benthic insects crustaceans and mollusks many of which survive in shallow hyporheic flow beneath rocks or logs this extreme low flow may not be detectable on typical usgs stream flow gauges but is vital to stream ecology the word perennial comes from the 1640s evergreen formed in

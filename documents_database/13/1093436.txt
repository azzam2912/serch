the primary star is a single lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 42 9 days there was once thought to be a fourth star in the system the red dwarf binary kuiper 90 designated 17 lyrae c until it was evident that the star s parallax and proper motions were too different for it to be part of the system the separation between 17 lyrae ab and c is increasing rapidly from less than 2 in 1881 to nearly 5 in 2014 a number of other visual companions have been catalogued the closest is the 11th magnitude star at 39 and the brightest is bd 32 3325 just over 2 away the primary component 17 lyrae a is a 5th magnitude main sequence star of the spectral type f0 meaning it has a surface temperature of about 6 750 k it is about 60 more massive than the sun and 16 times more luminous it has been catalogued as an am star but is now believed to be a relatively normal quickly rotating star the visible companion 17 lyrae b is a 9th magnitude star of an unknown spectral type the spectroscopic companion cannot be detected in the spectrum

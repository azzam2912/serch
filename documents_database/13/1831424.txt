aopdf was invented by pierre tournois typically quartz crystals are used for the fabrication of the aopdfs operating in the uv spectral domain paratellurite crystals are used in the visible and the nir up to 4 m and calomel in the mir 3 20 m recently introduced lithium niobate crystals allow for high repetition rate operation 100 khz owing to their high acoustic velocity the aopdf is also used for the active control of the carrier envelope phase of the few cycle optical pulses and as a part of pulse measurement schemes although sharing a lot in principle of operation with an acousto optic tunable filter the aopdf should not be confused with it since in the former the tunable parameter is the transfer function and in the latter it is the impulse response traveling acoustic wave induces variations in optical properties thus forming a dynamic volume grating aopdf is a programmable spectral filter from signal processing point of view the aopdf corresponds to a time variant passive linear transversal filter with a programmable finite impulse response phase and amplitude filtering in the aopdf is achieved by virtue of birefringent acousto optic effect and can be represented by a convolution

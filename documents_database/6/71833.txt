the goal of precision agriculture research is to define a decision support system dss for whole farm management with the goal of optimizing returns on inputs while preserving resources among these many approaches is a phytogeomorphological approach which ties multi year crop growth stability characteristics to topological terrain attributes the interest in the phytogeomorphological approach stems from the fact that the geomorphology component typically dictates the hydrology of the farm field the practice of precision agriculture has been enabled by the advent of gps and gnss the farmer s and or researcher s ability to locate their precise position in a field allows for the creation of maps of the spatial variability of as many variables as can be measured e g crop yield terrain features topography organic matter content moisture levels nitrogen levels ph ec mg k and others similar data is collected by sensor arrays mounted on gps equipped combine harvesters these arrays consist of real time sensors that measure everything from chlorophyll levels to plant water status along with multispectral imagery this data is used in conjunction with satellite imagery by variable rate technology vrt including seeders sprayers etc to optimally distribute resources however recent technological advances

the development of the polymers is potentially a treatment for bacterial diseases the research takes a novel approach to combating bacteria rather than poisoning them as antibiotics do snapps and other antimicrobial peptides tear the bacteria apart the molecule destabilizes the structure of the outer membrane and cytoplasmic membrane in multi drug resistant gram negative bacteria with no resistance observed by the researchers through multiple bacterial generations while no human trials have been approved yet the molecule has been tested in vivo with the mouse peritonitis model and was shown to be highly selective towards bacterial cell walls leaving mammalian cells unharmed bacteria species tested include e coli and k pneumoniae along with variants of p aeruginosa and a baumannii snapps work by literally tearing the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane apart leading to cell death their structure physically resembles a star at the core of their structure is a multi functional initiator poly amidoamine with 16 or 32 primary amines lysine and valine amino acids are polymerized to the n terminus of the core in order to form either an s16 16 arm snapp or s32 32 arm snapp the polymerized peptide chains result in several positively charged primary

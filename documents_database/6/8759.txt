electrons pass by the openings to these cavities and cause microwaves to oscillate within similar to the way a whistle produces a tone when excited by an air stream blown past its opening the frequency of the microwaves produced the resonant frequency is determined by the cavities physical dimensions unlike other vacuum tubes such as a klystron or a traveling wave tube twt the magnetron cannot function as an amplifier in order to increase the intensity of an applied microwave signal the magnetron serves solely as an oscillator generating a microwave signal from direct current electricity supplied to the vacuum tube an early form of magnetron was invented by h gerdien in 1910 another form of magnetron tube the split anode magnetron was invented by albert hull of general electric research laboratory in 1920 but it achieved only a frequency of 30 khz similar devices were experimented with by many teams through the 1920s and 1930s hans erich hollmann filed a patent on a design similar to the modern tube in 1935 but the more stable klystron was preferred for most german radars during world war ii an important advance was the multi cavity magnetron first proposed in 1934 by

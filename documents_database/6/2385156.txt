it was founded by dr leslie field in 2008 and is based in menlo park california ice911 s approach is to spread hollow silica microspheres reflective sand on top of ice in the arctic the microspheres raise the reflecting power of polar ice this reduces the amount of sunlight absorbed and slows the melting of the ice the microspheres are bright white and each one is 35 microns in diameter less than the diameter of a human hair the microspheres are filled with air and they float the vision is to cover a strategic area of the arctic about the size of belgium with microspheres target locations will be near communities that depend on the ice and routes through which melting ice reaches the wider ocean ice911 aims to rebuild a natural system with the least possible intervention ice911 s silica microspheres will dissolve over time this is a form of soft geoengineering it is claimed to be less damaging and more reversible than other techniques some scientists are concerned about the risks of restoring arctic ice as this approach could have unintended consequences ice911 maintains that its approach will not drastically alter the ecosystem or pollute the environment since

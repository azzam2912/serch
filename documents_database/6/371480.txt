autodynamics never gained status as a viable alternative model within the physics community and today is wholly rejected by mainstream science the primary claim of autodynamics is that the equations of the lorentz transformation are incorrectly formulated to describe relativistic effects which would invalidate special relativity general relativity and maxwell s equations the effect of the revised equations proposed in autodynamics is to cause particle mass to decrease with particle velocity being exchanged with kinetic energy with mass being zero and kinetic energy being equal to the rest mass at c this exchange between mass and energy is the proposed mechanism underlying most of the derived conclusions of autodynamics ancillary predictions of autodynamics include autodynamics is wholly rejected by the mainstream scientific community since carezani s original publication no papers on autodynamics have appeared in the scientific literature except for additional papers by carezani published in alternative journals such as physics essays a 1999 article in the magazine wired quotes h pierre noyes a professor at the stanford linear accelerator center as stating autodynamics was disproved special relativity is correct noyes was a researcher in an experiment attempting to compare the predictions of sr and ad and concluded that the

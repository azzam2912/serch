it is primarily composed of an electronically commutated synchronous motor ecm with a permanent magnet rotor the ecm is a motor that converts a direct current dc from an electrical source into an alternating current ac which is sent to the motor itself allowing for increased efficiency over standard ac motors the permanent magnet rotor consists of an iron core surrounded by multiple magnetic rare earth metals and finally a metal sleeve that evenly spaces the magnets around the core which helps to drive the motor by utilizing multiple small improvements in pump design technology such as a double pump in parallel system and variable controls these pumps are able to run at about a 50 to 70 increased efficiency with up to an 80 decrease in electricity consumption over the previous standard design this pump has recently become the new standard in both commercial and residential buildings across the european union due to a recent ordinance by the european erp eco design directive the erp directive began enforcing this new standard of regulation of these pumps january 1st 2013 and will become even stricter on efficiency standards on august 1st 2015 in order to meet the eu s goal

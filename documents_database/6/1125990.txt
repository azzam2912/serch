in general it is used for shares bonds and other securities it may be computed in two ways either the number of bids received divided by the number of bids accepted or the value of bids received divided by the value of bids accepted the higher the ratio the higher the demand a ratio above 2 0 indicates a successful auction with aggressive bids a lower reading indicates weak demand and is said to have a long tail a wide spread between the average and the high yield it is also a measure of the demand for securities at an offering or auction it is most commonly used to measure demand at bond auctions it is the ratio of the value of all bids received to the value of the bids accepted for example suppose debt managers are seeking to raise 10 billion in ten year notes with a 5 130 coupon and in aggregate they have received seven bids from lenders as follows the total of all bids received is 19 5 billion and the number of bids accepted would be 10 billion therefore leading to a bid to cover ratio of 1 95 calculated by the value method

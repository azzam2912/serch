not only are these contexts too numerous to list in their entirety for any agroecosystem but their interactions are so complex it is impossible to perfectly characterize a system let alone predict the effect a given perturbation will have on the whole at the same time all of these contexts are dynamic albeit at wildly diverging time scales so the ecology of contexts for an agroecosystem is fundamentally mutable an awareness of the ecology of contexts is helpful for agroecologists as the nearly axiomatic acceptance dynamic and thereby unperfectable nature of agroecosystems precludes the often damaging notion of a best or ideal approach to agroecosystem management as well as an awareness of the complexity of the response that can result from any perturbation of the system this concept of the ecology of contexts provides a useful epistemological device for understanding agroecosystems this dual relationship of an entity in an ecology of contexts underscores the ecological analogy with its emphasis on holonic interactions in child development for instance it can refer to the nested scales at which influences on children reside from the individual e g age to the broadest elements like government policies or cultural attitudes from computer science is

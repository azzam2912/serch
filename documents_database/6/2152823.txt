laser ablation works by heating up a substance enough to allow gaseous material to eject either through sublimation solid to gas or vaporization liquid to gas for most asteroids this process occurs between temperatures in the range of the ejecting material creates a thrust which over an extended period of time can change the trajectory of the asteroid as a proof of concept on a small scale travis brashears a researcher at uc santa barbara s experimental cosmology lab led by dr philip lubin has already experimentally verified that laser ablation can de spin and spin up an asteroid further testing and development of this method are being done by groups at uc santa barbara nasa and the university of strathclyde modern humans or homo sapiens have existed for approximately 200 000 years by comparison the dinosaurs survived on earth for over 100 million years before the chixculub asteroid wiped them out asteroids could still potentially pose a serious threat to every major city on earth and even to our whole species february 2013 the chelyabinsk meteor exploded at a height of 30 kilometers over western russia the meteor which weighed around 15 million pounds was estimated to be traveling

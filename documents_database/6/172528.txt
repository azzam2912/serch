the empirical angle of rotation is given by where formula 2 is the angle of rotation in radians formula 3 is the magnetic flux density in the direction of propagation in teslas formula 4 is the length of the path in metres where the light and magnetic field interact then formula 5 is the verdet constant for the material this empirical proportionality constant in units of radians per tesla per metre rad t m varies with wavelength and temperature and is tabulated for various materials faraday rotation is an example of non reciprocal optical propagation unlike what happens in an optically active medium such as a sugar solution reflecting a polarized beam back through the same faraday medium does not undo the polarization change the beam underwent in its forward pass through the medium this allows faraday rotators to be used to construct devices such as optical isolators to prevent undesired back propagation of light from disrupting or damaging an optical system the geometry of non reciprocal propagation may at first appear paradoxical in an optically active medium the polarization direction twists or rotates in the same sense e g like a right handed screw during both the forward and

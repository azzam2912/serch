it can be found in beans and liver it can be formed from trimethylglycine upon the loss of one of its methyl groups it is also a byproduct of the metabolism of choline when dmg was first discovered it was referred to as vitamin b but unlike true b vitamins deficiency of dmg in the diet does not lead to any ill effects and it is synthesized by the human body in the citric acid or krebs cycle meaning it does not meet the definition of a vitamin dimethylglycine has been suggested for use as an athletic performance enhancer immunostimulant and a treatment for autism epilepsy or mitochondrial disease there is no evidence that dimethylglycine is effective for treating mitochondrial disease published studies on the subject have shown little to no difference between dmg treatment and placebo in autism spectrum disorders dimethylglycine has been found to act as an agonist of the glycine site of the nmda receptor this compound is commercially available as the free form amino acid and as the hydrochloride salt dmg may be prepared by the alkylation of glycine via the eschweiler clarke reaction in this reaction glycine is treated with aqueous formaldehyde in formic acid

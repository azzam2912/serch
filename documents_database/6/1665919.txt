in other words in blood vessels with diameters less than 500 micrometers the hematocrit decreases with decreasing capillary diameter the f hr us effect definitely influences the f hr us lindqvist effect which describes the dependence of apparent viscosity of blood on the capillary size but the former is not the only cause of the latter fahraeus was a pathologist at the university of uppsala in sweden and his interest in the suspension stability of blood and later in hemorheology was motivated by the desire to understand the clinical effects of abnormalities in the aggregation and flow behavior of the formed elements the aim was to ascertain whether blood obeyed the law of poiseuille hagen poiseuille equation it was hess in 1915 who proved that blood obeys the poiseuille law at high flow and low shear the non newtonian effects were due to the elastic deformation of red blood cells fahraeus entered the scene in 1917 through his observation that sedimentation velocity of red corpuscles increases during pregnancy he used the concept of buffy coat as the starting point of his work on red cell sedimentation and the more general problem of suspension stability of blood he pointed out that

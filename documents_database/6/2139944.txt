the tvf is uniquely the only region affected by quaternary volcanism that is part of the himalayan geothermal belt caused by the indo asian continent continent collision the tvf is characterized by hydrothermal activity and large scale eruptions last recorded in 1609ce although the volcanoes themselves are considered extinct several geothermal fields geographically linked to the tvf are still highly active evidence for geothermal activity can be linked to several prevalent active hot springs located predominantly within the vicinity of the volcanoes in the tvf holocene eruptions occurred predominantly in the three largest volcanoes in the tvf named the dayingshan maa nshan and heikongshan the highest of which dayingshan reaches 2865 meters above sea level the volcanoes are distributed in a string like pattern clustered from north to south in the middle on the tengchong basin and are characterized by post collisional high potassium k calc alkaline series eruptions the tvf provides unique geographical and geological knowledge as understanding the geological processes of creation provides insight into aspects such as the history of volcanism during the quaternary era in the region and as well as compositional information of its source and crustal assimilants the tvf can be visited in the

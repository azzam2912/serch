it involves a change of chemical composition and is irreversible the word is coined from the greek derived elements pyro fire and lysis separating pyrolysis is most commonly used in the treatment of organic materials it is one of the processes involved in charring wood in general pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves a solid residue enriched in carbon char extreme pyrolysis which leaves mostly carbon as the residue is called carbonization the process is used heavily in the chemical industry for example to produce ethylene many forms of carbon and other chemicals from petroleum coal and even wood to produce coke from coal aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert biomass into syngas and biochar waste plastics back into usable oil or waste into safely disposable substances pyrolysis is one of various types of chemical degradation processes that occur at higher temperatures above the boiling point of water or other solvents it differs from other processes like combustion and hydrolysis in that it usually does not involve the addition of other reagents such as oxygen o in combustion or water in hydrolysis pyrolysis produces solids char condensable liquids tar and uncondensing permanent gasses complete pyrolysis of organic

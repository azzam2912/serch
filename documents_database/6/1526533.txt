blockade of adrenoreceptors particularly presynaptic autoreceptors in noradrenergic neurons by fluparoxan produces an increase in the synaptic concentrations of noradrenaline by blocking the autoinhibitory feedback mechanism this release of noradrenaline has a potential value in the treatment of disorders which are associated with a deficiency of noradrenaline at postsynaptic adrenoreceptors such as depression the early features of alzheimer s disease and schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders associated with cognitive impairment fluparoxan also exhibits no anticholinergic antidopaminergic alpha1 adrenergic beta adrenergic muscarinic or 5 ht1 receptor blocking effects fluparoxan showed adrenoceptors antagonist activity in vivo in several animal species in the conscious mouse fluparoxan was effective by the oral route in preventing clonidine induced hypothermia and antinociception while in the rat the marked impairment of rotarod performance were prevented dose dependently by fluparoxan fluparoxan orally prevented agonist uk 14304 induced sedation and bradycardia in a dose related fashion in the dog fluparoxan has been shown to possess central adrenoceptor antagonist activity after both single and repeated oral doses in man significantly attenuating all responses to the agonist clonidine growth hormone secretion bradycardia hypotension xerostomia apart from the measures of sedation fluparoxan has shown positive effects in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction

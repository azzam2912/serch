each wishbone or arm has two mounting points to the chassis and one joint at the knuckle the shock absorber and coil spring mount to the wishbones to control vertical movement double wishbone designs allow the engineer to carefully control the motion of the wheel throughout suspension travel controlling such parameters as camber angle caster angle toe pattern roll center height scrub radius scuff and more the double wishbone suspension can also be referred to as double a arms though the arms themselves can be a shaped l shaped or even a single bar linkage a single wishbone or a arm can also be used in various other suspension types such as variations of the macpherson strut the upper arm is usually shorter to induce negative camber as the suspension jounces rises and often this arrangement is titled an sla or short long arms suspension when the vehicle is in a turn body roll results in positive camber gain on the lightly loaded inside wheel while the heavily loaded outer wheel gains negative camber between the outboard end of the arms is a knuckle the knuckle contains a kingpin for horizontal radial movement in older designs and rubber or trunion

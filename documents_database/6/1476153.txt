currently eight species of trichinella are known only three of which cause trichinellosis and trichinella britovi is one of them numerous mammal species as well as birds and crocodiles can harbor the parasite worldwide but the sylvatic cycle is mainly maintained by wild carnivores humans represent only a possible host and the parasite is exclusively transmitted through consumption of raw or rare meat in europe pork and wild boar meat are the main sources for human infection because of mandatory veterinary controls in slaughterhouses large trichinellosis outbreaks due to horse meat consumption are rare but cases in hunters and their families after raw or rare wild boar meat consumption are regularly reported with over 100 cases since 1975 t britovi in wild boar is relatively resistant to freezing in france meat from naturally infected wild boar meat frozen for three weeks at remained infectious whereas the parasites were not viable after four weeks in the 1960s trichinella infection was documented in senegal west africa a survey of 160 wild animals from that region produced plausible evidence that european strains may have originated in africa it has also been proposed that strains of t britovi are isolated to both african and

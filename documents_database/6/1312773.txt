the shell has from 4 to 6 slowly enlarging whorls the aperture is small oblique with armature of 2 or 3 parietal lamellae and several deeply placed basal folds all growing continuously from an early neanic stage the peristome is more or less thickened and expanded the ends of the lip remote joined by a parietal callus the shell aside from its helicoid shape not a character of great importance differs from all pupillidae in the arrangement of the lamellae and baso palatal folds in multidentate pupillidae the five primary teeth are always recognizable while in strobilops only the main parietal lamella and the columellar lamella can certainly be said to correspond and these are found in so many other land shells that their occurrence is not especially significant it is possible however that upper and lower palatal folds of pupillidae are represented by teeth 5 the most right basal tooth and 2 second left basal tooth and the basal fold by tooth 1 the most left basal tooth by the accelerated lamellae and folds of the shell which appear early in the neanic stage strobilops resembles various tornatellininae within achatinellidae in that family both parietal and palatal folds or

lower numbers indicate less resistance and softer materials the term is also used to describe a material s rating on the scale as in an object having a shore durometer of 90 the scale was defined by albert ferdinand shore who developed a suitable device to measure hardness in the 1920s it was neither the first hardness tester nor the first to be called a durometer isv duro and meter attested since the 19th century but today that name usually refers to shore hardness other devices use other measures which return corresponding results such as for rockwell hardness there are several scales of durometer used for materials with different properties the two most common scales using slightly different measurement systems are the astm d2240 type a and type d scales the a scale is for softer ones while the d scale is for harder ones however the astm d2240 00 testing standard calls for a total of 12 scales depending on the intended use types a b c d do e m o oo ooo ooo s and r each scale results in a value between 0 and 100 with higher values indicating a harder material durometer like many other

it is a member of the acyl coa thioesterase superfamily which is a group of enzymes that hydrolyze coenzyme a esters there is no known function however it has been shown to act as a long chain thioesterase at low concentrations and a short chain thioesterase at high concentrations the acot9 gene is located at p22 11 on chromosome x located on the minus strand of the chromosome the start is at 23 721 777 bp and the end is at 23 761 407 bp which is a span of 39 631 base pairs acot9 gene is known primarily for encoding the acyl coa thioesterase 9 protein other less commonly used names for the gene are acate2 and mt act48 the protein encoded by the acot9 gene is part of a family of acyl coa thioesterases which catalyze the hydrolysis of various coenzyme a esters of various molecules to the free acid plus coa these enzymes have also been referred to in the literature as acyl coa hydrolases acyl coa thioester hydrolases and palmitoyl coa hydrolases the reaction carried out by these enzymes is as follows coa ester ho free acid coenzyme a these enzymes use the same substrates as

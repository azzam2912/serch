the paralytic disease spread rapidly through a breeding colony as well as through a laboratory population causing about 95 mortality this was the first recorded isolate of the virus and is generally referred to as crpvvic to distinguish it from subsequent isolates the spheroidal non enveloped virus particles of crpv are about 27 nm diameter in negatively stained electron micrographs and contain a single piece of positive sense ssrna the virion is composed of four capsid proteins with molecular masses generally reported to be 33 31 and 30 kilodaltons with a minor vp4 protein of about 8 kda the particles resemble those of the mammalian picornaviruses but crpv virions sediment at a faster rate 167 s than poliovirus particles 158 s in sucrose rate zonal gradients and in isopycnic neutral cesium chloride gradients crpv particles are denser than those of poliovirus 1 368 g cm vs 1 340 g cm respectively crpv has been detected in a number of insect species from at least five different orders of the class insecta in both natural and laboratory populations and is usually identified by standard serological methods the infections include not only the australian cricket species but the new zealand cricket pteronemobius

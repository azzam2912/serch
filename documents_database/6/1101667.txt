tlr9 has also been designated as cd289 cluster of differentiation 289 it is a member of the toll like receptor tlr family tlr9 is an important receptor expressed in immune system cells including dendritic cells macrophages natural killer cells and other antigen presenting cells tlr9 preferentially binds dna present in bacteria and viruses and triggers signaling cascades that lead to a pro inflammatory cytokine response cancer infection and tissue damage can all modulate tlr9 expression and activation tlr9 is also an important factor in autoimmune diseases and there is active research into synthetic tlr9 agonists and antagonists that help regulate autoimmune inflammation the tlr family plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity tlrs are named for the high degree of conservation in structure and function seen between mammalian tlrs and the drosophila transmembrane protein toll tlrs are transmembrane proteins expressed on the cell surface and the endocytic compartment and recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps that are expressed on infectious agents and initiate signalling to induce production of cytokines necessary for the innate immunity and subsequent adaptive immunity the various tlrs exhibit different patterns of expression this gene is preferentially expressed in immune cell rich

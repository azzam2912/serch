phosphatases are enzymes that catalyze the removal of phosphate from biomolecules over half of all cellular proteins are modified by phosphorylation which typically controls their functions protein phosphorylation is controlled by the opposing actions of protein phosphatases and protein kinases most phosphorylation sites are not linked to a specific phosphatase so the phosphatome approach allows a global analysis of dephosphorylation screening to find the phosphatase responsible for a given reaction and comparative studies between different phosphatases similar to how protein kinase research has been impacted by the kinome approach protein phosphatases remove phosphates from proteins usually on serine threonine and tyrosine residues reversing the action of protein kinases the ptp family of protein phosphatases is tyrosine specific and several other families pppl ppm had appear to be serine threonine specific while other families are unknown or have a variety of substrates dsps dephosphorylate any amino acid while some protein phosphatases also have non protein substrates in the human genome 20 different folds of protein are known to be phosphatases of which 10 include protein phosphatases protein phosphatomes have been cataloged for human and 8 other key eukaryotes for plasmodium and trypanosomes and phosphatomes have been used for functional analysis by

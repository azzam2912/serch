these apparatus exert forces and torques to individual molecules or groups of molecules it can be used to measure the tensile strength or the force generated by molecules most commonly magnetic tweezers are used to study mechanical properties of biological macromolecules like dna or proteins in single molecule experiments other applications are the rheology of soft matter and studies of force regulated processes in living cells forces are typically on the order of pico to nanonewtons due to their simple architecture magnetic tweezers are a popular biophysical tool in experiments the molecule of interest is attached to a magnetic microparticle the magnetic tweezer is equipped with magnets that are used to manipulate the magnetic particles whose position is measured with the help of video microscopy a magnetic tweezers apparatus consists of magnetic micro particles which can be manipulated with the help of an external magnetic field the position of the magnetic particles is then determined by a microscopic objective with a camera magnetic particles for the operation in magnetic tweezers come with a wide range of properties and have to be chosen according to the intended application two basic types of magnetic particles are described in the following paragraphs however

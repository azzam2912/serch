anderson s rule states that when constructing an energy band diagram the vacuum levels of the two semiconductors on either side of the heterojunction should be aligned at the same energy it is also referred to as the electron affinity rule and is closely related to the schottky mott rule for metal semiconductor junctions anderson s rule was first described by r l anderson in 1960 once the vacuum levels are aligned it is possible to use the electron affinity and band gap values for each semiconductor to calculate the conduction band and valence band offsets the electron affinity usually given by the symbol formula 1 in solid state physics gives the energy difference between the lower edge of the conduction band and the vacuum level of the semiconductor the band gap usually given the symbol formula 2 gives the energy difference between the lower edge of the conduction band and the upper edge of the valence band each semiconductor has different electron affinity and band gap values for semiconductor alloys it may be necessary to use vegard s law to calculate these values once the relative positions of the conduction and valence bands for both semiconductors are known anderson

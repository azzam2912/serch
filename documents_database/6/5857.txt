strictly speaking there is no repulsive force involved it is an absence of attraction in contrast hydrophiles are attracted to water hydrophobic molecules tend to be nonpolar and thus prefer other neutral molecules and nonpolar solvents because water molecules are polar hydrophobes do not dissolve well among them hydrophobic molecules in water often cluster together forming micelles water on hydrophobic surfaces will exhibit a high contact angle examples of hydrophobic molecules include the alkanes oils fats and greasy substances in general hydrophobic materials are used for oil removal from water the management of oil spills and chemical separation processes to remove non polar substances from polar compounds hydrophobic is often used interchangeably with lipophilic fat loving however the two terms are not synonymous while hydrophobic substances are usually lipophilic there are exceptions such as the silicones and fluorocarbons the term hydrophobe comes from the ancient greek h droph bos having a horror of water constructed the hydrophobic interaction is mostly an entropic effect originating from the disruption of the highly dynamic hydrogen bonds between molecules of liquid water by the nonpolar solute forming a clathrate like structure around the non polar molecules this structure formed is more highly ordered than

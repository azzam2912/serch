it was initially developed as part of a larger effort to develop a 16 32 bit workstation known as sierra but this project was cancelled in 1984 for a time amy was slated to be included in the atari 520st then an updated version of the atari 8 bit family the 65xem but development was discontinued the technology was later sold but when the new owners started to introduce it as a professional synthesizer atari sued and work on the project ended the amy was based around a bank of 64 oscillators which emit sine waves of a specified frequency the sine waves were created by looking up the amplitude at a given time from a 16 bit table stored in rom rather than calculating the amplitude using math hardware the signals could then be mixed together to perform additive synthesis the amy also included a number of ramp generators that could be used to smoothly modify the amplitude or frequency of a given oscillator over a given time during the design phase it was believed these would be difficult to implement in hardware so only eight frequency ramps are included sounds were created by selecting one of the oscillators

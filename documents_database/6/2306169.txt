the density of baryons can be constrained according to big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background observations by the planck spacecraft in 2015 yielded a theoretical value for baryonic matter of 4 85 of the contents of the universe however directly adding up all the known baryonic matter produces a baryonic density slightly less than half of this the missing baryon problem is distinct from the dark matter problem which is mainly non baryonic in nature the missing baryons are believed to be located in the warm hot intergalactic medium whim hot intergalactic gas with recent observations providing strong support the density of baryonic matter can be obtained indirectly from two independent methods the cmb constraint formula 1 is much more precise than the bbn constraint formula 2 but the two are in agreement the density of baryonic matter can be obtained directly by summing up all the known baryonic matter this is highly nontrivial since although luminous matter such as stars and galaxies are easily summed baryonic matter can also exist in highly non luminous form such as black holes planets and highly diffuse interstellar gas nonetheless it can still be done using techniques such as prior to

the name line graph comes from a paper by although both and used the construction before this other terms used for the line graph include the covering graph the derivative the edge to vertex dual the conjugate the representative graph and the obrazom as well as the edge graph the interchange graph the adjoint graph and the derived graph various extensions of the concept of a line graph have been studied including line graphs of line graphs line graphs of multigraphs line graphs of hypergraphs and line graphs of weighted graphs given a graph g its line graph l g is a graph such that that is it is the intersection graph of the edges of g representing each edge by the set of its two endpoints the following figures show a graph left with blue vertices and its line graph right with green vertices each vertex of the line graph is shown labeled with the pair of endpoints of the corresponding edge in the original graph for instance the green vertex on the right labeled 1 3 corresponds to the edge on the left between the blue vertices 1 and 3 green vertex 1 3 is adjacent to three

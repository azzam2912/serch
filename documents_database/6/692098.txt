depending on the sophistication of the meter it may display the capacitance only or it may also measure a number of other parameters such as leakage equivalent series resistance esr and inductance for most purposes and in most cases the capacitor must be disconnected from circuit esr can usually be measured in circuit some checks can be made without a specialised instrument particularly on aluminium electrolytic capacitors which tend to be of high capacitance and to be subject to poor leakage a multimeter in a resistance range can detect a short circuited capacitor very low resistance or one with very high leakage high resistance but lower than it should be an ideal capacitor has infinite dc resistance a crude idea of the capacitance can be derived with an analog multimeter in a high resistance range by observing the needle when first connected current will flow to charge the capacitor and the needle will kick from infinite indicated resistance to a relatively low value and then drift up to infinity the amplitude of the kick is an indication of capacitance interpreting results requires some experience or comparison with a good capacitor and depends upon the particular meter and range used many

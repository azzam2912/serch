in some cases pancreas divisum is only detected during autopsy a small group of individuals will develop symptoms which commonly include abdominal pain nausea vomiting and acute and chronic pancreatitis the human embryo begins life with two ducts in the pancreas the ventral duct and the dorsal duct normally the two ducts will fuse together to form one main pancreatic duct this occurs in more than 90 of embryos in approximately 10 of embryos the ventral and dorsal ducts fail to fuse together resulting in pancreas divisum in utero the majority of the pancreas is drained by the dorsal duct which opens up into the minor duodenal papilla the ventral duct drains the minority of the pancreas and opens into the major duodenal papilla in adults however this situation is reversed whereby 70 of the pancreas is drained by the ventral duct therefore in pancreas divisum where fusion of the ducts does not occur the major drainage of the pancreas is done by the dorsal duct which opens up into the minor papilla the most common and accurate way of diagnosing an individual with this anomaly is by mrcp magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or ercp endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography this test can

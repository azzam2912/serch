homebrew started due to george hotz geohot wanting to install linux on the ps3 a feature which was removed in the 3 55 update this led to him being sued by sony the court case was settled out of court with the result of george hotz not being able to circumvent the ps3 security system at the 2010 chaos communication congress ccc in berlin a group calling itself fail0verflow announced it had succeeded in bypassing a number of the playstation 3 s security measures allowing unsigned code to run without a dongle they also announced that it was possible to recover the elliptic curve dsa ecdsa private key used by sony to sign software due to a failure of sony s ecdsa implementation to generate a different random number for each signature however fail0verflow chose not to publish this key because it was not necessary to run homebrew software on the device the release of this key would allow anyone to sign their code and therefore be able to run it on any playstation 3 console this would also mean that no countermeasures could be taken by sony without rendering old software useless as there would be no distinction between

most photometers convert light into an electric current using a photoresistor photodiode or photomultiplier photometers measure before electronic light sensitive elements were developed photometry was done by estimation by the eye the relative luminous flux of a source was compared with a standard source the photometer is placed such that the illuminance from the source being investigated is equal to the standard source as the human eye can judge equal illuminance the relative luminous fluxes can then be calculated as the illuminance decreases proportionally to the inverse square of distance a standard example of such a photometer consists of a piece of paper with an oil spot on it that makes the paper slightly more transparent when the spot is not visible from either side the illuminance from the two sides is equal by 1861 three types were in common use these were rumford s photometer ritchie s photometer and photometers that used the extinction of shadows which was considered to be the most precise rumford s photometer also called a shadow photometer depended on the principle that a brighter light would cast a deeper shadow the two lights to be compared were used to cast a shadow onto paper

during the pliocene the presence of a large lake provided habitat for fish as the climate started to dry during the pleistocene vegetation similar to the present day flora developed although its geographical distribution was markedly different further drying occurred during the north american glaciation period that followed resulting in the general aridity of the region today the snake river plain of 4 million years ago in the pliocene differed greatly from today with respect to climate there was much lower temperature seasonality and the humidity was much higher much of the western plain was submerged under the waters of lake idaho which encompassed an area as large as lake ontario and covered the low elevation areas between twin falls and hells canyon summers were milder and winters were warmer with an estimated annual temperature gradient of 10 25 c these conditions allowed for fish assemblages that are not observable in this area today researchers smith patterson analyzed sediment samples from the western plain s chalk hills formation and found the fossilized inner ear bones otoliths of sunfish to contain hints about the region s climate past two characteristics of the fossil offer a proxy for temperature and moisture conditions

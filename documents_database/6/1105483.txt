this transporter is a major regulator of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid homeostasis it was discovered that a mutation in the abca1 protein is responsible for causing tangier s disease by several groups in 1998 gerd schmitz s group in germany and michael hayden s group in british columbia were using standard genetics techniques and dna from family pedigrees to locate the mutation richard lawn s group at cv therapeutics in palo alto ca used cdna microarrays which were relatively new at the time to assess gene expression profiles from cell lines created from normal and affected individuals they showed cell lines from patients with tangier s disease showed differential regulation of the abca1 gene subsequent sequencing of the gene identified the mutations this group received an award from the american heart association for their discovery tangier disease has been identified in nearly 100 patients worldwide and patients have a broad range of biochemical and clinical phenotypes as over 100 different mutations have been identified in abca1 resulting in the disease the membrane associated protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of atp binding cassette abc transporters abc proteins transport various molecules across extra and intracellular membranes

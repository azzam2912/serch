cs23d combines maximal fragment assembly with chemical shift threading de novo structure generation chemical shift based torsion angle prediction and chemical shift refinement cs23d makes use of refdb and shiftx cs23d accepts chemical shift files in either shifty or bmrb formats a user can cs23d output consists of a set of 10 best score pdb coordinates a hyperlink to the single best score structure is also provided the overall cs23d score knowledge based score chemical shift score ramachandran plot statistics correlations between the observed and calculated shifts before and after refinement are displayed a conclusion about structure reliability is given to the user homology search the query sequence is used to find homologous proteins or and protein fragments in a non redundant database of pdb sequences and secondary structures of ppt db using blast homology modelling homology modelling is done by the homodeller program which is a part of the proteus2 program the proteins that are identified during the homology search step are used as the templates in homology modelling chemical shift re referencing chemical shifts are re referenced by the refcor which is a part of the rci webserver backend secondary structure prediction from chemical shifts secondary structure is

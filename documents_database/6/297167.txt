while sources differ on the exact nomenclature the basic hierarchy comprises freeways arterials collectors and local roads generally the functional hierarchy can more or less correspond to the hierarchy of roads by their owner or administrator the related concept of access management aims to provide access to land development while ensuring traffic flows freely and safely on surrounding roads at the top of the hierarchy are limited access roads freeways or expressways including most toll roads these roads provide largely uninterrupted travel often using partial or full access control and are designed for high speeds some freeways have collector distributor lanes also known as local lanes which further reduce the number of access ramps that directly interface with the freeway rather the freeway periodically interfaces with these parallel roadways which themselves have multiple on and off ramps these allow the freeway to operate with less friction at an even higher speed and with higher flow often freeways are included in the next category arterials arterials are major through roads that are expected to carry large volumes of traffic arterials are often divided into major and minor arterials and rural and urban arterials in some places there are large divided roads

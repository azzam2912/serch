the ship s design heavily emphasizes low visibility radar cross section and infrared signature the first ship in the class is named after visby the main city on the island of gotland the class has received widespread international attention because of its capabilities as a stealth ship the ships are designed by swedish defence materiel administration fmv and built by kockums ab the first ship of the class was launched in 2000 and since then the construction was fraught with repeated delays finally in december 2009 the first two ships of the class were delivered to the swedish navy by the fmv albeit with greatly reduced operational capability the hull is constructed with a sandwich design consisting of a pvc core with a carbon fibre and vinyl laminate see also the oceanic creations spin off there are multiple advantages to using composite materials in ship hulls good conductivity and surface flatness means a low radar signature while good heat insulation lowers the infrared signature and increases survivability in case of fire the composite sandwich used is also non magnetic which lowers the magnetic signature composites are also very strong for their relative weight and less weight means a higher top

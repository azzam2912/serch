he was educated at university of pretoria b sc and stellenbosch university m sc and earned a phd in nuclear physics at university of cambridge on completing his education in england he returned to south africa on the advice of basil schonland his mentor in february 1965 sellschop was part of a group which identified the first neutrino found in nature in one of south africa s gold mines the experiment was performed in a specially prepared chamber at a depth of 3 km in the erpm mine near boksburg a plaque in the main building commemorates the discovery the experiments also implemented a primitive neutrino astronomy and looked at issues of neutrino physics and weak interactions sellschop was an expert in the physics of diamonds his research here was very broad as a member of the cern na43 and na59 collaborations he contributed to experiments that used the perfect and very rigid diamond lattice to produce and study the highest energy near monochromatic photons ever produced in a laboratory he was an important contributor to the field of nuclear geochemistry in diamond evidencing the trace element composition of natural diamond and linking this to mantle geochemistry diamonds are seen

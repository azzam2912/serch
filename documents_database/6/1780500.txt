the main reason to suppose that there was a siberian homeland has been the traditional taxonomic model that sees the samoyed branch as splitting off first because the present border between the samoyed and the ugric branch is in western siberia the original split was seen to have occurred there too however because the ugric languages are known to have been spoken earlier on the european side of the urals a european homeland would be equally possible in recent years it has also been argued on the basis of phonology that the oldest split was not between the samoyed and the finno ugric but between the finno permic and the ugro samoyedic language groups the lexical level is argued to be less reliable and lexical innovativeness a small number of shared cognates can be confused because of the great age of the division for a long time no new arguments for a siberian homeland have been presented both european and siberian homeland proposals have been supported by palaeolinguistic evidence but only those cases in which the semantic reconstructions are certain are valid a siberian homeland has been claimed on the basis of two coniferous tree names in proto uralic but

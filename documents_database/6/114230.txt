the idea is to start with a simple system for which a mathematical solution is known and add an additional perturbing hamiltonian representing a weak disturbance to the system if the disturbance is not too large the various physical quantities associated with the perturbed system e g its energy levels and eigenstates can be expressed as corrections to those of the simple system these corrections being small compared to the size of the quantities themselves can be calculated using approximate methods such as asymptotic series the complicated system can therefore be studied based on knowledge of the simpler one in effect it is describing a complicated unsolved system using a simple solved system perturbation theory is an important tool for describing real quantum systems as it turns out to be very difficult to find exact solutions to the schr dinger equation for hamiltonians of even moderate complexity the hamiltonians to which we know exact solutions such as the hydrogen atom the quantum harmonic oscillator and the particle in a box are too idealized to adequately describe most systems using perturbation theory we can use the known solutions of these simple hamiltonians to generate solutions for a range of more complicated

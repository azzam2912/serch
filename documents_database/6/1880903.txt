this project was conducted to test the ability of remote sensing to detect flooding stress in mangroves during flooding for mosquito control mosquito control in the cocoa beach area was initially provided by application of various pesticides including ddt cocoa beach was the site of initial field tests for ddt and one of the first locations where resistance was noted this led to use of source reduction in addition to pesticides source reduction is a mechanical modification of habitat to decrease mosquito production the saltmarsh mosquito will not lay its eggs in standing water preferring seasonally flooded sand or mud instead the concept behind source reduction is to convert seasonally flooded marsh to either upland or submerged land source reduction began to be used in the late 1950s in cocoa beach in this beginning phase small ditches were dug through the islands to allow water movement and fish access to inner areas of the succulent marsh this approach had limited success during the late 1960s brevard county mosquito control began dredging the thousand islands south of minutemen causeway to eliminate ephemeral ponds necessary for saltmarsh mosquito breeding this destruction of wetlands set the stage for an approach that would retain

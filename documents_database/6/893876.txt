sometimes a thermally reflective surface called a radiant barrier is added to a material to reduce the transfer of heat through radiation as well as conduction the choice of which material or combination of materials is used depends on a wide variety of factors some insulation materials have health risks some so significant the materials are no longer allowed to be used but remain in use in some older buildings such as asbestos fibers and urea factors affecting the type and amount of insulation to use in a building include considerations regarding building and climate often a combination of materials is used to achieve an optimum solution and there are products which combine different types of insulation into a single form spray foam is a type of insulation that is sprayed in place through a gun polyurethane and isocyanate foams are applied as a two component mixture that comes together at the tip of a gun and forms an expanding foam cementitious foam is applied in a similar manner but does not expand spray foam insulation is sprayed onto concrete slabs into wall cavities of an unfinished wall against the interior side of sheathing or through holes drilled in sheathing

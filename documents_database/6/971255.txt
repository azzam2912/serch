for instance within a major third g b there can be a minor third g to b such that in moving from one to the other each line shifts less than a half step within a just intonation scale this could be represented indicates an approximate quarter tone sharp an approximate quarter tone flat by moving to like so one voice slides down from 386 cents to 347 the other slides up from 0 cents to 32 yet the harmonic shift can be dramatic the best known example of tonality flux and one of the two partch uses as illustration is the beginning of his composition the letter in which the kithara alternates between two chords one major and one minor with the minor third of one nestled inside the major third of the other given here in ben johnston s pitch notation in this notation which assumes g as the tonic or 1 1 a 7 lowers a pitch from a just intonation value by 35 36 or 48 77 cents an upside down 7 raises a pitch by the same amount the first chord is a major triad and relative to g contains the notes 8 7 231

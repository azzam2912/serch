he may be best known for his work in the field that would eventually be called additive combinatorics particularly notable was his ingenious application of the szemer di trotter theorem to improve the best known lower bound for the sum product problem he also proved that any polynomial time algorithm approximating the volume of convex bodies must have a multiplicative error and the error grows exponentially on the dimension with micha sharir he set up a framework which eventually led guth and katz to the solution of the erd s distinct distances problem see below after graduating from the mathematics program at fazekas mih ly gimn zium i e fazekas mih ly high school in budapest which is known for its excellence especially in mathematics elekes studied mathematics at the e tv s lor nd university upon completing his degree he joined the faculty in the department of analysis at the university in 1984 he joined the newly forming department of computer science which was being headed by l szl lov sz elekes was promoted to full professor in 2005 he received the doctor of mathematical sciences title from the hungarian academy of sciences in 2001 elekes started his mathematical

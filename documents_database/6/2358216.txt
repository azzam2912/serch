first discovered in 1949 from streptomyces rochei borrelidin shows antibacterial activity by acting as an inhibitor of threonyl trna synthetase and features a nitrile moiety a unique functionality in natural products borrelidin also exhibits potent angiogenesis inhibition which was shown in a rat aorta matrix model other studies have been performed to show that low concentrations of borrelidin can suppress growth and induce apoptosis in malignant acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells borredlidin s antimalarial activity has also been shown in vitro and in vivo the core structure of borrelidin is biosynthesized by type i polyketide synthase pks followed by post pks modifications six genes bor a1 to bor a6 encode the type i pks composed of a loading domain and six extending modules rather than the expected eight each extension module consists of the ketosynthase ks condensing an extender unit either malonyl coa or methylmalonyl coa that is loaded by the acyl transferase at onto the growing polyketide which can then be modified by further enzymes tailoring enzymes of type i pks that can be involved in each module are ketoreductase kr dehydratase dh and enoyl reductase er once polyketide has gone through all of the chain extensions it can then

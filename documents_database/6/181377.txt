in gram negative bacteria an outer membrane is also included this envelope is not present in the mollicutes where the cell wall is absent bacterial cell envelopes fall into two major categories a gram positive type and a gram negative type distinguished by gram staining either type may have an enclosing capsule of polysaccharide for extra protection as a group these are known as polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria as in other organisms the bacterial cell wall provides structural integrity to the cell in prokaryotes the primary function of the cell wall is to protect the cell from internal turgor pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment the bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan poly n acetylglucosamine and n acetylmuramic acid which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the bacterial cell wall and for the determination of cell shape it is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates while all bacterial cell walls with a few exceptions e g intracellular parasites such as mycoplasma

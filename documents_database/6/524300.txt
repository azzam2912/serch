v belyi from 1979 at the time it was considered surprising and it spurred grothendieck to develop his theory of dessins d enfant which describes nonsingular algebraic curves over the algebraic numbers using combinatorial data it follows that the riemann surface in question can be taken to be with h the upper half plane and of finite index in the modular group compactified by cusps since the modular group has non congruence subgroups it is not the conclusion that any such curve is a modular curve a belyi function is a holomorphic map from a compact riemann surface s to the complex projective line p c ramified only over three points which after a m bius transformation may be taken to be formula 1 belyi functions may be described combinatorially by dessins d enfants belyi functions and dessins d enfants but not belyi s theorem date at least to the work of felix klein he used them in his article to study an 11 fold cover of the complex projective line with monodromy group psl 2 11 belyi s theorem is an existence theorem for belyi functions and has subsequently been much used in the inverse galois problem

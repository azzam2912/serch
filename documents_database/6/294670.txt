the system was built between 1974 and 1979 and can transmit 1920 megawatts at a voltage level of 533 kilovolts dc and 1800 amperes thyristor valves are used which unlike most other hvdc schemes are mounted outdoors and not in a valve hall the valves are grouped into eight 133 kv six pulse bridges in series at each end the long powerline runs through inaccessible terrain so it is mostly built as monopolar lines apart in case of a single line failure transmission with reduced power is possible via the surviving pole and return through the earth cahora bassa was out of service from 1985 to 1997 because of the mozambican civil war in the region the project was beset with technological challenges most notable of these being the adoption of solid state rectification devices in a large scale commercial installation mercury arc valves had been the de facto standard for hvdc up to this time cahora bassa was the first hvdc scheme ordered with thyristor valves though its operation was delayed it was also the first hvdc scheme operational in africa and the first anywhere in the world to operate above 500 kv significant commercial hurdles culminating in hearings

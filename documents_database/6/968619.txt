individuals trained in these fields are often able to gather diagnostically critical information in this stage of processing including the stage and margin status of surgically removed tumors the initial step in any examination of a clinical specimen is confirmation of the identity of the patient and the anatomy anatomical site from which the specimen was obtained sufficient clinical data should be communicated by the clinical team to the pathology team in order to guide the appropriate diagnostic examination and interpretation of the specimen if such information is not provided it must be obtained by the examiner prior to processing the specimen there are usually two end products of the gross examination of a surgical specimen the first is the gross description a document which serves as the written record of the examiner s findings and is included in the final pathology report the second product is a set of tissue biology tissue blocks typically postage stamp sized portions of tissue sealed in plastic cassettes which will be processed into slides for microscopic examination since only a minority of the tissue from a large specimen can reasonably be subject to microscopic examination the success of the final histopathology histological diagnosis

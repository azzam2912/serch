froman d29 is notable for its ability to infect m tuberculosis the causative agent of tuberculosis d29 is a double stranded dna mycobacteriophage it is a lytic phage this means that d29 takes the lytic pathway of infection instead of the lysogenic pathway of infection there are no human associated diseases associated with mycobacterium virus d29 mycobacterium virus d29 is a caudovirales virus belonging to the siphoviridae family these are commonly referred to as t5 like phages mycobacterium phage t5 was the first of the siphoviruses found with the structure consistent throughout the siphoviridae viruses which is why they are referred to as t5 like phages mycobacteriophage are broken up into 33 genomically distinct groups 26 of these groups are known as clusters cluster a z and there are 7 singleton groups d29 belongs to cluster a subcluster a2 subcluster a2 has a unique distinction of being one of a few groups known to infect tuberculosis along with a3 and cluster k phages this is important as it emphasizes these clusters and subclusters for potential importance in dealing with tuberculosis as it is still one of the leading causes of death in certain parts of the globe mycobacterium virus d29

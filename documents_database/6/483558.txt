it is most frequently used as a measurement of the overall height of 19 inch and 23 inch rack frames as well as the height of equipment that mounts in these frames whereby the height of the frame or equipment is expressed as multiples of rack units for example a typical full size rack cage is 42u high while equipment is typically 1u 2u 3u or 4u high the rack unit size is based on a standard rack specification as defined in eia 310 the eurocard specifies a standard rack unit as the unit of height it also defines a similar unit horizontal pitch hp used to measure the width of rack mounted equipment the standard was adopted worldwide as iec 60297 mechanical structures for electronic equipment dimensions of mechanical structures of the series and defines the sizes for rack subrack a shelf like chassis in which cards can be inserted and the pitch of printed circuit boards cards providing physical compatibility of technological equipment typically in telecommunications while a rack unit is defined as a front panel or filler panel in a rack is not an exact multiple of this height to allow space between adjacent rack mounted components

its specific dna sequence canntg where n can be any nucleotide with a palindromic canonical sequence of cacgtg is recognized and bound by transcription factors to initiate gene transcription once the transcription factors bind to the promoters through the e box other enzymes can bind to the promoter and facilitate transcription from dna to mrna the e box was discovered in a collaboration between susumu tonegawa s and walter gilbert s laboratories in 1985 as a control element in immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer they found that a region of 140 base pairs in the tissue specific transcriptional enhancer element was sufficient for different levels of transcription enhancement in different tissues and sequences they suggested that proteins made by specific tissues acted on these enhancers to activate sets of genes during cell differentiation in 1989 david baltimore s lab discovered the first two e box binding proteins e12 and e47 these immunoglobulin enhancers could bind as heterodimers to proteins through bhlh domains in 1990 another e protein itf 2a later renamed e2 2alt was discovered that can bind to immunoglobulin light chain enhancers two years later the third e box binding protein heb was discovered by screening a cdna library from

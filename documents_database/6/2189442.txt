it is a version of the spice simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis simulation tool with focuses on design and simulation for circuit operation at cryogenic temperatures circuits operating with wide bandgap semiconductors and simulation of thermal effects on circuit performance the circuit simulation tool was developed from spice3f5 a version of ngspice by coolcad electronics llc it can model standard electronic applications including radio frequency and audio circuits but was created with focus on modeling and designing circuits functioning at extreme temperatures ranging 4k to 300k the software is used for modeling both cryogenic temperature cmos circuits and high power high temperature silicon carbide sic power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor mosfet devices as well its also used to simulate the temperature change of the various electrical components that results from power dissipation during circuit operation a freeware version of coolspice is available for download on the web coolspice simulates electronic circuits operating at cryogenic temperatures ranging as low as 4k which is the temperature of liquid helium he the compact models used to carry out these circuit simulations were created for numerous cmos processes models were built on bsim 4 and experimentally verified bsim 4 is a

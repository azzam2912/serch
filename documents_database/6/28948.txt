self organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space this makes soms useful for visualization by creating low dimensional views of high dimensional data akin to multidimensional scaling the artificial neural network introduced by the finnish professor teuvo kohonen in the 1980s is sometimes called a kohonen map or network the kohonen net is a computationally convenient abstraction building on biological models of neural systems from the 1970s and morphogenesis models dating back to alan turing in the 1950s while it is typical to consider this type of network structure as related to feedforward networks where the nodes are visualized as being attached this type of architecture is fundamentally different in arrangement and motivation useful extensions include using toroidal grids where opposite edges are connected and using large numbers of nodes it has been shown that while self organizing maps with a small number of nodes behave in a way that is similar to k means larger self organizing maps rearrange data in a

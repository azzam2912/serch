it was influential primarily as the prototype effectively for the later pdp 10 the instruction sets of the two machines are almost identical the pdp 6 was dec s first big machine it used 36 bit words in common with other large computers at the time from companies like ibm honeywell and general electric addressing remained 18 bit as in earlier dec machines allowing for a 256 kword main memory memory was implemented using magnetic cores a typical system included 32 768 words equivalent to 144kb on modern machines the instruction set architecture could be categorized as one and a half address instructions contained one full 18 bit memory address and a second four bit address that could specify one of the first sixteen memory locations as an accumulator or ac another four bit field in the instruction allowed for any ac other than ac0 to be used as an index register most if not all pdp 6 systems were equipped with the optional type 162 fast memory which provided 16 memory locations constructed from discrete transistor flip flops the fast memory also known as fast accumulators or fast acs substituted for the first 16 words of core memory and

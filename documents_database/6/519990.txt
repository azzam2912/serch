first we split the surface into infinitesimal elements each of which is effectively flat for each infinitesimal element of area we have an area vector also infinitesimal where is the local unit vector perpendicular to integrating gives the vector area for the surface for a curved or faceted surface the vector area is smaller in magnitude than the area as an extreme example a closed surface can possess arbitrarily large area but its vector area is necessarily zero surfaces that share a boundary may have very different areas but they must have the same vector area the vector area is entirely determined by the boundary these are consequences of stokes theorem the concept of an area vector simplifies the equation for determining the flux through the surface consider a planar surface in a uniform field the flux can be written as the dot product of the field and area vector this is much simpler than multiplying the field strength by the surface area and the cosine of the angle between the field and the surface normal the projected area onto for example the plane is equivalent to the component of the vector area and is given as where is the

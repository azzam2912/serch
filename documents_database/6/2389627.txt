it provides tools for creating and manipulating quantum programs and running them on prototype quantum devices and simulators it follows the circuit model for universal quantum computation and can be used for any quantum hardware that follows this model qiskit was founded by ibm research to allow software development for their cloud quantum computing service contributions are also made by external supporters typically from academic institutions the primary version of qiskit uses the python programming language versions for swift and javascript are also available these are used to create quantum programs based on the openqasm representation of quantum circuits a range of jupyter notebooks are provided with examples of quantum computing being used examples include the source code behind scientific studies that use qiskit as well as a set of exercises to help people to learn the basics of quantum programming qiskit provides the ability to develop quantum software both at the machine code level of openqasm and at abstract levels suitable for end users without quantum computing expertise this functionality is provided by the following distinct components qiskit terra provides tools to create quantum circuits at or close to the level of quantum machine code it allows the processes

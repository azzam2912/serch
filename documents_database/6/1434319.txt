algae may be cultivated for the purposes of biomass production as in a seaweed cultivator wastewater treatment co fixation or aquarium pond filtration in the form of an algae scrubber algae bioreactors vary widely in design falling broadly into two categories open reactors and enclosed reactors open reactors are exposed to the atmosphere while enclosed reactors also commonly called photobioreactors are isolated to varying extent from the atmosphere specifically algae bioreactors can be used to produce fuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol to generate animal feed or to reduce pollutants such as no and co in flue gases of power plants fundamentally this kind of bioreactor is based on the photosynthetic reaction which is performed by the chlorophyll containing algae itself using dissolved carbon dioxide and sunlight energy the carbon dioxide is dispersed into the reactor fluid to make it accessible for the algae the bioreactor has to be made out of transparent material the algae are photoautotroph organisms which perform oxygenic photosynthesis the equation for photosynthesis some of the first experiments with the aim of cultivating algae were conducted in 1957 by the carnegie institution in washington in these experiments monocellular chlorella were cultivated by adding co and some

in essence it describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved qed mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction in technical terms qed can be described as a perturbation theory of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum richard feynman called it the jewel of physics for its extremely accurate predictions of quantities like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the lamb shift of the energy levels of hydrogen the first formulation of a quantum theory describing radiation and matter interaction is attributed to british scientist paul dirac who during the 1920s was able to compute the coefficient of spontaneous emission of an atom dirac described the quantization of the electromagnetic field as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators with the introduction of the concept of creation and annihilation operators of particles in the following years with contributions from wolfgang pauli eugene wigner pascual jordan werner heisenberg and an elegant formulation of quantum electrodynamics due to enrico fermi physicists came to believe that

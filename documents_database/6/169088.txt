glucocorticoids are corticosteroids that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor that is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell the name glucocorticoid is a portmanteau glucose cortex steroid and is composed from its role in regulation of glucose metabolism synthesis in the adrenal cortex and its steroidal structure see structure to the right a less common synonym is glucocorticosteroid glucocorticoids are part of the feedback mechanism in the immune system which reduces certain aspects of immune function such as inflammation they are therefore used in medicine to treat diseases caused by an overactive immune system such as allergies asthma autoimmune diseases and sepsis glucocorticoids have many diverse pleiotropic effects including potentially harmful side effects and as a result are rarely sold over the counter they also interfere with some of the abnormal mechanisms in cancer cells so they are used in high doses to treat cancer this includes inhibitory effects on lymphocyte proliferation as in the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias and the mitigation of side effects of anticancer drugs glucocorticoids affect cells by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor the activated glucocorticoid receptor glucocorticoid complex up regulates the expression of anti inflammatory proteins in the nucleus a process known as transactivation

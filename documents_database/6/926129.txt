the source of the amino group in ctp is glutamine which is hydrolysed in a glutamine amidotransferase domain to produce ammonia this is then channeled through the interior of the enzyme to the synthetase domain here ammonia reacts with the intermediate 4 phosphoryl utp two isozymes with ctp synthase activity exist in humans encoded by the following genes active ctp synthase exists as a homotetrameric enzyme at low enzyme concentrations and in the absence of atp and utp ctp synthase exists as inactive monomer as enzyme concentration increases it polymerizes first to a dimer such as the form shown to the left and in the presence of atp and utp forms a tetramer the enzyme contains two major domains responsible for the aminotransferase and synthase activity respectively the amidotransferase domains are located away from the tetramer interfaces and are not affected by the oligomeric state the atp binding site and ctp binding site in the synthase domain are located at the tetramer interface it is for this reason that atp and utp are required for tetramerization ctp synthase is precisely regulated by the intracellular concentrations of ctp and utp and both hctps1 and hctps2 have been seen to be maximally

it is an ionic salt of potassium ions k and nitrite ions no which forms a white or slightly yellow hygroscopic crystalline powder that is soluble in water it is a strong oxidizer and may accelerate the combustion of other materials like other nitrite salts such as sodium nitrite potassium nitrite is toxic if swallowed and laboratory tests suggest that it may be mutagenic or teratogenic gloves and safety glasses are usually used when handling potassium nitrite nitrite is present at trace levels in soil natural waters plant and animal tissues and fertilizer the pure form of nitrite was first made by the prolific swedish chemist scheele working in the laboratory of his pharmacy in the market town of k ping he heated potassium nitrate at red heat for half an hour and obtained what he recognized as a new salt the two compounds potassium nitrate and nitrite were characterized by p ligot and the reaction was established as 2kno 2kno o potassium nitrite can be obtained by the reduction of potassium nitrate the production of potassium nitrite by absorption of nitrogen oxides in potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate is not employed on a large scaled because of the high

implementation of an soa requires tools as well as run time infrastructure software this is collectively referred to as a service oriented architecture implementation framework or soaif the soaif envisions a comprehensive framework that provides all the technology that an enterprise might need to build and run an soa an soaif includes both design time and run time capabilities as well as all the software functionality an enterprise needs to build and operate an soa including service oriented as vendors race to provide possible solutions three different approaches are emerging to integrating disparate heterogeneous information and systems in the enterprise these implementation frameworks should meet the requirements for loosely coupled coarse grained asynchronous services most packaged enterprise applications perform well in streamlining processes related to standard tasks however the performance rapidly deteriorates while automating and streamlining customized processes that encompass multiple enterprise applications the process is difficult time consuming and expensive to implement and maintain the soaif infrastructure addresses this issue by allowing the definition of any process in any network topology spanning multiple enterprise boundaries this is accomplished via a peer to peer messaging infrastructure with distributed security mechanisms that allow efficient data exchanges for easy implementation while enabling

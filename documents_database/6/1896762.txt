it is part of the rutherford appleton laboratory the facility is dedicated to studying the applications of high energy lasers it was opened in 1976 as of 2013 there are 5 active laser laboratories at the clf vulcan astra gemini artemis ultra and octopus the facility provides both high power and high sensitivity lasers for study across broad fields of science from atomic and plasma physics to medical diagnostics biochemistry and environmental science also through the centre for advanced laser technology and application calta clf is responsible for laser development dipole is the brainchild of that project the vulcan is the first operational laser at the clf by 1997 when a new director was appointed m h r hutchinson formerly of imperial college london clf was also operating a second laser the titania at that time said to be the world brightest krypton fluoride laser the vulcan is the world s most powerful laser user facility it emits a light beam in the petawatts the construction of the core of the vulcan was carried out by kvaerner engineering and construction to specifications on par with those in the nuclear industry the chamber is lined with aluminium and lead to reduce

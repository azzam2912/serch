gramicidin s is a cyclodecapeptide constructed as two identical pentapeptides joined head to tail formally written as cyclo val orn leu d phe pro that is to say it forms a ring structure composed of five different amino acids each one used twice within the structure another interesting point is that it utilizes two amino acids uncommon in peptides ornithine as well as the atypical stereoisomer of phenylalanine it is synthesized by gramicidin s synthetase gramicidin s biosynthetic pathway consists of two enzyme of nonribosomal peptide synthases nrpss gramicidin s synthetase i grsa and gramicidin s synthetase ii grsb to give a product as a cyclic decapeptide within the biosynthetic pathway there are total of five modules that specifically recognize activate and condense the amino acids to gramicidin s starting module grsa consists of three domains adenylation a domain where it incorporates the amino acid and activates it by adenylation using atp thiolation t domain or peptidyl carrier protein pcp in which the adenylated amino acid gets covalently attached to the 4 phosphopantetheine group and this gets loaded onto the conserved serine in the t domain epimerization e domain where it epimerizes l amino acid to d amino acid starting

they can form part of a bigger intelligent transport system a technology for smart traffic signals has been developed at carnegie mellon university and is being used in a pilot project in pittsburgh in an effort to reduce vehicle emissions in the city unlike other dynamic control signals that adjust the timing and phasing of lights according to limits that are set in controller programming this system combines existing technology with artificial intelligence the signals communicate with each other and adapt to changing traffic conditions to reduce the amount of time that cars spend idling using fiber optic video receivers similar to those already employed in dynamic control systems the new technology monitors vehicle numbers and makes changes in real time to avoid congestion wherever possible initial results from the pilot study are encouraging the amount of time that motorists spent idling at lights was reduced by 40 and travel times across the city were reduced by 25 companies involved in developing smart traffic management systems include bmw and siemens who unveiled their system of networked lights in 2010 this system works with the anti idling technology that many cars are equipped with to warn them of impending light changes

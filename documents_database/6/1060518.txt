the major difference between the two doctrines is that while impossibility excuses performance where the contractual duty cannot physically be performed the doctrine of impracticability comes into play where performance is still physically possible but would be extremely burdensome for the party whose performance is due thus impossibility is an objective condition whereas impracticability is a subjective condition for a court to determine typically the test u s courts use for impracticability is as follows with a few variations among different jurisdictions section 261 of the restatement second of contracts does not explicitly define the scope of what is considered impracticable as it is a fairly subjective and fact intensive test for the courts generally courts do not consider events such as an increase in price or costs beyond a normal range to allow for discharge of duties on grounds of impracticability as such events are normally foreseeable risks of fixed price contracts section 2 615 of the uniform commercial code deals with impracticability in the context of sales of goods and introduces some additional constraints on the parties a party whose ability to perform his obligations has only been partially affected must allocate production and delivery among his customers

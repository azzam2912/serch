atmosphere breathing electric propulsion could make a new class of long lived low orbiting missions feasible the concept is currently investigated by the european space agency and the eu funded discoverer project current state of the art conventional electric thrusters cannot maintain flight at low altitudes for any times longer than about 2 years because of the limitation in propellant storage and in the amount of thrust generated which force the spacecraft s orbit to decay the european space agency officially announced the first successful ram ep prototype on ground demonstration in march 2018 an abep is composed by an intake and an electric thruster rarefied gases which are responsible for drag in leo and vleo low and very low earth orbit are used as the propellant this technology would ideally allow s cs to orbit at very low altitudes without the need of on board propellant allowing longer time missions in a new section of atmosphere s altitudes this advantage makes the technology of interest for scientific missions as well as military and civil surveillance services a special intake will be used to collect the gas molecules and direct them to the thruster the molecules will then be ionized

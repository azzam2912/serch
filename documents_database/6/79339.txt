in those systems the subject is usually called a stream of events or stream source of events while the observers are called sink of events the stream nomenclature simulates or adapts to a physical setup where the observers are physically separated and have no control over the emitted events of the subject stream source this pattern then perfectly suits any process where data arrives through i o that is where data is not available to the cpu at startup but can arrive randomly http requests gpio data user input from keyboard mouse distributed databases and blockchains most modern languages have built in event constructs which implement the observer pattern components while not mandatory most observers implementations will use background threads listening for subject events and other support mechanism from the kernel linux epoll the observer design pattern is one of the twenty three well known gang of four design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object oriented software that is objects that are easier to implement change test and reuse the observer pattern addresses the following problems defining a one to many dependency between objects by defining one object subject that updates

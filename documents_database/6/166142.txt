an ldpc is constructed using a sparse bipartite graph ldpc codes are which means that practical constructions exist that allow the noise threshold to be set very close or even arbitrarily close on the binary erasure channel to the theoretical maximum the shannon limit for a symmetric memoryless channel the noise threshold defines an upper bound for the channel noise up to which the probability of lost information can be made as small as desired using iterative belief propagation techniques ldpc codes can be decoded in time linear to their block length ldpc codes are finding increasing use in applications requiring reliable and highly efficient information transfer over bandwidth constrained or return channel constrained links in the presence of corrupting noise implementation of ldpc codes has lagged behind that of other codes notably turbo codes the fundamental patent for turbo codes expired on august 29 2013 https www google com patents us5446747 us5446747 ldpc codes are also known as gallager codes in honor of robert g gallager who developed the ldpc concept in his doctoral dissertation at the massachusetts institute of technology in 1960 impractical to implement when first developed by gallager in 1963 ldpc codes were forgotten until his

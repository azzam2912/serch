the system is now being decommissioned with final laser experiments being completed february 2017 the trident laser consists of three main laser chains a b and c of neodymium glass amplifiers or nd glass two are identical longpulse beams lines a b and a third beamline c that can be operated either in longpulse or in chirped pulse amplification cpa shortpulse mode longpulse beams a and b are laser chains capable of delivering up to 500 j at 1054 nm which are frequency doubled to 527 nm and 200 j depending on pulse duration the pulse duration can be varied from 100 ps to 1 s and is a unique capability of any large laser in the us and possibly the world the third laser chain beamline c can produce up to 200 j at 1054 nm or can be frequency doubled to 527 nm at 100 j in the longpulse mode with the same pulse duration variability as beams a and b or can be use in the recently june 2007 completed trident enhancement configuration allowing the 200 j beam to be compressed via cpa to 600 fs and 100 j producing powers on the scale of a quarter

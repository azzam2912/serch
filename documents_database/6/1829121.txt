plastics that act as pollutants are categorized into micro meso or macro debris based on size plastics are inexpensive and durable and as a result levels of plastic production by humans are high however the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade together these two factors have led to a high prominence of plastic pollution in the environment plastic pollution can afflict land waterways and oceans it is estimated that 1 1 to 8 8 million metric tons mt of plastic waste enters the ocean from coastal communities each year living organisms particularly marine animals can be harmed either by mechanical effects such as entanglement in plastic objects problems related to ingestion of plastic waste or through exposure to chemicals within plastics that interfere with their physiology effects on humans include disruption of various hormonal mechanisms as of 2018 about 380 million tons of plastic is produced worldwide each year from the 1950s up to 2018 an estimated 6 3 billion tons of plastic has been produced worldwide of which an estimated 9 has been recycled and another 12 has been incinerated this large

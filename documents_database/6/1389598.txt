extinction is usually caused by damage resulting in lesions on one side of the brain those who are affected by extinction have a lack of awareness in the contralesional side of space towards the left side space following a right lesion and a loss of exploratory search and other actions normally directed toward that side unilateral lesions of various brain structures can cause a failure to sense contralesional stimuli in the absence of obvious sensory losses this failure is defined as unilateral extinction if it occurs solely in the case of simultaneous bilateral sensory stimulations unilateral extinction can occur with bilateral visual auditory and tactile stimuli as well as with bilateral cross modal stimulations of these sensory systems and is more frequent following right hemisphere brain damage rhd than left hemisphere brain damage lhd unilateral sensory extinction is thought by most to be explained by competition models of selective attention where each stimulus competes to gain access to limited pools of attentional resources because of a special role of the right hemisphere in attention lesions of that hemisphere would disadvantage sensory inputs from the contralateral left hemispace relative from those from the right space the idea that inputs from the

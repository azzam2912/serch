these spaces are generally called crevices examples of crevices are gaps and contact areas between parts under gaskets or seals inside cracks and seams spaces filled with deposits and under sludge piles the corrosion resistance of a stainless steel is dependent on the presence of an ultra thin protective oxide film passive film on its surface but it is possible under certain conditions for this oxide film to break down for example in halide solutions or reducing acids areas where the oxide film can break down can also sometimes be the result of the way components are designed for example under gaskets in sharp re entrant corners or associated with incomplete weld penetration or overlapping surfaces these can all form crevices which can promote corrosion to function as a corrosion site a crevice has to be of sufficient width to permit entry of the corrodent but narrow enough to ensure that the corrodent remains stagnant accordingly crevice corrosion usually occurs in gaps a few micrometres wide and is not found in grooves or slots in which circulation of the corrodent is possible this problem can often be overcome by paying attention to the design of the component in particular to

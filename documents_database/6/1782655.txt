it is useful for both research and application development and is part of the janus speech to speech translation system the jrtk provides a flexible tcl tk script based environment which enables researchers to build state of the art speech recognizers and allows them to develop implement and evaluate new methods it implements an object oriented approach that unlike other toolkits is not a set of libraries and precompiled modules but a programmable shell with transparent yet efficient objects since version 5 jrtk features the ibis decoder a one pass decoder that is based on a re entrant single pronunciation prefix tree and makes use of the concept of linguistic context polymorphism it is therefore able to incorporate full linguistic knowledge at an early stage it is possible to decode in one pass using the same engine in combination with a statistical n gram language model as well as context free grammars it is also possible to use the decoder to rescore lattices in a very efficient way jrtk utilizes the concept of hidden markov models hmms for acoustic modeling and offers many state of the art techniques for acoustic pre processing acoustic model training and speech decoding through its

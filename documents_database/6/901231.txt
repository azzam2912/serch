it is a form of genotyping which is the measurement of more general genetic variation snps are one of the most common types of genetic variation a snp is a single base pair mutation at a specific locus usually consisting of two alleles where the rare allele frequency is 1 snps are found to be involved in the etiology of many human diseases and are becoming of particular interest in pharmacogenetics because snps are conserved during evolution they have been proposed as markers for use in quantitative trait loci qtl analysis and in association studies in place of microsatellites the use of snps is being extended in the hapmap project which aims to provide the minimal set of snps needed to genotype the human genome snps can also provide a genetic fingerprint for use in identity testing the increase of interest in snps has been reflected by the furious development of a diverse range of snp genotyping methods several applications have been developed that interrogate snps by hybridizing complementary dna probes to the snp site the challenge of this approach is reducing cross hybridization between the allele specific probes this challenge is generally overcome by manipulating the hybridization stringency conditions

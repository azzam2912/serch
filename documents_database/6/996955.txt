this allows an exchange of individuals between populations which may help prevent the negative effects of inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity via genetic drift that often occur within isolated populations corridors may also help facilitate the re establishment of populations that have been reduced or eliminated due to random events such as fires or disease this may potentially moderate some of the worst effects of habitat fragmentation wherein urbanization can split up habitat areas causing animals to lose both their natural habitat and the ability to move between regions to use all of the resources they need to survive habitat fragmentation due to human development is an ever increasing threat to biodiversity and habitat corridors are a possible mitigation the main goal of implementing habitat corridors is to increase biodiversity when areas of land are broken up by human interference population numbers become unstable and many animal and plant species become endangered by re connecting the fragments the population fluctuations can decrease dramatically corridors can contribute to three factors that stabilize a population rosenberg et al 1995 were among the first to define what constitutes a wildlife corridor the definitions of biological corridor i e wildlife corridor had in the

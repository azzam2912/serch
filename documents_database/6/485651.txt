these four names were applied by lincoln ellsworth who discovered the range from the air during his flights of november 21 and november 23 1935 in november 1936 the range was surveyed by john riddoch rymill of the british graham land expedition who gave the name mount wakefield to the central mountain in the range this complication by rymill and uncertainty as to the precise location or extent of ellsworth s discovery hindered for a time a resolution of its nomenclature i e following the u s antarctic service expedition in 1939 41 the name eternity range or eternity mountains was incorrectly applied to the present welch mountains farther south a careful study of the original reports maps and photographs and comparison with materials from subsequent expeditions such as the ronne antarctic research expedition 1947 and the falkland islands dependencies survey 1960 has led to the conclusion that the range described comprises at least the core of ellsworth s eternity range and appropriately commemorates his discovery the name wakefield given by rymill has been transferred to nearby wakefield highland

the warmest storage layer is the top storage cylinder and below this there are colder storage layers through natural layering the water is fed into different storage levels depending on the available feed temperature and current temperature layering the feed takes place via a vertical line via valves in each case the feed water is fed into the storage layer with the corresponding water temperature this is achieved by means of self acting valves feeding the respective temperature or water density into the temperature layer the advantage is that there is no mixing of the storage temperature swirling of the water is therefore to be avoided as far as possible in stratified storage tanks because this could lead to intermingling of storage layers this is reduced by means of measures such as limiting flow velocity and baffle plates at the inlets heating is therefore only necessary later since warm water can be taken from above for longer as opposed to mixed storage in addition water can be drawn with almost the same temperature very quickly after filling with hot water since not all of the storage tank has to be heated this optimises energy efficiency at the moment they are

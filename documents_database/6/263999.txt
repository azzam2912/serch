while geometry pipelines were originally implemented in software they have become highly amenable to hardware implementation particularly since the advent of very large scale integration vlsi in the early 1980s a device called the geometry engine developed by jim clark and marc hannah at stanford university in about 1981 was the watershed for what has since become an increasingly commoditized function in contemporary image synthetic raster display systems geometric transformations are applied to the vertices of polygons or other geometric objects used as modelling primitives as part of the first stage in a classical geometry based graphic image rendering pipeline geometric computations may also be applied to transform polygon or repair surface normals and then to perform the lighting and shading computations used in their subsequent rendering hardware implementations of the geometry pipeline were introduced in the early evans sutherland picture system but perhaps received broader recognition when later applied in the broad range of graphics systems products introduced by silicon graphics sgi initially the sgi geometry hardware performed simple model space to screen space viewing transformations with all the lighting and shading handled by a separate hardware implementation stage in later much higher performance applications such as the realityengine

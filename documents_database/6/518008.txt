this article lists some common gamma emitting radionuclides of technological importance and their properties many artificial radionuclides of technological importance are produced as fission products within nuclear reactors a fission product is a nucleus with approximately half the mass of a uranium or plutonium nucleus which is left over after such a nucleus has been split in a nuclear fission reaction caesium 137 is one such radionuclide it has a half life of 30 years and decays by pure beta decay to a metastable state of barium 137 barium 137m has a half life of a 2 6 minutes and is responsible for all of the gamma ray emission the ground state of barium 137 is stable the gamma ray photon energy of ba 137m is about 662 kev these gamma rays can be used for example in radiotherapy such as for the treatment of cancer in food irradiation or in industrial gauges or sensors cs 137 is not widely used for industrial radiography as other nuclides such as cobalt 60 or iridium 192 for example offer higher radiation output for a given volume iodine 131 is another important gamma emitting radionuclide produced as a fission product with a short

such calcareous structures are either dinocysts systematized as calciodinelloideae which are formed during the life cycle i e mostly hypnozygotes after sexual reproduction or resting stages an overview of potential cyst formations is given by or found in vegetative stages namely in thoracosphaera kamptner the potential to produce calcareous structures has been considered as apomorphic within alveolates arguing for the monophyly of calciodinellaceae including thoracosphaera calciodinellaceae peridiniales dinophyceae comprise 35 extant species of calcareous dinophytes plus about 260 fossil species they are distributed in cold through tropical seas of the world neritic and pelagic calcareous cysts are deposited in both marine sediments that are coastal and oceanic the first freshwater dinoflagellate that produces calcareous cysts was recently discovered according to the fossil record calcareous dinoflagellates originate in the upper triassic and are highly diverse during the cretaceous and throughout the tertiary due to their long stratigraphic range many fossil species namely their cysts have been described by contrast descriptions of extant species are primarily based on the motile stages namely on the thecae which are less diverse this has led to two distinct systematics paleontological with four subordinate groups primarily based on the cyst wall ultrastructure of which the c

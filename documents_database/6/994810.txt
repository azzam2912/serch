parahybae was described in 1877 by franz steindachner under the name platystoma parahybae later carl h eigenmann and rosa smith eigenmann described steindachneridia named for steindachner for this species and for s amblyurum designated as the type species in 1888 the next year eigenmann and eigenmann described s doceanum in 1918 miranda ribeiro described s scriptum and s scriptum punctatum later s punctatum was studied and considered to be a species of its own however because steindachneria was already being used these fish were transferred to steindachneridion in 1919 the most recent species s melanodermatum was described by garavello in 2005 this genus currently includes six extant species two fossil species of steindachneridion have been found the first to be described s iherengi was first described to arius but subsequently moved to steindachneridion though originally considered to be of pleistocene age it was later found to be actually of oligocene age the second fossil species to be described was s silvasantosi the phylogenetic placement of steindachneridion and its relationship to other pimelodid genera is unresolved these fish have been classified with sorubim like fish such as brachyplatystoma and pseudoplatystoma they have also been classified as being more closely related to

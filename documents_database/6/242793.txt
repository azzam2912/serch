perhaps the most recognizable species of this genus is the bluegill some lepomis species can grow to a maximum overall length of though most average around they are widely distributed throughout the lakes and rivers of the united states and canada and several species have been transplanted and flourished around the world even becoming pests trade in some lepomis species is prohibited in germany for this reason many are sought by anglers as panfish and large numbers are bred to stock lakes rivers and tributaries lepomis species are sometimes referred to as bream but the term more properly refers to the unrelated european cypriniform fish of genus abramis the generic name lepomis derives from the greek scale and cover plug operculum phylogeny of all lepomis species based on a partitioned mixed model bayesian analysis of a seven gene dataset of mitochondrial and nuclear gene dna sequences by near et al 2005 expanded with fossil species subgenera in bold follow bailey 1938 phylogenetic reconstructions using a combination of nuclear and mitochondrial dna sequences calibrated with fossils to estimate ages of divergences suggests that the genus lepomis diverged from the black bass in genus micropterus its sister taxon about 25 million years

the first systematic mathematical treatment was that of kepler in his harmonices mundi latin the harmony of the world 1619 following gr nbaum and shephard section 1 3 a tiling is said to be regular if the symmetry group of the tiling acts transitively on the flags of the tiling where a flag is a triple consisting of a mutually incident vertex edge and tile of the tiling this means that for every pair of flags there is a symmetry operation mapping the first flag to the second this is equivalent to the tiling being an edge to edge tiling by congruent regular polygons there must be six equilateral triangles four squares or three regular hexagons at a vertex yielding the three regular tessellations vertex transitivity means that for every pair of vertices there is a symmetry operation mapping the first vertex to the second if the requirement of flag transitivity is relaxed to one of vertex transitivity while the condition that the tiling is edge to edge is kept there are eight additional tilings possible known as archimedean uniform or demiregular tilings note that there are two mirror image enantiomorphic or chiral forms of 3 6 snub hexagonal tiling

lasers leds waveguides etc and systems which operate by the propagation and interaction of light with various tailored materials it is essentially the same as what is popularly described today as photonics it is not only concerned with the electro optic effect thus it concerns the interaction between the electromagnetic optical and the electrical electronic states of materials the electro optic effect relates to a change in the optical properties of the medium which is usually a change in the birefringence and not simply the refractive index in a kerr cell the change in birefringence is proportional to the square of the electric field and the material is usually a liquid in a pockels cell the change in birefringence varies linearly with the electric field and the material is a crystal non crystalline solid electro optical materials have caught interest because of their low cost of production these organic polymer based materials are also known as organic eo material plastic eo material or polymer eo material they consist of nonlinear optical chromophores in a polymer lattice the nonlinear optical chromophores produce pockel s effect

declarative contextual causal behavioral and adaptive models for computational inferencing analysis and control can run and adapt based on the changing context of data in motion this patented software technology enables the processing and the orchestration of context and causality for counterfactual analysis decision support and learning machines addressing key roadblocks in the continued evolution of current ai interoperability and system of systems solutions vector relational data modeling vrdm is an object based modeling language that differs significantly from traditional object oriented software descriptions a key goal of vrdm is to enable the definition of executable models this means that the modeling constructs need to be capable of fully specifying the runtime structure of an application one way vrdm achieves this is by introducing the notion of a vector which allows the participants in object relationships to be determined dynamically as the model executes this and the other core object based constructs that make up the vrdm modeling language are combined through configuration and not coding to make possible software applications that are executable models and that are interpreted dynamically just in time just in context and just in state the computational model underlying the gina software was designed to

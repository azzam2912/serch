stepwise refinement allows this process to be done in stages logically refinement normally involves implication but there can be additional complications the progressive just in time preparation of the product backlog requirements list in agile software development approaches such as scrum is also commonly described as refinement data refinement is used to convert an abstract data model in terms of sets for example into implementable data structures such as arrays operation refinement converts a specification of an operation on a system into an implementable program e g a procedure the postcondition can be strengthened and or the precondition weakened in this process this reduces any nondeterminism in the specification typically to a completely deterministic implementation for example x 1 2 3 where x is the value of the variable x after an operation could be refined to x 1 2 then x 1 and implemented as x 1 implementations of x 2 and x 3 would be equally acceptable in this case using a different route for the refinement however we must be careful not to refine to x equivalent to false since this is unimplementable it is impossible to select a member from the empty set the term reification

a set of elements to which a key is assigned can then be managed the run time of the operations depends on the difference between the largest and smallest key or constant the data structure consists mainly of a series of buckets the size of which increases exponentially the three most important fields are the above diagram shows the data structure the following invariants apply it is important to note the exponential growth of the limits and thus the range that a bucket holds in this way the logarithmic dependence of the field quantities is of value c the maximum difference between two key values during initialization empty buckets are generated and the lower bounds formula 4 are generated according to invariant 2 running time formula 17 during insert a new element formula 7 is linearly moved from right to left through the buckets and the new element with formula 19 is stored in the left bucket to that formula 20 running time formula 17 for decrease key first the key value is decreased checking for compliance with the invariants then the formula 6 field is used to locate the element and it is iterated to the left if necessary

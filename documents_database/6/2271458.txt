it states that for any deterministic process of collective decision at least one of the following three properties must hold a corollary of this theorem is gibbard satterthwaite theorem about voting rules the main difference between the two is that gibbard satterthwaite theorem is limited to ranked ordinal voting rules a voter s action consists in giving a preference ranking over the available options gibbard s theorem is more general and considers processes of collective decision that may not be ordinal for example voting systems where voters assign grades to candidates gibbard s theorem is itself generalized by gibbard s 1978 theorem and hylland s theorem which extend these results to non deterministic processes i e where the outcome may not only depend on the agents actions but may also involve a part of chance consider some voters formula 1 formula 2 and formula 3 who wish to select an option among three alternatives formula 4 formula 5 and formula 6 assume they use approval voting each voter assigns to each candidate the grade 1 approval or 0 disapproval for example formula 7 is an authorized ballot it means that the voter approves of candidates formula 4 and formula 5

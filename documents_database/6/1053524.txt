when lee attempted another spot in the hull he lost the ship and eventually abandoned the attempt british naval historian richard compton hall stated that the problems of achieving neutral buoyancy would have rendered the vertical propeller useless the route turtle would have had to take to attack hms eagle was slightly across the tidal stream which would in all probability have resulted in ezra lee becoming exhausted having only 20 minutes of air there is no record of the royal navy recording an attack in the face of these and other problems compton hall suggests that the turtle got nowhere near hms eagle and the entire story was fabricated as disinformation and morale boosting propaganda and that if ezra lee did carry out an attack it was in a covered rowing boat rather than turtle eagle went on to take part in the battle of cuddalore in 1783 eagle was on harbour service from 1790 and was broken up in 1812

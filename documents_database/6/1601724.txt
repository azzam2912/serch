from its typical abundance in healthy tissue is a moderate decrease in non metastatic breast cancer cell lines and levels are almost completely absent in mouse and human metastatic breast cancer cell lines there has also been observed a strong encapsulation of tumour cells expressing mir 31 as well as a reduced cell survival rate mir 31 s antimetastatic effects therefore make it a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer however these two papers were formally retracted by the authors in 2015 mir 31 has been linked to duchenne muscular dystrophy a genetic disorder characterised by a lack of the protein dystrophin as a potential therapeutic target duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations arising in the dystrophin gene which impair the translation of dystrophin through the formation of premature termination codons mir 31 overexpression is more abundant in human duchenne muscular dystrophy than in healthy controls with levels remaining high only in duchenne muscular dystrophy myoblasts mir 31 levels in healthy controls are instead decreased with the onset of cell differentiation mir 31 is part of the circuit controlling late muscle differentiation by repression of dystrophin synthesis and its expression is localised specifically to regenerating myoblasts of dystrophic muscles

in hilbert space delta convergence and weak convergence coincide for a general class of spaces similarly to weak convergence every bounded sequence has a delta convergent subsequence delta convergence was first introduced by teck cheong lim and soon after under the name of almost convergence by tadeusz kuczumow a sequence formula 1 in a metric space formula 2 is said to be convergent to formula 3 if for every formula 4 formula 5 if formula 6 is a uniformly convex and uniformly smooth banach space with the duality mapping formula 7 given by formula 8 formula 9 then a sequence formula 10 is delta convergent to formula 11 if and only if formula 12 converges to zero weakly in the dual space formula 13 see in particular delta convergence and weak convergence coincide if formula 6 is a hilbert space coincidence of weak convergence and delta convergence is equivalent for uniformly convex banach spaces to the well known opial property the delta compactness theorem of t c lim states that if formula 2 is an asymptotically complete metric space then every bounded sequence in formula 6 has a delta convergent subsequence the delta compactness theorem is similar to the banach

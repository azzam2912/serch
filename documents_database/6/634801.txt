it was named after spanish poet federico garcia lorca and was recorded simultaneously with blue afternoon though notably different in style it was one of buckley s two avant garde albums and explored some sounds and ideas he had not previously used also importantly it was an attempt to break away from more traditional and prevalent pop music songwriting styles such as the verse chorus binary form that buckley had explored in the earlier parts of his career lorca is a move away from traditional pop music forms towards a free form mix of jazz avant garde and folk musically buckley uses the lack of a constant rhythm section to drive the songs forward with his voice many songs make use of a chromatic scale which makes them stand in stark contrast to buckley s earlier melodic works the lyrics of lorca also represent a departure from his previous traditional pop music writing instead buckley uses a more abstract descriptive style avoiding direct narratives and standard song themes this is a reflection of the poetry such as the works of poet federico garc a lorca that buckley and guitarist lee underwood were reading at the time the album s opener

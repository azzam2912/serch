it is known that a complex orientation of a homology theory leads to a formal group law the landweber exact functor theorem or left for short can be seen as a method to reverse this process it constructs a homology theory out of a formal group law the coefficient ring of complex cobordism is formula 1 where the degree of formula 2 is formula 3 this is isomorphic to the graded lazard ring formula 4 this means that giving a formal group law f of degree formula 5 over a graded ring formula 6 is equivalent to giving a graded ring morphism formula 7 multiplication by an integer formula 8 is defined inductively as a power series by let now f be a formal group law over a ring formula 11 define for a topological space x here formula 6 gets its formula 14 algebra structure via f the question is is e a homology theory it is obviously a homotopy invariant functor which fulfills excision the problem is that tensoring in general does not preserve exact sequences one could demand that formula 6 be flat over formula 14 but that would be too strong in practice peter landweber found

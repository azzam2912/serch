pulse generators are used primarily for working with digital circuits related function generators are used primarily for analog circuits simple bench pulse generators usually allow control of the pulse repetition rate frequency pulse width delay with respect to an internal or external trigger and the high and low voltage levels of the pulses more sophisticated pulse generators may allow control over the rise time and fall time of the pulses pulse generators are available for generating output pulses having widths duration ranging from minutes down to under 1 picosecond pulse generators are generally voltage sources with true current pulse generators being available only from a few suppliers pulse generators may use digital techniques analog techniques or a combination of both techniques to form the output pulses for example the pulse repetition rate and duration may be digitally controlled but the pulse amplitude and rise and fall times may be determined by analog circuitry in the output stage of the pulse generator with correct adjustment pulse generators can also produce a 50 duty cycle square wave pulse generators are generally single channel providing one frequency delay width and output light pulse generators are the optical equivalent to electrical pulse generators with

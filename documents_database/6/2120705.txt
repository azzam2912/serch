this permits reading full cdna sequences and can deliver high yield from single sources even single cells that contain 10 to 30 picograms of mrna with relatively low levels 3 5 of contaminating rrna sequence this technique is often employed in whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing it is marketed by clontech as switching mechanism at the 5 end of rna template smart it is marketed by diagenode as capture and amplification by tailing and switching cats by using syringe pumps to transmit a steady rate of isolated cells and uniquely oligonucleotide barcoded beads it is possible to isolate individual cells and beads together in droplets of lysis buffer where the polyadenylation site binds to a primer containing a unique identifying sequence this primer also contains a common sequence upstream of the identifier so that after it is extended by reverse transcription subsequent rounds of pcr will incorporate the tag which permits each isolated cdna that is sequenced to be tracked back to a specific originating bead this permits the relative levels of transcripts in many individual cells to be analyzed simultaneously creating a rational basis for the classification of these cells into particular cell types or permitting the logical inference of

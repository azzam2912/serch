it is also present in saliva from which it was first isolated l plantarum is gram positive bacilli shaped bacterium l plantarum cells are rods with rounded ends straight generally 0 9 1 2 m wide and 3 8 m long occurring singly in pairs or in short chains l plantarum has one of the largest genomes known among the lactic acid bacteria and is a very flexible and versatile species it is estimated to grow between ph 3 4 and 8 8 lactobacillus plantarum can grow in the temperature range 12 c to 40 c l plantarum are aerotolerant gram positive bacteria that grow at but not at and produce both isomers of lactic acid d and l lactobacilli are unusual in that they can respire oxygen but have no respiratory chain or cytochromes the consumed oxygen ultimately ends up as hydrogen peroxide the peroxide it is presumed acts as a weapon to exclude competing bacteria from the food source in place of the protective enzyme superoxide dismutase present in almost all other oxygen tolerant cells this organism accumulates millimolar quantities of manganese polyphosphate manganese is also used by l plantarum in a pseudo catalase to lower reactive oxygen

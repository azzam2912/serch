its current dedication to saint panteleimon was given to the church after the end of ottoman rule in 1912 and its original dedication is therefore disputed in ottoman times it was converted into a mosque in 1548 and became known as ishakiye camii mosque of ishak isaac which in the prevailing scholarly interpretation points to an identification with the late byzantine monastery of the virgin peribleptos also known as the monastery of kyr isaac after its founder jacob who was the city s metropolitan bishop in 1295 1315 and became a monk with the monastic name of isaac a counter argument however supports the theory that the present church is unrelated to the peribleptos monastery and that it was converted into a mosque ca 1500 when the city s kad judge was ishak elebi whom the mosque was named after however the church s architecture and decoration which date to the late 13th early 14th centuries appear to support the former view the church is of the tetrastyle cross in square type with a narthex and a now destroyed ambulatory that is connected to two chapels still extant very few of the building s original wall paintings survive ottoman remains

the gassmann equation is the most common way of performing a fluid substitution model from one known parameter these formulations are from avseth et al 2006 given an initial set of velocities and densities formula 1 formula 2 and formula 3 corresponding to a rock with an initial set of fluids you can compute the velocities and densities of the rock with another set of fluid often these velocities are measured from well logs but might also come from a theoretical model step 1 extract the dynamic bulk and shear moduli from formula 4 formula 5 and formula 3 step 2 apply gassmann s relation of the following form to transform the saturated bulk modulus where formula 10 and formula 11 are the rock bulk moduli saturated with fluid 1 and fluid 2 and formula 12 and formula 13 are the bulk moduli of the fluids themselves step 3 leave the shear modulus unchanged rigidity is independent of fluid type step 4 correct the bulk density for the change in fluid step 5 recompute the fluid substituted velocities given let and then or expanded this assumption imply that shear modulus of the saturated rock is the same as the shear

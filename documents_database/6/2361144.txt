it is based on solid state welding that means there is no melting dfsw is based on a frictional heat generated by a simple tool in order to soften the materials and stir them together using both tool rotational and tool traverse movements in the beginning it is mainly used for joining of aluminum base metals due to existence of solidification defects in joining them by fusion welding methods such as porosity along with thick intermetallic compounds dfsw is taken into account as an efficient method to join dissimilar materials in the last decade there are many advantages for dfsw in compare with other welding methods including low cost user friendly and easy operation procedure resulting in enormous usages of friction stir welding for dissimilar joints welding tool base materials backing plate fixture and a milling machine are required materials and equipment for dfsw on the other hand other welding methods such as shielded metal arc welding smaw typically need highly professional operator as well as quite expensive equipment the mechanism of dfsw is very simple a rotating tool plunges into the interface of parent metals and heat input generated by the friction between the tool shoulder surface and top

lie groups are named after norwegian mathematician sophus lie who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups in rough terms a lie group is a continuous group that is one whose elements are described by several real parameters as such lie groups provide a natural model for the concept of continuous symmetry such as rotational symmetry in three dimensions lie groups are widely used in many parts of modern mathematics and physics lie s original motivation for introducing lie groups was to model the continuous symmetries of differential equations in much the same way that finite groups are used in galois theory to model the discrete symmetries of algebraic equations lie groups are smooth differentiable manifolds and as such can be studied using differential calculus in contrast with the case of more general topological groups one of the key ideas in the theory of lie groups is to replace the global object the group with its local or linearized version which lie himself called its infinitesimal group and which has since become known as its lie algebra lie groups play an enormous role in modern geometry on several different levels felix klein argued in his erlangen program

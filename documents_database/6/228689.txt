like all other properties of a quantum particle angular momentum is quantized meaning it can only equal certain discrete values which correspond to different rotational energy states when a particle loses angular momentum it is said to have transitioned to a lower rotational energy state likewise when a particle gains angular momentum a positive rotational transition is said to have occurred rotational transitions are important in physics due to the unique spectral lines that result because there is a net gain or loss of energy during a transition electromagnetic radiation of a particular frequency must be absorbed or emitted this forms spectral lines at that frequency which can be detected with a spectrometer as in rotational spectroscopy or raman spectroscopy molecules have rotational energy owing to rotational motion of the nuclei about their center of mass due to quantization these energies can take only certain discrete values rotational transition thus corresponds to transition of the molecule from one rotational energy level to the other through gain or loss of a photon analysis is simple in the case of diatomic molecules quantum theoretical analysis of a molecule is simplified by use of born oppenheimer approximation typically rotational energies of molecules are

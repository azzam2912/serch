oxidation of odd carbon fatty acids requires three additional enzymes the first is propionyl coa cabroxylase this enzyme is responsible for carboxylating the carbon of a propionyl coa to produce d methylmalonyl coa after this methylmalonyl coa epimerase carries out an isomerization reaction specifically the d isomer produced by the carboxylase reaction is transformed into the l isomer of methylmalonyl coa scientifically this is a fairly recently discovered enzyme it was researched during the late 1900 s and one of the first few publications of the enzyme was published in 1961 although not much was known researchers concluded that there was indeed an racemic reaction prior to reaching succinyl coa to reach succinyl coa the l isomer of the if methylmalonyl coa is used as a substrate by methylmalonyl coa mutase this reaction is essentially a switch in positions between the carboxylated carbon and the carbon for this reaction to take place the enzyme works with a cofactor known as a vitamin b allowing the mechanism to take place through a free radical mechanism with these three reactions completed to success the fatty acid is allowed to continue through normal oxidation rounds almost all animal fatty acid synthesis is done

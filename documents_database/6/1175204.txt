they are located off davenport landing which is a street off highway 1 the tide pools are unique due to the ridges that run up and down the tide pools allowing for different organisms to live close even though in a normal habitat they would be unable to do so the beach is open sunrise to sunset and is day use only the normal tide pool is separated into two main zones the intertidal zone and the subtidal zone the intertidal zone is only covered with sea water during high tide while the subtidal zone is closer to the ocean and is covered during low tide the distinctive separation of organisms into bands along the shoreline is called zonation however the davenport tide pools are unique in the fact that there are many rifts and ridges in the rock formations allowing water to reach high on the beach during low tide this allows species that normally are not found together to live close in contrast gastropods are not fed upon in proportion to their abundance and availability only 2 species of gastropods the black turban snail tegula and the ribbed limpet acwaea scabra are of any real importance to pisaster

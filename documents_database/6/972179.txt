human gcpii contains 750 amino acids and weighs approximately 84 kda gcpii is a zinc metalloenzyme that resides in membranes most of the enzyme resides in the extracellular space gcpii is a class ii membrane glycoprotein it catalyzes the hydrolysis of n acetylaspartylglutamate naag to glutamate and n acetylaspartate naa according to the reaction scheme to the right neuroscientists primarily use the term naaladase in their studies while those studying folate metabolism use folate hydrolase and those studying prostate cancer or oncology psma all of which refer to the same protein glutamate carboxypeptidase ii gcpii is mainly expressed in four tissues of the body including prostate epithelium the proximal tubules of the kidney the jejunal brush border of the small intestine and ganglia of the nervous system indeed the initial cloning of the cdna encoding the gene expressing psma was accomplished with rna from a prostate tumor cell line lncap psma shares homology with the transferrin receptor and undergoes endocytosis but the ligand for inducing internalization has not been identified it was found that psma was the same as the membrane protein in the small intestine responsible for removal of gamma linked glutamates from polygammaglutamate folate this enables the freeing

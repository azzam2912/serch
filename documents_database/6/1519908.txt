the package interconnects are applied on an artificial wafer made of silicon chips and a casting compound ewlb is a further development of the classical wafer level ball grid array technology wlb or wlp wafer level package the main driving force behind the ewlb technology was to allow fanout and more space for interconnect routing all process steps for the generation of the package are performed on the wafer this allows in comparison to classical packaging technologies e g ball grid array the generation of very small and flat packages with excellent electrical and thermal performance at lowest cost it is common for all wlb technologies which are built on a silicon wafer that the interconnects typically solder balls fit on the chip so called fan in design therefore only chips with a restricted number of interconnects can be packaged the ewlb technology allows the realization of chips with a high number of interconnects the package is not created on a silicon wafer as for the classical wafer level package but on an artificial wafer therefore a front end processed wafer is diced and the singulated chips are placed on a carrier the distance between the chips can be chosen

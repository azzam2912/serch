it uses the degree fahrenheit symbol as the unit several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist the lower defining point 0 was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from equal parts of ice water and a salt ammonium chloride further limits were established as the melting point of ice 32 and his best estimate of the average human body temperature 96 about 2 6 less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale the scale is now usually defined by two fixed points the temperature at which water freezes into ice is defined as 32 and the boiling point of water is defined to be 212 a 180 separation as defined at sea level and standard atmospheric pressure at the end of the 2010s fahrenheit was used as the official temperature scale only in the united states including its unincorporated territories its freely associated states in the western pacific palau the federated states of micronesia and the marshall islands the bahamas liberia and burma antigua and barbuda and other islands which use the same meteorological service such as saint kitts and nevis and belize use fahrenheit and celsius

alpha thalassemia is due to impaired production of alpha chains from 1 2 3 or all 4 of the alpha globin genes leading to a relative excess of beta globin chains the degree of impairment is based on which clinical phenotype is present how many genes are affected the presentation of individuals with alpha thalassemia consists of alpha thalassemias are most commonly inherited in a mendelian recessive manner they are also associated with deletions of chromosome 16p alpha thalassemia can also be acquired under rare circumstances the mechanism sees that thalassemias results in decreased alpha globin production therefore fewer alpha globin chains are produced resulting in an excess of chains in adults and excess chains in newborns the excess chains form unstable tetramers called hemoglobin h or hbh of four beta chains the excess chains form tetramers which are poor carriers of o since their affinity for o is too high so it is not dissociated in the periphery homozygote thalassaemias where numerous but no globins occur at all referred to as hb barts often result in death soon after birth diagnosis of alpha thalassemia is primarily by laboratory evaluation and molecular diagnosis alpha thalassemia can be mistaken for iron

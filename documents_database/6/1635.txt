a lactam is a cyclic amide it is named as such because the nitrogen atom is attached to the carbon atom relative to the carbonyl the simplest lactam possible is 2 azetidinone the lactam ring is part of the core structure of several antibiotic families the principal ones being the penicillins cephalosporins carbapenems and monobactams which are therefore also called lactam antibiotics nearly all of these antibiotics work by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis this has a lethal effect on bacteria although any given bacteria population will typically contain a subgroup that is resistant to lactam antibiotics bacterial resistance occurs as a result of the expression of one of many genes for the production of lactamases a class of enzymes that break open the lactam ring more than 1 800 different lactamase enzymes have been documented in various species of bacteria these enzymes vary widely in their chemical structure and catalytic efficiencies when bacterial populations have these resistant subgroups treatment with lactam can result in the resistant strain becoming more prevalent and therefore more virulent lactam derived antibiotics can be considered as one of the most important antibiotic classes but prone to clinical resistance lactam exhibits its antibiotic properties by

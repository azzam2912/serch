due east of mons piton is the flooded crater cassini and to the west northwest lies piazzi smyth north and northeast of this massif is the montes alpes range forming the northeast edge of the lunar mare the selenographic coordinates of this rise are 40 6 n 1 1 w and it has a diameter of 25 km it is slightly elongated along toward the northwest with ridge lines to the south northwest and west the peak climbs to a height of 2250 m typical of the peaks in the montes alpes but much lower than mons blanc which rises to 3 6 km because it is an isolated formation on the lunar mare this peak can form prominent shadows when illuminated by oblique sunlight during the lunar dawn or dusk it is also known as a location of transient lunar anomalies the peak of piton is cratered from a meteor strike though the crater can be difficult to observe from earthbound telescopes there is a pair of satellite craters on the mare to the south that are named for this peak see below to the south southwest is a low ridge feature in an isolated portion of the mare

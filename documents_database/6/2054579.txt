it consists of a red dwarf star with 20 30 the mass of the sun and a white dwarf star roughly 50 the mass of the sun the two components orbit each other in a tight orbit only 0 11 astronomical units from each other with an orbital period of only 14 71 days due to their small separation the two objects have never been visually resolved and are merely predicted from the radial velocity changes of gj 3991 a making the system a spectroscopic binary gj 3991 b was first identified in 1997 by astronomers i n reid and j e gizis through significant radial velocity variations visible through gj 3991 a although were unable to identify the nature of the secondary object in 1998 another group of astronomers was able to determine the secondary as a cold white dwarf star the compact remnant that remains after a low mass star such as our sun is no longer able to fuse elements for energy gj 3991 b is the 9th nearest white dwarf after sirius b procyon b van maanen 2 lp 145 141 40 eridani b stein 2051 b g 240 72 and gliese 223 2 among these

it is a colorless liquid classified as a 1 3 diketone it exists in equilibrium with a tautomer chc o ch c oh ch these tautomers interconvert so rapidly under most conditions that they are treated as a single compound in most applications it is a colorless liquid that is a precursor to acetylacetonate anion commonly abbreviated acac a bidentate ligand it is also a building block for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds the keto and enol tautomers of acetylacetone coexist in solution the enol form has c symmetry meaning the hydrogen atom is shared equally between the two oxygen atoms in the gas phase the equilibrium constant k is 11 7 favoring the enol form the two tautomeric forms can be distinguished by nmr spectroscopy ir spectroscopy and other methods the equilibrium constant tends to be high in nonpolar solvents the keto form becomes more favorable in polar hydrogen bonding solvents such as water the enol form is a vinylogous analogue of a carboxylic acid acetylacetone is a weak acid iupac recommended p k values for this equilibrium in aqueous solution at 25 c are 8 99 0 04 i 0 8 83 0 02 i 0 1 m

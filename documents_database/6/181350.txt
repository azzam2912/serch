range is restricted by the amount of breathing gas that can be carried the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed and the battery power of the dpv time limits imposed on the diver by decompression requirements may also limit safe range in practice dpvs have recreational scientific and military applications dpvs include a range of configurations from small easily portable scooter units with a small range and low speed to faired or enclosed units capable of carrying several divers longer distances at higher speeds the earliest recorded dpvs were used for military purposes during world war ii and were based on torpedo technology and components a dpv usually consists of a pressure resistant watertight casing containing a battery powered electric motor which drives a propeller the design must ensure that the propeller cannot harm the diver diving equipment or marine life the vehicle cannot be accidentally started or run away from the diver and it remains neutrally buoyant while in use underwater dpvs are useful for extending the range of an autonomous diver that is otherwise restricted by the amount of breathing gas that can be carried the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed which is

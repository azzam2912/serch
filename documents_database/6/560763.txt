usually however the salt is handled as its dihydrate nacro 2ho virtually all chromium ore is processed via conversion to sodium dichromate and virtually all compounds and materials based on chromium are prepared from this salt in terms of reactivity and appearance sodium dichromate and potassium dichromate are very similar the sodium salt is however around twenty times more soluble in water than the potassium salt 49 g l at 0 c and its equivalent weight is also lower which is often desirable sodium dichromate is generated on a large scale from ores containing chromium iii oxides the ore is fused with a base typically sodium carbonate at around 1000 c in the presence of air source of oxygen 2cr2o3 4na2co3 3o2 4na2cro4 4co2 this step solubilizes the chromium and allows it to be extracted into hot water at this stage other components of the ore such as aluminium and iron compounds are poorly soluble acidification of the resulting aqueous extract with sulfuric acid or carbon dioxide affords the dichromate 2na2cro4 2co2 h2o na2cr2o7 2nahco3 2na2cro4 h2so4 na2cr2o7 na2so4 h2o the dichromate is isolated as the dihydrate by crystallization in this way many millions of kilograms of sodium dichromate are

supremum among the absolute values of the elements in its spectrum it is sometimes denoted by let be the real or complex eigenvalues of a matrix then its spectral radius is defined as the condition number of formula 2 can be expressed using the spectral radius as formula 3 the spectral radius is a sort of infimum of all norms of a matrix on the one hand formula 4 for every natural matrix norm formula 5 and on the other hand gelfand s formula states that formula 6 both these results are shown below however the spectral radius does not necessarily satisfy formula 7 for arbitrary vectors formula 8 to see why let formula 9 be arbitrary and consider the matrix formula 10 the characteristic polynomial of formula 11 is formula 12 hence its eigenvalues are formula 13 and thus formula 14 however formula 15 so formula 16 for formula 17 being any formula 18 norm on formula 19 what still allows formula 20 as formula 21 is that formula 22 making formula 23 as formula 21 does hold when formula 2 is a hermitian matrix and formula 17 is the euclidean norm the spectral radius of a finite graph

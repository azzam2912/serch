see also equality in contrast to strict inequalities there are two types of inequality relations that are not strict if the values in question are elements of an ordered set such as the integers or the real numbers they can be compared in size in engineering sciences less formal use of the notation is to state that one quantity is much greater than another normally by several orders of magnitude this implies that the lesser value can be neglected with little effect on the accuracy of an approximation for example the ultrarelativistic limit in physics in all of the cases above any two symbols mirroring each other are symmetrical a a are equivalent etc inequalities are governed by the following properties all of these properties also hold if all of the non strict inequalities and are replaced by their corresponding strict inequalities and in the case of applying a function monotonic functions are limited to strictly monotonic functions the transitive property of inequality states the relations and are each other s converse a common constant c may be added to or subtracted from both sides of an inequality i e the real numbers are an ordered group under addition the

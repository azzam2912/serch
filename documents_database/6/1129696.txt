two of these subunits cd122 and cd132 are shared with the receptor for il 2 but il 2 receptor has an additional subunit cd25 the shared subunits contain the cytoplasmic motifs required for signal transduction and this forms the basis of many overlapping biological activities of il15 and il2 although in vivo the two cytokines have separate biological effects this may be due to effects of the respective alpha chains which are unique to each receptor the kinetics and affinity of cytokine cytokine receptor binding or due to the availability and concentration of each cytokine il 15ralpha specifically binds il15 with very high affinity and is capable of binding il 15 independently of other subunits it is suggested that this property allows il 15 to be produced by one cell endocytosed by another cell and then presented to a third party cell this receptor is reported to enhance cell proliferation and expression of apoptosis inhibitor bcl2l1 bcl2 xl and bcl2 multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been reported the full length sequences of only two variants encoding distinct isoforms are available several isoforms of the il 15ralpha protein have been detected these isoforms can either result from

it is a member of the bromodomain and extra terminal motif bet protein family brdt is similar to the ring3 protein family it possesses 2 bromodomain motifs and a pest sequence a cluster of proline glutamic acid serine and threonine residues characteristic of proteins that undergo rapid intracellular degradation the bromodomain is found in proteins that regulate transcription two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene the use of three different mouse models brdt knock out mice mice expressing a non functional brdt and mice expressing a mutated brdt lacking its first bromodomain showed that brdt drives a meiotic and post meiotic gene expression program it also controls the genome wide post meiotic genome reorganization that occurs after histone hyperacetylation in elongating spermatids model organisms have been used in the study of brdt function a conditional knockout mouse line called brdt was generated as part of the international knockout mouse consortium program a high throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion twenty five tests were carried out on mutant mice and two significant

the approximately 129 species in 12 genera are found mostly on the reefs of the atlantic indian and pacific oceans a number of species pairs occur in the indian and pacific oceans members of the huge genus chaetodon butterflyfish look like smaller versions of angelfish pomacanthidae but unlike these lack preopercle spines at the gill covers some members of the genus heniochus resemble the moorish idol zanclus cornutus of the monotypic zanclidae among the paraphyletic perciformes the former are probably not too distantly related to butterflyfish whereas the zanclidae seem far less close butterflyfish mostly range from in length the largest species the lined butterflyfish and the saddle butterflyfish c ephippium grow to the common name references the brightly coloured and strikingly patterned bodies of many species bearing shades of black white blue red orange and yellow other species are dull in colour many have eyespots on their flanks and dark bands across their eyes not unlike the patterns seen on butterfly wings their deep laterally narrow bodies are easily noticed through the profusion of reef life the conspicuous coloration of butterflyfish may be intended for interspecies communication butterflyfish have uninterrupted dorsal fins with tail fins that may be rounded

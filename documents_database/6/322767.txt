in this verse peter is standing in jesus s empty tomb the beloved disciple and perhaps mary magdalene are outside this verse describes the arrangement of the grave clothes they see in the king james version of the bible the text reads the english standard version translates the passage as for a collection of other versions see biblehub john 20 7 the translation and meaning of this verse are much debated the napkin face cloth in greek is a soudarium from the latin sudarium literally a sweat rag a piece of cloth used to wipe the sweat from one s brow most scholars believe it refers to a cloth wrapped around the head of the deceased perhaps to keep the mouth from falling open ader has a different reading seeing soudarium as meaning the same thing as the word sindon which in the synoptic gospels refers to any of the burial cloths the word soudarium is used in a different context in where a servant uses one to wrap his money the exact relationship between this headpiece and the other clothes is not certain the passage can be read either as meaning the cloth is not in the same location

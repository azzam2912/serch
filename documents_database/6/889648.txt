this technology bears some similarities to conductive bridging ram cbram and phase change memory pcm cbram involves one electrode providing ions that dissolve readily in an electrolyte material while pcm involves generating sufficient joule heating to effect amorphous to crystalline or crystalline to amorphous phase changes on the other hand reram involves generating defects in a thin oxide layer known as oxygen vacancies oxide bond locations where the oxygen has been removed which can subsequently charge and drift under an electric field the motion of oxygen ions and vacancies in the oxide would be analogous to the motion of electrons and holes in a semiconductor although reram was initially seen as a replacement technology for flash memory the cost and performance benefits of reram have not been enough for companies to proceed with the replacement apparently a broad range of materials can be used for reram however the discovery that the popular high gate dielectric hfo can be used as a low voltage reram has encouraged researchers to investigate more possibilities among these siox has been found to offer significant benefits and is currently being explored by some companies such as weebit nano ltd rram is the registered trademark name

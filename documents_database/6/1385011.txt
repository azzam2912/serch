in african elephants related forms of these viruses which have been identified in wild populations are generally benign occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions however some types of eehv can cause a highly fatal disease in asian elephants which kills up to 80 of severely affected individuals the disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs but this has only been effective in around a third of cases the first case of a fatal form of the disease was documented in 1995 though tissue samples from as early as the 1980s have since tested positive for the virus and localized skin lesions in wild african elephants were recorded in the 1970s since 1995 there have been over fifty documented disease cases in north america and europe of which only nine have been successfully cured those affected are mostly young animals born in captivity though a small number of older wild born adults held in zoos have died and a number of cases caused by the same pathogenic type of eehv have been identified in both orphan and wild calves in asian elephant populations the eehvs are members of the proboscivirus genus a novel clade most

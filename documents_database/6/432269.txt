it is similar to fastcgi but is designed to be easier to parse unlike cgi it permits a long running service process to continue serving requests thus avoiding delays in responding to requests due to setup overhead such as connecting to a database scgi is a protocol which defines communication between a webserver and an application server this is in contrast to cgi which is an earlier application gateway interface designed to let the application programmer avoid the complexity of sockets and long running service processes when poor scalability and high overhead are acceptable the scgi protocol leverages the fact that the client has already parsed and validated the http request and canonically communicates the request to the scgi server while letting the application programmer avoid parsing ambiguities and protocol edge cases this avoids the complicated header parsing and header combining rules from rfc2616 saving significant complexity in the scgi server process neil schemenauer published the original scgi protocol specification dated october 2001 he developed the first implementations of scgi and initially published them in april 2002 the client connects to a scgi server over a reliable stream protocol allowing transmission of 8 bit bytes the client begins by sending

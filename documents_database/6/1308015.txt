this process is helpful in mass spectrometry because it creates unique bands that can be used to identify molecules this process is extremely common in nature as it is considered the primary initial reaction in flames the term chemi ionization was coined by hartwell f calcote in 1948 in the third symposium on combustion and flame and explosion phenomena the symposium performed much of the early investigation into this phenomenon in the 1950s the majority of the research on this topic was performed in the 1960s and 70s it is currently seen in many different ionization techniques used for mass spectrometry chemi ionization can be represented by where g is the excited state species indicated by the super scripted asterisk and m is the species that is ionized by the loss of an electron to form the radical cation indicated by the super scripted plus dot the most common example of a type chemi ionization occurs in hydrocarbon flame the reaction can be represented as this reaction is present in any hydrocarbon flame and can account for deviation in the amount of expected ions from thermodynamic equilibrium this can then lead to b type chemi ionization which can be represented

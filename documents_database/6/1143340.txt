this enzyme is part of the mitochondrial protein kinases family and it is a regulator of the valine leucine and isoleucine catabolic pathways bckdk is found in the mitochondrial matrix and the prevalence of it depends on the type of cell liver cells tend to have the lowest concentration of bckdk whereas skeletal muscle cells have the highest amount abnormal activity of this enzyme often leads to diseases such as maple syrup urine disease and cachexia bckdk s structure consists of a characteristic nucleotide binding domain along with a four helix bundle domain similar to certain aspects of protein histidine kinases which are involved in two component signal transduction systems bckdk is also a dimer with a leu389 residue located between the dimers and this dimerization is seen to be essential for its kinase activity and protein stability moreover it is made up of 382 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 43 kda the gene bckdk is located at 16p11 2 has an exon count of 11 and it lacks a tata box and an initiator element bckdk regulates the activity of branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex bckd through phosphorylation and inactivation this inactivation results in increased branched

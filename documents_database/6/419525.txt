in a more specific sense the rim may refer to the circular or elliptical edge that represents the uppermost tip of this raised portion if there is no raised portion the rim simply refers to the inside edge of the curve where the flat surface meets the curve of the crater bottom smaller simple craters retain rim geometries similar to the features of many craters found on the moon and the planet mercury large craters are those with a diameter greater than 2 3 km and are distinguished by central uplifts within the impact zone these larger also called complex craters can form rims up to several hundred meters in height a process to consider when determining the exact height of a crater rim is that melt may have been pushed over the crest of the initial rim from the initial impact thereby increasing its overall height when combined with potential weathering due to atmospheric erosion over time determining the average height of a crater rim can be somewhat difficult it has also been observed that the slope along the excavated interior of many craters can facilitate a spur and gully morphology including mass wasting events occurring due to slope

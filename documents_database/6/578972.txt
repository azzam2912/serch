such devices are commonly used to signal in accurate time intervals the operation of some other device this is done by measuring the intermittent pulses released between a starting pulse signal and an ending pulse signal before a pulse counter measures the number of pulses released into the appropriate time interval for instance an intervalometer might activate something every 30 seconds in photography intervalometers are used to trigger exposures this is often done for a time lapse series it may also be used to take or begin taking picture s after a set delay examples of intervalometer use in aerial photography include delaying the start of picture taking by an unattended camera until some time after takeoff and separating multiple exposures in time and thus distance as the vehicle containing the camera travels to obtain the 3d effect stereoscopy to obtain the 3d effect each image should have about 60 of the surface in common with either the preceding or following image the interval is calculated as a function of the altitude and speed of the vehicle shorter intervals for low altitude and high speed often the purpose of a photographic intervalometer is to reduce the resources required either to

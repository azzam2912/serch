the term is used to refer to the closely related group of phages including the f1 fd and m13 phages the if1 and ike phage are also closely related to this group these phages undergo a non lytic lifecycle in which infected bacteria are not killed but continuously release viral particles this is in contrast to the lytic and lysogenic cycles of other phages where the host is killed when virions are released the ff phages have a circular ssdna genome wrapped in a few thousand copies of the major coat protein to give a rod shaped viral particle that is capped on either end with two different sets of proteins only one end binds to the f pilus and can inject the dna into the host cell ff phages need the host cell to be hfr or f when a virion binds to the sex pilus of a host by protein 3 in its beaded end the pilus retracts and the virus fuses with the host membrane several host proteins are involved in this step and the genome of the virus is released into the bacterial cytoplasm the single stranded dna of the virus is converted into double stranded

more formally a coordination polymer is a coordination compound with repeating coordination entities extending in 1 2 or 3 dimensions it can also be described as a polymer whose repeat units are coordination complexes coordination polymers contain the subclass coordination networks that are coordination compounds extending through repeating coordination entities in 1 dimension but with cross links between two or more individual chains loops or spiro links or a coordination compound extending through repeating coordination entities in 2 or 3 dimensions a subclass of these are the metal organic frameworks or mofs that are coordination networks with organic ligands containing potential voids coordination polymers are relevant to many fields such as organic and inorganic chemistry biochemistry materials science electrochemistry and pharmacology having many potential applications this interdisciplinary nature has led to extensive study in the past few decades coordination polymers can be classified in a number of different ways according to their structure and composition one important classification is referred to as dimensionality a structure can be determined to be one two or three dimensional depending on the number of directions in space the array extends in a one dimensional structure extends in a straight line along the x axis

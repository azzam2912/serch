it is designed as a general purpose laboratory for experimental plasma physics research the device began operation in 1991 and was upgraded twice in 2001 and 2016 to its current version the modern lapd is operated as a national user facility in which half the research time on the device is open to scientists at other institutions and facilities the lapd is a linear pulsed discharge device operated at a high 1 hz repetition rate producing a strongly magnetized background plasma which is physically large enough to support alfv n waves plasma is produced from a barium oxide bao cathode anode discharge at one end of a 20 meter long 1 meter diameter cylindrical vacuum vessel diagram the resulting plasma column is roughly 16 5 meters long and 60 cm in diameter the background magnetic field produced by a series of large electromagnets surrounding the chamber can be varied from 400 gauss to 2 5 kilogauss 40 to 250 mt because the lapd is a general purpose research device the plasma parameters are carefully selected to make diagnostics simple without the problems associated with hotter e g fusion level plasmas while still providing a useful environment in which to do

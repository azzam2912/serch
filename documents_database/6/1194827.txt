cameroon s undeveloped mineral resources include bauxite cobalt gold from lode deposits granite iron ore nepheline syenite nickel and rutile strong metal and industrial mineral prices since 2003 have encouraged companies to develop mines the nkamouna enriched cobalt nickel manganese iron laterite deposits and several other nickeliferous laterite deposits in southeast cameroon were first discovered and investigated by the united nations development programme undp during 1981 1986 in a cooperative project with the cameroon ministry of mines water and energy to evaluate mineral potential in southeastern cameroon due to the remote location and the low nickel prices at the time the discovery did not draw much attention no further exploration took place on the property until geologist william buckovic became aware of the nickel discovery in 1988 the southeast region and nearby regions in gabon republic of the congo and central african republic have few producing mineral deposits and few with near term production potential most of this region is underlain by proterozoic granite gneiss schist terrains within the region ultramafic rocks the original source of the cobalt and nickel are confined to the project area there has been no previous production of minerals from the project area alluvial gold

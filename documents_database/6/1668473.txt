debs is found in saccharopolyspora erythraea and responsible for the synthesis of the macrolide ring which is the precursor of the antibiotic erythromycin there have been three categories of polyketide synthases identified to date type 1 2 and 3 type one synthases involve large multidomain proteins containing all the sites necessary for polyketide synthesis type two synthases contain active sites distributed among several smaller polypeptides and type three synthases are large multi protein complexes containing modules which have a single active site for each and every step of polyketide synthesis in the case of debs there are three large multi functional proteins debs 1 2 and 3 that each exist as a dimer of two modules each module consists of a minimum of a ketosynthase ks acyl carrier protein acp site and acyltransferase at but may also contain a ketoreductase kr dehydrotase dh and enol reductase er for additional reduction reactions the debs complex also contains a loading domain on module 1 consisting of an acyl carrier protein and an acyltransferase the terminal thioesterase acts solely to terminate debs polyketide synthesis and cyclize the macrolide ring the active site of this enzyme has a very broad specificity which allows for

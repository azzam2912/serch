its visual magnitude varies from 6 3 to 7 5 tv gem is less than a degree sw of geminorum it is a member of the gemini ob1 stellar association at around 4 500 light years from earth tv geminorum is classified as a semi regular variable star meaning that its brightness changes are not predictable but do show some periodicity the general catalogue of variable stars does not list a period but the international variable star index gives an uncertain period of 229 days a detailed study of tv gem between 1997 and 2014 detects periods of 411 days and 3 137 days tv geminorum changes its size temperature and luminosity as its brightness varies the temperature changes between 3 500 k and 3 850 k the radius between and and the bolometric luminosity between and the majority of the electromagnetic radiation is emitted at wavelengths longer than the visual band being only around 20 000 times brighter than the sun at visual wavelengths the pulsations are not correlated with the brightness changes in the expected way other pulsating variables are brightest when they are hottest and smallest but tv gem does not follow this rule it has been

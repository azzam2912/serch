it consists of the multifunction vehicle bus mvb inside each vehicle and of the wire train bus wtb to connect the different vehicles the tcn components have been standardized in iec 61375 the tcn is used in most of the modern train control systems usually connecting the vehicles with an 18 pin uic 558 the wire train bus has been designed for international passenger trains with variable composition consisting of up to 22 vehicles the medium consists of a duplicated shielded twisted pair cable which runs in the uic cables between the vehicles the connector between the vehicles is the 18 pole uic connector since connectors are exposed and can oxidize a current pulse is applied at connection establishment to evaporate the oxide layer called fritting the standard connector for the wtb nodes is a din 9 pin connector the physical level uses rs 485 levels at 1 mbit s data rate the encoding uses a manchester ii code and a hdlc frame protocol with proper voltage balancing to avoid dc components in the galvanic isolation transformers the manchester decoder uses a phase quadrature demodulation not rs485 that operates with zero crossings which allows to span 750 m under worst

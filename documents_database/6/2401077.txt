800 600 bc it appears to coincide with and have been the cause of a phase of climate change at that time which involved a wetter western and drier eastern europe this had far reaching effects on human civilization some of which may be recorded in greek mythology and the old testament the homeric minimum is a persistent and deep solar minimum that took place between 2 800 and 2 550 years before present starting around 830 bc and resembling the sp rer minimum this minimum is sometimes considered to be part of a longer hallstattzeit solar minimum between 705 200 bc that also includes a second minimum between 460 and 260 bc the homeric minimum however also coincided with a geomagnetic excursion named etrussia sterno which may have altered the climate response to the homeric minimum variations in the solar output have effects on climate less through the usually quite small effects on insolation and more through the relatively large changes of uv radiation and potentially also indirectly through modulation of cosmic ray radiation the 11 year solar cycle measurably alters the behaviour of weather and atmosphere but decadal and centennial climate cycles are also attributed to solar variation

heat pumping is probably today one of the quickest and safest solutions to save energy and to reduce co emission most of air conditioned commercial buildings offer attractive retrofit opportunities because the retrofit of an existing building and even more the design of a new one should take all possibilities of heat pumping into consideration in such a way to make air conditioning as reversible as possible different techniques are already available but a recent survey of monitoring results established in germany made still appear a lot of faults lacks of optimisation and surprisingly low cop coefficient of performance after at least one year of operation it appears that the many mistakes would not have been discovered without monitoring it also appears that these mistakes and disappointing results are mainly due to a lack of good understanding of the dynamic behaviour of the systems at design stage a lack of simulation work a lack of instrumentation for satisfactory commissioning optimal control and fault detection the aim of this project is to promote the most efficient combinations of heating and cooling techniques in air conditioning these goals will be achieved by performing five different subtasks whose content is very briefly summarized

this theory was first stated by marshall sahlins at a symposium entitled man the hunter in 1966 1 he believes hunter gatherers were able to achieve much for their own societies and able to satisfy their own material needs at the time of the symposium new research by anthropologists such as richard b lee s work on the kung of southern africa was challenging popular notions that hunter gatherer societies were always near the brink of starvation and continuously engaged in a struggle for survival sahlins gathered the data from these studies and used it to support a comprehensive argument that states that hunter gatherers did not suffer from deprivation but instead lived in a society in which all the people s wants are easily satisfied the basis of sahlins argument is that hunter gatherer societies are able to achieve affluence by desiring little and meeting those needs desires with what is available to them this he calls the zen road to affluence which states that human material wants are finite and few and technical means unchanging but on the whole adequate sahlins original this he compares to the western way towards affluence which he terms as the galbraithean way

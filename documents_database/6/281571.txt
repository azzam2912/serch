confusingly the same term is also sometimes used for two center bipolar coordinates there is also a third system based on two poles biangular coordinates the term bipolar is further used on occasion to describe other curves having two singular points foci such as ellipses hyperbolas and cassini ovals however the term bipolar coordinates is reserved for the coordinates described here and never used for systems associated with those other curves such as elliptic coordinates the system is based on two foci f and f referring to the figure at right the coordinate of a point p equals the angle f p f and the coordinate equals the natural logarithm of the ratio of the distances d and d if in the cartesian system the foci are taken to lie at a 0 and a 0 the coordinates of the point p are the coordinate ranges from formula 3 for points close to f to formula 4 for points close to f the coordinate is only defined modulo 2 and is best taken to range from to by taking it as the negative of the acute angle f p f if p is in the lower half plane the equations

it rises to a depth of and is paired with a taller but overall smaller seamount to the east this seamount has a flat top and probably formed an island in the past it is about 7 8 million years old although a large earthquake recorded at its position in 1955 may indicate a recent eruption the seamount appears to be part of a long geological lineament with the neighbouring henderson and ducie islands as well as the southern tuamotus and line islands such a lineament may have been generated by a hotspot the nearby easter hotspot is a candidate hotspot the region lies between and around the islands of pitcairn and easter island there the east pacific rise is interrupted by a trapezoid microplate known as the easter microplate about wide seafloor spreading occurs at a rate of about there is a topographic swell that connects the two islands and continues eastward towards sala y gomez the origin of this swell and the various volcanoes and seamounts associated with it has been variously explained as either being due to a mantle plume which forms volcanoes that are then carried away through plate motion or by a hot line where

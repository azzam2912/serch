both are derived from donald knuth s metafont language and interpreter metapost produces vector graphic diagrams from a geometric algebraic description the language shares metafont s declarative syntax for manipulating lines curves points and geometric transformations however many of the limitations of metapost derive from features of metafont for instance metapost does not support all features of postscript most notably paths can have only one segment so that regions are simply connected and regions can be filled only with uniform colours postscript level 1 supports tiled patterns and postscript 3 supports gouraud shading metapost is distributed with many distributions of the tex and metafont framework for example it is included in the miktex and the tex live distributions the encapsulated postscript produced by metapost can be included in latex context and tex documents via standard graphics inclusion commands the encapsulated postscript output can also be used with the pdftex engine thus directly giving pdf this ability is implemented in context and in the latex graphics package and can be used from plain tex via the supp pdf tex macro file context and luatex supports the inclusion of metapost code within the input file inclusion of metapost code in latex is

the pcpd pump uses drilling fluid commonly referred to as drilling mud or just mud to create eccentric motion in the power section of the motor which is transferred as concentric power to the drill bit the mud motor uses different rotor and stator configurations to provide optimum performance for the desired drilling operation typically increasing the number of lobes and length of power assembly for greater horsepower in certain applications compressed air or other gas can be used for mud motor input power normal rotation of the bit while using a mud motor can be from 60 rpm to over 100 rpm based on the principle developed by rene moineau the theory states that a helical rotor with one or more lobes will rotate eccentrically when the stator contains more lobes than the rotor the flow of the fluid transmits power allowing the assembly to rotate and turn the bit normal mud motor construction consists of a top sub which connects the mud motor to the drill string the power section which consists of the rotor and stator the transmission section where the eccentric power from the rotor is transmitted as concentric power to the bit using a constant

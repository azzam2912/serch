due to its location this feature appears foreshortened when viewed from the earth limiting the amount of detail that can be observed the crater lies to the northwest of the similar sized walled plain k stner to the west of the mare smythii several satellite craters in the vicinity have since been given names by the iau nearly attached to the north northeastern rim of gilbert are the craters weierstrass gilbert n and van vleck gilbert m two somewhat similar formations in the northeastern part of gilbert s interior floor is the small bowl shaped geissler gilbert d gilbert is a somewhat degraded walled plain with an outer rim that has been somewhat reshaped by nearby impacts the southern rim has almost completely disintegrated and forms a rolling surface that flows toward the south as an extended depression the crater pair of weierstrass and van vleck have formed an indented rim along the northeast face while the northwest rim is overlain by gilbert s the interior floor is relatively level with some low ridges running down the center toward the southern end by convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the

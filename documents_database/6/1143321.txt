it is named after nikolai prilezhaev who first reported this reaction in 1909 a widely used peroxy acid for this reaction is meta chloroperoxybenzoic acid m cpba due to its stability and good solubility in most organic solvents an illustrative example is the epoxidation of trans 2 butene with m cpba to give trans 2 3 epoxybutane the reaction is highly stereospecific in the sense that the double bond stereochemistry is generally transferred to the relative configuration of the epoxide with essentially perfect fidelity so that a trans olefin leads to the stereoselective formation of the trans 2 3 substituted epoxide only as illustrated by the example above while a cis olefin would only give the cis epoxide this stereochemical outcome is a consequence of the accepted mechanism discussed below the reaction proceeds through what is commonly known as the butterfly mechanism first proposed by bartlett wherein the peracid is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded at the transition state although there are frontier orbital interactions in both directions the peracid is generally viewed as the electrophile and the alkene as the nucleophile in support of this notion more electron rich alkenes undergo epoxidation at a faster rate for example the relative rates

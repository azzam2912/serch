this species is often considered a synonym of miniopterus inflatus the holotype was collected in october 1926 by a m bailey it was described as a new species in 1936 by colin campbell sanborn it is similar in appearance to the natal long fingered bat but it is much larger its dorsal fur is light brown with the bases of individual hairs darker than their tips its ventral fur is lighter than the dorsal fur with individual hairs brown at the base and gray at the tip its forearm is long the greatest length of the skull is long it is known to be infected with the parasite polychromophilus melanipherus which helps support the hypothesis that haemosporidiasina transitioned from avian hosts to bat hosts in a single evolutionary event the 2016 study concluded that it was likely that malaria parasites affecting humans and rodents evolved from parasites affecting bats the african long fingered bat s evolutionary lineage diverged from other long fingered bats approximately 20 million years ago in 2013 an individual from this species tested positive for polyomaviruses however bats are unlikely to be the source of polyomavirus infection in humans as none of the lineages found in bats

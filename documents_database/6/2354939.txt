it was rereleased on sunnyside records in 2006 the allmusic review by david r adler stated guitarist ben monder packs this highly original album with a panoply of ideas the dreamlike voice of theo bleckmann gives the music an almost medieval spooky quality the compositions couldn t be more modern however excavation contains some of the most unique invigorating music released during the year 2000 on all about jazz phil dipietro said ben and crew literally unearth layer upon layer of harmonic invention from the tunes and progressions the listener must therefore prepare the ears for some heavy but certainly not burdensome lifting as well all in all another extremely strong release from an underrecognized innovative harmonic master and his henchmen that so fortunately for us all calls out for the next in jazztimes christopher porter wrote guitarist ben monder possesses such prodigious technique that songs can run away from him as he restlessly crams in every chordal variation and this is mostly a very good thing especially on excavation excavation is well worth digging all compositions by ben monder except where noted

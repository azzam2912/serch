according to j j thomson faraday usually discusses lines of force as chains of polarized particles in a dielectric yet sometimes faraday discusses them as having an existence all their own as in stretching across a vacuum in addition to lines of force j j thomson similar to maxwell also calls them tubes of electrostatic inductance or simply faraday tubes from the 20th century perspective lines of force are energy linkages embedded in a 19th century unified field theory that led to more mathematically and experimentally sophisticated concepts and theories including maxwell s equations electromagnetic waves and einstein s relativity lines of force originated with michael faraday whose theory holds that all of reality is made up of force itself his theory predicts that electricity light and gravity have finite propagation delays the theories and experimental data of later scientific figures such as maxwell hertz einstein and others are in agreement with the ramifications of faraday s theory nevertheless faraday s theory remains distinct unlike faraday maxwell and others e g j j thomson thought that light and electricity must propagate through an ether in einstein s relativity there is no ether yet the physical reality of force is much

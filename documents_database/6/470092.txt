some of the squares formed by the dots have numbers inside them the objective is to connect horizontally and vertically adjacent dots so that the lines form a simple loop with no loose ends in addition the number inside a square represents how many of its four sides are segments in the loop other types of planar graphs can be used in lieu of the standard grid with varying numbers of edges per vertex or vertices per polygon these patterns include snowflake penrose laves and altair tilings these add complexity by varying the number of possible paths from an intersection and or the number of sides to each polygon but similar rules apply to their solution whenever the number of lines around a cell matches the number in the cell the other potential lines must be eliminated this is usually indicated by marking an x on lines known to be empty another useful notation when solving slitherlink is a ninety degree arc between two adjacent lines to indicate that exactly one of the two must be filled a related notation is a double arc between adjacent lines indicating that both or neither of the two must be filled these notations

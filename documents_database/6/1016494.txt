the study of this radiation is essential to obtain precise information on the evolution of the universe density hubble constant age of the universe etc to achieve this goal measurements were done with devices cooled down at 100mk temperature placed at the focus of a warm telescope to avoid atmospheric disturbance the whole apparatus is placed on a gondola below a helium balloon that reaches 40 km altitude archeops has four bands in the millimeter domain 143 217 353 and 545 ghz with a high angular resolution about 15 arcminutes in order to constrain small anisotropy scales as well as a large sky coverage fraction 30 in order to minimize the intrinsic cosmic variance the instrument was designed by adapting concepts put forward for the high frequency instrument of planck surveyor planck hfi and using balloon borne constraints namely it consists of an open 3he 4he dilution cryostat cooling spiderweb type bolometers at 100 mk cold individual optics with horns at different temperature stages 0 1 1 6 10 k and an off axis gregorian telescope the cmb signal is measured by the 143 and 217 ghz detectors while interstellar dust emission and atmospheric emission are monitored with the 353

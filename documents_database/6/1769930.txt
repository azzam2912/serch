randolph diagrams were created by mathematician john f randolph in 1965 while he was teaching at the university of arkansas randolph diagrams can be interpreted most easily by defining each line as belonging to or relating to one logical statement or set any dot above the line indicates truth or inclusion and below the line indicates falsity or exclusion using this system one can represent any combination of sets or logical statements using intersecting lines though venn diagrams are more commonly used to represent combinations of sets randolph diagrams have the advantage of being able to cleanly represent combinations of more than 3 sets venn diagrams require either extension into higher spatial dimensions or the use of more complicated shapes while randolph diagrams evenly subdivide for every additional set here is a comparison between a venn diagram and r diagram for 5 sets or logical statements in his introductory paper on the subject cross examining propositional calculus and set operations randolph mentions that the first use of crosses and dots to represent logical relationships was introduced by w s mcculloch a neurophysiologist and randolph s contemporary randolph modified mcculloch s system with a new way of representing combinations and relationships

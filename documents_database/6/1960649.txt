it is useful in bioremediation for its ability to reductively dehalogenate chlorinated alkanes dehalogenimonas lykanthroporepellens cells are gram negative non motile irregular cocci that are 0 3 0 6 m in diameter there is no evidence of pathogenicity they are mesophiles that can grow in a temperature range of 20 34 c with their optimum temperature range being 28 34 c they grow best in ph 7 7 5 ph range 6 8 although it was isolated from groundwater of ph 5 1 growth has been observed in salt concentrations from 0 1 2 nacl with optimum growth at 1 gc content reported in characterization of d lykanthroporellens is 53 8 as determined by hplc however as determined by genomic analysis the gc content is 55 04 d lyankanthroporepellens does not form spores resistance to the antibiotics ampicillin and vancomycin has been observed d lykanthroporepellens is strictly anaerobic and uses hydrogen as an electron donor it has been cultured in an anaerobic basal medium at 30 c in the dark it is able to reductively dehalogenate aliphatic alkanes non aromatic alkanes such as 1 2 3 trichloropropane reduces it to allyl chloride which abiotically transforms in the presence of water

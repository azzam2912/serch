it can be used to prove fermat s theorem on sums of two squares by taking m to be a prime p that is 1 mod 4 and taking a to satisfy a 1 0 mod p such an a is guaranteed for p by wilson s theorem in general the solution whose existence is asserted by thue s lemma is not unique for example when there are usually several solutions providing that and are not too small therefore one may only hope unicity for the rational number to which is congruent modulo if y and m are coprime nevertheless this rational number needs not to be unique for example if and one has the two solutions however for and small enough if a solution exists it is unique more precisely with above notation if and with and then this result is the basis for rational reconstruction which allows using modular arithmetic for computing rational numbers for which one knows bounds for numerators and denominators the proof is rather easy by multiplying each congruence by the other and subtracting one gets the hypotheses imply that each term has an absolute value lower than and thus that the absolute value of

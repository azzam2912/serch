in this model the presence or absence of an atmosphere and therefore any greenhouse effect is irrelevant as the equilibrium temperature is calculated purely from a balance with incident stellar energy other authors use different names for this concept such as equivalent blackbody temperature of a planet or the effective radiation emission temperature of the planet planetary equilibrium temperature differs from the global mean temperature and surface air temperature which are measured observationally by satellites or surface based instruments and may be warmer than an equilibrium temperature due to greenhouse effects consider a planet orbiting its host star the star emits radiation isotropically and some fraction of this radiation reaches the planet the amount of radiation arriving at the planet is referred to as the incident solar radiation formula 1 the planet has an albedo that depends on the characteristics of its surface and atmosphere and therefore only absorbs a fraction of radiation the planet absorbs the radiation that isn t reflected by the albedo and heats up one may assume that the planet radiates energy like a blackbody at some temperature according to the stefan boltzmann law thermal equilibrium exists when the power supplied by the star is equal

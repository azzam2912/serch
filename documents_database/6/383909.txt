haploinsufficiency may arise from a de novo or inherited loss of function mutation in the variant allele such that it produces little or no gene product often a protein although the other standard allele still produces the standard amount of product the total product is insufficient to produce the standard phenotype this heterozygous genotype may result in a non or sub standard deleterious and or disease phenotype haploinsufficiency is the standard explanation for dominant deleterious alleles in the alternative case of haplosufficiency the loss of function allele behaves as above but the single standard allele in the heterozygous genotype produces sufficient gene product to produce the same standard phenotype as seen in the homozygote haplosufficiency accounts for the typical dominance of the standard allele over variant alleles where the phenotypic identity of genotypes heterozygous and homozygous for the allele defines it as dominant versus a variant phenotype produced by only by the genotype homozygous for the alternative allele which defines it as recessive haploinsufficiency can occur through a number of ways a mutation in the gene may have erased the production message one of the two copies of the gene may be missing due to a deletion the message or

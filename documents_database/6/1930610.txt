it occurs in different forms parabutoxin 1 pbtx1 parabutoxin 2 pbtx2 parabutoxin 3 pbtx3 and parabutoxin pbtx10 the different variants have different affinities towards kv 1 channels four different acidic peptides pbtx1 pbtx2 pbtx3 and pbtx10 have been isolated and cloned from the venoms of three different parabuthus scorpion species found in southern africa pbtx1 and pbtx3 were extracted from the venom of p transvaalicus pbtx2 from p villosus and pbtx10 has been purified from p granulatus scorpion toxins that target potassium channels have been classified into three k toxin kt subfamilies ktx ktx and ktx peptides the ktx subfamilies are the best studied toxins and are usually small basic short chain toxins pbtx1 pbtx2 and pbtx10 structurally belong to an unusually acidic ktx short chain scorpion toxins subfamily and are classified as ktx11 ktx11 1 pbtx1 ktx11 2 pbtx2 and ktx11 3 pbtx10 pbtx1 pbtx2 and pbtx10 toxins have extremely low pi values of 3 82 pbtx1 and pbtx2 and 3 88 pbtx10 the toxins are 36 37 amino acids in length and have six aligned cysteine residues usually binding sites of kv 1 blocking toxins kv1 1 kv1 2 kv1 3 include a lysine and a hydrophobic residue

it was originally designed for applications such as low cost crt terminals biomedical monitors control system displays and arcade or home video game consoles the chip was designed by al charpentier in 1977 but commodore could not find a market for the chip in 1979 mos technology began work on a video chip named mos technology 6564 intended for the toi computer and had also made some work on another chip mos 6562 intended for a color version of the commodore pet both of these chips failed due to memory timing constraints both required very fast and thus expensive sram making them unsuitable for mass production before finally starting to use the vic in the vic 20 chip designer robert yannes fed features from the 6562 a better sound generator and 6564 more colors back to the 6560 so before beginning mass production for the vic 20 it had been thoroughly revised its features include unlike many other video circuits of the era it does not offer dynamic ram refresh capabilities thus the vic 20 employed the more expensive static ram chips this is likely the reason why the machine was sold with just 5 kb of ram memory expansions

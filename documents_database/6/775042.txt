they are one of the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source as a fuel proteins provide as much energy density as carbohydrates 4 kcal 17 kj per gram in contrast lipids provide 9 kcal 37 kj per gram the most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition proteins are polymer chains made of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds during human digestion proteins are broken down in the stomach to smaller polypeptide chains via hydrochloric acid and protease actions this is crucial for the absorption of the essential amino acids that cannot be biosynthesized by the body there are nine essential amino acids which humans must obtain from their diet in order to prevent protein energy malnutrition and resulting death they are phenylalanine valine threonine tryptophan methionine leucine isoleucine lysine and histidine there has been debate as to whether there are 8 or 9 essential amino acids the consensus seems to lean towards 9 since histidine is not synthesized in adults there are five amino acids which humans are able to synthesize in the body these five are alanine aspartic acid asparagine glutamic

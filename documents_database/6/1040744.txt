with an apparent visual magnitude of 6 80 this star is a challenge to view with the naked eye even under ideal viewing conditions using the technique of gyrochronology which measures the age of a low mass star based on its rotation hd 53143 is about old depending on the source the stellar classification for this star is g9 v or k1v placing it near the borderline between g type and k type main sequence stars in either case it is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core this star is smaller than the sun with about 85 of the sun s radius it is emitting only 70 of the sun s luminosity the effective temperature of the star s outer envelope is cooler than the sun at 5 224 k giving it a golden orange hue based upon an excess of infrared emission a circumstellar debris disk has been found in this sysyem this disk is inclined at an angle of about 40 50 to the line of sight from the earth and it has an estimated mass of more than for comparison the mass of the moon is 7 3477 10 kg this is

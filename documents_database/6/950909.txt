another name used is j field the abbreviation cm was introduced by a number field k is a cm field if it is a quadratic extension k f where the base field f is totally real but k is totally imaginary i e every embedding of f into formula 1 lies entirely within formula 2 but there is no embedding of k into formula 2 in other words there is a subfield f of k such that k is generated over f by a single square root of an element say formula 4 in such a way that the minimal polynomial of over the rational number field formula 5 has all its roots non real complex numbers for this should be chosen totally negative so that for each embedding of formula 6 into the real number field complex conjugation on formula 1 induces an automorphism on the field which is independent of its embedding into formula 8 in the notation given it must change the sign of a number field k is a cm field if and only if it has a units defect i e if it contains a proper subfield f whose unit group has the same formula

they complement the gfp derivatives and homologues and are particularly characterized by their independence of molecular oxygen and their small size fbfps absorb blue light and emit light in the cyan green spectral range lov domains are a sub class of pas domains and were first identified in plants as part of phototropin which plays an essential role in the plant s growth towards light they noncovalently bind flavin mononucleotide fmn as coenzyme due to the bound fmn lov domains exhibit an intrinsic fluorescence which is however very weak upon illumination with blue light lov domains undergo a photocyle during which a covalent bond is formed between a conserved cysteine residue and the fmn this causes a conformational change in the protein that is necessary for signal propagation and also leads to the loss of fluorescence the covalent bond is energetically unfavorable and is cleaved with a protein specific time constant ranging from seconds to hours in order to make better use of the fluorescence properties of these proteins the natural photocycle of these lov domains was abolished by exchanging the conserved cysteine against an alanine on a genetic level thus upon blue light irradiation the protein remains in the

they may reduce cache pollution reduce bandwidth requirement bypass latencies by providing better control over the working set most cache control instructions do not affect the semantics of a program although some can several such instructions with variants are supported by several processor instruction set architectures such as arm mips powerpc and x86 also termed data cache block touch the effect is to request loading the cache line associated with a given address this is performed by the codice 1 instruction in the x86 instruction set some variants bypass higher levels of the cache hierarchy which is useful in a streaming context for data that is traversed once rather than held in the working set the prefetch should occur sufficiently far ahead in time to mitigate the latency of memory access for example in a loop traversing memory linearly the gnu compiler collection intrinsic function codice 2 can be used to invoke this in the programming languages c or c a variant of prefetch for the instruction cache this hint is used to prepare cache lines before overwriting the contents completely in this example the cpu needn t load anything from main memory the semantic effect is equivalent to an

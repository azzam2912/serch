it was discovered on 9 may 2010 by astronomers with the pan starrs 1 survey at the haleakala observatory hawaii in the united states according to american astronomer michael brown it is possibly a dwarf planet orbits the sun at a distance of 46 0 80 2 au once every 500 years and 11 months 182 969 days semi major axis of 63 07 au its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 27 and an inclination of 20 with respect to the ecliptic this distant minor planet is a trans neptunian object and a member of the scattered disc population scattered disc objects are thought to have been ejected from the classical kuiper belt into their current orbits by gravitational interactions with neptune and typically have highly eccentric orbits and perihelia of less than 38 au has also been considered a detached object since its relatively low eccentricity of 0 27 and its perihelion distance of 46 0 au are hard to reconcile with the celestial mechanics of a scattered disc object this has led to some uncertainty as to the current theoretical understanding of the outermost solar system the theories include close stellar passages unseen planet rogue planets planetary

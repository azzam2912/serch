the main idea of ecoforestry is to maintain or restore the forest to standards where the forest may still be harvested for products on a sustainable basis ecoforestry is forestry that emphasizes holistic practices which strive to protect and restore ecosystems rather than maximize economic productivity sustainability of the forest also comes with uncertainties there are other factors that may affect the forest furthermore than that of the harvesting there are internal conditions such as effects of soil compaction tree damage disease fire and blow down that also directly affect the ecosystem these factors have to be taken into account when determining the sustainability of a forest if these factors are added to the harvesting and production that comes out of the forest then the forest will become less likely to survive and will then become less sustainable since the forest is considered an ecosystem it is dependent on all of the living and non living factors within itself this is a major part of why the forest needs to be sustainable before it is harvested for example a tree by way of photosynthesis converts sunlight to sugars for respiration to keep the tree alive the remains of the converted

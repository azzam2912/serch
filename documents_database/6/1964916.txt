the elvis operator is a variant of the ternary conditional operator codice 4 in the sense that the expression with the elvis operator codice 5 is approximately equivalent to the expression with the ternary operator codice 6 some computer programming languages e g c have different semantics for the codice 7 operator instead of the first operand having to result in a boolean it must result in an object reference if the resulting object reference is not null it is returned otherwise the value of the second operand which may also be null is returned this distinction is necessary because in c references are not implicitly convertible to a boolean the name elvis operator refers to the fact that when its common notation codice 1 is viewed sideways it resembles an emoticon of elvis presley in a language that supports the elvis operator something like this will set codice 10 equal to the result of codice 11 if that result is a true value and to the result of codice 12 otherwise it is equivalent to this example using the except that it does not evaluate the codice 11 twice if it is true this code will result in a

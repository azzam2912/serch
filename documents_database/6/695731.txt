it was the earliest design of a pendulum clock since he was blind galileo described the device to his son who drew a sketch of it the son began construction of a prototype but both he and galileo died before it was completed galileo was the first to investigate the timekeeping properties of pendulums beginning around 1602 his interest was sparked by his discovery that at least for small swings the pendulum is isochronous its period of swing is the same for different size swings he realized that this property made the pendulum useful for timekeeping he also discovered that the pendulum s period is dependent on its length and independent of the mass of the pendulum bob he used freeswinging pendulums as timers in scientific experiments and for keeping time for music in 1637 when he was 73 galileo had the idea of a mechanism that would keep the pendulum swinging by giving it pushes an escapement thus allowing it to be applied to clocks since he was totally blind he described the mechanism to his son vincenzio who drew a picture from his description galileo s student and biographer vincenzo viviani describes the invention one day in 1641

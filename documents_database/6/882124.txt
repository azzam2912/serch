it bears a similar relationship to computer science and engineering as mathematical logic bears to mathematics and as philosophical logic bears to philosophy it is synonymous with logic in computer science the term computational logic came to prominence with the founding of the acm transactions on computational logic however the term was apparently introduced by j a robinson in a 1970 paper in the proceedings of the sixth annual machine intelligence workshop edinburgh 1970 entitled computational logic the unification computation machine intelligence 6 63 72 edinburgh university press 1971 the expression is used in the second paragraph with a footnote claiming that computational logic the emphasis is in the paper is surely a better phrase than theorem proving for the branch of artificial intelligence which deals with how to make machines do deduction efficiently this sounds like coining the term no reference to a previous use is mentioned in 1972 the metamathematics unit at the university of edinburgh was renamed the department of computational logic in the school of artificial intelligence the term was then used by robert s boyer and j strother moore who worked in the department in the early 1970s to describe their work on program verification

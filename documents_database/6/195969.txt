the solution in the case where the needle length is not greater than the width of the strips can be used to design a monte carlo method for approximating the number although that was not the original motivation for de buffon s question the problem in more mathematical terms is given a needle of length formula 1 dropped on a plane ruled with parallel lines t units apart what is the probability that the needle will lie across a line upon landing let x be the distance from the center of the needle to the closest parallel line and let be the acute angle between the needle and one of the parallel lines the uniform probability density function of x between 0 and t 2 is here x 0 represents a needle that is centered directly on a line and x t 2 represents a needle that is perfectly centered between two lines the uniform pdf assumes the needle is equally likely to fall anywhere in this range but could not fall outside of it the uniform probability density function of between 0 and 2 is here 0 radians represents a needle that is parallel to the marked lines and

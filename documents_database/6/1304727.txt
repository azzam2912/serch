it is a specialized form of extrusion that uses a spinneret to form multiple continuous filaments there are many types of spinning wet dry dry jet wet melt gel and electrospinning first the polymer being spun must be converted into a fluid state if the polymer is a thermoplastic then it can be simply melted otherwise it is dissolved in a solvent or chemically treated to form soluble or thermoplastic derivatives the molten polymer is then forced through the spinneret then it cools to a rubbery state and then a solidified state if a polymer solution is used then the solvent is removed after being forced through the spinneret wet spinning is the oldest of the five processes this process is used for polymers that need to be dissolved in a solvent to be spun the spinneret is submerged in a chemical bath that causes the fiber to precipitate and then solidify as it emerges the process gets its name from this wet bath acrylic rayon aramid modacrylic and spandex are produced via this process a variant of wet spinning is dry jet wet spinning where the solution is extruded into air and drawn and then submerged into a liquid

the galaxy is located at the distance of about 180 kpc kiloparsecs from the sun it is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy dsph meaning that it has an elongated shape with the half light radius of about 60 pc and ratio of the axis of about 5 3 pisces ii is one of the smallest and faintest satellites of the milky way its integrated luminosity is about 10 000 times that of the sun absolute magnitude of about 5 which corresponds to the luminosity of an average globular cluster the stellar population of pisces ii consists mainly of moderately old stars formed 10 12 billion years ago the metallicity of these old stars is low at which means that the percentage of their mass that consists of heavy metals is no more than of the corresponding percentage in the sun in 2016 follow up work on pegasus iii highlighted that both it and pisces ii lie relatively close to each other within approximately 43 kpc and share similar radial velocities in the galactic standard of rest frame note this is not the same as the lsr this suggests that these two satellite galaxies may actually be associated with one

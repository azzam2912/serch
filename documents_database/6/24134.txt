a few species are edible as famine foods after careful preparation to remove irritating chemicals the oldest systematic record of the plants was in 1692 when van rheede tot drakenstein published descriptions of two plants the name amorphophallus was first mentioned in 1834 by the dutch botanist blume between 1876 and 1911 engler merged a number of other genera into amorphophallus with a final monograph published in 1911 these are typical lowland plants growing in the tropical and subtropical zones of the paleotropics from west africa to the pacific islands none of them are found in the americas although a remarkably similar but not closely related genus dracontium has evolved there most species are endemic they grow preferentially on disturbed grounds such as secondary forests these small to massive plants grow from a subterranean tuber amorphophallus tubers vary greatly from species to species from the quite uniformly globose tuber of a konjac to the elongated tubers of a longituberosus and a macrorhizus to the bizarre clustered rootstock of a coaetaneus from the top of this tuber a single leaf which can be several metres across in larger species is produced atop a trunk like petiole followed on maturity by a

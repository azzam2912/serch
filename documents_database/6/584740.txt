faure s improvements greatly increased the capacity of such batteries and led directly to their manufacture on an industrial scale he was born at vizille and trained at the ecole des arts et m tiers at aix from 1874 until about 1880 he worked as a chemist at the new factory of the cotton powder company at uplees faversham kent england while there he and the factory manager george trench took out patents for tonite a new high explosive 1874 and an improved dynamite detonator 1878 in 1880 faure patented a method of coating lead plates with a paste of lead oxides sulphuric acid and water which was then cured by being gently warmed in a humid atmosphere the curing process caused the paste to change to a mixture of lead sulphates which adhered to the lead plate during charging the cured paste was converted into electrochemically active material the active mass and gave a substantial increase in capacity compared with plant s battery this was a significant breakthrough that led to the industrial manufacture of lead acid batteries as now used for starting motor cars towards the end of his life faure was granted further patents among them ones

this characteristic makes them naturally resistant to antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis like the beta lactam antibiotics they can be parasitic or saprotrophic several species are pathogenic in humans including m pneumoniae which is an important cause of walking pneumonia and other respiratory disorders and m genitalium which is believed to be involved in pelvic inflammatory diseases mycoplasma species are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered can survive without oxygen and come in various shapes for example m genitalium is flask shaped about 300 x 600 nm while m pneumoniae is more elongated about 100 x 1000 nm hundreds of mycoplasma species infect animals the term mycoplasma from the greek fungus and formed was first used by albert bernhard frank in 1889 to describe an altered state of plant cell cytoplasm resulting from infiltration by fungus like microorganisms julian nowak later proposed the genus name mycoplasma for certain filamentous microorganisms imagined to have both cellular and acellular stages in their lifecycles which could explain how they were visible with a microscope but passed through filters impermeable to other bacteria later the name for mycoplasma was pleuropneumonia like organisms pplo broadly referring to organisms similar in colonial morphology and filterability

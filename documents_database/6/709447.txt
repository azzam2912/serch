his swords were known for their great strength and their ability to cut through helmets however kotetsu s swords were often faked and they were so well faked that even kotetsu himself is said to have not been able to tell the difference when presented with a fake on one occasion he is reported to have said the blade is mine but the signature is not records exist which state that nagasone kotetsu only forged thirty one swords bearing the name there are however other records which directly dispute this with the nihont meikan showing 50 different mei or signatures for nagasone kotetsu additionally there are honomi records of sword polishers and master appraisers receiving mumei or unsigned blades from nagasone kotetsu and adding signature to them later after having completely substantiated the maker and provenance of the sword in question increasing this count even further this can also easily explain kotetsu s comment above where he said the blade is mine but the signature is not however the fact remains that kotetsu has been often faked over the past 350 years and so both the signatures as well as the style and quality of the blade should be judged

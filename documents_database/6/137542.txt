voltage division is the result of distributing the input voltage among the components of the divider a simple example of a voltage divider is two resistors connected in series with the input voltage applied across the resistor pair and the output voltage emerging from the connection between them resistor voltage dividers are commonly used to create reference voltages or to reduce the magnitude of a voltage so it can be measured and may also be used as signal attenuators at low frequencies for direct current and relatively low frequencies a voltage divider may be sufficiently accurate if made only of resistors where frequency response over a wide range is required such as in an oscilloscope probe a voltage divider may have capacitive elements added to compensate load capacitance in electric power transmission a capacitive voltage divider is used for measurement of high voltage a voltage divider referenced to ground is created by connecting two electrical impedances in series as shown in figure 1 the input voltage is applied across the series impedances z and z and the output is the voltage across z z and z may be composed of any combination of elements such as resistors inductors and capacitors

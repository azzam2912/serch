the etiologic agent is the larval development of botflies within the cuterebra or trypoderma genera which occurs obligatorily in rodents and lagomorphs respectively felines and canines serve as accidental hosts but research suggests only by trypoderma spp entrance into the body by first instar larvae occurs via mucous membranes of natural orifices or open wounds as opposed to direct dermic penetration in rabbits hares and lagomorphs clinical signs usually do not appear subcutaneous cysts warbles may present upon larval deposition out of the body at maturation three forms in which cuterebriasis may present in canines and felines definitive diagnosis can only occur with positive identification of the larvae this involves radiologic imaging preferably mri which can reveal larval migration tracks and in some cases the larvae themselves as well as surgical exploration during which larvae can be removed and examined for identification identification of exact species is often impossible as the instars of the various cuterebra and trychoderma spp exhibit significant resemblance but identification as a cuterebra botfly is sufficient for diagnosis as cuterebriasis typically a third larval instar is found and identifiable by its dark thick heavily spined body subcutaneous cysts may be surgically opened to remove less mature

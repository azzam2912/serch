where it differed in size from the 5mt was in its tender which was massively enlarged to carry large quantities of fuel and water to extend its operating range such a large tender would also have provided space for the locomotive carried parts of advanced signalling systems such as ertms the 5at s four axle tender would have had a gross weight of 80 tonnes with a fuel light oil capacity of 7 tonnes and water capacity of 46 tonnes 12 000 us gallons the 5at project was established in 2001 with the aim of commercializing wardale s 5at locomotive concept and bringing it to reality the project was spearheaded by a small team of professional engineers scientists and businessmen and women whose common purpose was to see steam traction continue in main line operation into the foreseeable future the first task undertaken by the project team was to commission david wardale to undertake the fundamental design calculations for the locomotive the purpose of these calculations was to verify through detailed calculations that the conceptual design was viable in engineering terms and that it would meet the performance predictions that wardale had made for it see below at the same

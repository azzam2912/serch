given a connected undirected graph and a set of query vertices in a graph the minimum wiener connector is an induced subgraph that connects the query vertices and minimizes the sum of shortest path distances among all pairs of vertices in the subgraph in combinatorial optimization the minimum wiener connector problem is the problem of finding the minimum wiener connector it can be thought of as a version of the classic steiner tree problem one of karp s 21 np complete problems where instead of minimizing the size of the tree the objective is to minimize the distances in the subgraph the minimum wiener connector was first presented by ruchansky et al in 2015 the minimum wiener connector has applications in many domains where there is a graph structure and an interest in learning about connections between sets of individuals for example given a set of patients infected with a viral disease which other patients should be checked to find the culprit or given a set of proteins of interest which other proteins participate in pathways with them the wiener index is the sum of shortest path distances in a sub graph using formula 1 to denote the shortest path

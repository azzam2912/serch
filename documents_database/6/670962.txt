the si unit of quantity of electricity is the coulomb the voltameter should not be confused with a voltmeter which measures electric potential the si unit for electric potential is the volt the voltameter is an electrolytic cell and the measurement is made by weighing the element deposited or released at the cathode in a specified time this is the most accurate type it consists of two silver plates in a solution of silver nitrate when current is flowing silver dissolves at the anode and is deposited at the cathode the cathode is initially massed current is passed for a measured time and the cathode is massed again this is similar to the silver voltameter but the anode and cathode are copper and the solution is copper sulfate acidified with sulfuric acid it is cheaper than the silver voltameter but slightly less accurate in this device mercury is used to determine the amount of charges transformed during the following reaction these oxidation reduction processes have 100 efficiency with the wide range of the current densities measuring of the quantity of electricity coulombs is based on the changes of the mass of the mercury electrode mass of the electrode can be

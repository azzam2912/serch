this lubricates the bearings allows the use of higher capacity fluid bearings and also assists in cooling the engine as well as its primary purpose for lubrication pressurized oil is increasingly used as a hydraulic fluid to power small actuators one of the first notable uses in this way was for hydraulic tappets in camshaft and valve actuation increasingly common recent uses may include the tensioner for a timing belt or variators for variable valve timing systems the type of pump used varies gear pumps trochoid pumps and vane pumps are all commonly used plunger pumps have been used in the past but these are now only used rarely for small engines to avoid the need for priming the pump is always mounted low down either submerged or around the level of the oil in the sump a short pick up pipe with a simple wire mesh strainer reaches to the bottom of the sump for simplicity and reliability mechanical pumps are used driven by mechanical geartrains from the crankshaft reducing pump speed is beneficial and so it is usual to drive the pump from the cam if this is mounted in the cylinder block or distributor shaft which turns

he was a professor at the university of uppsala from 1931 to 1962 his doctoral students include harald bergstr m nagell proved a conjecture of srinivasa ramanujan that there are only five numbers that are both triangular numbers and mersenne numbers they are the numbers 0 1 3 15 and 4095 the formula expressing the equality of a triangular number and a mersenne number can be simplified to the equivalent form which likewise has five solutions in natural numbers formula 2 and formula 3 with solutions for formula 4 in honor of nagell s solution this equation is called the ramanujan nagell equation the nagell lutz theorem is a result in the diophantine geometry of elliptic curves which describes rational torsion points on elliptic curves over the integers it was published independently by nagell and by lisabeth lutz nagell was appointed commander of the royal norwegian order of st olav in 1951 and of the swedish order of the polar star in 1952

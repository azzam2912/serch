dtella allows the creation of a file sharing intra net with decentralized communication between clients this lets clients on the same network share files without an internet connection avoiding internet bandwidth limitations dtella is pronounced dee tell uh and the name originates from the rough contraction of dc gnutella a p2p system that shares a similar network structure to dtella though dtella does not derive from it dtella originated at purdue from a need to share files on a network without being limited by purdue s bandwidth limit for residents of its residence halls and to avoid anti piracy take down notices dtella started as a client for dcgate which used a dc network linked via irc directory nodes dcgate originally provided purdue with irc based network transfers at about 1mb sec dtella grew into a decentralized system offering several improvements over the now deprecated dcgate project while dcgate featured main irc directory nodes dtella is decentralized making it harder to shut down dcgate translated between dc and irc protocols while dtella forms a p2p mesh network allowing it to not rely on irc or any other central node this additionally made it more adaptable to other universities and faster

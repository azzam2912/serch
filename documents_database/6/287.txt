an alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of a helium 4 atom which consists of two protons and two neutrons it has a charge of and a mass of for example uranium 238 decays to form thorium 234 alpha particles have a charge but as a nuclear equation describes a nuclear reaction without considering the electrons a convention that does not imply that the nuclei necessarily occur in neutral atoms the charge is not usually shown alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides theoretically it can occur only in nuclei somewhat heavier than nickel element 28 where the overall binding energy per nucleon is no longer a minimum and the nuclides are therefore unstable toward spontaneous fission type processes in practice this mode of decay has only been observed in nuclides considerably heavier than nickel with the lightest known alpha emitters being the lightest isotopes mass numbers 104 109 of tellurium element 52 exceptionally however beryllium 8 decays to two alpha particles alpha decay is by far the most common form of cluster decay where the parent atom ejects a defined daughter collection of nucleons leaving another defined product behind it is the most common form because of

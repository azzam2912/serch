for instance when we need to decide whether to invest and build a factory the construction cost might be more influential than the product price but once we have already built the factory the product price is definitely more influential to the revenue hence the implicit assumption 2 doesn t match this context the essence of this issue is that the standard tobit implicitly models a very strong link between the participation decision formula 13 or formula 14 and the amount decision the magnitude of formula 15 when formula 16 if a corner solution model is represented in a general form formula 17 where formula 18 is the participate decision and formula 19 is the amount decision standard tobit model assumes to make the model compatible with more contexts a natural improvement is to assume formula 23 where the error term formula 24 is distributed as a truncated normal distribution with a density as formula 25 formula 18 and formula 19 are independent conditional on formula 28 this is called truncated normal hurdle model which is proposed in cragg 1971 by adding one more parameter and detach the amount decision with the participation decision the model can fit more contexts

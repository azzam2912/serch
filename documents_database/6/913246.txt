the melting temperature t is defined as the temperature at which half of the dna strands are in the random coil or single stranded ssdna state t depends on the length of the dna molecule and its specific nucleotide sequence dna when in a state where its two strands are dissociated i e the dsdna molecule exists as two independent strands is referred to as having been denatured by the high temperature hybridization is the process of establishing a non covalent sequence specific interaction between two or more complementary strands of nucleic acids into a single complex which in the case of two strands is referred to as a duplex oligonucleotides dna or rna will bind to their complement under normal conditions so two perfectly complementary strands will bind to each other readily in order to reduce the diversity and obtain the most energetically preferred complexes a technique called annealing is used in laboratory practice however due to the different molecular geometries of the nucleotides a single inconsistency between the two strands will make binding between them less energetically favorable measuring the effects of base incompatibility by quantifying the temperature at which two strands anneal can provide information as to

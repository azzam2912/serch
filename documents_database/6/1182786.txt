unlike a diode it has an anti symmetric current voltage relationship and a symmetric capacitance voltage relationship as shown in the graph to the right the device was invented by erik kollberg together with anders rydberg in 1989 at chalmers university of technology the inset of the figure shows the circuit schematic symbol of the hbv from the symbol one can conclude that the hbv consists of two back to back anti serially connected rectifying diodes such as schottky diodes for instance the gap in the middle of the diode symbol represents the inherent capacitance of the device the electrical characteristics of the hbv are realized by separating two layers of a semiconductor material a with a layer of another semiconductor material b the band gap of material b should be larger than for material a this results in a barrier for the carriers trying to travel through the layers a b a the a layers are usually n doped which means that electrons are the majority carriers of this device at different bias voltages the carriers are redistributed and the distance between the carriers on each side of the barrier b is different as a consequence the hbv has

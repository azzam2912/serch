maup affects results when point based measures of spatial phenomena are aggregated into districts for example population density or illness rates the resulting summary values e g totals rates proportions densities are influenced by both the shape and scale of the aggregation unit for example census data may be aggregated into county districts census tracts postcode areas police precincts or any other arbitrary spatial partition thus the results of data aggregation are dependent on the mapmaker s choice of which modifiable areal unit to use in their analysis a census choropleth map calculating population density using state boundaries will yield radically different results than a map that calculates density based on county boundaries furthermore census district boundaries are also subject to change over time meaning the maup must be considered when comparing past data to current data the issue was first recognized by gehlke and biehl in 1934 and later described in detail in a famous article by openshaw 1984 and in the book by arbia 1988 in particular openshaw 1984 observed that the areal units zonal objects used in many geographical studies are arbitrary modifiable and subject to the whims and fancies of whoever is doing or did the

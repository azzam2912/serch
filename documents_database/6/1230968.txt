for example the supermarine spitfire is a conventional low wing cantilever monoplane of straight elliptical planform with moderate aspect ratio and slight dihedral many variations have been tried sometimes the distinction between them is blurred for example the wings of many modern combat aircraft may be described either as cropped compound deltas with forwards or backwards swept trailing edge or as sharply tapered swept wings with large leading edge root extensions or lerx some are therefore duplicated here under more than one heading this is particularly so for variable geometry and combined closed wing types most of the configurations described here have flown if only very briefly on full size aircraft a few significant theoretical designs are also notable note on terminology most fixed wing aircraft have left hand and right hand wings in a symmetrical arrangement strictly such a pair of wings is called a wing plane or just plane however in certain situations it is common to refer to a plane as a wing as in a biplane has two wings or to refer to the whole thing as a wing as in a biplane wing has two planes where the meaning is clear this article follows common

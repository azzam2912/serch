both of these topics are described in sections below the millennium problem requires the proposed yang mills theory to satisfy the wightman axioms or similarly stringent axioms there are four axioms quantum mechanics is described according to von neumann in particular the pure states are given by the rays i e the one dimensional subspaces of some separable complex hilbert space the wightman axioms require that the poincar group acts unitarily on the hilbert space in other words they have position dependent operators called quantum fields which form covariant representations of the poincar group the group of space time translations is commutative and so the operators can be simultaneously diagonalised the generators of these groups give us four self adjoint operators formula 3 j 1 2 3 which transform under the homogeneous group as a four vector called the energy momentum four vector the second part of the zeroth axiom of wightman is that the representation u a a fulfills the spectral condition that the simultaneous spectrum of energy momentum is contained in the forward cone the third part of the axiom is that there is a unique state represented by a ray in the hilbert space which is invariant

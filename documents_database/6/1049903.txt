this species can reach a length of sl juveniles move from saltwater to freshwater streams shortly before changes in the anatomy of their mouths make eating plankton impossible their dietary behaviour depends critically on the benthic algal cycle which is locked into the hydrological cycles of the island streams the species in its adult form is found in the upper parts of clear fast running mountain streams where there is clean gravel and rocks with no sedimentation allowing the growth of algae on rock surfaces it is found on all the hawaiian islands although it has become rare on o ahu the species is herbivorous feeding only on diatoms and filamentous algae and vigorously defending its feeding patch the fish cultivate gardens on the upper surfaces of stones and boulders here they encourage a short turf of diatoms filamentous algae and blue green algae the males guard these territorial gardens and they play a part in courtship the males display brilliant blue and red colours during the breeding season colours which change with the mood of the fish the females attach their eggs to rocks where they are fertilised by the males and the hatchlings are immediately washed downstream into

the effect can be seen in the drawing up of liquids between the hairs of a paint brush in a thin tube in porous materials such as paper and plaster in some non porous materials such as sand and liquefied carbon fiber or in a biological cell it occurs because of intermolecular forces between the liquid and surrounding solid surfaces if the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small then the combination of surface tension which is caused by cohesion within the liquid and adhesive forces between the liquid and container wall act to propel the liquid the first recorded observation of capillary action was by leonardo da vinci a former student of galileo was said to have investigated capillary action in 1660 capillary action was still a novelty to the irish chemist robert boyle when he reported that some inquisitive french men had observed that when a capillary tube was dipped into water the water would ascend to some height in the pipe boyle then reported an experiment in which he dipped a capillary tube into red wine and then subjected the tube to a partial vacuum he found that the vacuum had no observable influence on the height

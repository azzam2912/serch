sperner colorings have been used for effective computation of fixed points and in root finding algorithms and are applied in fair division cake cutting algorithms it is now believed to be an intractable computational problem to find a brouwer fixed point or equivalently a sperner coloring even in the plane in the general case the problem is ppad complete a complexity class invented by christos papadimitriou according to the soviet mathematical encyclopaedia ed i m vinogradov a related 1929 theorem of knaster borsuk and mazurkiewicz had also become known as the sperner lemma this point is discussed in the english translation ed m hazewinkel it is now commonly known as the knaster kuratowski mazurkiewicz lemma in one dimension sperner s lemma can be regarded as a discrete version of the intermediate value theorem in this case it essentially says that if a discrete function takes only the values 0 and 1 begins at the value 0 and ends at the value 1 then it must switch values an odd number of times the two dimensional case is the one referred to most frequently it is stated as follows given a triangle abc and a triangulation t of the triangle the

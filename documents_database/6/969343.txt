it facilitates raid5 functionality without the need of a hardware raid controller geom raid5 allows storage of large amounts of data to be protected against disk failure while providing good throughput performance like other freebsd storage modules geom raid5 utilizes the geom framework it is built as a kernel loadable module kld which allows it to run inside the freebsd kernel the module can be compiled on freebsd release 5 and newer releases geom raid5 is also incorporated into freenas an operating system dedicated to network attached storage its author arne woerner has released the software under the bsd license making geom raid5 osi compliant open source software geom raid5 distinguishes itself by providing both advanced features and high performance while the theoretical maximum write speed is 1 the latest version is able to achieve about 80 of that theoretical maximum this is in huge contrast with other software raid5 solutions which sometimes achieve less than 10 of that throughput combined with significantly higher cpu utilization the reason for this huge difference lies in geom raid5 s design in order to write data to a raid5 volume data must often first be read in order to calculate the parity information

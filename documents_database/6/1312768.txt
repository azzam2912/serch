transitional crust welds continental crust to oceanic crust along the lines of continental break up both vpm and nvpm form during rifting when a continent rifts to form a new ocean basin nvpm are different from vpm because of a lack of volcanism instead of intrusive magmatic structures the transitional crust is composed of stretched continental crust and exhumed upper mantle nvpm are typically submerged and buried beneath thick sediments so they must be studied using geophysical techniques or drilling nvpm have diagnostic seismic gravity and magnetic characteristics that can be used to distinguish them from vpm and for demarcating the transition between continental and oceanic crust nvpm are the result of rifting when a continent breaks up to form an ocean producing transitional crust without volcanism extension causes a number of events to occur first is lithospheric thinning which allows asthenospheric upwelling heating further erodes the lithosphere furthering the thinning process the extensional forces also cause listric faults and continentward dipping reflectors that help identify nvpm and distinguish them from vpm characterized by seaward dipping seismic reflectors the main difference between nvpm and vpm is that in the latter case the mantle is hot enough to melt and produce

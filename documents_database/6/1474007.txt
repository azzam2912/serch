agps contains a protein backbone of varied length 5 30 kda with n terminal secretory peptide followed by agp fasciclin fas domains and a c terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi lipid anchor site there are 85 predicted agps in arabidopsis with most of them containing a gpi plasma membrane anchor sequence that ties the extracellular agps to the plasma membrane and positions them to function as potential signaling molecules to date 18 different genes have been functionally characterized and many more involved with agp glycosylation are expected to be identified as research progresses agps are widely distributed in plants and typically comprise only 2 to 10 protein by weight the protein family has been earlier reported to contain o linked glycans whereas recent efforts employing mass spectrometry have revealed the presence of n linked glycans as well within this protein family isolated from elongating cotton fiber cells agps are implicated in various aspects of plant growth and development including root elongation somatic embryogenesis hormone responses xylem differentiation pollen tube growth and guidance programmed cell death cell expansion salt tolerance host pathogen interactions and cellular signaling agps contains protein backbone of varied lengths in some plant cells the length of the mature protein

unfortunately for the city of whyalla the main runway s pavement classification number pcn has deteriorated from 13 to the current pcn of 8 this has put a stop to all heavy aircraft such as the boeing 737 and airbus a320 using the airport although such aircraft never operated on a rpt regular passenger transport basis they were a fairly common sight at whyalla airport due to charters the airport remained open for use by the department of defence c 130 hercules transport aircraft until the late 1990s the city of whyalla aware of the accelerating damage caused by c 130 operations asked the federal government for financial assistance in upgrading the main runway to accommodate unrestricted c 130 operations the idea was for the airport to accommodate medium sized commercial jets as well as the royal australian air force raaf aircraft the government declined to offer the city of whyalla financial assistance to upgrade the main runway john smith then the mayor of whyalla immediately put a stop to all c 130 operations in whyalla causing the raaf to use either raaf woomera airfield or raaf base edinburgh to fly in troops and supplies for the nearby cultana training

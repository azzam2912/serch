reservation aloha and its parent scheme slotted aloha is a schema or rule set for the division of transmission resources over fixed time increments also known as slots if followed by all devices this scheme allows the channel s users to cooperatively utilize a shared transmission resource in this case it is the allocation of transmission time reservation aloha is an effort to improve the efficiency of slotted aloha the improvements with reservation aloha are markedly shorter delays and ability to efficiently support higher levels of utilization as a contrast of efficiency simulations have shown that reservation aloha exhibits less delay at 80 utilization than slotted aloha at 20 36 utilization the chief difference between slotted and reservation aloha is that with slotted aloha any slot is available for utilization without regards to prior usage under reservation aloha s contention based reservation schema the slot is temporarily considered owned by the station that successfully used it additionally reservation aloha simply stops sending data once the station has completed its transmission as a rule idle slots are considered available to all stations that may then implicitly reserve utilize the slot on a contention basis

in humans the dhfr enzyme is encoded by the dhfr gene it is found in the q11 q22 region of chromosome 5 bacterial species possess distinct dhfr enzymes based on their pattern of binding diaminoheterocyclic molecules but mammalian dhfrs are highly similar a central eight stranded beta pleated sheet makes up the main feature of the polypeptide backbone folding of dhfr seven of these strands are parallel and the eighth runs antiparallel four alpha helices connect successive beta strands residues 9 24 are termed met20 or loop 1 and along with other loops are part of the major subdomain that surround the active site the active site is situated in the n terminal half of the sequence which includes a conserved pro trp dipeptide the tryptophan has been shown to be involved in the binding of substrate by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase converts dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate a methyl group shuttle required for the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines thymidylic acid and certain amino acids while the functional dihydrofolate reductase gene has been mapped to chromosome 5 multiple intronless processed pseudogenes or dihydrofolate reductase like genes have been identified on separate chromosomes found in all organisms dhfr has a critical role

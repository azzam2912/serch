this is in contrast to single component superconductors where there is only one coherence length formula 2 and the superconductor is necessarily either type 1 formula 3 or type 2 formula 4 often a coherence length is defined with extra formula 5 factor with such a definition the corresponding inequalities are formula 6 and formula 7 when placed in magnetic field type 1 5 superconductors should form quantum vortices magnetic flux carrying excitations they allow magnetic field to pass through superconductors due to a vortex like circulation of superconducting particles electronic pairs in type 1 5 superconductors these vortices have long range attractive short range repulsive interaction as a consequence a type 1 5 superconductor in a magnetic field can form a phase separation into domains with expelled magnetic field and clusters of quantum vortices which are bound together by attractive intervortex forces the domains of the meissner state retain the two component superconductivity while in the vortex clusters one of the superconducting components is suppressed thus such materials should allow coexistence of various properties of type i and type ii superconductors animations from numerical calculations of vortex cluster formation are available at type i superconductors completely expel external magnetic

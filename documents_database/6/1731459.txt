the occurring problems from eppps are in parallel explained under environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcp the european union summarizes pharmaceutical residues with the potential of contamination of water and soil together with other micropollutants under priority substances pharmaceuticals comprise one of the few groups of chemicals that are specifically designed to act on living cells which presents a special risk when they enter persist and are dispersed into the environment with exception for downstream sewage treatment plants the concentration of pharmaceuticals in water is probably extremely low however the effect that the chronic exposure to environmental pharmaceuticals chemicals adds to the effects of other chemicals in the cocktail is still not studied the different chemicals might be potentiating synergistic effects 1 1 3 an extremely sensitive group in this respect are foetuses eppps are already found in water all over the world the diffuse exposure might contribute to in sweden the industry together with universities and health care sector has developed a method for environmental risk assessment and environmental classification of drugs environmental risk refers to the risk of toxicity to the aquatic environment it is based on the ratio between predicted environmental concentration of the

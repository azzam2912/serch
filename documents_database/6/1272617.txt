it was discovered by thorold gosset published in his 1900 paper he called it an 8 ic semi regular figure its coxeter symbol is 4 describing its bifurcating coxeter dynkin diagram with a single ring on the end of the 4 node sequences the rectified 4 is constructed by points at the mid edges of the 4 the birectified 4 is constructed by points at the triangle face centers of the 4 the trirectified 4 is constructed by points at the tetrahedral centers of the 4 and is the same as the rectified 1 these polytopes are part of a family of 255 2 1 convex uniform 8 polytopes made of uniform 7 polytope facets and vertex figures defined by all permutations of one or more rings in this coxeter dynkin diagram the 4 polytope has 17 280 7 simplex and 2 160 7 orthoplex facets and 240 vertices its vertex figure is the 3 polytope as its vertices represent the root vectors of the simple lie group e this polytope is sometimes referred to as the e root polytope the vertices of this polytope can also be obtained by taking the 240 integral octonions of norm 1 because the

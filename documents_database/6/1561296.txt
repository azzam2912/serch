the technique was developed for brain tissue but it is widely applicable for any biological samples a serial block face scanning electron microscope consists of an ultramicrotome mounted inside the vacuum chamber of a scanning electron microscope samples are prepared by methods similar to that in transmission electron microscopy tem typically by fixing the sample with aldehyde staining with heavy metals such as osmium and uranium then embedding in an epoxy resin the surface of the block of resin embedded sample is imaged by detection of back scattered electrons following imaging the ultramicrotome is used to cut a thin section typically around 30 nm from the face of the block after the section is cut the sample block is raised back to the focal plane and imaged again this sequence of sample imaging section cutting and block raising can acquire many thousands of images in perfect alignment in an automated fashion practical serial block face scanning electron microscopy was invented in 2004 by winfried denk at the max planck institute in heidelberg and is commercially available from gatan inc thermo fisher scientific volumescope and connectomx one of the first applications of serial block face scanning electron microscopy was to analyze

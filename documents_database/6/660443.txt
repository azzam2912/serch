there have been multiple anomalies described for example the left circumflex having an aberrant course from the right coronary artery the circumflex artery curves to the left around the heart within the coronary sulcus giving rise to one or more left marginal arteries also called obtuse marginal branches om as it curves toward the posterior surface of the heart it helps form the posterior left ventricular branch or posterolateral artery the circumflex artery ends at the point where it joins to form to the posterior interventricular artery in 15 of all cases which lies in the posterior interventricular sulcus in the other 85 of all cases the posterior interventricular artery comes out of the right coronary artery when the left circumflex supplies the posterior descending artery in those 15 of cases it is known as a left dominant circulation the lcx supplies the posterolateral left ventricle and the anterolateral papillary muscle it also supplies the sinoatrial nodal artery in 38 of people it supplies 15 25 of the left ventricle in right dominant systems if the coronary anatomy is left dominant the lcx supplies 40 50 of the left ventricle see coronary circulation for description of dominance

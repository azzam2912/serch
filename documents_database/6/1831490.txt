the time interval between each pair of consecutive counts follows the non exponential power law distribution with parameter formula 1 which has physical dimension formula 2 where formula 3 in other words fractional poisson process is non markov counting stochastic process that exhibits non exponential distribution of interarrival times the fractional poisson process is a continuous time process that can be thought of as natural generalization of the well known poisson process fractional poisson probability distribution is a new member of discrete probability distributions the fractional poisson process fractional compound poisson process and fractional poisson probability distribution function have been invented developed and encouraged for applications by nick laskin 2003 who coined the terms fractional poisson process fractional compound poisson process and fractional poisson probability distribution function the fractional poisson probability distribution captures the long memory effect which results in the non exponential waiting time probability distribution function empirically observed in complex classical and quantum systems thus fractional poisson process and fractional poisson probability distribution function can be considered as natural generalization of the famous poisson process and the poisson probability distribution the idea behind the fractional poisson process was to design counting process with non exponential waiting time probability

g pekinensis was named and described by heckert et al 2015 on the basis of ten rows of bony plates called osteoderms representing the front part of an armored carapace that would have covered the back of the animal these plates were found embedded in sandstone and conglomerate boulders near a brick quarry in chatham county north carolina which likely originated from the late triassic pekin formation the pekin formation consists of interbedded red mudstones siltstones sandstones and conglomerates it was the fine grained mudstones and siltstones that the mining operation was targeting for brick making so coarser grained blocks were removed from the pit gorgetosuchus was part of a diverse faunal community in a continental rift valley system during the late triassic which also included traversodontids phytosaurs dicynodonts and temnospondyls gorgetosuchus coexisted with two other aetosaurs lucasuchus and coahomasuchus gorgetosuchus is unique among aetosaurs in having cervical neck osteoderms that nearly wrap around the entire neck and are strongly angled to give the neck a hexagonal shape in cross section the lateral side and paramedian upper osteoderms each bear prominent spines other aetosaurs such as longosuchus also have neck spines but only on the lateral osteoderms the cervical osteoderms

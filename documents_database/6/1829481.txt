it consists of two structural genes guab encodes for imp dehydrogenase or impdh and guaa encodes for gmp synthetase apart from the promoter and operator region the first committed step of purine biosynthesis starts from 5 phosphoribosyl 1 pyrophosphate prpp this undergoes a series of reactions to form imp an important branch point in the pathway the pathway then branches to form adenylosuccinate and then adenylate amp in one branch and xanthylate xmp and then guanylate gmp in the other branch imp dehydrogenase catalyses the conversion of imp to xmp and gmp synthetase catalyses the conversion of xmp to gmp the operon must respond to changes in the metabolic state of the cell it is subject to growth rate dependent control stringent control control during the various stresses the cell is exposed to and other forms of control hence it stops biosynthesis if guanine can be obtained from the external medium increases its expression if nucleotides are needed for example during dna replication and balances the production of gmp with respect to amp and the pyrimidine nucleotides the branch point at imp mentioned above is tightly controlled rigid node so as to have a balanced production of amp and gmp

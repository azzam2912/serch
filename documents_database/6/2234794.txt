it is dimly visible to the naked eye under good viewing conditions having an apparent visual magnitude of 5 89 based upon an annual parallax shift of 24 71 it is located 132 light years away the system is moving closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of 14 km s radial velocity measurements taken at the dominion astrophysical observatory in victoria british columbia canada in 1919 led to the determination by william edmund harper that hr 7484 is a double lined spectroscopic binary it is a detached eclipsing binary which means the orbital plane is aligned close to the line of sight from the earth causing the components to eclipse twice per orbit the system is undergoing apsidal motion with a rate greater than that predicted by general relativity both components are ordinary f type main sequence stars with similar physical properties the star normally has an apparent magnitude of 5 89 but every 7 64 days 7 days 15 hours and 22 minutes its brightness decreases to magnitude 6 37 approximately two thirds as bright five days and 17 hours after each primary eclipse there is a secondary eclipse when the brightness drops to magnitude 6 06 about 85

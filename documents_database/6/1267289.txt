this is the expected value to one of the players when both play a perfect strategy which is to choose from a particular pdf this article gives an example of a zero sum game that has no value it is due to sion and wolfe zero sum games with a finite number of pure strategies are known to have a minimax value originally proved by john von neumann but this is not necessarily the case if the game has an infinite set of strategies there follows a simple example of a game with no minimax value the existence of such zero sum games is interesting because many of the results of game theory become inapplicable if there is no minimax value players i and ii each choose a number formula 1 and formula 2 respectively with formula 3 the payoff to i is i e player ii pays formula 5 to player i the game is zero sum sometimes player i is referred to as the maximizing player and player ii the minimizing player if formula 6 is interpreted as a point on the unit square the figure shows the payoff to player i now suppose that player i adopts

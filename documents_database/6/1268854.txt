typically metals are heated to between to increase their malleability and aid flow in the forging die induction heating is a non contact process which uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to produce heat in a workpiece by placing a conductive material into a strong alternating magnetic field electric current is made to flow in the material thereby causing joule heating in magnetic materials further heat is generated below the curie point due to hysteresis losses the generated current is predominantly in the surface layer the depth of this layer being dictated by the frequency of the alternating field and the permeability of the material power supplies for induction forging vary in power from a few kilowatts to many megawatts and depending on the component geometry can vary in frequency from 50 hz to 200 khz the majority of applications use the range between 1 khz and 100 khz in order to select the correct power it is necessary to first calculate the thermal energy required to raise the material to the required temperature in the time allotted this can be done using the heat content of the material which is normal expressed in kw hours per tonne the weight

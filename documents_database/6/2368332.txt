this form of shoulder replacement is utilized in situations in which conventional shoulder replacement surgery would lead to poor outcomes and high failure rates originally considered a salvage procedure the combination of improved design features and excellent clinical outcome data has led to reverse shoulder replacement largely replacing shoulder hemiarthroplasty for most indications and even challenging conventional anatomic shoulder replacement in many countries as the most commonly performed shoulder replacement procedure historically the primary indication to perform reverse shoulder replacement was cuff tear arthropathy which consists of advanced glenohumeral arthritis in the presence of a massive rotator cuff tear as reverse shoulder replacement has become more popular the indications have expanded to include shoulder pseudoparalysis due to massive rotator cuff tears shoulder fractures severe bone loss on the scapula or humerus precluding the use of standard implants and failed prior shoulder replacement procedures the procedure is performed through a deltopectoral approach in which the space between the deltoid muscle and pectoralis major muscle is developed the subscapularis muscle one of the four muscles of the rotator cuff is typically detached to perform the operation the native humerus and scapula bones are prepared using precise machining to accommodate their respective implants

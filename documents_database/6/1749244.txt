the theory of functions of several complex variables has a different character mainly because analytic functions of several variables are not conformal conformal maps can be defined between euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimension but when the dimension is greater than 2 this class of maps is very small it consists of m bius transformations only this is a theorem of joseph liouville relaxing the smoothness assumptions does not help as proved by yurii reshetnyak this suggests the search of a generalization of the property of conformality which would give a rich and interesting class of maps in higher dimension a differentiable map f of a region d in r to r is called k quasiregular if the following inequality holds at all points in d here k 1 is a constant j is the jacobian determinant df is the derivative that is the linear map defined by the jacobi matrix and is the usual euclidean norm of the matrix the development of the theory of such maps showed that it is unreasonable to restrict oneself to differentiable maps in the classical sense and that the correct class of maps consists of continuous maps in the sobolev space w whose partial

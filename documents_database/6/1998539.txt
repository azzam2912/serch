while lenin wished for a revolutionary organisation akin to the contemporary social democratic party of germany which was open to the public and more democratic in organisation the russian autocracy prevented this leninists argue that lenin s ideal vanguard party would be one where membership is completely open the members of the party are they who accept the principles of the party programme and render the party all possible support this party could in theory be completely transparent the entire political arena is as open to the public view as is a theatre stage to the audience a party that supposedly implemented democracy to such an extent that the general control in the literal sense of the term exercised over every act of a party man in the political field brings into existence an automatically operating mechanism which produces what in biology is called the survival of the fittest this party would be completely open to the public eye as it conducted its business which would mainly consist of educating the proletariat to remove the false consciousness that had been instilled in them in its first phase the vanguard party would exist for two reasons firstly it would protect marxism

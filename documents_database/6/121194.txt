fsh is synthesized and secreted by the gonadotropic cells of the anterior pituitary gland and regulates the development growth pubertal maturation and reproductive processes of the body fsh and luteinizing hormone lh work together in the reproductive system fsh is a 35 5 kda glycoprotein heterodimer consisting of two polypeptide units alpha and beta its structure is similar to those of luteinizing hormone lh thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and human chorionic gonadotropin hcg the alpha subunits of the glycoproteins lh fsh tsh and hcg are identical and consist of 96 amino acids while the beta subunits vary both subunits are required for biological activity fsh has a beta subunit of 111 amino acids fsh which confers its specific biologic action and is responsible for interaction with the follicle stimulating hormone receptor the sugar portion of the hormone is covalently bonded to asparagine and is composed of n acetylgalactosamine mannose n acetylglucosamine galactose and sialic acid in humans the gene for the alpha subunit is located at cytogenetic location 6q14 3 it is expressed in two cell types most notably the basophils of the anterior pituitary the gene for the fsh beta subunit is located on chromosome 11p13 and is expressed

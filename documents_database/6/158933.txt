the lines on a predominance diagram indicate where adjacent species have the same concentration either side of such a line one species or the other predominates that is has higher concentration relative to the other species to illustrate a predominance diagram part of the one for chromate is shown at the right pcr stands for minus the logarithm of the chromium concentration and ph stands for minus the logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration there are two independent equilibria with equilibrium constants defined as follows a third equilibrium constant can be derived from k and k the species hcro and are only formed at very low ph so they do not appear on this diagram published values for log k and log k are 5 89 and 2 05 respectively using these values and the equality conditions the concentrations of the three species chromate hydrogen chromate and dichromate can be calculated for various values of ph by means of the equilibrium expressions the chromium concentration is calculated as the sum of the species concentrations in terms of chromium content the three species all have concentrations equal to at ph p k for which cr the three lines on this diagram

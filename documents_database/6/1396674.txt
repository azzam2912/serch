the hydrolysis is generally the result of the enzymatic action of phospholipase a2 among other properties they activate endothelial cells during early atherosclerosis and stimulate phagocyte recruitment when released by apoptotic cells moreover lpcs can be used in the lab to cause demyelination of brain slices to mimic the effects of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis further they are known to stimulate phagocytosis of the myelin sheath and can change the surface properties of erythrocytes lpc induced demyelination is thought to occur through the actions of recruited macrophages and microglia which phagocytose nearby myelin invading t cells are also thought to mediate this process bacteria such as legionella pneumophila utilize phospholipase a2 end products fatty acids and lysophospholipids to cause host cell macrophage apoptosis through cytochrome c release lpcs are present as minor phospholipids in the cell membrane 3 and in the blood plasma 8 12 since lpcs are quickly metabolized by lysophospholipase and lpc acyltransferase they last only shortly in vivo by replacing the acyl group within the lpc with an alkyl group alkyl lysophospholipids alp were synthesized these lpc analogues are metabolically stable and several such as edelfosine miltefosine and perifosine are under research and development as

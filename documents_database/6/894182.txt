they are typically used in grit chambers equalization basins chlorine contact tanks and aerobic digesters and sometimes also in aeration tanks generally they are better at vertically pumping water than at mass transfer of oxygen coarse bubble diffusers typically provide half the mass transfer of oxygen as compared to fine bubble diffusers given the same air volume often in non newtonian or pseudoplastic fluids such as a digester with high solids concentration it does make sense to use coarse bubble diffusers rather than fine bubble diffusers due to the larger bubbles ability to shear through more viscous wastewater however over the past two decades coarse bubble diffusers have been used less frequently primarily due to the ever increasing cost of energy and the availability of more reliable highly efficient fine bubble diffusers manufacturers of diffused aeration systems claim that converting from coarse bubble to fine bubble system should yield a 50 percent energy cost savings specifically in aeration tanks a system that utilizes coarse bubble diffusers requires 30 to 40 percent more process air than a fine bubble diffused air system to provide the same level of treatment the exception would be in secondary treatment or side processing phases in

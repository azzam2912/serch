alternating current electric motors and transformers may draw several times their normal full load current when first energized for a few cycles of the input waveform power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents due to the charging current of the input capacitance the selection of over current protection devices such as fuses and circuit breakers is made more complicated when high inrush currents must be tolerated the over current protection must react quickly to overload or short circuit faults but must not interrupt the circuit when the usually harmless inrush current flows a discharged or partially charged capacitor appears as a short circuit to the source when the source voltage is higher than the potential of the capacitor a fully discharged capacitor will take approximately 5 rc time cycles to fully charge during the charging portion of the cycle instantaneous current can exceed load current by a substantial multiple instantaneous current declines to load current as the capacitor reaches full charge in the case of open circuit the capacitor will be charged to the peak ac voltage one cannot actually charge a capacitor with ac line power this refers to unidirectional alternating voltage

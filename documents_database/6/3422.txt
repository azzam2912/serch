this contrasts with spark ignition engines such as a petrol engine gasoline engine or gas engine using a gaseous fuel as opposed to petrol which use a spark plug to ignite an air fuel mixture diesel engines work by compressing only the air this increases the air temperature inside the cylinder to such a high degree that atomised diesel fuel injected into the combustion chamber ignites spontaneously with the fuel being injected into the air just before combustion the dispersion of the fuel is uneven this is called a heterogeneous air fuel mixture the torque a diesel engine produces is controlled by manipulating the air ratio instead of throttling the intake air the diesel engine relies on altering the amount of fuel that is injected and the air ratio is usually high the diesel engine has the highest thermal efficiency engine efficiency of any practical internal or external combustion engine due to its very high expansion ratio and inherent lean burn which enables heat dissipation by the excess air a small efficiency loss is also avoided compared to two stroke non direct injection gasoline engines since unburned fuel is not present at valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly

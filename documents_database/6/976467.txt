schoenberg s music was not as well received as it had been in previous years also two years before the composition of the piece mathilde schoenberg s wife had an affair with the painter richard gerstl and although she returned to schoenberg this had a lasting effect on their relationship the drama represents an inescapable cycle of man s plight as it starts and finishes with the male character struggling with the monster on his back the male character sings about his love for a young woman mime but despite this love she leaves him for a well dressed gentleman mime he senses that she has left him and eventually when she returns he forgives her and his happiness returns again the woman retreats the woman is seen later with the gentleman and the male soloist implores the woman to stay with him but she escapes and kicks a rock at him this rock turns into the monster that was originally seen on the man s back thus the drama ends where it began the score calls for piccolo three flutes 3rd doubling on 2nd piccolo three oboes english horn d clarinet three clarinets in b flat and a bass

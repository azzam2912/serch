it converts an input laser wave called pump with frequency formula 1 into two output waves of lower frequency formula 2 by means of second order nonlinear optical interaction the sum of the output waves frequencies is equal to the input wave frequency formula 3 for historical reasons the two output waves are called signal and idler where the output wave with higher frequency is the signal a special case is the degenerate opo when the output frequency is one half the pump frequency formula 4 which can result in half harmonic generation when signal and idler have the same polarization the first optical parametric oscillator was demonstrated by joseph a giordmaine and robert c miller in 1965 five years after the invention of the laser at bell labs optical parametric oscillators are used as coherent light sources for various scientific purposes and to generate squeezed light for quantum mechanics research a soviet report was also published in 1965 the opo consists essentially of an optical resonator and a nonlinear optical crystal the optical resonator serves to resonate at least one of signal and idler waves in the nonlinear optical crystal the pump signal and idler waves overlap the interaction

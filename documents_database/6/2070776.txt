organisms in both genera share characteristics in addition to being oxygenic phototrophs they are both unicellular forming aggregates but not found in mucilaginous colonies they may have a thin mucilage layer around each cell both genera also divide by binary fission along an axis perpendicular to the cell s longitudinal axis a handful of characteristics distinguish the two genera while synechococcus species are usually cylindrical cyanothece species are normally oval and longer than 3 m cyanothece s outer cell wall layer is relatively thick and contains spherical glassy vesicles whose function has yet to be defined cyanothece s nucleoids are spread loosely throughout the cell with a net like appearance instead of concentric thylakoid membranes that share a center or axis cyanothece s exhibit short wavy and radially arranged all cyanothece had nitrogenase activity at one time although some strains have lost the necessary genes during nitrogen fixing conditions cyanothece creates inclusion storage bodies under the control of a circadian rhythm between 2 5 and 3 0 billion years ago cyanobacteria started using the energy from light to split water releasing oxygen into the anaerobic reducing environment parts of this ancient cyanobacterial metabolism are still maintained today bandyopadhyay et al

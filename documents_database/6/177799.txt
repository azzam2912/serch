minisatellites occur at more than 1 000 locations in the human genome and they are notable for their high mutation rate and high diversity in the population minisatellites are prominent in the centromeres and telomeres of chromosomes the latter protecting the chromosomes from damage the name satellite refers to the early observation that centrifugation of genomic dna in a test tube separates a prominent layer of bulk dna from accompanying satellite layers of repetitive dna minisatellites are small sequences of dna that do not encode proteins but appear throughout the genome hundreds of times with many repeated copies lying next to each other minisatellites and their shorter cousins the microsatellites together are classified as vntr variable number of tandem repeats dna confusingly minisatellites are often referred to as vntrs and microsatellites are often referred to as short tandem repeats strs or simple sequence repeats ssrs minisatellites consist of repetitive generally gc rich motifs that range in length from 10 to over 100 base pairs these variant repeats are tandemly intermingled some minisatellites contain a central sequence or core unit of nucleobases gggcaggang where n can be any base or more generally consist of sequence motifs of purines adenine a and

the first number in the model series designation refers to the number of cylinders and the second 71 the nominal displacement per cylinder in cubic inches a rounding off of inline models included one two three four and six cylinders and the v types six eight 12 16 and 24 cylinders the two largest v units used multiple cylinder heads per bank to keep the head size and weight to manageable proportions the v 16 using four heads from the four cylinder inline model and the v 24 using four heads from the inline six cylinder model this feature also assisted in keeping down the overall cost of these large engines by maintaining parts commonality with the smaller models the inline six cylinder 71 series engine was introduced as the initial flagship product of the detroit diesel engine division of general motors in 1938 the v type first appeared in 1957 sales of the 71 series ceased in the summer of 1995 with the four stroke detroit diesel engine introduced as a replacement bore and stroke are the same across all units at inline models were famously symmetrical meaning that blower exhaust water manifold starter and other components could be

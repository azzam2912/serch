for example the proteins from halobacteria include bacteriorhodopsin and archaerhodopsin which are light driven proton pumps halorhodopsin a light driven chloride pump and sensory rhodopsin which mediates both photoattractant in the red and photophobic in the ultra violet responses proteins from other bacteria include proteorhodopsin contrary to their name microbial rhodopsins are found not only in archaea and bacteria but also in eukaryota such as algae and viruses although they are rare in complex multicellular organisms rhodopsin was originally a synonym for visual purple a visual pigment light sensitive molecule found in the retinas of frogs and other vertebrates used for dim light vision and usually found in rod cells this is still the meaning of rhodopsin in the narrow sense any protein evolutionarily homologous to this protein in a broad non genetic sense rhodopsin refers to any molecule whether related by genetic descent or not mostly not consisting of an opsin and a chromophore generally a variant of retinal all animal rhodopsins arose by gene duplication and divergence late in the history of the large g protein coupled receptor gpcr gene family which itself arose after the divergence of plants fungi choanflagellates and sponges from the earliest animals the

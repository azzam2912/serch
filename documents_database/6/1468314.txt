it first came to widespread attention among archaeologists with the publication of christopher tilley s a phenomenology of landscape 1994 in which he suggested it to be a useful technique that can be used to discover more about historical peoples and how they interact with the landscapes in which they live he argued that simply by looking at two dimensional depictions of a landscape such as on a map archaeologists fail to understand how peoples living in hunter gatherer and agricultural societies actually relate to those areas he believed therefore that investigators should enter the very landscape that they are studying and use their senses of sight smell and hearing to learn more about how historical peoples would have interpreted it phenomenology has provoked considerable discussion within the discipline receiving considerable criticism from the archaeological community who deem it to be unscientific and subjective in contrast to this it has also been supported by a great number of archaeologists and nowadays is often used in fieldwork alongside other more traditional methods it has been used particularly in understanding prehistoric sites such as the neolithic tavoliere plain in italy and the bronze age landscape on bodmin moor england

nirenberg and philip leder the experiment elucidated the triplet nature of the genetic code and allowed the remaining ambiguous codons in the genetic code to be deciphered in this experiment using a ribosome binding assay called the triplet binding assay various combinations of mrna were passed through a filter which contained ribosomes unique triplets promoted the binding of specific trnas to the ribosome by associating the trna with its specific amino acid it was possible to determine the triplet mrna sequence that coded for each amino acid oswald avery discovered that the substance responsible for producing inheritable change in the disease causing bacteria was neither a protein nor a lipid rather deoxyribonucleic acid dna he and his colleagues colin macleod and maclyn mccarty suggested that dna was responsible for transferring genetic information later erwin chargaff discovered that the makeup of dna differs from one species to another these experiments helped pave the way for the discovery of the structure of dna in 1953 with the help of maurice wilkins and rosalind franklin s x ray crystallography james watson and francis crick proposed dna is structured as a double helix in the 1960s one main dna mystery scientists needed to figure

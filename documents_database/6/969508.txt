the density molar mass and the critical temperature of the liquid have to be known at the critical point the surface tension is zero the first assumption of the e tv s rule is 1 the surface tension is a linear function of the temperature the e tv s rule also gives a relation of the surface tension behaviour of different liquids in respect to each other 2 the temperature dependence of the surface tension can be plotted for all liquids in a way that the data collapses to a single master curve to do so either the molar mass the density or the molar volume of the corresponding liquid has to be known if v is the molar volume and t the critical temperature of a liquid the surface tension is given by where k is a constant valid for all liquids the e tv s constant has a value of 2 1 10 j k mol more precise values can be gained when considering that the line normally passes the temperature axis 6 k before the critical point the molar volume v is given by the molar mass m and the density the term formula 4 is also

power chords are commonly played on amplified guitars especially on electric guitar with distortion power chords are a key element of many styles of rock and especially in heavy metal and punk rock when two or more notes are played through a distortion process that non linearly transforms the audio signal additional partials are generated at the sums and differences of the frequencies of the harmonics of those notes intermodulation distortion when a typical chord containing such intervals for example a major or minor chord is played through distortion the number of different frequencies generated and the complex ratios between them can make the resulting sound messy and indistinct this effect is accentuated as most guitars are tuned based on equal temperament with the result that minor thirds are narrower and major thirds wider than they would be in just intonation however in a power chord the ratio between the frequencies of the root and fifth are very close to the just interval 3 2 when played through distortion the intermodulation leads to the production of partials closely related in frequency to the harmonics of the original two notes producing a more coherent sound the intermodulation makes the spectrum of

air bags polystyrene pellets and magnetic or mechanical brakes are sometimes used to arrest the fall of the experimental payload in other cases high speed impact with a substrate at the bottom of the tower is an intentional part of the experimental protocol not all such facilities are towers nasa glenn s zero gravity research facility is based on a vertical shaft extending to below ground level for a typical materials science experiment a sample of the material under study is loaded into the top of the drop tube which is filled with inert gas or evacuated to create a low pressure environment following any desired preprocessing e g induction heating to melt a metal alloy the sample is released to fall to the bottom of the tube during its flight or upon impact the sample can be characterized with instruments such as cameras and pyrometers drop towers are also commonly used in combustion research for this work oxygen must be present and the payload may be enclosed in a drag shield to isolate it from high speed wind as the apparatus accelerates toward the bottom of the tower see a video of a microgravity combustion experiment in the nasa

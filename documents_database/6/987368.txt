the idea is that when one directs signals left and right with the pan pot the perceived loudness will stay the same regardless of latitude however both the direction of attenuation throughout the panoramic sweep and the amount by which the signal is attenuated vary according to pan rule for example the yamaha digital consoles employ a typical compromise 3 db pan rule however the signal is at full level at 12 00 and becomes progressively louder up to 3 db as it is panned to the right or left the 3 db pan rule is a commonly applied compromise to comply with the mediocre acoustic summing capabilities of most control rooms however the console manufacturer ssl used to employ a 4 5 db pan rule because it was believed that their expensive consoles would normally be used in tuned rooms that had acoustic summing capabilities closer to the ideal many consoles that have only one pan rule employ one such that a signal panned hard left or right is at full level and becomes progressively lower in level as the pan is directed to the center according to mastering engineer glenn meadows the kinoshita hidley rooms at masterfonics nashville

major focuses include geochronology comparative geology and petrology in general a stratum will be primarily igneous or sedimentary relating to how the rock was formed sedimentary layers are laid down by deposition of sediment associated with weathering processes decaying organic matters biogenic or through chemical precipitation these layers are distinguishable as having many fossils and are important for the study of biostratigraphy igneous layers are either plutonic or volcanic in character depending upon the cooling rate of the rock these layers are generally devoid of fossils and represent intrusions and volcanic activity that occurred over the geologic history of the area there are a number of principles that are used to explain the appearance of stratum when an igneous rock cuts across a formation of sedimentary rock then we can say that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock the principle of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed stratum is younger than the one beneath and older than the one above it the principle of original horizontality states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds a lithostratigraphic unit conforms to the law of superposition which state that in any succession

since both phosphorylation and o glcnacylation compete for similar serine or threonine residues the two processes may compete for sites or they may alter the substrate specificity of nearby sites by steric or electrostatic effects the protein contains 9 or 14 tetratricopeptide repeats depending on the splice variant and a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms nucleocytoplasmic and mitochondrial have been found for this gene ogt glycosylates many proteins including histone h2b akt1 pfkl kmt2e mll5 mapt tau host cell factor c1 and sin3a o glcnac transferase is a part of a host of biological functions within the human body ogt is involved in the resistance of insulin in muscle cells and adipocytes by inhibiting the threonine 308 phosphorylation of akt1 increasing the rate of irs1 phosphorylation at serine 307 and serine 632 635 reducing insulin signaling and glycosylating components of insulin signals additionally o glcnac transferase catalyzes intracellular glycosylation of serine and threonine residues with the addition of n acetylglucosamine studies show that ogt alleles are vital for embryogenesis and that ogt is necessary for intracellular glycosylation and embryonic stem cell vitality o glcnac transferase also catalyzes the posttranslational modification that modifies

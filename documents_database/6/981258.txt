it is the analog of the frenet serret frame as applied to surface geometry a darboux frame exists at any non umbilic point of a surface embedded in euclidean space it is named after french mathematician jean gaston darboux let s be an oriented surface in three dimensional euclidean space e the construction of darboux frames on s first considers frames moving along a curve in s and then specializes when the curves move in the direction of the principal curvatures at each point of an oriented surface one may attach a unit normal vector in a unique way as soon as an orientation has been chosen for the normal at any particular fixed point if is a curve in parametrized by arc length then the darboux frame of is defined by the triple defines a positively oriented orthonormal basis attached to each point of the curve a natural moving frame along the embedded curve note that a darboux frame for a curve does not yield a natural moving frame on the surface since it still depends on an initial choice of tangent vector to obtain a moving frame on the surface we first compare the darboux frame of with

typically gnotobiotic organisms are germ free or gnotophoric having only one contaminant a gnotobiotic animal is an animal in which only certain known strains of bacteria and other microorganisms are present technically the term also includes germ free animals as the status of their microbial communities is also known however the term gnotobiotic is often incorrectly contrasted with germ free gnotobiotic animals also gnotobiotes or gnotobionts are born in aseptic conditions which may include removal from the mother by caesarean section and immediate transfer of the newborn to an isolator where all incoming air food and water is sterilized such animals are normally reared in a sterile or microbially controlled laboratory environment and they are only exposed to those microorganisms that the researchers wish to have present in the animal these gnotobiotes are used to study the symbiotic relationships between an animal and one or more of the microorganisms that may inhabit its body this technique is important for microbiologists because it allows them to study only a select few symbiotic interactions at a time see scientific control whereas animals that develop under normal conditions may quickly acquire a microbiota that includes hundreds or thousands of unique organisms animals reared

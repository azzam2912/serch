grundy numbers are named after p m grundy who studied an analogous concept for directed graphs in 1939 the undirected version was introduced by for example for a path graph with four vertices the chromatic number is two but the grundy number is three if the two endpoints of the path are colored first the greedy coloring algorithm will use three colors for the whole graph defines a sequence of graphs called atoms with the property that a graph has grundy number at least if and only if it contains a atom each atom is formed from an independent set and a atom by adding one edge from each vertex of the atom to a vertex of the independent set in such a way that each member of the independent set has at least one edge incident to it a grundy coloring of a atom can be obtained by coloring the independent set first with the smallest numbered color and then coloring the remaining atom with an additional colors for instance the only 1 atom is a single vertex and the only 2 atom is a single edge but there are two possible 3 atoms a triangle and a four

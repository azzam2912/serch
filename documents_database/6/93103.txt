at room temperature it is a colourless gas which forms white fumes of hydrochloric acid upon contact with atmospheric water vapor hydrogen chloride gas and hydrochloric acid are important in technology and industry hydrochloric acid the aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride is also commonly given the formula hcl hydrogen chloride is a diatomic molecule consisting of a hydrogen atom h and a chlorine atom cl connected by a polar covalent bond the chlorine atom is much more electronegative than the hydrogen atom which makes this bond polar consequently the molecule has a large dipole moment with a negative partial charge at the chlorine atom and a positive partial charge at the hydrogen atom in part because of its high polarity hcl is very soluble in water and in other polar solvents upon contact ho and hcl combine to form hydronium cations ho and chloride anions cl through a reversible chemical reaction the resulting solution is called hydrochloric acid and is a strong acid the acid dissociation or ionization constant k is large which means hcl dissociates or ionizes practically completely in water even in the absence of water hydrogen chloride can still act as an acid for example hydrogen chloride

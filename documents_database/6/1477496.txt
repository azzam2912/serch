the start checkpoint ensures irreversible cell cycle entry even if conditions later become unfavorable the physiological factors that control passage through the start checkpoint include external nutrient concentrations presence of mating factor pheromone forms of stress and size control in an effort to study the ordered events of the cell cycle leland hartwell et al screened for and characterized temperature sensitive mutants also known as cell division cycle mutants cdc mutants that display arrested cellular development at various stages of the cycle hartwell not only identified the mutant cdc28 which arrests in very early stages of the cell cycle but he also recognised that the presence of mating factors could result in similar phenotypes of inhibited bud formation and lack of dna synthesis notably cells that were exposed to mating factors at later stages of the cycle continued division and only arrested when the resulting daughter cells reached the early stages or more technically the g1 phase of the cell cycle these results suggest that both cdc28 and mating pheromones mediate such early events and further suggest that there exists a point in the cell cycle where the cell commits to division rather than to mating hartwell named this point

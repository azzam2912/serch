originally thought to trigger the formation of testes via loci an autosomal gene that generates the antigen and one that generates the receptor it is now known that it does not trigger the formation of testes but may be activated by the formation of testes there are several antigens which qualify as h y as defined by rejection of male skin grafts in female hosts or detected by cytotoxic t cells or antibodies one h y secreted by the testis defined by antibodies is identical to m llerian inhibiting substance amh gene another h y minor histocompatibility antigen seemed to be encoded in the smcy gene acronym for selected mouse cdna on y later identified as an 11 residue peptide from the lysine specific demethylase 5d protein kdm5d gene presented by hla b7 a third example is mea1 it has been shown that male mice lacking in the h y antigen hence lacking in the gene producing it have also lost genetic information responsible for spermatogenesis this result also identified a gene on the mouse y chromosome distinct from the testis determining gene that was essential for spermatogenesis thus raising the possibility that the very product of this spermatogenesis gene

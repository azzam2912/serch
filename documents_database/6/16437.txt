hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents such as in blending inheritance but can show hybrid vigour sometimes growing larger or taller than either parent the concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding where there is interest in the individual parentage in genetics attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes in taxonomy a key question is how closely related the parent species are species are reproductively isolated by strong barriers to hybridisation which include genetic and morphological differences differing times of fertility mating behaviors and cues and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo some act before fertilization and others after it similar barriers exist in plants with differences in flowering times pollen vectors inhibition of pollen tube growth somatoplastic sterility cytoplasmic genic male sterility and the structure of the chromosomes a few animal species and many plant species however are the result of hybrid speciation including important crop plants such as wheat where the number of chromosomes has been doubled human impact on the environment has resulted in an increase in the interbreeding between regional species and the proliferation of introduced species worldwide has also resulted in an increase in

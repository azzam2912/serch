they are also referred to as the euler lagrange equations of quantum field theories since they are the equations of motion corresponding to the green s function they form a set of infinitely many functional differential equations all coupled to each other sometimes referred to as the infinite tower of sdes in his paper the s matrix in quantum electrodynamics dyson derived relations between different s matrix elements or more specific one particle green s functions in quantum electrodynamics by summing up infinitely many feynman diagrams thus working in a perturbative approach starting from his variational principle schwinger derived a set of equations for green s functions non perturbatively which generalize dyson s equations to the schwinger dyson equations for the green functions of quantum field theories today they provide a non perturbative approach to quantum field theories and applications can be found in many fields of theoretical physics such as solid state physics and elementary particle physics schwinger also derived an equation for the two particle irreducible green functions which is nowadays referred to as the inhomogeneous bethe salpeter equation given a polynomially bounded functional f over the field configurations then for any state vector which is a solution

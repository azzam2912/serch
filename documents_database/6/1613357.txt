they consist of concentric inter bedded cones of calcite or more rarely gypsum siderite or pyrite although several mechanisms may be responsible for the formation of cone in cone structures displacive crystal mechanism is preferred it accounts for the most uniform and consistent explanation of growth and why cone in cone can occur with such variable composition cone in cone structures are identifiable by their distinctive conical appearance they are composed of concentric cones nested inside each other the actual composition of the cones is variable and dependent on the environment in which they were formed with the majority of the cone in cone structures being composed of calcite with thin layers of clay between cones there are also more rarely structures composed of siderite gypsum pyrite there are also some instances of cone in cone occurring within coals often the cone in cone will be found as features of calcite layers within a shale and rarely within a dedolomite calcitized dolomite the formation of cone in cone structures has been attributed to in all cases the common trend is for crystal formation to begin within partially consolidated sediment as cone in cone formation happens it begins to take up

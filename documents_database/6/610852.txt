opening allows increase in the permeability of the mitochondrial membranes to molecules of less than 1500 daltons in molecular weight induction of the permeability transition pore mitochondrial membrane permeability transition mpt or mpt can lead to mitochondrial swelling and cell death through apoptosis or necrosis depending on the particular biological setting the mptp was originally discovered by haworth and hunter in 1979 and has been found to be involved in neurodegeneration hepatotoxicity from reye related agents cardiac necrosis and nervous and muscular dystrophies among other deleterious events inducing cell damage and death mpt is one of the major causes of cell death in a variety of conditions for example it is key in neuronal cell death in excitotoxicity in which overactivation of glutamate receptors causes excessive calcium entry into the cell mpt also appears to play a key role in damage caused by ischemia as occurs in a heart attack and stroke however research has shown that the mpt pore remains closed during ischemia but opens once the tissues are reperfused with blood after the ischemic period playing a role in reperfusion injury mpt is also thought to underlie the cell death induced by reye s syndrome since chemicals that

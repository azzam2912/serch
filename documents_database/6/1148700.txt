it represents a surface a body of given energy cannot cross since it would have zero velocity on the surface it was first introduced by george william hill the zero velocity surface is particularly significant when working with weak gravitational interactions among orbiting bodies in the circular restricted three body problem two heavy masses orbit each other at constant radial distance and angular velocity and a particle of negligible mass is affected by their gravity by shifting to a rotating coordinate system where the masses are stationary a centrifugal force is introduced energy and momentum are not conserved separately in this coordinate system but the jacobi integral remains constant where formula 2 is the rotation rate formula 3 the particle s location in the rotating coordinate system formula 4 the distances to the bodies and formula 5 their masses times the gravitational constant for a given value of formula 6 points on the surface require that formula 8 that is the particle will not be able to cross over this surface since the squared velocity would have to become negative this is the zero velocity surface of the problem note that this means zero velocity in the rotating frame in

james fearon s rationalist explanations for war and robert powell s in the shadow of power which launched rational choice theory in international relations provide three possible answers private information and incentives to misrepresent commitment problems and issue indivisibility fearon has three basic assumptions about war first war is a more costly choice than peace second war is predictably unpredictable in other words although neither side may be sure exactly who will win they can agree on the relatively likelihood each will win and third there are no direct benefits from fighting thus using john von neumann and oskar morgenstern expected utility functions fearon finds the expected utility for war for states a and b which are p c and 1 p c where p is a s probability of winning a war c is a s costs for war proportional to how much they value the utility and c is b s costs for war proportional to how much they value the utility with simplification if x is a s share of a peaceful settlement fearon finds that peace is better than war when p c p c or c c 0 because c and c are individually greater

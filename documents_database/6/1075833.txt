it is possible to use the points with four orientations obtained with subsequent 90 degree rotations this way we get four different families of padua points we can see the padua point as a sampling of a parametric curve called generating curve which is slightly different for each of the four families so that the points for interpolation degree formula 2 and family formula 3 can be defined as actually the padua points lie exactly on the self intersections of the curve and on the intersections of the curve with the boundaries of the square formula 5 the cardinality of the set formula 6 is formula 7 moreover for each family of padua points two points lie on consecutive vertices of the square formula 5 formula 9 points lie on the edges of the square and the remaining points lie on the self intersections of the generating curve inside the square the four generating curves are closed parametric curves in the interval formula 10 and are a special case of lissajous curves the generating curve of padua points of the first family is if we sample it as written above we have where formula 13 when formula 2 is even

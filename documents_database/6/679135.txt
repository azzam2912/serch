the challenge is to calculate the value formula 1 where t is a 14 digit or 47 bit integer namely 79685186856218 and n is a 616 digit or 2048 bit integer which is the product of two large primes which are not given the value of w can then be used to decrypt the ciphertext z another 616 digit integer the plaintext provides the concealed information about the factorisation of n allowing the solution to be easily verified the idea behind the challenge is that the only known way to find the value of w without knowing the factorisation of n is by t successive squarings the value of t was chosen to make this brute force calculation take about 35 years using 1999 chip speeds as a starting point and taking into account moore s law rivest notes that just as a failure of moore s law could make the puzzle harder than intended a breakthrough in the art of factoring would make the puzzle easier than intended the challenge was set at and takes its name from the 35th anniversary celebrations of the mit laboratory for computer science now part of mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory

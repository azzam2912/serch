they are built using the merkle damg rd structure from a one way compression function itself built using the davies meyer structure from a classified specialized block cipher sha 2 includes significant changes from its predecessor sha 1 the sha 2 family consists of six hash functions with digests hash values that are 224 256 384 or 512 bits sha 224 sha 256 sha 384 sha 512 sha 512 224 sha 512 256 sha 256 and sha 512 are novel hash functions computed with 32 bit and 64 bit words respectively they use different shift amounts and additive constants but their structures are otherwise virtually identical differing only in the number of rounds sha 224 and sha 384 are truncated versions of sha 256 and sha 512 respectively computed with different initial values sha 512 224 and sha 512 256 are also truncated versions of sha 512 but the initial values are generated using the method described in federal information processing standards fips pub 180 4 sha 2 was published in 2001 by the national institute of standards and technology nist a u s federal standard fips the sha 2 family of algorithms are patented in us patent 6829355 the

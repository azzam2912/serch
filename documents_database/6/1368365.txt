that is an input polygon or the convex hull of an input point set must be subdivided into triangles that meet edge to edge and vertex to vertex in such a way as to minimize the sum of the perimeters of the triangles the problem is np hard for point set inputs but may be approximated to any desired degree of accuracy for polygon inputs it may be solved exactly in polynomial time the minimum weight triangulation has also sometimes been called the optimal triangulation the problem of minimum weight triangulation of a point set was posed by who suggested its application to the construction of triangulated irregular network models of land countours and used a greedy heuristic to approximate it conjectured that the minimum weight triangulation always coincided with the delaunay triangulation but this was quickly disproved by and indeed showed that the weights of the two triangulations can differ by a linear factor the minimum weight triangulation problem became notorious when included it in a list of open problems in their book on np completeness and many subsequent authors published partial results on it finally showed it to be np hard and showed that accurate approximations to it

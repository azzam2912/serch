it is used in the bucket fill tool of paint programs to fill connected similarly colored areas with a different color and in games such as go and minesweeper for determining which pieces are cleared the flood fill algorithm takes three parameters a start node a target color and a replacement color the algorithm looks for all nodes in the array that are connected to the start node by a path of the target color and changes them to the replacement color there are many ways in which the flood fill algorithm can be structured but they all make use of a queue or stack data structure explicitly or implicitly depending on whether we consider nodes touching at the corners connected or not we have two variations eight way and four way respectively one implicitly stack based recursive flood fill implementation for a two dimensional array goes as follows though easy to understand the implementation of the algorithm used above is impractical in languages and environments where stack space is severely constrained e g java applets an explicitly queue based implementation sometimes called forest fire algorithm is shown in pseudo code below it is similar to the simple recursive solution

the protein encoded by this gene is one of two proteins that are required to form the dq heterodimer a cell surface receptor essential to the function of the immune system hla dqa1 belongs to the hla class ii alpha chain paralogues this class ii molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha dqa and a beta chain dqb both anchored in the membrane it plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins class ii molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells apc b lymphocytes dendritic cells macrophages the alpha chain contains 5 exons exon one encodes the leader peptide exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular protein domains exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail within the dq molecule both the alpha chain and the beta chain contain the polymorphisms specifying the peptide binding specificities resulting in up to 4 different molecules typing for these polymorphisms is routinely done for bone marrow transplantation there are four commonly encountered dqa1 alleles dqa1 0101 0102 0103 0104 these alleles are always found in haplotypes with hla dqb1 05 dq5 and hla dqb1 06 dq6 dq1 is a serotype rare among

other potential propulsion techniques such as ornithopters are very rarely used a propeller or airscrew comprises a set of small wing like aerofoil blades set around a central hub which spins on an axis aligned in the direction of travel the blades are set at a pitch angle to the airflow which may be fixed or variable such that spinning the propeller creates aerodynamic lift or thrust in a forward direction a tractor design mounts the propeller in front of the power source while a pusher design mounts it behind although the pusher design allows cleaner airflow over the wing tractor configuration is more common because it allows cleaner airflow to the propeller and provides a better weight distribution contra rotating propellers have one propeller close behind another on the same axis but rotating in the opposite direction a variation on the propeller is to use many broad blades to create a fan such fans are usually surrounded by a ring shaped fairing or duct as ducted fans many kinds of power plant have been used to drive propellers the earliest designs used man power to give dirigible balloons some degree of control and go back to jean pierre blanchard

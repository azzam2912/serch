it is endemic to the gal pagos islands ecuador the gal pagos mockingbird is one of four mockingbird species endemic to the gal pagos islands these four are all closely related and dna evidence shows they likely all descended from an ancestor species which reached the islands in a single colonization event when john gould first described the species in 1837 based on specimens brought back from the islands by charles darwin he named it orpheus parvulus however because of the rules of binomial nomenclature orpheus was declared a junior synonym and in 1841 george robert gray moved all of the orpheus mockingbirds to the older genus mimus in 1890 robert ridgway created the genus nesomimus for the mockingbirds found on the gal pagos islands and most taxonomists adopted the change recent dna studies however show that the nesomimus mockingbirds fall within the traditional genus mimus making the latter paraphyletic so some taxonomists have moved them back into mimus there are six subspecies each endemic to a particular island or islands the genus name mimus is a latin word meaning mimic while the species name parvulus is a latin word meaning very small like all of the mockingbirds found in

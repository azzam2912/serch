india s wave power potential is around 40 60gw however compared to the developments in other renewable energy technologies ocean energy technologies like wave and tidal are in their nascent stages of development in india india many other development potential resources wave power depends upon the height of the wave and its period primary estimates of wave energy potential along indian coast is around 5 15 mw m so the theoretical estimated potential comes out to be around 40 60 gw a study by iit madras and credit rating information services of indian ltd crisil have shown that western coast has higher wind power potential compared to eastern coast they have identified potential locations for wave power development along the west coast of india in maharashtra goa karnataka and kerala kanyakumari located at the southern tip of indian peninsula has the highest power owing to the effects of refraction and strong winds with currently available technologies amount of power that can be generated using wave energy is much less than the theoretical estimated potential capacity utilization factor for wave energy in india is in the range of 15 20 wave energy research in india was initiated in 1983 when the

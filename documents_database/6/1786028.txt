in his ph d thesis he completely classified all more than 100 topologically different possible flows of the generalized lotka volterra dynamics generalized lotka volterra equation on the plane employing equivalence of this dynamics to the 3 type replicator equation in non cooperative two person games in biology a classification 1986 and his book jointly authored with b m p tscher game theoretic foundations of evolutionary stability springer 1989 he popularized the field of evolutionary game theory which at that time received most attention within theoretical biology among researchers in economics and social sciences around the turn of the millennium he coined together with his co authors the now widely used terms standard quadratic optimization and copositive optimization or copositive programming while the further deals with the simplest problem class in non linear optimization with an np hard complexity copositive optimization allows a conic reformulation of these hard problems as a linear optimization problem over a closed convex cone of symmetric matrices a so called conic optimization problem in this type of problems the full extent of complexity is put into the cone constraint while structural constraints and also the objective function are linear and therefore easy to handle bomze

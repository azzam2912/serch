the large volume of low density pumice produced by the eruption accumulated as a large area of floating pumice a pumice raft that was originally covering a surface of spread to a continuous float of between and within three months dispersed to an area of more than twice the size of new zealand the thickness of the raft may initially have been as high as and was reduced to around within a month three months after the eruption the mass had dispersed into very dilute rafts and ribbons of floating pumice clasts most pumice clasts became waterlogged and sank to the sea floor while some flocks have stranded in the tonga islands on the northern shores of new zealand and eventually on the eastern coast of australia one year after the eruption the eruption of the havre seamount was not initially noticed by scientists and volcanologists were not even aware that the havre seamount was an active submarine volcano after the pumice raft was detected researchers retrospectively examined satellite imagery and past seismic activity in an attempt to pinpoint the time and location of the eruption that produced the pumice raft seismologists discovered a cluster of earthquakes ranging in magnitude

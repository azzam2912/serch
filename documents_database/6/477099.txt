it is therefore a special case of phenotypic plasticity there are several types of polyphenism in animals from having sex determined by the environment to the castes of honey bees and other social insects some polyphenisms are seasonal as in some butterflies which have different patterns during the year and some arctic animals like the snowshoe hare and arctic fox which are white in winter other animals have predator induced or resource polyphenisms allowing them to exploit variations in their environment some nematode worms can develop either into adults or into resting dauer larvae according to resource availability a polyphenism is a biological mechanism that causes a trait to be polyphenic for example crocodiles possess a temperature dependent sex determining polyphenism where sex is the trait influenced by variations in nest temperature when polyphenic forms exist at the same time in the same panmictic interbreeding population they can be compared to genetic polymorphism with polyphenism the switch between morphs is environmental but with genetic polymorphism the determination of morph is genetic these two cases have in common that more than one morph is part of the population at any one time this is rather different from cases where one morph

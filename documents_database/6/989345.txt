motor symptoms consistent of muscle weakness sensory symptoms or paresthesias consist of numbness or tingling in the areas innervated by the ulnar nerve the type of symptoms depend on the location of ulnar nerve impingement because the ulnar nerve consists of different sub types of nerves along its course in cubital tunnel syndrome a type of proximal impingement sensory and motor symptoms tend to occur in a certain sequence initially there may be numbness of the small and ulnar fourth finger which may be transient if the impingement is not corrected the numbness may become constant and progress to hand weakness a characteristic resting hand position of ulnar claw where the small and ring fingers curl up occurs late in the disease and is a sign of severe neuropathy by contrast in guyon s canal syndrome distal impingement motor symptoms and claw hand may be more pronounced a phenomenon known as the ulnar paradox also the back of the hand will have normal sensation the distinct innervation of the hand usually enables diagnosis of an ulnar nerve impingement by symptoms alone ulnar nerve damage that causes paralysis to these muscles will result in a characteristic ulnar claw position of the

it yields vibrational spectra of the adsorbates with high resolution bias voltage is applied between the two contacts an energy diagram of the metal oxide metal device under bias is shown in the top figure the metal contacts are characterized by a constant density of states filled up to the fermi energy the metals are assumed to be equal the adsorbates are situated on the oxide material they are represented by a single bridge electronic level which is the upper dashed line if the insulator is thin enough there is a finite probability that the incident electron tunnels through the barrier since the energy of the electron is not changed by this process it is an elastic process this is shown in the left figure some of the tunneling electrons can lose energy by exciting vibrations of the oxide or the adsorbate these inelastic processes lead to a second tunneling path which gives an additional current contribution to the tunneling current since the incident electron should have enough energy to excite this vibration there is a minimum energy that is the onset of this inelastic process this is shown in the middle figure where the lower dashed line is a

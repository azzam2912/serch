they demonstrated a visual secret sharing scheme where an image was broken up into n shares so that only someone with all n shares could decrypt the image while any shares revealed no information about the original image each share was printed on a separate transparency and decryption was performed by overlaying the shares when all n shares were overlaid the original image would appear there are several generalizations of the basic scheme including k out of n visual cryptography using a similar idea transparencies can be used to implement a one time pad encryption where one transparency is a shared random pad and another transparency acts as the ciphertext normally there is an expansion of space requirement in visual cryptography but if one of the two shares is structured recursively the efficiency of visual cryptography can be increased to 100 some antecedents of visual cryptography are in patents from the 1960s other antecedents are in the work on perception and secure communication visual cryptography can be used to protect biometric templates in which decryption does not require any complex computations in this example the image has been split into two component images each component image has a pair of

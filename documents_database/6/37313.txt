its lining is specialized for the absorption by enterocytes of small nutrient molecules which have been previously digested by enzymes in the duodenum the jejunum lies between the duodenum and the ileum and is considered to start at the suspensory muscle of the duodenum a location called the duodenojejunal flexure the division between the jejunum and ileum is not anatomically distinct in adult humans the small intestine is usually 6 7m long about two fifths of which 2 5 m is the jejunum the interior surface of the jejunum which is exposed to ingested food is covered in finger like projections of mucosa called villi which increase the surface area of tissue available to absorb nutrients from ingested foodstuffs the epithelial cells which line these villi have microvilli the transport of nutrients across epithelial cells through the jejunum and ileum includes the passive transport of sugar fructose and the active transport of amino acids small peptides vitamins and most glucose the villi in the jejunum are much longer than in the duodenum or ileum the ph in the jejunum is usually between 7 and 9 neutral or slightly alkaline the jejunum and the ileum are suspended by mesentery which gives

the approaches overlap with those in psychometrics educational measurement is the assigning of numerals to traits such as achievement interest attitudes aptitudes intelligence and performance the aim of theory and practice in educational measurement is typically to measure abilities and levels of attainment by students in areas such as reading writing mathematics science and so forth traditionally attention focuses on whether assessments are reliable and valid in practice educational measurement is largely concerned with the analysis of data from educational assessments or tests typically this means using total scores on assessments whether they are multiple choice or open ended and marked using marking rubrics or guides in technical terms the pattern of scores by individual students to individual items is used to infer so called scale locations of students the measurements this process is one form of scaling essentially higher total scores give higher scale locations consistent with the traditional and everyday use of total scores if certain theory is used though there is not a strict correspondence between the ordering of total scores and the ordering of scale locations the rasch model provides a strict correspondence provided all students attempt the same test items or their performances are marked

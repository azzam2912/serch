control theory is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and mathematics that is concerned with the behavior of dynamical systems with inputs and how to modify the output by changes in the input using feedback feedforward or signal filtering the system to be controlled is called the plant one way to make the output of a system follow a desired reference signal is to compare the output of the plant to the desired output and provide feedback to the plant to modify the output to bring it closer to the desired output control theory is divided into two branches linear control theory applies to systems made of devices which obey the superposition principle they are governed by linear differential equations a major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time called linear time invariant lti systems these systems can be solved by powerful frequency domain mathematical techniques of great generality such as the laplace transform fourier transform z transform bode plot root locus and nyquist stability criterion nonlinear control theory covers a wider class of systems that do not obey the superposition principle it applies to more real world systems because all real control systems

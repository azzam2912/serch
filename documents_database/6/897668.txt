produced by don fleming it was originally intended to be a concept album based on the idea of the world ending as soon as the year 2000 started it was the last studio album to feature bassist mike mesaros who left the band in 2006 but returned ten years later for occasional live dates she s got a way was released as a promo single a two disc deluxe edition with rare demos and live recordings was released in february 2005 paired with frontman pat dinizio s debut solo album songs and sounds after the commercial failure of the smithereens previous studio album 1994 s a date with the smithereens the band were dropped by their label rca but continued to play live while looking for a new record deal in the meantime frontman pat dinizio was offered a solo deal with velvel records which issued his album songs and sounds in 1997 i guess they thought perhaps it would be the next logical move from the smithereens and then if that got any critical reaction or did anything at all probably a smithereens deal was in the offing i guess is the word dinizio told billboard magazine in 1999

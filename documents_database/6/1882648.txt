it lived during the early middle cambrian amgan and mayan stages in what are now the czech republic and the north siberian plateau like all agnostina it has a headshield or cephalon and tailshield or pygidium of approximately the same shape and size or isopygeous and two thorax segments like other members of the peronopsidae family it lacks a furrow connecting the furrow surrounding the central raise area of the cephalon or glabella and the furrow that defines the border of the cephalon both the cephalon and the pygidium lack spines it is difficult to distinguish from many other peronopsids the ancestor of diplorrhina is most likely one of the siberian species of the genus archaeagnostus d recta is the most primitive species and it gave rise to d cuneifera which was in turn ancestral to diplorrhina triplicata both the border and the border furrow of the cephalon are relatively narrow the furrow that divides the glabella in an anterior and posterior part or transglabellar furrow is straight or bent slightly rearwards the posterior lobe is parallel sided has two pairs of lateral furrows in shape of prominent grooves or pits small basal lobes and no median node the pygidium

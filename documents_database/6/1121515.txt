the systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl coa long chain alcohol o acyltransferase other names in common use include wax synthase and wax ester synthase in general wax synthases naturally accept acyl groups with carbon chain lengths of c16 or c18 and linear alcohols with carbon chain lengths ranging from c12 to c20 there are three unrelated families of wax synthases found in many organisms including bacteria higher plants and animals in two known distinct forms either just as a wax synthase enzyme which is found predominantly in eukaryotes or as an enzyme with dual wax synthase and acyl coa diacylglycerol acyltransferase function which is often the final enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway responsible for wax ester production from fatty alcohols and fatty acyl coas and is found predominantly in prokaryotes there are frequent reports of wax esters biosynthesis in bacteria of the acinetobacter genus in particular it has been shown that the acinetobacter calcoaceticus adp1 strain synthesizes wax esters through a bifunctional wax ester synthase acyl coa diacylglycerol acyltransferase ws dgat and that this complex can be functionally expressed in different bacterial hosts suggesting the potential for potential microbial production of cheap jojoba like wax esters furthermore

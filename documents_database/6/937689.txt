its shell was long and conical with the open end protected by an operculum from which two fleshy arms called helens protruded at the sides these arms served to elevate the opening of the shells above the sea floor acting like stilts mature haplophrentis ranged in length between 2 6 cm h reesi being larger than h carinatus juveniles could of course be smaller it is distinguished from hyolithes by the presence of a longitudinal septum on the middle of the inner surface of the top of the shell its soft anatomy comprises 12 h carinatus to 16 h reesi tentacles attached to a horseshoe shaped lophophore a pair of wide structures of uncertain function extend along the length of the conical shell a larval shell is attached to the shell apex the soft anatomy of haplophrentis was key to establishing the hyoliths as members of the lophophorata the group containing brachiopods and phoronids haplophrentis was a filter feeder using its lophophore to extract organic matter from passing seawater specimens of haplophrentis have been found in the gut of the predator ottoia it is also known from several specimens in the spence shale and occurs prolifically at the marble canyon

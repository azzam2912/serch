they can be used to reduce the search space and make the problem easier to solve various kinds of local consistency conditions are leveraged including node consistency arc consistency and path consistency every local consistency condition can be enforced by a transformation that changes the problem without changing its solutions such a transformation is called constraint propagation constraint propagation works by reducing domains of variables strengthening constraints or creating new ones this leads to a reduction of the search space making the problem easier to solve by some algorithms constraint propagation can also be used as an unsatisfiability checker incomplete in general but complete in some particular cases local consistency conditions can be grouped into various classes the original local consistency conditions require that every consistent assignment can be consistently extended to another variable directional consistency only requires this condition to be satisfied when the other variable is higher than the ones in the assignment according to a given order relational consistency includes extensions to more than one variable but this extension is only required to satisfy a given constraint or set of constraints in this article a constraint satisfaction problem is defined as a set of variables a set

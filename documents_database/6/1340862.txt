if the fuel required to reach a particular cycler orbit from both the earth and the moon is modest and the travel time between the two along the cycler is reasonable then having a spacecraft in the cycler can provide an efficient and regular method for space transportation buzz aldrin first suggested the use of cycler orbits in 1985 for the life support equipment and logistical supplies necessary for extensive manned exploration of the moon and mars he also presented his thoughts on the benefits of using cycler spacecraft at the space 88 symposium in albuquerque during a panel discussion on approaching the construction problems in space these trajectories must have the characteristic that they can be easily targeted for either launch or destination planet and that the times between encounters yield a reasonable stay time on the destination and provide for both routine and emergency return on a fairly regular basis one of the challenges for nasa s interstellar boundary explorer ibex satellite was to find a stable orbit in cislunar space a region from outside the earth s atmosphere to just beyond the moon s orbit the orbit in which the satellite was originally set could only be

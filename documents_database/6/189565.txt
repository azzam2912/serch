these sets were first defined by and his student there are several equivalent definitions of analytic set the following conditions on a subspace a of a polish space x are equivalent an alternative characterization in the specific important case that formula 1 is baire space is that the analytic sets are precisely the projections of trees on formula 8 similarly the analytic subsets of cantor space 2 are precisely the projections of trees on formula 9 analytic subsets of polish spaces are closed under countable unions and intersections continuous images and inverse images the complement of an analytic set need not be analytic suslin proved that if the complement of an analytic set is analytic then the set is borel conversely any borel set is analytic and borel sets are closed under complements luzin proved more generally that any two disjoint analytic sets are separated by a borel set in other words there is a borel set containing one and disjoint from the other this is sometimes called the luzin separability principle though it was implicit in the proof of suslin s theorem analytic sets are always lebesgue measurable indeed universally measurable and have the property of baire and the

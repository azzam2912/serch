optionally a mass analyzer can be incorporated in the ion source source materials in the form of a gas an evaporated solid or a solution liquid are ionized for atomic ion ibd electron ionization field ionization penning ion source or cathodic arc sources are employed cathodic arc sources are used particularly for carbon ion deposition molecular ion beam deposition employs electrospray ionization or maldi sources the ions are then accelerated focused or deflected using high voltages or magnetic fields optional deceleration at the substrate can be employed to define the deposition energy this energy usually ranges from a few ev up to a few kev at low energy molecular ion beams are deposited intact soft landing while at a high deposition energy molecular ions fragment and atomic ions penetrate further into the material a process known as ion implantation ion optics such as radio frequency quadrupoles can be mass selective in ibd they are used to select a single or a range of ion species for deposition in order to avoid contamination for organic materials in particular this process is often monitored by a mass spectrometer the ion beam current which is quantitative measure for the deposited amount of material

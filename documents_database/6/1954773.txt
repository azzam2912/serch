bali phy achieves high accuracy in alignment estimation by using information from the co estimated phylogeny bali phy takes alignment uncertainty into account while estimating the phylogeny by averaging over possible alignments unlike most phylogeny inference software input sequences need not be aligned beforehand this differs from traditional approaches to alignment and phylogeny estimation which first estimate the alignment without a high quality tree estimate and then estimate the tree given the alignment bali phy produces a bayesian posterior distribution on both the alignments and the tree the software shows uncertainty in both the alignment and the tree bali phy uses markov chain monte carlo methods for estimation it can take several days to run alignment uncertainty stems from two main sources near optimal alignments and evolutionary parameter uncertainty evolutionary parameters include branch lengths substitution rates insertion deletion rates and the phylogeny itself if the exact value for these parameters is unknown and the alignment estimate is sensitive to the parameter then the alignment cannot be known with confidence even when evolutionary parameters are fully known many different alignments may be optimal or nearly optimal in this case the researcher cannot have confidence in any single alignment but must average

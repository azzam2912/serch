wind ice water and gravity transport previously weathered surface material which at the loss of enough kinetic energy in the fluid is deposited building up layers of sediment deposition occurs when the forces responsible for sediment transportation are no longer sufficient to overcome the forces of gravity and friction creating a resistance to motion this is known as the null point hypothesis deposition can also refer to the buildup of sediment from organically derived matter or chemical processes for example chalk is made up partly of the microscopic calcium carbonate skeletons of marine plankton the deposition of which has induced chemical processes diagenesis to deposit further calcium carbonate similarly the formation of coal begins with deposition of organic material mainly from plants in anaerobic conditions the null point hypothesis explains how sediment is deposited throughout a shore profile according to its grain size this is due to the influence of hydraulic energy resulting in a seaward fining of sediment particle size or where fluid forcing equals gravity for each grain size the concept can also be explained as sediment of a particular size may move across the profile to a position where it is in equilibrium with the wave and

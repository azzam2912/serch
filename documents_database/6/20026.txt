as instrumental records only span a tiny part of earth history the reconstruction of ancient climate is important to understand natural variation and the evolution of the current climate paleoclimatology uses a variety of proxy methods from the earth and life sciences to obtain data previously preserved within rocks sediments boreholes ice sheets tree rings corals shells and microfossils combined with techniques to date the proxies these paleoclimate records are used to determine the past states of earth s atmosphere the scientific field of paleoclimatology came to maturity in the 20th century notable periods studied by paleoclimatologists are the frequent glaciations the earth has undergone rapid cooling events such as the younger dryas and the fast rate of warming during the paleocene eocene thermal maximum studies of past changes in the environment and biodiversity often reflect on the current situation specifically the impact of climate on mass extinctions and biotic recovery and current global warming notions of a changing climate probably evolved in ancient egypt mesopotamia the indus valley and china where prolonged periods of droughts and floods were experienced in the seventeenth century robert hooke postulated that fossils of giant turtles found in dorset could only be explained by

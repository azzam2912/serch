although the conjugated ring of this annulene contains 4 n 2 electrons it only exhibits limited evidence for being aromatic it does not fully conform to h ckel s rule because none of its cis trans isomers can adopt a completely planar conformation due to crowding of the interior hydrogens there is evidence that it has two isomeric forms of comparable stability trans cis trans cis trans trans cis with four interior hydrogens shown in the infobox and trans cis trans cis trans cis cis with three interior hydrogens which rapidly interconvert at room temperature but can be observed at low temperature by nmr its h nmr spectrum shows evidence of aromatic ring currents that result in an upfield shift for the interior hydrogens in contrast the corresponding 12 and 16 annulenes which are weakly antiaromatic or nonaromatic have downfield shifted interior hydrogens however unlike the undoubtedly aromatic 18 annulene 14 annulene does not bear the hallmark aromatic property of chemical stability and it quickly decomposes when exposed to light and air

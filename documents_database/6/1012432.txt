this article will focus on density dependence in the context of macroparasite life cycles positive density dependence density dependent facilitation or the allee effect describes a situation in which population growth is facilitated by increased population density for dioecious separate sex obligatory parasites mated female worms are required to complete a transmission cycle at low parasite densities the probability of a female worm encountering a male worm and forming a mating pair can become so low that reproduction is restricted due to single sex infections at higher parasite densities the probability of mating pairs forming and successful reproduction increases this has been observed in the population dynamics of schistosomes positive density dependence processes occur in macroparasite life cycles that rely on vectors with a cibarial armature such as anopheles or culex mosquitoes for wuchereria bancrofti a filarial nematode well developed cibarial armatures in vectors can damage ingested microfilariae and impede the development of infective l3 larvae at low microfilariae densities most microfilariae can be ruptured by teeth preventing successful development of infective l3 larvae as more larvae are ingested the ones that become entangled in the teeth may protect the remaining larvae which are then left undamaged during ingestion positive

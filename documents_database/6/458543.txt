it is an open architecture developed and administered by fieldcomm group it is targeted for applications using basic and advanced regulatory control and for much of the discrete control associated with those functions foundation fieldbus technology is mostly used in process industries but has recently been implemented in powerplants two related implementations of foundation fieldbus have been introduced to meet different needs within the process automation environment these two implementations use different physical media and communication speeds foundation fieldbus was originally intended as a replacement for the 4 20 ma standard and today it coexists alongside other technologies such as modbus profibus and industrial ethernet foundation fieldbus today enjoys a growing installed base in many heavy process applications such as refining petrochemicals power generation and even food and beverage pharmaceuticals and nuclear applications foundation fieldbus was developed over a period of many years by the international society of automation or isa as sp50 in 1996 the first h1 31 25 kbit s specifications were released in 1999 the first hse high speed ethernet specifications were released the international electrotechnical commission iec standard on field bus including foundation fieldbus is iec 61158 type 1 is foundation fieldbus h1 while type 5

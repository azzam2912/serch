they are orthogonal with respect to the weight on the interval the gegenbauer polynomials and thus also the legendre zernike and chebyshev polynomials are special cases of the jacobi polynomials the jacobi polynomials were introduced by carl gustav jacob jacobi the jacobi polynomials are defined via the hypergeometric function as follows where formula 2 is pochhammer s symbol for the rising factorial in this case the series for the hypergeometric function is finite therefore one obtains the following equivalent expression an equivalent definition is given by rodrigues formula if formula 5 then it reduces to the legendre polynomials for real x the jacobi polynomial can alternatively be written as and for integer n where is the gamma function in the special case that the four quantities and are nonnegative integers the jacobi polynomial can be written as the sum extends over all integer values of s for which the arguments of the factorials are nonnegative the jacobi polynomials satisfy the orthogonality condition as defined they do not have unit norm with respect to the weight this can be corrected by dividing by the square root of the right hand side of the equation above when formula 13 although it does

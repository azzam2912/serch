it is the homologue of the human g t binding protein gtbp also called p160 or hmsh6 human msh6 the msh6 protein is a member of the mutator s muts family of proteins that are involved in dna damage repair defects in hmsh6 are associated with atypical hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer not fulfilling the amsterdam criteria for hnpcc hmsh6 mutations have also been linked to endometrial cancer and the development of endometrial carcinomas msh6 was first identified in the budding yeast s cerevisiae because of its homology to msh2 the identification of the human gtbp gene and subsequent amino acid sequence availability showed that yeast msh6 and human gtbp were more related to each other than any other muts homolog with a 26 6 amino acid identity thus gtbp took on the name human msh6 or hmsh6 in the human genome hmsh6 is located on chromosome 2 it contains the walker a b adenine nucleotide binding motif which is the most highly conserved sequence found in all muts homologs as with other muts homologs hmsh6 has an intrinsic atpase activity it functions exclusively when bound to hmsh2 as a heterodimer although hmsh2 itself can function as a homomultimer or as

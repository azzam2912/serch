it was used historically to make different kinds of mirrors from personal grooming aids to reflecting telescope optical mirrors until it was replaced by more modern materials large speculum metal mirrors are hard to manufacture and the alloy is prone to tarnish requiring frequent re polishing however it was the only practical choice for large mirrors in high precision optical equipment between mid 17th and mid 19th century before the invention of glass silvering speculum metal was noted for its use in the metal mirrors of reflecting telescopes and famous examples of its use were newton s telescope the leviathan of parsonstown and herschel s telescope used to discover the planet uranus a major difficulty of this type of telescope is that it had only certain percentage of reflection of the light and they would tarnish upon re polishing the mirror could loose its precise figuring and many of these issues were not solved with satisfaction until the 21st century technologies for metal coated glass reflectors speculum metal mixtures usually contain two parts copper to one part tin along with a small amount of arsenic although there are other mixtures containing silver lead or zinc the knowledge of making very

its utility is to predict possible congestion and prevent it this protocol works with tcp when a router wants to signal congestion to the sender it adds a bit in the header of packets sent when a packet arrives at the router the router calculates the average queue length for the last busy idle period plus the current busy period the router is busy when it is transmitting packets and idle otherwise when the average queue length exceeds 1 then the router sets the congestion indication bit in the packet header of arriving packets when the destination replies the corresponding ack includes a bit of congestion the sender receives the ack and calculates how many packets it received with the congestion indication bit set to one if less than half of the packets in the last window had the congestion indication bit set then the window is increased linearly otherwise the window is decreased exponentially this technique provides distinct advantages note that this technique does not allow for effective use of the line because it fails to take advantage of the available bandwidth besides the fact that the tail has increased in size from one cycle to another does not

it is one of 10 regular schl fli hess polytopes it is the only one with 600 cells it is one of four regular star 4 polytopes discovered by ludwig schl fli it is named by john horton conway extending the naming system by arthur cayley for the kepler poinsot solids the grand 600 cell can be seen as the four dimensional analogue of the great icosahedron which in turn is analogous to the pentagram both of these are the only regular n dimensional star polytopes which are derived by performing stellational operations on the pentagonal polytope which has simplectic faces it can be constructed analogously to the pentagram its two dimensional analogue via the extension of said n 1 d simplex faces of the core n d polytope tetrahedra for the grand 600 cell equilateral triangles for the great icosahedron and line segments for the pentagram until the figure regains regular faces the grand 600 cell is also dual to the great grand stellated 120 cell mirroring the great icosahedron s duality with the great stellated dodecahedron which in turn is also analogous to the pentagram all of these are the final stellations of the n dimensional dodecahedral type

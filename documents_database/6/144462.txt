the lxi standard defines the communication protocols for instrumentation and data acquisition systems using ethernet ethernet is a ubiquitous communication standard providing a versatile interface the lxi standard describes how to use the ethernet standards for test and measurement applications in a way that promotes simple interoperability between instruments the lxi consortium ensures lxi compliant instrumentation developed by various vendors work together with no communication or setup issues the lxi consortium ensures that the lxi standard complements other test and measurement control systems such as gpib and pxi systems proposed in 2005 by keysight formerly called agilent technologies and vti instruments formerly called vxi technology and now part of ametek the lxi standard adapts the ethernet and world wide web standards and applies them to test and measurement applications the standard defines how existing standards should be used in instrumentation applications to provide a consistent feel and ensure compatibility between vendors equipment the lxi standard does not define a mechanical format allowing lxi solutions to take any physical form deemed suitable for products in their intended market lxi products can be modular rack mounted bench mounted or take any other physical form lxi supports synthetic instruments and peer to peer

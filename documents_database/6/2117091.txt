for the quaternary period terminations are numbered using roman numerals from the most recent termination as i and with increasing value e g ii iii and so forth into the past termination i also known as the last glacial termination is the end of marine isotope stage 2 termination ii is the end of marine isotope stage 6 termination iii is the end of marine isotope stage 8 termination iv is the end of marine isotope stage 10 and so forth during the quaternary global climate experienced a recurring pattern of ice sheet growth and decay the length of late quaternary cycles varied between 80 000 and 120 000 years with an average recurrence interval of about 100 000 years the typical late quaternary glacial cycle was asymmetric having a long cooling interval that was characterized by an oscillating buildup of ice sheets to maximum volume the long cooling interval was then followed by a relatively short warming period during this warming period called a termination huge northern hemisphere ice sheets melted away sea level rose about and interglacial climate emerged across the planet in a few thousand years in case of the termination of the last glacial cycle the

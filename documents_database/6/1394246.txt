the wipower system uses directed and controlled magnetic fields to replace traditional power cords to do this the transmitter utilizes one or more primary windings in order to induce an even magnetic field above its surface a receiver in the magnetic field uses a secondary winding which captures the magnetic energy and converts it back to electrical energy wipower s system was based on modified coreless inductive technology and dynamically adjusts power supplied by the transmitter to power demanded by the receiver without the need for control systems or communication as such the company s technology represents a simpler design versus alternate wireless power solutions the system is capable of supplying power to multiple receivers simultaneously that are placed on top of the transmitter in any position or orientation and the company has reported dc to dc efficiencies between 60 90 these technologies were combined in a backwards compatible manner with intel and qualcomm s wireless power over distance technologies to be standardised by the alliance for wireless power originally pioneered by nikola tesla in the 1890s wireless power transfer systems largely based on michael faraday s electromagnetic induction principles of 1831 have seen many applications from electronic toothbrushes to

nsbm artists typically combine neo nazi ideology with ethnic european paganism and opposition to foreign religions such as christianity islam and judaism however some artists are satanists or occultists rather than pagans nsbm is not seen as a distinct genre but as a neo v lkisch movement within black metal according to mattias gardell nsbm musicians see this ideology as a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal although there is an undercurrent of ethnic nationalism in black metal nsbm artists are a small minority within the genre many nsbm artists are not very explicit with their political beliefs in the music instead expressing their beliefs offstage artists who hold far right or white nationalist beliefs but do not express these in their music are not often deemed nsbm by the greater black metal scene but may be labelled as such in the media some black metal bands have also made references to nazi germany purely for shock value much like some punk rock and heavy metal bands while some black metallers boycott nsbm artists many are indifferent or appreciate the music without supporting the musicians however according to christian dornbusch and hans peter killguss

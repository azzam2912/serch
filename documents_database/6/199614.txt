it was invented by william thomson 1st baron kelvin the current to be measured is passed in series through two coils of wire one of which is attached to one arm of a sensitive balance the magnetic force between the two coils is measured by the amount of weight needed on the other arm of the balance to keep it in equilibrium this is used to calculate the magnitude of the current the main weakness of the ampere balance is that the calculation of the current involves the dimensions of the coils so the accuracy of the current measurement is limited by the accuracy with which the coils can be measured and their mechanical rigidity a more complicated version of an ampere balance called the kibble balance that removes this source of inaccuracy by a calibration step was invented by b p kibble in 1975 this experimental device is being developed at government metrology laboratories worldwide with the goal of providing a more accurate definition of the kilogram the world s standard of mass in this application the kibble balance will function in the reverse sense to the ampere balance it will be used to weigh the international prototype kilogram

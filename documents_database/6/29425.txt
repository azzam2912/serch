in the case of bodies with substantial atmospheres such as earth s atmosphere the exosphere is the uppermost layer where the atmosphere thins out and merges with interplanetary space it is located directly above the thermosphere very little is known about it due to lack of research mercury the moon and the galilean satellites of jupiter have surface boundary exospheres which are exospheres without a denser atmosphere underneath the gases that can be found in the exosphere are mostly hydrogen and carbon dioxide mercury and several large moons such as the moon and the galilean satellites of jupiter have exospheres without a denser atmosphere underneath referred to as a surface boundary exosphere here molecules are ejected on elliptic trajectories until they collide with the surface smaller bodies such as asteroids in which the molecules emitted from the surface escape to space are not considered to have exospheres the most common molecules within earth s exosphere are those of the lightest atmospheric gases hydrogen is present throughout the exosphere with some helium carbon dioxide and atomic oxygen near its base because it can be hard to define the boundary between the exosphere and outer space see upper boundary at the end

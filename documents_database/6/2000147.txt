until 2018 it was considered to be the most likely candidate for a thorne ytkow object but it is now thought to be an asymptotic giant branch star hv 2112 was first reported as a variable star in 1908 by henrietta leavitt at the time it was identified as harvard no 2112 no period was given but it was reported to be probably long the magnitude range was given as 13 7 to fainter than 16 5 from photographic plates in 1966 analysis of magellanic cloud variable stars showed that hv 2112 had a photographic magnitude range from 13 0 to below 17 8 it was classified as a long period variable now known as a mira variable on the basis of its large amplitude and reasonably regular light variations hv 2112 had historically been treated as a very luminous asymptotic giant branch agb star a red giant that has exhausted its core helium and is in the last stages of its evolution large amplitude class m variables and stars with spectral types later than about m5 are almost always agb stars rather than red supergiants these stars have a theoretical maximum luminosity and at the distance of the smc

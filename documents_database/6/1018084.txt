in addition ncor2 appears to recruit histone deacetylases to dna promoter regions hence ncor2 assists nuclear receptors in the down regulation of target gene expression ncor2 is also referred to as a silencing mediator for retinoid or thyroid hormone receptors smrt or t receptor associating cofactor 1 trac 1 ncor2 smrt is a transcriptional coregulatory protein that contains several modulatory functional domains including multiple autonomous repression domains as well as two or three c terminal nuclear receptor interacting domains ncor2 smrt serves as a repressive coregulatory factor corepressor for multiple transcription factor pathways in this regard ncor2 smrt functions as a platform protein facilitating the recruitment of histone deacetylases to the dna promoters bound by its interacting transcription factors it is a member of the family of nuclear receptor corepressors the other human protein that is a member of that family is nuclear receptor co repressor 1 smrt was initially cloned and characterized in the laboratory of dr ronald m evans at the salk institute for biological studies in another early investigation into this molecule similar findings were reported in a variant referred to as trac 1 nuclear receptor co repressor 2 has been shown to interact with

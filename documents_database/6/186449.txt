naming this version of the talmud after the land of israel rather than jerusalem is considered more accurate by some because while the work was certainly composed in the west as seen from babylonia i e in the holy land it mainly originates from the galilee rather than from jerusalem in judea as no jews lived in jerusalem at this time the jerusalem talmud was compiled in the land of israel then divided between the byzantine provinces of palaestina prima and palaestina secunda and was brought to an end sometime around 400 the jerusalem talmud predates its counterpart the babylonian talmud known in hebrew as the talmud bavli by about 200 years and is written in both hebrew and jewish palestinian aramaic the word talmud itself is often defined as instruction both versions of the talmud comprise two parts the mishnah of which there is only one version which was finalized by judah the prince around the year 200 ce and either the babylonian or the jerusalem gemara the gemara is what differentiates the jerusalem talmud from its babylonian counterpart the jerusalem gemara contains the written discussions of generations of rabbis in the land of israel primarily in the academies

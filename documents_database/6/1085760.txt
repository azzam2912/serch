the concept was introduced in 1926 by ludwig claisen to explain the acidic properties of formylacetone and related ketoaldehydes its adjectival form vinylogous is used to describe functional groups in which the standard moieties of the group are separated only by a conjugated bonded system for example a carbon carbon double bond c cvinyl moiety between a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group is referred to as a vinylogous carboxylic acid analogous electronically to a carboxylic acid rcooh vinylogous reactions are believed to occur when orbitals of the double bonds of the vinyl group and of an attached electron withdrawing group ewg the orbitals are aligned and so can overlap and mix i e are conjugated electron delocalization enables the ewg to receive electron density through participation of the conjugated system vinylogous reactions also include conjugate additions where a nucleophile reacts at the vinyl terminus as well as a vinylogous variation of the aldol reaction where an electrophile is attacked by a nucleophilic vinylogous enolate see first and following image the vinylogous enolate reacts at the terminal position of the double bond system the carbon rather than the carbon immediately adjacent to the carbonyl as would a simple enolate allylic

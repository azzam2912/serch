it has previously been treated as a separate family asphodelaceae sensu stricto the family asphodelaceae has now been proposed to be a nomen conservandum and the proposal has been recommended for ratification in 2017 in that case asphodelaceae will have priority over xanthorrhoeaceae this is reflected in the apg iv family lists the subfamily name is derived from the generic name of the type genus asphodelus members of group are native to africa central and western europe the mediterranean basin central asia and australia with one genus bulbinella having some of its species in new zealand the greatest diversity occurs in south africa the genera aloe asphodelus and kniphofia are perhaps best known from their use in horticulture as ornamental plants the asphodeloideae are distinguished by a general presence of anthraquinones simultaneous microsporogenesis atypical ovules morphology and the presence of an aril asphodeloideae also have a characteristic secondary growth by means of a secondary thickening meristem this character however is also found in other taxa in the asparagales including agavaceae iridaceae and xanthorrhoeoideae it is confined to asparagales among the monocots and is believed to have evolved independently in most families there is agreement among many researchers that asphodeloideae can

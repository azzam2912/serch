the number and characteristics of these phenol structures underlie the unique physical chemical and biological metabolic toxic therapeutic etc properties of particular members of the class examples include tannic acid and ellagitannin the historically important chemical class of tannins is a subset of the polyphenols the name derives from the ancient greek word polus meaning many much and the word phenol which refers to a chemical structure formed by attaching to an aromatic benzenoid phenyl ring a hydroxyl oh group as is found in alcohols hence the ol suffix the term polyphenol has been in use at least since 1894 as seen in the definitions and examples below polyphenols are not polymers of phenol phenol can be polymerized by electrochemical oxidation but this yields compounds that are not referred to as polyphenols polyphenols have more than one hydroxyl group attached to benzene rings whereas phenol has one hydroxyl attached to one benzene ring the earliest widely accepted definition of polyphenols the white bate smith swain haslam wbssh definition was offered and justified by natural product and organic chemist edwin haslam and co workers based on the earlier natural products research of edgar charles bate smith anthony swain and theodore white

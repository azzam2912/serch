its chemical formula is it is a yellow material that dissolves in common solvents including benzene toluene and dichloromethane its solutions emit blue light fluorescence under uv light it has been used as a solvent probe similar to pyrene the compound is of theoretical interest to organic chemists because of its aromaticity it can be described by 20 resonance structures or by a set of three mobile clar sextets in the clar sextet case the most stable structure for coronene has only the three isolated outer sextets as fully aromatic although superaromaticity would still be possible when these sextets are able to migrate into the next ring coronene occurs naturally as the very rare mineral carpathite which is characterized by flakes of pure coronene embedded in sedimentary rock this mineral may be created from ancient hydrothermal vent activity in earlier times this mineral was also called karpatite or pendletonite coronene is produced in the petroleum refining process of hydrocracking where it can dimerize to a fifteen ring pah trivially named dicoronylene formally named benzo 10 11 phenanthro 2 3 4 5 6 4 5 6 7 chryseno 1 2 3 bc coronene or benzo 1 2 3 bc 4 5

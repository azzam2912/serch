the concept was first studied by william kingdon clifford in elliptic space since parallel lines have the property of equidistance the term parallel was appropriated from euclidean geometry but in fact the lines of elliptic geometry are curves and they have finite length unlike the lines of euclidean geometry the algebra of quaternions provides a descriptive geometry of elliptic space in which clifford parallelism is made explicit the lines on 1 in elliptic space are described by versors with a fixed axis r for an arbitrary point u in elliptic space two clifford parallels to this line pass through u the right clifford parallel is and the left clifford parallel is rotating a line about another to which it is clifford parallel creates a clifford surface the clifford parallels through points on the surface all lie in the surface a clifford surface is thus a ruled surface since every point is on two lines each contained in the surface given two square roots of minus one in the quaternions written r and s the clifford surface through them is given by clifford parallels were first described in 1873 by the english mathematician william kingdon clifford in 1900 guido fubini wrote

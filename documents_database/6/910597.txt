dye tracing may be used to analyse the flow of the liquid or the transport of objects within the liquid dye tracking may be either qualitative showing the presence of a particular flow or quantitative when the amount of the traced dye is measured by special instruments are often used in situations where there is insufficient lighting e g sewers or cave waters and where precise quantitative data are required measured by a fluorometer in 1871 fluorescein was among the first fluorescent dyes to be developed its disodium salt under the trademark uranine was developed several years later and still remains among the best tracer dyes other popular tracer dyes are rhodamine pyranine and sulforhodamine carbon sampling was the first method of technology assisted dye tracing that was based on the absorption of dye in charcoal charcoal packets may be placed along the expected route of the flow later the collected dye may be chemically extracted and its amount subjectively evaluated filter fluorometers were the first devices that could detect dye concentrations beyond human eye sensitivity spectrofluorometers developed in the mid 1980s made it possible to perform advanced analysis of fluorescence filter fluorometers and spectrofluorometers identify the intensity of fluorescence

winning his second grammy award for best r b performance his second straight award this album tried to capture the success of the previous future shock with some more twists and turns junku for instance featured foday musa suso and also was written for the 1984 summer olympics in los angeles it served as the field theme it also was used during hancock s appearance on the long running nbc saturday night live sound system sounded like junku in many ways while karabali featured wayne shorter playing a lyricon instead of a traditional saxophone and went back to the days of hancock s african themed mwandishi band robert christgau commented future shock was a pretty good album despite its dink quotient this is a better album despite its schlock quotient where s the melody is beside the point because even when they re just hooks the melodies seem a little obvious without the physical or intellectual bite of the rhythm tracks nowhere mightier than on the amazing metal beat recommended to those who think trevor horn is into something heavy and me i doubt herbie should be playing more jazz several of the false moments here are provided by saint

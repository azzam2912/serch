weiner the name of the theorem comes from the standard shape of a tennis ball whose seam forms a curve that meets the conditions of the theorem the same kind of curve is also used for the seams on baseballs precisely an inflection point of a doubly continuously differentiable formula 1 curve on the surface of a sphere is a point formula 2 with the following property let formula 3 be the connected component containing formula 2 of the intersection of the curve with its tangent great circle at formula 2 for most curves formula 3 will just be formula 2 itself but it could also be an arc of the great circle then for formula 2 to be an inflection point every neighborhood of formula 3 must contain points of the curve that belong to both of the hemispheres separated by this great circle the theorem states that every formula 1 curve that partitions the sphere into two equal area components has at least four inflection points in this sense the tennis ball and baseball seams can be modeled mathematically by a curve made of four semicircular arcs with exactly four inflection points where pairs of these arcs meet

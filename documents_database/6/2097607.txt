such a design translates the received radio frequency rf or passband signal directly from the carrier frequency fc to baseband using only one mixing stage the traditional heterodyne receiver structure needs an intermediate frequency if stage between the rf and baseband signals the direct conversion receiver structure does not have an if stage and does not need an image rejection filter due to the lower component count it is easier to integrate however a direct conversion rf front end suffers from two major drawbacks one is iq imbalance and the other is dc offset when designing a homodyne receiver control of iq imbalance is necessary to limit signal demodulation error iq imbalances occur due to mismatches between the parallel sections of the receiver chain dealing with the in phase i and quadrature q signal paths the local oscillator lo generates a sinewave and a copy of that sinewave that is delayed by 90 degrees when the direct lo output is mixed with the original signal this produces the i signal whereas when the delayed lo output is mixed with the original signal that produces the q signal in the analog domain the delay is never exactly 90 degrees similarly analog

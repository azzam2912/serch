the mpc maintains a data base that stores all observations submitted by these registered observatories an astrometric record consist of the position brightness and timestamp of an observed object besides additional information the database contains more than 200 million records gathered over the past two centuries the mpc assigns for each observatory a 3 digit observatory code also known as mpc or iau codes the code is in the range codice 1 to codice 2 and serves as a unique identifier for the reported observations the mpc periodically published a revised list of observatory codes with newly registered observatories in their minor planet circulars over time the number of astronomical observatories worldwide has been growing constantly and contains 2095 observatory codes as of october 2018 on numbering often years later the mpc determines the discovery among all the reported observations for an object this does not need to be the earliest dated observation also see precovery the date of the selected observation will become the object s discovery date and the corresponding observing astronomer or facility will become its discoverer the discovery circumstances are given in the catalog of numbered minor planets an astrometric observational record includes the position timestamp

these conditions were collected during the late 1970s the weaker the causality condition on a spacetime the more unphysical the spacetime is spacetimes with closed timelike curves for example present severe interpretational difficulties see the grandfather paradox it is reasonable to believe that any physical spacetime will satisfy the strongest causality condition global hyperbolicity for such spacetimes the equations in general relativity can be posed as an initial value problem on a cauchy surface there is a hierarchy of causality conditions each one of which is strictly stronger than the previous this is sometimes called the causal ladder the conditions from weakest to strongest are given are the definitions of these causality conditions for a lorentzian manifold formula 1 where two or more are given they are equivalent notation see causal structure for definitions of formula 4 formula 5 and formula 6 formula 7 formula 23 a manifold satisfying any of the weaker causality conditions defined above may fail to do so if the metric is given a small perturbation a spacetime is stably causal if it cannot be made to contain closed causal curves by arbitrarily small perturbations of the metric stephen hawking showed that this is equivalent to

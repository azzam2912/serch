this gene encodes a homodimeric protein that catalyses the cleavage of alpha 1 4 glucosidic bonds to release glucose 1 phosphate from liver glycogen stores this protein switches from inactive phosphorylase b to active phosphorylase a by phosphorylation of serine residue 14 activity of this enzyme is further regulated by multiple allosteric effectors and hormonal controls humans have three glycogen phosphorylase genes that encode distinct isozymes that are primarily expressed in liver brain and muscle respectively the liver isozyme serves the glycemic demands of the body in general while the brain and muscle isozymes supply just those tissues in glycogen storage disease type vi also known as hers disease mutations in liver glycogen phosphorylase inhibit the conversion of glycogen to glucose and results in moderate hypoglycemia mild ketosis growth retardation and hepatomegaly alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms provided by refseq feb 2011 the pygl gene encodes one of three major glycogen phosphorylase isoforms which are distinguished by their different structures and subcellular localizations brain pygb muscle pygm and liver pygl pygl spans 846 amino acids and shares fairly high homology in amino acid sequence with the other two isozymes with 73 similarity with pygm and

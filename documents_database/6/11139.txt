codd where all data is represented in terms of tuples grouped into relations a database organized in terms of the relational model is a relational database the purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it and let the database management system software take care of describing data structures for storing the data and retrieval procedures for answering queries most relational databases use the sql data definition and query language these systems implement what can be regarded as an engineering approximation to the relational model a table in an sql database schema corresponds to a predicate variable the contents of a table to a relation key constraints other constraints and sql queries correspond to predicates however sql databases deviate from the relational model in many details and codd fiercely argued against deviations that compromise the original principles the relational model s central idea is to describe a database as a collection of predicates over a finite set of predicate variables describing constraints on the possible values and combinations of values the content of the database at any given

while these traps may take place within any type of behavioral context e g mate selection navigation nest site selection the most empirically and theoretically well understood type of evolutionary trap is the ecological trap which represents maladaptive habitat selection behavior witherington demonstrates an interesting case of a navigational trap over evolutionary time hatchling sea turtles have evolved the tendency to migrate toward the light of the moon upon emerging from their sand nests however in the modern world this has resulted in them tending to orient towards bright beach front lighting which is a more intense light source than the moon as a result the hatchlings migrate up the beach and away from the ocean where they exhaust themselves desiccate and die either as a result of exhaustion dehydration or predation habitat selection is an extremely important process in the lifespan of most organisms that choice affects nearly all of an individual s subsequent choices so it may not be particularly surprising the type of evolutionary trap with the best empirical support is the ecological trap even so traps may be relatively difficult to detect and so the lack of evidence for other types of evolutionary trap may be

in the basic euler s method the tangent of the curve at formula 15 is computed using formula 16 the next value formula 17 is found where the tangent intersects the vertical line formula 18 however if the second derivative is only positive between formula 11 and formula 13 or only negative as in the diagram the curve will increasingly veer away from the tangent leading to larger errors as formula 5 increases the diagram illustrates that the tangent at the midpoint upper green line segment would most likely give a more accurate approximation of the curve in that interval this tangent is estimated by using the original euler s method to estimate the value of formula 12 at the midpoint then computing the slope of the tangent with formula 23 finally the improved tangent is used to calculate the value of formula 24 from formula 7 this last step is represented by the red chord in the diagram note that the red chord is not exactly parallel to the green segment the true tangent due to the error in estimating the value of formula 12 at the midpoint the local error at each step of the midpoint method is

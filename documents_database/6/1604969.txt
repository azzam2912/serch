established in the late 1960s brookhaven instruments pioneered modern techniques in characterizing nanoparticles proteins and polymers using light scattering techniques such as dynamic static electrophoretic and phase analysis for particle size zeta potential molecular mass and absolute molar mass analysis product designs started when their founders were postdoctoral students in the late 1960s today brookhaven instruments uses a variety of techniques including static dynamic electrophoretic phase analysis light scattering and specialized centrifuge technology to become one of the major players in the light scattering instrumentation market brookhaven instruments is in the materials analysis sector specializing in protein polymer and particle characterization with techniques in zeta potential molecular weight chromatography and dynamic light scattering these systems have applications across many industries including polymer and protein sciences pharmaceuticals the painting and coatings industries research institutions and food processing just to name a few microgravity experiments performed aboard the us space shuttle columbia helped physicists and chemical engineers at princeton university and nasa understand how the properties of engineering materials are determined by their atomic structure using equipment supplied by brookhaven instruments corporation in new york state provided the key to solving fundamental problems in condensed matter physics and lead to revolutionary new

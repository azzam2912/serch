similar to maxwell s distribution the maxwell j ttner distribution considers a classical ideal gas where the particles are dilute and do not significantly interact with each other the distinction from maxwell s case is that effects of special relativity are taken into account in the limit of low temperatures t much less than mc k where m is the mass of the kind of particle making up the gas c is the speed of light and k is boltzmann s constant this distribution becomes identical to the maxwell boltzmann distribution the distribution can be attributed to ferencz j ttner who derived it in 1911 it has become known as the maxwell j ttner distribution by analogy to the name maxwell boltzmann distribution that is commonly used to refer to maxwell s distribution as the gas becomes hotter and kt approaches or exceeds mc the probability distribution for formula 1 in this relativistic maxwellian gas is given by the maxwell j ttner distribution where formula 3 formula 4 and formula 5 is the modified bessel function of the second kind alternatively this can be written in terms of the momentum as where formula 7 the maxwell j ttner equation is

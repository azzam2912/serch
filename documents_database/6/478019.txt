wildberger currently a professor of mathematics at the university of new south wales his ideas are set out in his 2005 book divine proportions rational trigonometry to universal geometry according to new scientist part of his motivation for an alternative to traditional trigonometry was to avoid some problems that he claims occur when infinite series are used in mathematics rational trigonometry avoids direct use of transcendental functions like sine and cosine by substituting their squared equivalents wildberger draws inspiration from mathematicians predating georg cantor s infinite set theory like gauss and euclid who he claims were far more wary of using infinite sets than modern mathematicians to date rational trigonometry is largely unmentioned in mainstream mathematical literature rational trigonometry follows an approach built on the methods of linear algebra to the topics of elementary high school level geometry distance is replaced with its squared value quadrance and angle is replaced with the squared value of the usual sine ratio spread associated to either angle between two lines the complement of spread known as cross also corresponds to a scaled form of the inner product between line segments taken as vectors the three main laws in trigonometry pythagoras s theorem the

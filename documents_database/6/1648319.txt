while the 6 nitro substitution on the indole ring reduces affinity for both cb and cb relative to the unsubstituted parent compound am 2201 cb affinity is reduced much more resulting in a cb selectivity of around 13 times this is in contrast to other related compounds such as am 1221 where a 6 nitro substitution instead confers significant selectivity for cb am 1235 metabolism differs only slightly from that of jwh 018 am 1235 n dealkylation produces fluoropentane instead of pentane or plain alkanes in general it has been speculated that the fluoropentane might function as an alkylating agent or is further metabolized into toxic fluoroacetic acid this is not true since fluoroalkanes do not act as alkylating agents under normal conditions and uneven fluoroalkane chains metabolize into substantially less toxic fluoropropanoic acid in the united states all cb receptor agonists of the 3 1 naphthoyl indole class such as am 1235 are schedule i controlled substances

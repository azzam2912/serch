the attack was published in 1999 by david wagner who used it to break the coconut98 cipher the boomerang attack has allowed new avenues of attack for many ciphers previously deemed safe from differential cryptanalysis refinements on the boomerang attack have been published the amplified boomerang attack then the rectangle attack the boomerang attack is based on differential cryptanalysis in differential cryptanalysis an attacker exploits how differences in the input to a cipher the plaintext can affect the resultant difference at the output the ciphertext a high probability differential that is an input difference that will produce a likely output difference is needed that covers all or nearly all of the cipher the boomerang attack allows differentials to be used which cover only part of the cipher the attack attempts to generate a so called quartet structure at a point halfway through the cipher for this purpose say that the encryption action e of the cipher can be split into two consecutive stages e and e so that e m e e m where m is some plaintext message suppose we have two differentials for the two stages say for e and the basic attack proceeds as follows one attack

it was designed to allow high numbers of particles in simulations of molecular dynamics there is a direct or explicit and an implicit variant of the method the direct variant was published by schofield in 1973 as a personal communication from beeman this is what is commonly known as beeman s method it is a variant of the verlet integration method it produces identical positions but uses a different formula for the velocities beeman in 1976 published a class of implicit predictor corrector multi step methods where beeman s method is the direct variant of the third order method in this class the formula used to compute the positions at time formula 2 in the full predictor corrector scheme is using only the predictor formula and the corrector for the velocities one obtains a direct or explicit method which is a variant of the verlet integration method this is the variant that is usually understood as beeman s method beeman also proposed to alternatively replace the velocity update in the last equation by the second order adams moulton method where in systems where the forces are a function of velocity in addition to position the above equations need to be

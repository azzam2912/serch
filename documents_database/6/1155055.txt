the decree ordered parliamentary officers to give no quarter to irish soldiers fighting in england and wales and irish confederate sailors at sea the kilkenny confederacy sent 2 000 troops in three regiments under the command of alasdair maccolla to support montrose s royalist army in scotland who were fighting against the covenanters in 1644 during the years 1643 and 1644 they also promised to send 10 000 troops to england and wales the troops were never sent because the negotiations with charles i broke down over the public practice of catholicism and the independence of the irish parliament a ceasefire deal between the irish confederates and english royalists did result in the return of some 5 000 royalist troops from ireland in 1643 44 the confusion of these regiments with the irish catholics associated in parliamentarian minds with the massacres of the irish rebellion of 1641 did much to frighten english protestant opinion english parliamentarians had often taunted prince rupert that he was a german mercenary and while they could just about tolerate foreign protestants and english roman catholics fighting as royalists they considered support by foreign roman catholics a much greater threat even before the ordinance was passed

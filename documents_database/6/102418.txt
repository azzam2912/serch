the summation by parts formula is sometimes called abel s lemma or abel transformation suppose formula 1 and formula 2 are two sequences then using the forward difference operator formula 4 it can be stated more succinctly as note that summation by parts is an analogue to integration by parts an alternative statement is which is analogous to the integration by parts formula for semimartingales note also that although applications almost always deal with convergence of sequences the statement is purely algebraic and will work in any field it will also work when one sequence is in a vector space and the other is in the relevant field of scalars the formula is sometimes given in one of these slightly different forms which represent a special case formula 9 of the more general rule both result from iterated application of the initial formula the auxiliary quantities are newton series and a remarkable particular formula 14 result is the noteworthy identity here formula 16 is the binomial coefficient for two given sequences formula 17 and formula 18 with formula 19 one wants to study the sum of the following series formula 20 if we define formula 21 then for every formula

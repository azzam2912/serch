it was a vertical take off and landing tailsitter interceptor design for local defense of important factories or areas which had small or no airfields the triebfl gel had only reached wind tunnel testing when the allied forces reached the production facilities no complete prototype was ever built the design was particularly unusual it had no wings and all lift and thrust were provided by a rotor propeller assembly 1 3 of the way down the side of the craft roughly halfway between the cockpit and tailplane when the plane was sitting on its tail in the vertical position the rotors would have functioned similarly to a helicopter when flying horizontally they would function more like a giant propeller the three rotor blades were mounted on a ring assembly supported by bearings allowing free rotation around the fuselage at the end of each was a ramjet to start the rotors spinning simple rockets would have been used as the speed increased the flow of air would have been sufficient for the ramjets to work and the rockets would expire the pitch of the blades could be varied with the effect of changing the speed and the lift produced there was

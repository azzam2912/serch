these lists can also be sorted according to an object s mass and for the largest objects volume density and surface gravity insofar as these values are available this list contains the sun the planets dwarf planets many of the larger small solar system bodies which includes the asteroids all named natural satellites and a number of smaller objects of historical or scientific interest such as comets and near earth objects some objects in the lower tables despite their smaller radii may be more massive than objects in the upper tables because they have a higher density many trans neptunian objects tnos have been discovered in many cases their positions in this list are approximate as there can be a large uncertainty in their measurement solar system objects more massive than 10 kilograms one yottagram yg are known or expected to be approximately spherical astronomical bodies relax into rounded shapes ellipsoids achieving hydrostatic equilibrium when their own gravity is sufficient to overcome the structural strength of their material objects made of ice become round more easily than those made of rock and many icy objects are spheroidal at far lower sizes the cutoff boundary for roundness is somewhere between 100

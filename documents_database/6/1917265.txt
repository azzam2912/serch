it is defined as follows link together a non contiguous series of genomic sequences into a scaffold consisting of sequences separated by gaps of known length the sequences that are linked are typically contiguous sequences corresponding to read overlaps when creating a draft genome individual reads of dna are first assembled into contigs which by the nature of their assembly have gaps between them the next step is to then bridge the gaps between these contigs to create a scaffold this can be done using either optical mapping or mate pair sequencing the sequencing of the haemophilus influenzae genome marked the advent of scaffolding that project generated a total of 140 contigs who were oriented and linked using paired end reads the success of this strategy prompted the creation of the software grouper which was included in genome assemblers until 2001 this was the only scaffolding software after the human genome project and celera proved that it was possible to create a large draft genome several other similar programs were created bambus was created in 2003 and was a rewrite of the original grouper software but afforded researchers the ability to adjust scaffolding parameters this software also allowed for optional

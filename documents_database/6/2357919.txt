this mass is brooded in the mouth in the apogonidae and borne on the supraoccipital hook of the two species in the kurtidae they also have horizontal and vertical rows of sensory papillae on their heads and bodies which are often arranged in a pattern resembling a grid and similar patterns of sensory papillae can be observed in some species in the gobiiformes the two families comprising the kurtiformes are recovered as sister groups in some molecular phylogenies but as successive sisters to gobiiformes in some molecular phylogenies two extant families are classified under the order kurtiformes

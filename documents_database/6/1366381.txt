as a matter of fact until not too long ago the dogma was that in mammals guidance of spermatozoa to the oocyte was unnecessary this was due to the common belief that following ejaculation into the female genital tract large numbers of spermatozoa race towards the oocyte and compete to fertilize it research during the 1980s caused this belief to be taken apart when it became clear that only few of the ejaculated spermatozoa in humans only 1 of every million spermatozoa succeed in entering the oviducts fallopian tubes and when more recent studies showed that mammalian spermatozoa do respond chemotactically in sperm chemotaxis the oocyte secretes a chemoattractant which as it diffuses away forms a concentration gradient a high concentration close to the egg and a gradually lower concentration as the distance from the oocyte increases spermatozoa can sense this chemoattractant and orient their swimming direction up the concentration gradient towards the oocyte sperm chemotaxis was demonstrated in a large number of non mammalian species from marine invertebrates to frogs the sperm chemoattractants in non mammalian species vary to a large extent some examples are shown in table 1 so far most sperm chemoattractants that have been identified in

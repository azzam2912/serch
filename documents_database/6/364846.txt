michelson hendrik lorentz henri poincar and others it culminated in the theory of special relativity proposed by albert einstein and subsequent work of max planck hermann minkowski and others although isaac newton based his physics on absolute time and space he also adhered to the principle of relativity of galileo galilei restating it precisely for mechanical systems this can be stated as as far as the laws of mechanics are concerned all observers in inertial motion are equally privileged and no preferred state of motion can be attributed to any particular inertial observer however as to electromagnetic theory and electrodynamics during the 19th century the wave theory of light as a disturbance of a light medium or luminiferous ether was widely accepted the theory reaching its most developed form in the work of james clerk maxwell according to maxwell s theory all optical and electrical phenomena propagate through that medium which suggested that it should be possible to experimentally determine motion relative to the aether the failure of any known experiment to detect motion through the aether led hendrik lorentz starting in 1892 to develop a theory of electrodynamics based on an immobile luminiferous aether about whose material constitution lorentz

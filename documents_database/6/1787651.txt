rsted investigated and found the physical law describing the magnetic field now known as rsted s law rsted s discovery was the first connection found between electricity and magnetism and the first of two laws that link the two the other is faraday s law of induction these two laws became part of the equations that govern electromagnetism maxwell s equations rsted found that for a straight wire carrying a steady dc current the direction of the magnetic field at a point the direction of the arrowheads on the magnetic field lines which is the direction that the north pole of the compass needle points can be found from the current by the right hand rule if the right hand is wrapped around the wire so the thumb points in the direction of the current conventional current flow of positive charge the fingers will curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field the above rules can be generalized to give the modern vector form of rsted s law the line integral of the magnetic field formula 1 around any closed curve formula 2 is proportional to the total current formula 3 passing through any surface bounded by

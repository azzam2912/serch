since martingales can be used to model the wealth of a gambler participating in a fair game the optional stopping theorem says that on average nothing can be gained by stopping play based on the information obtainable so far i e without looking into the future certain conditions are necessary for this result to hold true in particular the theorem applies to doubling strategies the optional stopping theorem is an important tool of mathematical finance in the context of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing a discrete time version of the theorem is given below let be a discrete time martingale and a stopping time with values in both with respect to a filtration assume that one of the following three conditions holds then is an almost surely well defined random variable and formula 3 similarly if the stochastic process is a submartingale or a supermartingale and one of the above conditions holds then for a submartingale and for a supermartingale under condition it is possible that happens with positive probability on this event is defined as the almost surely existing pointwise limit of see the proof below for details let denote the stopped process it is also a martingale

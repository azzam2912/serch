it may have descended from a similar attack called rabbits reported from 1969 on a burroughs 5500 at the university of washington fork bombs operate both by consuming cpu time in the process of forking and by saturating the operating system s process table a basic implementation of a fork bomb is an infinite loop that repeatedly launches new copies of itself in unix like operating systems fork bombs are generally written to use the fork system call as forked processes are also copies of the first program once they resume execution from the next address at the frame pointer they continue forking endlessly within their own copy of the same infinite loop this has the effect of causing an exponential growth in processes as modern unix systems generally use a copy on write resource management technique when forking new processes a fork bomb generally will not saturate such a system s memory microsoft windows operating systems do not have an equivalent functionality to the unix fork system call a fork bomb on such an operating system must therefore create a new process instead of forking from an existing one f f f f fork f f f f an

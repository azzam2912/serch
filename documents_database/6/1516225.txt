the experiment used significant amounts of a short lived radioisotope lanthanum 140 a potent source of gamma radiation the rala is a contraction of radioactive lanthanum the method was proposed by robert serber and developed by a team led by the italian experimental physicist bruno rossi the tests were performed with 1 8 inch 3 2 mm spheres of radioactive lanthanum equal to about and later located in the center of a simulated nuclear device the explosive lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests some 254 tests were conducted between september 1944 and march 1962 in his history of the los alamos project david hawkins wrote rala became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design the experiment was suggested on 1 november 1943 by robert serber the idea was to measure the spatial and temporal symmetry of explosive compression of a metal sphere the test measured changes of absorption of gamma rays in the metal of the sphere as it underwent compression the gamma ray source was located in the center of a metal sphere the increase of thickness of hollow shells and density of solid spheres as the compression progressed was detected as a

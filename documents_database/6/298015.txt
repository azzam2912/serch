it is a data structure used among others in full text indices data compression algorithms and within the field of bibliometrics suffix arrays were introduced by as a simple space efficient alternative to suffix trees they had independently been discovered by gaston gonnet in 1987 under the name pat array enhanced suffix arrays esas are suffix arrays with additional tables that reproduce the full functionality of suffix trees preserving the same time and memory complexity the suffix array for a subset of all suffixes of a string is called sparse suffix array multiple probabilistic algorithms have been developed to minimize the additional memory usage including an optimal time and memory algorithm let formula 3 be a string and let formula 4 denote the substring of formula 5 ranging from formula 6 to formula 7 the suffix array formula 8 of formula 5 is now defined to be an array of integers providing the starting positions of suffixes of formula 5 in lexicographical order this means an entry formula 11 contains the starting position of the formula 6 th smallest suffix in formula 5 and thus for all formula 14 formula 15 each suffix of formula 5 shows up in formula

just as exponentiation has two inverse functions roots and logarithms tetration has two inverse functions super roots and super logarithms there are several ways of interpreting super logarithms for positive integer values the super logarithm with base e is equivalent to the number of times a logarithm must be iterated to get to 1 the iterated logarithm however this is not true for negative values and so cannot be considered a full definition the precise definition of the super logarithm depends on a precise definition of non integral tetration that is formula 1 for y not an integer there is no clear consensus on the definition of non integral tetration and so there is likewise no clear consensus on the super logarithm for non integer range the super logarithm written formula 2 is defined implicitly by this definition implies that the super logarithm can only have integer outputs and that it is only defined for inputs of the form formula 5 and so on in order to extend the domain of the super logarithm from this sparse set to the real numbers several approaches have been pursued these usually include a third requirement in addition to those listed above which

it has been widely used to study gaseous samples which absorb light at specific wavelengths and in turn to determine mole fractions down to the parts per trillion level the technique is also known as cavity ring down laser absorption spectroscopy crlas a typical crds setup consists of a laser that is used to illuminate a high finesse optical cavity which in its simplest form consists of two highly reflective mirrors when the laser is in resonance with a cavity mode intensity builds up in the cavity due to constructive interference the laser is then turned off in order to allow the measurement of the exponentially decaying light intensity leaking from the cavity during this decay light is reflected back and forth thousands of times between the mirrors giving an effective path length for the extinction on the order of a few kilometers if a light absorbing material is now placed in the cavity the mean lifetime decreases as fewer bounces through the medium are required before the light is absorbed a crds setup measures how long it takes for the light to decay to 1 e of its initial intensity and this ringdown time can be used to calculate

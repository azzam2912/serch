one type of efps is the people detector the people detector is a micro electronic based device that can detect the presence of both moving and stationary objects through solid materials its ability to operate through any non conductive material permits complete invisibility the sensor functions by detecting small changes in an ultra low power electromagnetic field generated between two remotely located antenna electrodes its range is adjustable from a few centimetres inches to 4 m over 12 feet electric field proximity detectors can detect partially conducting or conducting objects and does not depend on impedance to ground because ef sensors provide comparatively low amounts of data they have the potential to provide several advantages over optical systems electric field systems can be made smaller lighter and power efficient valuable qualities in an age of ever shrinking electronics such as palm and watch based computers since ef sensors penetrate non conducting materials they can remain hidden allowing them to remain protected from weather efps systems today are used in a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications including automobile airbag systems to determine where passengers are seated in advanced robotic manipulators to determine the properties of an object in the

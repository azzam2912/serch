in axiomatic set theory as developed for example in the zfc axioms the existence of the power set of any set is postulated by the axiom of power set any subset of is called a family of sets over if is the set then the subsets of are and hence the power set of is if is a finite set with elements then the number of subsets of is this fact which is the motivation for the notation may be demonstrated simply as follows cantor s diagonal argument shows that the power set of a set whether infinite or not always has strictly higher cardinality than the set itself informally the power set must be larger than the original set in particular cantor s theorem shows that the power set of a countably infinite set is uncountably infinite the power set of the set of natural numbers can be put in a one to one correspondence with the set of real numbers see cardinality of the continuum the power set of a set together with the operations of union intersection and complement can be viewed as the prototypical example of a boolean algebra in fact one can show that any

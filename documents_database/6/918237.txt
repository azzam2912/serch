in passive portfolio management the aim is to obtain a relative return as close to zero as possible thereby reproducing the return of the theoretical reference portfolio when the relative return is positive the portfolio is said to outperform the benchmark conversely when the relative return is negative the portfolio is said to underperform the benchmark within passive portfolio management the absolute value of the relative return is often called the tracking error which is confusing since the tracking error is more generally defined as the standard deviation of the relative return index funds are the financial products that use passively managed portfolios the relative return measure is a useful measure to evaluate the skill of the portfolio manager if the relative return is positive then the portfolio manager has skill however the relative return measure by itself is not sufficient to quantify how much skill a portfolio manager has since the measure does not take into account the amount of risk that the portfolio manager has taken in order to compare two outperforming portfolio managers one should therefore consider not only the relative return but also the risk taken by each portfolio manager juxtaposed with the relative return measure

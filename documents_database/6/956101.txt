aquarium filters remove physical and soluble chemical waste products from aquaria simplifying maintenance furthermore aquarium filters are necessary to support life as aquaria are relatively small closed volumes of water compared to the natural environment of most fish animals typically fish kept in fish tanks produce waste from excrement and respiration another source of waste is uneaten food or plants and fish which have died these waste products collect in the tanks and contaminate the water as the degree of contamination rises the risk to the health of the aquaria increases and removal of the contamination becomes critical filtration is a common method used for maintenance of healthy aquaria proper management of the nitrogen cycle is a vital element of a successful aquarium excretia and other decomposing organic matter produce ammonia which is highly toxic to fish bacterial processes oxidize this ammonia into the slightly less toxic nitrites and these are in turn oxidized to form the much less toxic nitrates in the natural environment these nitrates are subsequently taken up by plants as fertilizer and this does indeed happen to some extent in an aquarium planted with real plants an aquarium is however an imperfect microcosm of the natural

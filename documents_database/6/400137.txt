the precise definition of the solution is quite complicated but very instructive any exact solution of the einstein field equation which models an electromagnetic field must take into account all gravitational effects of the energy and mass of the electromagnetic field besides the electromagnetic field if there lacks matter and non gravitational fields present we must simultaneously solve the einstein field equation and the maxwell field equations in maxwell s theory of electromagnetism one of the most important types of an electromagnetic field are those representing electromagnetic radiation of these the most important examples are the electromagnetic plane waves in which the radiation has planar wavefronts moving in a specific direction at the speed of light of these the most basic are the monochromatic plane waves in which only one frequency component is present this is precisely the phenomenon which our solution will model in terms of general relativity the metric tensor of the unique exact solution modeling a linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave with amplitude and frequency can be written in terms of rosen coordinates in the form where formula 2 is the first positive root of where formula 3 in this chart are null coordinate vectors while are

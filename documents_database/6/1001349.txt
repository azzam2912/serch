in such a study it may be known that an individual s age at death is at least 75 years but may be more such a situation could occur if the individual withdrew from the study at age 75 or if the individual is currently alive at the age of 75 censoring also occurs when a value occurs outside the range of a measuring instrument for example a bathroom scale might only measure up to if a individual is weighed using the scale the observer would only know that the individual s weight is at least the problem of censored data in which the observed value of some variable is partially known is related to the problem of missing data where the observed value of some variable is unknown censoring should not be confused with the related idea truncation with censoring observations result either in knowing the exact value that applies or in knowing that the value lies within an interval with truncation observations never result in values outside a given range values in the population outside the range are never seen or never recorded if they are seen note that in statistics truncation is not the same as rounding

aldolase can also produce dhap from other 3s 4r ketose 1 phosphates such as fructose 1 phosphate and sedoheptulose 1 7 bisphosphate gluconeogenesis and the calvin cycle which are anabolic pathways use the reverse reaction glycolysis a catabolic pathway uses the forward reaction aldolase is divided into two classes by mechanism the word aldolase also refers more generally to an enzyme that performs an aldol reaction creating an aldol or its reverse cleaving an aldol such as sialic acid aldolase which forms sialic acid see the list of aldolases class i proteins form a protonated schiff base intermediate linking a highly conserved active site lysine with the dhap carbonyl carbon additionally tyrosine residues are crucial to this mechanism in acting as stabilizing hydrogen acceptors class ii proteins use a different mechanism which polarizes the carbonyl group with a divalent cation like zn the escherichia coli galactitol operon protein gaty and n acetyl galactosamine operon protein agay which are tagatose bisphosphate aldolase are homologs of class ii fructose bisphosphate aldolase two histidine residues in the first half of the sequence of these homologs have been shown to be involved in binding zinc the protein subunits of both classes each have an

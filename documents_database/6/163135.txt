microtubules are one type of fibre which constitutes the cytoskeleton and the dynamic microtubule network has several important roles in the cell including vesicular transport forming the mitotic spindle and in cytokinesis several drugs including vincristine and colcemid are similar to nocodazole in that they interfere with microtubule polymerization nocodazole has been shown to decrease the oncogenic potential of cancer cells via another microtubules independent mechanisms nocodazole stimulates the expression of lats2 which potently inhibits the wnt signaling pathway by abrogating the interaction between the wnt dependent transcriptional co factors beta catenin and bcl9 it is related to mebendazole by replacement of the left most benzene ring by thiophene as nocodazole affects the cytoskeleton it is often used in cell biology experiments as a control for example some dominant negative rho small gtpases cause a similar effect as nocodazole and constitutively activated mutants often reverse or negate the effect nocodazole is frequently used in cell biology laboratories to synchronize the cell division cycle cells treated with nocodazole arrest with a g2 or m phase dna content when analyzed by flow cytometry microscopy of nocodazole treated cells shows that they do enter mitosis but cannot form metaphase spindles because microtubules of

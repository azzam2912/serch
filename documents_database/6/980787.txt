similarly the functions ker x and kei x are the real and imaginary parts respectively of where is the order modified bessel function of the second kind these functions are named after william thomson 1st baron kelvin while the kelvin functions are defined as the real and imaginary parts of bessel functions with x taken to be real the functions can be analytically continued for complex arguments with the exception of ber x and bei x for integral n the kelvin functions have a branch point at x 0 below is the gamma function and is the digamma function for integers n ber x has the series expansion where is the gamma function the special case ber x commonly denoted as just ber x has the series expansion and asymptotic series where for integers n bei x has the series expansion the special case bei x commonly denoted as just bei x has the series expansion and asymptotic series where formula 12 and formula 13 are defined as for ber x for integers n ker x has the complicated series expansion the special case ker x commonly denoted as just ker x has the series expansion and the asymptotic series

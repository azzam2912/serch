it is being developed to hopefully function as a brain computer interface bci for people with paralyzed or missing limbs who will use their neural signals or thoughts to control powered exoskeletons and robotic prosthesis the device was conceived by australian neurologist thomas oxley who has been developing the medical implant since 2010 using sheep for testing the fda is reviewing plans to start human trials in the us starting in 2019 neurologist thomas oxley has been developing the implant since 2010 through a company he founded called synchron the small implant is an electrode array made of platinum that is mounted on a nitinol endovascular stent the device measures about 5 cm long and a maximum of 4 mm in diameter the implant is capable of two way communication meaning that it can both sense thoughts and stimulate movement essentially acting as a feedback loop within the brain which offers potential applications for helping people with spinal cord injuries and control robotic prosthetic limbs with their thoughts the stentrode device is implanted via the jugular vein into a blood vessel near the cortical tissue near the motor cortex and sensory cortex so open brain surgery is avoided insertion via

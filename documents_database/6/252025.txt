inactive prodrugs are pharmacologically inactive medications that are metabolized into an active form within the body instead of administering a drug directly a corresponding prodrug might be used instead to improve how a medicine is absorbed distributed metabolized and excreted adme prodrugs are often designed to improve bioavailability when a drug itself is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract a prodrug may be used to improve how selectively the drug interacts with cells or processes that are not its intended target this reduces adverse or unintended effects of a drug especially important in treatments like chemotherapy which can have severe unintended and undesirable side effects many herbal extracts historically used in medicine contain glycosides sugar derivatives of the active agent which are hydrolyzed in the intestines to release the active and more bioavailable aglycone for example salicin is a d glucopyranoside that is cleaved by esterases to release salicylic acid aspirin acetylsalicylic acid first made by felix hoffmann at bayer in 1897 is a synthetic prodrug of salicylic acid however in other cases such as codeine and morphine the administered drug is enzymatically activated to form sugar derivatives morphine glucuronides that are more active than the parent compound the first

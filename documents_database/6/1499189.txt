these types of machines are found in metalworking woodworking stone cutting and carbon fiber fabricating shops many modern machines generate well in excess of 50 000 n 12 000 lbf measuring and maintaining this force is an important and necessary part of a machine shop preventative maintenance plan modern drawbar force gauges typically are based on a force sensor that uses bonded strain gauges and electronics to convert the resulting output into a digital display for the user to view earlier versions of these gauges sometimes also used a sealed hydraulic cavity with a pressure gauge to measure and display force these hydraulic gauges are generally considered less accurate because of the physical limitations of the indicator drawbar force gauges allow early detection of problems with the spindle s belleville spring stack verification of performance of the clamping system as a whole help prevent damage to spindle taper and other machine features critical to machining accuracy and ultimately help to keep the machine operator safe drawbar force measurement has been made much more important in recent years with the introduction of radically higher rpm machines these machines are necessary to work the modern materials required in a multitude of applications

m 2 replaces the minisata standard which uses the mini pci express physical card layout and connectors employing a more flexible physical specification the m 2 allows different module widths and lengths and paired with the availability of more advanced interfacing features makes the m 2 more suitable than msata in general for solid state storage applications and particularly in smaller devices such as ultrabooks and tablets computer bus interfaces provided through the m 2 connector are pci express 3 0 up to four lanes serial ata 3 0 and usb 3 0 a single logical port for each of the latter two it is up to the manufacturer of the m 2 host or module to select which interfaces are to be supported depending on the desired level of host support and device type the m 2 connector keying notches denote various purposes and capabilities of both m 2 hosts and devices the unique key notches of m 2 modules also prevent them from being inserted into incompatible host connectors nvm express non volatile memory express is additionally supported as the preferred logical device interface for m 2 pci express ssds to replace the legacy advanced host controller interface

this dark red crystalline solid is the smallest stable binary rhodium carbonyl it is used as a catalyst in organic synthesis the structure of rh co is described by a tetrahedral array of four rh atoms with nine terminal co ligands and three bridging co ligands the structure can be expressed as rh co co it is prepared by treatment of an aqueous solution of rhodium trichloride with activated copper metal under an atmosphere of co alternatively the compound can be prepared by treatment of a methanolic solution of rhcl ho with co to afford h rhcl co followed by carbonylation in the presence of sodium citrate the cluster undergoes thermal substitution with phosphorus ligands l because of their relevance to hydroformylation catalysis the metal carbonyls has been systematically studied to a high degree the instability of rh co has been a source of curiosity the analogous binary carbonyl of cobalt co co is well known solutions of rh co under high pressures of co convert to the dirhodium compound unlike co co which features bridging carbonyls the main isomer of rh co features only terminal co ligands the relative instability of rh co is analogous to the tendency of

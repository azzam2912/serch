the mineral is white to colorless and occurs as groupings of acicular needle shaped crystals it was discovered in 1983 in northern yukon canada and described in 1986 rapidcreekite is structurally and compositionally similar to gypsum rapidcreekite is transparent and white to colorless the mineral occurs as isolated clusters or pervasive crusts of radiating sprays of acicular crystals up to in length in the structure of rapidcreekite there are two distinct calcium sites coordinated by six oxygen anions and two ho groups arranged as a square antiprism the sulfur site is tetrahedrally coordinated by oxygen anions and the carbon site is coordinated by a triangle of oxygen anions the structural unit of rapidcreekite is a sheet that consists of edge sharing ca polyhedra unspecified species o or oh cross linked by carbonate and sulfate groups sheets are held together by weakening hydrogen bonds accounting for the perfect cleavage along 100 the structure and composition of rapidcreekite is similar to that of gypsum if half of the sulfate groups in gypsum were replaced by carbonate the formula of rapidcreekite is obtained if gypsum were transformed by twinning along alternate rows of sulfate groups and the resultant triangles of oxygen along the

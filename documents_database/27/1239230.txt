the other component is an intermediate mass star the source exhibits complex time variability pulsing with a period of 1 24 s due to the rotation of the neutron star eclipsing every 1 70 days with the period of the binary orbit and also varying with a 35 day period believed associated with the precession of the accretion disk from observations a twisted accretion disk in retrograde precession modulates the x rays illuminating hz her and earth the 1 24 second pulsar period associated with her x 1 is immediately evident from the data the sharp cut off at 24 kev in the flat spectrum observed for her x 1 in this exposure provided the first reported evidence for radiative transfer effects to be associated with a highly magnetized plasma near the surface of a neutron star the actual announcement of the discovery of hercules x 1 by uhuru occurred at the 1971 72 winter meeting of the high energy astrophysics division aas held in san juan the original discovery of this periodically pulsating binary x ray source occurred in november 1971 the position of her x 1 was uncertain due to the failure of the uhuru star aspect sensors

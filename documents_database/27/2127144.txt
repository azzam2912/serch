polyglot programming a term coined by neal ford in 2006 expresses the idea that computer applications should be written in a mix of different programming languages in order to take advantage of the fact that different languages are suitable for tackling different problems complex applications combine different types of problems so picking the right language for each job may be more productive than trying to solve all aspects of the problem using a single language this same concept can be applied to databases that an application can communicate with different databases using each for what it is best at to achieve an end goal hence the term polyglot persistence there are numerous databases available to solve different problems using a single database to satisfy all of a program s requirements can result in a non performant jack of all trades master of none solution relational databases for example are good at enforcing relationships that exist between various data tables to discover a relationship or to find data from different tables that belong to the same object an sql join operation can be used this might work when the data is smaller in size but becomes problematic when the data involved

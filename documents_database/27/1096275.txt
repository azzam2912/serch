the apparent magnitude is 4 82 4 17 trillion times fainter than the sun and the absolute magnitude is 2 35 9 82 times brighter than the sun it is an orange k type subgiant star of spectral type k1iv meaning it has nearly completely exhausted its hydrogen supply in its core it is 1 32 times as massive as the sun yet has brightened to 11 6 times its luminosity around 2 5 billion years old it was formerly an a type main sequence star in march 2013 it was announced that resolved images of at least one dust disk surrounding kappa coronae borealis were captured making it the first subgiant to host such circumstellar belt the disk extends out to 120 au in october 2007 a giant planet was found by johnson et al who used the radial velocity method in 2012 it was confirmed this planet was assumed to be outside the habitable zone on the assumption that the star is k1iva given the star s luminosity the planet is more likely on the zone s inner edge the width of the circumstellar belt suggests the presence of a second planetary companion of the star either within

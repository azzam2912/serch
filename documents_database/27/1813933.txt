the extension is analytic on the open disk the extension has an important equivariance property if the homeomorphism is composed on either side with a m bius transformation preserving the unit circle the extension is also obtained by composition with the same m bius transformation if the homeomorphism is quasisymmetric the diffeomorphism is quasiconformal an extension for quasisymmetric homeomorphisms had previously been given by ahlfors and arne beurling a different equivariant construction had been given in 1985 by pekka tukia equivariant extensions have important applications in teichm ller theory for example they lead to a quick proof of the contractibility of the teichm ller space of a fuchsian group by the rad kneser choquet theorem the poisson integral of a homeomorphism f of the circle defines a harmonic diffeomorphism of the unit disk extending f if f is quasisymmetric the extension is not necessarily quasiconformal i e the complex dilatation does not necessarily satisfy have an upper bound strictly less than one on the other hand if f is quasi m bius and fixes 1 i and i then f satisfies a h lder continuity condition for another positive constant c independent of f the same is true for the

the aperture is a little less than half as high as the entire shell the shell contains approximately 11 whorls in the adult increasing regularly in size the protoconch is obtuse and rather elevated thrice coiled the initial volution is smooth polished largely submerged the succeeding whorls turn inflated but gradually flattening away from the apex the final turn of the protoconch is compressed laterally sculptured with crowded asymmetrically arcuate axial riblets about 20 to the whorl extending from the posterior suture to the periphery which is cut off from the anterior suture by a rather deep linear channel the beginning of the conch is marked by the initiation of 5 spiral lirae the posterior of which is the broadest and the anterior which outlines the periphery the most elevated the sculpture is modified on the later volutions by the increasing prominence of the peripheral spiral and that directly behind it the intercalation of secondaries and the development of undulatory axials 8 to 10 to the whorl these are indicated chiefly in the crenulation of the peripheral spirals the periphery of antepenult whorls is situated a little more than one third of the distance across from the anterior to the

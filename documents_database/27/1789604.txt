the unit comprises the base horizontal unit of the platform around granite gorge inner gorge on the colorado river and because of its hardness creates the tonto platform upon which the two slope forming highly erodable units the muav limestone and bright angel shale lie the tapeats sandstone and the tonto platform follow the colorado river and surrounding tributary canyons creeks watercourses or washes in a dendritic fashion much like the branches of a tree the tapeats unit is the bottom member of the tonto group a typical marine transgression series of sandstone conglomerate shale limestone all part of a paleo sea initially adjacent to land the source of the tapeats rocks conglomerates and sand a regressing sequence has the reverse order the tapeats sea at the early devonian ceased to deposit more muav limestone and a period of erosion ensued a deposition unconformity the tapeats sandstone was laid upon the vishnu basement rocks after an unconformity of erosion the great unconformity of 1 000 million years 1 0 billion besides the erosion unconformity the unkar group of the basement rocks are also at an angular unconformity being an 8 member sequence tilted at 45 degrees the horizontal tonto platform

the line approximately eight miles long was also sometimes referred to as the micklehurst loop and the stalybridge and diggle loop line the london and north western railway had built its line from stalybridge to huddersfield through standedge tunnel between 1847 and 1849 and it opened on 1 august 1849 for through trains between liverpool lime street manchester victoria huddersfield and leeds the increasing number of passenger and goods trains on the route required a second single bore tunnel to be built opening in february 1871 a further growth in traffic required construction of a double track tunnel which was completed in august 1894 to effectively serve the four railway tracks through the standedge tunnels an additional twin track railway line was required the original track had been built on the steep western slopes of the tame valley making it difficult to add a second pair of tracks alongside so the new line was built in parallel along the eastern side of the valley and about one mile distant the new line was completed in 1885 whilst the line had mainly been built with through goods trains in mind the lnwr built four intermediate passenger stations on the line all

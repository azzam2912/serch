western blot for protein or for dna extraction most lysis buffers contain buffering salts e g tris hcl and ionic salts e g nacl to regulate the ph and osmolarity of the lysate sometimes detergents such as triton x 100 or sds are added to break up membrane structures for lysis buffers targeted at protein extraction protease inhibitors are often included and in difficult cases may be almost required lysis buffers can be used on both animal and plant tissue cells the primary purpose of lysis buffer is isolating the molecules of interest and keeping them in a stable environment for proteins for some experiments the target proteins should be completely denatured while in some other experiments the target protein should remain folded and functional different proteins also have different properties and are found in different cellular environments thus it is essential to choose the best buffer based on the purpose and design of the experiments the important factors to be considered are ph ionic strength usage of detergent protease inhibitors to prevent proteolytic processes for example detergent addition is necessary when lysing gram negative bacteria but not for gram positive bacteria it is common that a protease inhibitor is

the ndufab1 protein is a subunit of nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain the ndufab1 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 16 at position 12 2 and it spans 15 327 base pairs the ndufab1 gene produces a 17 4 kda protein composed of 156 amino acids ndufab1 is a subunit of the enzyme nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone the largest of the respiratory complexes the structure is l shaped with a long hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the nadh binding site ndufab1 is one of about 31 hydrophobic subunits that form the transmembrane region of complex i it has been noted that the n terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a c terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of complex i the highly conserved two domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an anchor for the nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone complex

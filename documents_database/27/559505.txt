such systems are therefore also known as infinite dimensional systems typical examples are systems described by partial differential equations or by delay differential equations with u x and y hilbert spaces and formula 1 l x formula 2 l u x formula 3 l x y and formula 4 l u y the following equations determine a discrete time linear time invariant system with formula 7 the state a sequence with values in x formula 8 the input or control a sequence with values in u and formula 9 the output a sequence with values in y the continuous time case is similar to the discrete time case but now one considers differential equations instead of difference equations an added complication now however is that to include interesting physical examples such as partial differential equations and delay differential equations into this abstract framework one is forced to consider unbounded operators usually a is assumed to generate a strongly continuous semigroup on the state space x assuming b c and d to be bounded operators then already allows for the inclusion of many interesting physical examples but the inclusion of many other interesting physical examples forces unboundedness of b and c

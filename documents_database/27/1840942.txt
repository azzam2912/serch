this optical output separates it from typical transistors and because optical signals travel faster than electrical signals has the potential to speed up computing immensely researchers who discovered the transistor laser developed a new model of kirchhoff s current law to better model the behavior of simultaneous optical and electrical output the team credited with discovering the transistor laser was headed by milton feng and nick holonyak jr and was based at the university of illinois at urbana champaign research into the transistor laser came about after feng and holonyak created the first light emitting transistor in 2004 feng and his team then modified the light emitting transistor to focus the light it output into a laser beam their research was funded by darpa the paper written about the discovery of the transistor laser was ranked as a top five paper out of all of applied physics letters history and the transistor laser was called one of the top 100 discoveries by discover the transistor laser functions like a typical transistor but emits infrared light through one of its outputs rather than electricity a reflective cavity within the device focuses the emitted light into a laser beam the transistor laser

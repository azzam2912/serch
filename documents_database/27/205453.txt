when k is odd this will happen on the interval between 0 and formula 4 more generally this will happen on any interval of length 2formula 4 for k even and formula 4 for k odd if k is a half integer e g 1 2 3 2 5 2 the curve will be rose shaped with 4 k petals example n 7 d 2 k n d 3 5 as changes from 0 to 4formula 4 if k can be expressed as n 1 6 where n is a nonzero integer the curve will be rose shaped with 12 k petals if k can be expressed as n 3 where n is an integer not divisible by 3 the curve will be rose shaped with n petals if n is odd and 2 n petals if n is even if k is rational then the curve is closed and has finite length if k is irrational then it is not closed and has infinite length furthermore the graph of the rose in this case forms a dense set i e it comes arbitrarily close to every point in the unit disk since for all formula 10 the curves given

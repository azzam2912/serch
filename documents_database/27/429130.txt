since different testing companies use different ethnic reference groups and different matching algorithms ethnicity estimates for an individual will vary between tests sometimes dramatically three principal types of genealogical dna tests are available with each looking at a different part of the genome and useful for different types of genealogical research autosomal mitochondrial mtdna and y dna autosomal tests may result in a large amount of dna matches other test persons that the individual may be related to along mixed male and female lines each match with an estimated distance in the family tree however due to the random nature of which and how much dna is inherited by each tested person from their common ancestors precise conclusions can only be made for close relations traditional genealogical research and the sharing of family trees is typically required for interpretation of the results autosomal tests are also used in estimating ethnic mix mtdna and y dna tests are much more objective however they give considerably fewer dna matches if any since they are limited to relationships along a strict female line and a strict male line respectively mtdna and y dna tests are utilized to identify archeological cultures and migration paths

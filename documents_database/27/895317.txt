metering pulses are also known as billing pulses and tax pulses the properties of metering signals differ between the telephone administrations in various countries some systems use alternating current pulses superimposed on the direct current battery levels of the local loop while others may use a reversal of tip ring polarity of the wire pair common frequencies of the a c pulses are 50 hz 12 khz and 16 khz with typical durations of the signal varying from several tens to hundreds of milliseconds 50 hz pulses are applied to the telephone circuit as common mode signals with respect to ground as applying them differentially would make them audible for the talking parties as buzzing tones the pulse amplitude rms voltage is high enough to distinguish them from signals induced from mains electricity 12 and 16 khz metering pulses are applied differentially across the telephone circuit as these frequencies cannot be heard by listeners with conventional telephone instruments each pulse represents an incremental cost for calls with higher billing rates the exchange equipment generates metering pulses at a higher rate than during calls to cheaper destinations or during periods of lower billing rates on residential telephone lines metering pulses are

a limitation to most in cylinder ldts is that the hydraulic cylinder s piston rod must be bored through its center to accommodate certain elements of the ldt usually the waveguide tube of a magnetostrictive transducer the machining and additional production steps associated with gun drilling the piston rod add substantial cost to the finished cylinder and although magnetostrictive ldts provide extremely high accuracy this accuracy usually is much greater than is needed for most mobile equipment applications installing linear position sensors into hydraulic cylinders has been a sore subject for cylinder manufacturers for a long time extensive fabrication headaches including gun drilling the need to stock all different sensor lengths and handling issues have contributed to industry frustration cpi has been developing a new generation of sensors which eliminates the need for gun drilling cpi sl series sensors install into standard hydraulic cylinders with minimal modifications and are suitable for field retrofit where rod type sensors have failed the cable connector installs into the piston or rod via a 7 16 20 threaded connector and the sensor is coupled to the cylinder via a hydraulic hose through a 8 sae port external linear displacement transducers ldts eliminate the need

based on the usn s f 11 tiger the f11f 1f did not proceed beyond the two f11f 1f prototypes as an improvement to the f11f 1 f 11a fighter grumman proposed a more advanced version of the airframe known as the f11f 1f super tiger this was the result of a 1955 study to fit the new general electric j79 engine into the f11f airframe the navy was sufficiently interested to authorize modification of two production f11f 1s with enlarged air intakes and yj79 ge 3 turbojets with the result being designated the f11f 1f indicating a production f11f 1 with a special engine fit the aircraft first flew on 25 may 1956 reaching mach 1 44 in one of the flights after the addition of 60 wing root fillets a 13 5 in 35 cm fuselage extension and an uprated j79 engine the f11f 1f reached an impressive mach 2 04 in 1957 thus becoming the first naval aircraft in the world to exceed mach 2 two years before the f4h the f8u 3 and the a3j this was a surprise even to grumman which had expected a top speed of only mach 1 4 at altitude by

it was considered a very distinct subspecies of the sharp beaked ground finch geospiza difficilis endemic to wolf and darwin islands the international ornithologists union has split the species supported by strong genetic evidence that they are not closely related and divergences in morphology and song other taxonomic authorities still consider it conspecific the vampire finch is sexually dimorphic as typical for its genus with the males being primarily black and the females grey with brown streaks it has a lilting song on wolf a buzzing song on darwin and whistling calls on both islands only on wolf a drawn out buzzing call is also uttered this bird is most famous for its unusual diet when alternative sources are scarce the vampire finch occasionally feeds by drinking the blood of other birds chiefly the nazca and blue footed boobies pecking at their skin with their sharp beaks until blood is drawn curiously the boobies do not offer much resistance against this it has been theorized that this behavior evolved from the pecking behavior that the finch used to clean parasites from the plumage of the booby the finches also feed on eggs stealing them just after they are laid and

another advantage is the ability to trigger the lbist of an integrated circuit while running a built in self test or power on self test of the finished product lbist that requires additional circuitry or read only memory increases the cost of the integrated circuit lbist that only requires temporary changes to programmable logic or rewritable memory avoids this extra cost but requires more time to first program in the bist and then to remove it and program in the final configuration another disadvantage of lbist is the possibility that the on chip testing hardware itself can fail external automated test equipment tests the integrated circuit with known good test circuitry other related technologies are mbist a bist optimized for testing internal memory and abist either a bist optimized for testing arrays or a bist that is optimized for testing analog circuitry the two uses may be distinguished by considering whether the integrated circuit being tested has an internal array or analog functions

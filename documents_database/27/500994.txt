the process consists of either invited or proffered submissions of the abstract or summary of work the abstract typically states the hypothesis tools used in research or investigation data collected and a summary or interpretation of the data the abstracts usually undergo peer review after which they are accepted or rejected by the conference chair or committee and then allocated to conference sessions the abstracts may be presented as an oral talk or as an illustrated poster during the event abstracts are often published before or after the event as conference proceedings or in academic journals or online in some cases submission of a full paper may be required before final acceptance is given in some fields e g computer science most mainstream conferences and workshops ask for the submission of full papers rather than just abstracts and academic program committees peer review the full paper to a standard comparable to journal publication before accepting a paper for presentation at the conference and publishing it in an edited proceedings series the abstract management process is closely tied to the need to provide continuing education to professionals especially continuing medical education many annual meetings hosted by specialty societies provide educational credit

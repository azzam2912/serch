it is especially common with modern compact and ultra compact digital cameras caused by the backscatter of light by unfocused particles these artifacts are also sometimes called orbs referring to a common paranormal claim some appear with trails suggesting motion backscatter commonly occurs in low light scenes when the camera s flash is used cases include nighttime and underwater photography when a bright light source and reflective unfocused particles are near the camera light appears much brighter very near the source due to the inverse square law which says light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source the artifact can result from the backscatter or retroreflection of the light from airborne solid particles such as dust or pollen or liquid droplets especially rain or mist they can also be caused by foreign material within the camera lens the image artifacts usually appear as either white or semi transparent circles though may also occur with whole or partial color spectra purple fringing or other chromatic aberration with rain droplets an image may capture light passing through the droplet creating a small rainbow effect fujifilm describes the artifacts as a common photographic problem in underwater scenes

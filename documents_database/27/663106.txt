originally published in west germany in 1950 the book was translated into many languages into english by anthony g powell in 1956 and has been issued in numerous editions the german high command wished to gauge the morale of the troops of the encircled 6th army so they allowed the soldiers to write and send the letters which became the basis for last letters from stalingrad the letters were then impounded opened stripped of identification and sorted by content before eventually being stored in archives unlike the usual military history accounts focusing on mass armies of anonymous men the reader is presented with the personal tragedies of individual soldiers the single human being in the face of death getting a tangible impression of the horrors of war the letters are a human document which bares the soul of the man at his worst hour and by softening the identification of germany with nazism the book helped germany to take its place in the western post war community of nations french president fran ois mitterrand supposedly carried the french edition with him in the last months of his life and drew inspiration from it in writing his speech for the 50th

the formation of the lake itself is much more recent it is the result of the collapse of the cliff on the northern side of the valley a few centuries ago this huge landslide partially blocked the valley between the ice factory and the source of the doye above les neyrolles blocking the river that was flowing along what is now the bed of the lake causing the lake to form today the water percolates through the landslide debris to form the source of the doye in dry summers the level of the lake can fall by 5m whereas during wet periods the level can rise to a point where the water also flows out towards saint germain de joux and bellegarde sur valserine at the other end of the water gap via the combet stream which flows into the semine then the valserine which flows into the rh ne the ice factory was built in 1865 after joachim moinat had the idea to use the very pure ice that covered the lake every year in his caf this purity meant the ice could be used as is without purification to store the ice he built a wooden hut in

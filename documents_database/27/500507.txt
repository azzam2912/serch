it is a challenge to view with the naked eye having an apparent visual magnitude of 6 61 the system is moving further from the earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of 34 km s the primary component appears to be a normal a type main sequence star with a stellar classification of a1 v showing neither an organized magnetic field nor a chemical peculiarity however it has an excessive temperature for its luminosity and thus is considered an extreme blue straggler this is a second generation star formed through a collision of two low mass stars some 5 350 million years ago the collision was either between two separate cluster members or the coalescence of a binary star system with an effective temperature of 9 382 k this is the hottest star in the cluster by about 1 200 k it has 2 46 times the mass of the sun and 2 72 times the sun s radius the star has an unusually slow rotation for an a1v star with a projected rotational velocity of 10 km s it is radiating 74 times the sun s luminosity from its photosphere 40 cancri has a common proper motion companion located

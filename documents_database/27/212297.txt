it is a colorless highly volatile flammable liquid it is commonly used as a solvent in laboratories and as a starting fluid for some engines it was formerly used as a general anesthetic until non flammable drugs were developed such as halothane it has been used as a recreational drug to cause intoxication it is an isomer of butanol most diethyl ether is produced as a byproduct of the vapor phase hydration of ethylene to make ethanol this process uses solid supported phosphoric acid catalysts and can be adjusted to make more ether if the need arises vapor phase dehydration of ethanol over some alumina catalysts can give diethyl ether yields of up to 95 diethyl ether can be prepared both in laboratories and on an industrial scale by the acid ether synthesis ethanol is mixed with a strong acid typically sulfuric acid hso the acid dissociates in the aqueous environment producing hydronium ions ho a hydrogen ion protonates the electronegative oxygen atom of the ethanol giving the ethanol molecule a positive charge a nucleophilic oxygen atom of unprotonated ethanol displaces a water molecule from the protonated electrophilic ethanol molecule producing water a hydrogen ion and diethyl ether this reaction

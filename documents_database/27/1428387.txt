he organized and conducted seismic field experiments in northern canada southern africa chile and bolivia china and tibet as well in california and elsewhere in western north america silver and colleagues were the first to conduct in 1989 a modern portable broadband seismic experiment this experiment was designed to explore the deep structure of the north american continent but also formed the starting point for the development of novel methods of seismological investigation with winston chan martha savage and other colleagues silver elaborated on earlier work and deduced from the measurements the splitting of shear waves a type of seismic anisotropy for areas of the size of tectonic plates in order to determine the patterns of convection in the upper mantle and the deformation history of the continental and subcontinental lithosphere that record how the continent grew and evolved this approach has been developed ever since and is now in widespread use to study the patterns of convective flow in the earth s interior and the processes by which the continents were assembled his shear wave splitting studies with mark behn and clint conrad showed that the pattern of seismic anisotropy under oceanic lithosphere can be explained as being caused

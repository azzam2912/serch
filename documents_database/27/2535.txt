common examples are earthenware porcelain and brick the crystallinity of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi crystalline vitrified and often completely amorphous e g glasses most often fired ceramics are either vitrified or semi vitrified as is the case with earthenware stoneware and porcelain varying crystallinity and electron composition in the ionic and covalent bonds cause most ceramic materials to be good thermal and electrical insulators extensively researched in ceramic engineering with such a large range of possible options for the composition structure of a ceramic e g nearly all of the elements nearly all types of bonding and all levels of crystallinity the breadth of the subject is vast and identifiable attributes e g hardness toughness electrical conductivity etc are difficult to specify for the group as a whole general properties such as high melting temperature high hardness poor conductivity high moduli of elasticity chemical resistance and low ductility are the norm with known exceptions to each of these rules e g piezoelectric ceramics glass transition temperature superconductive ceramics etc many composites such as fiberglass and carbon fiber while containing ceramic materials are not considered to be part of the ceramic family the earliest ceramics made by

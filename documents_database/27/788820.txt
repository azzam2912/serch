discovered by hermann grassmann these laws are actually principles used to predict color match responses to a good approximation under photopic and mesopic vision a number of studies have examined how and why they provide poor predictions under specific conditions the four laws are described in modern texts with varying degrees of algebraic notation and are summarized as follows the precise numbering and corollary definitions can vary across sources these laws entail an algebraic representation of colored light assuming beam 1 and 2 each have a color and the observer chooses formula 1 as the strengths of the primaries that match beam 1 and formula 2 as the strengths of the primaries that match beam 2 then if the two beams were combined the matching values will be the sums of the components precisely they will be formula 3 where grassmann s laws can be expressed in general form by stating that for a given color with a spectral power distribution formula 7 the rgb coordinates are given by observe that these are linear in formula 11 the functions formula 12 are the color matching functions with respect to the chosen primaries

it is expressed as the ratio of the core mass to the total mass of the core and envelope estimates of the limit depend on the models used and the assumed chemical compositions of the core and envelope typical values given are from 0 10 to 0 15 10 to 15 of the total stellar mass this is the maximum to which a helium filled core can grow and if this limit is exceeded as can only happen in massive stars the core collapses releasing energy that causes the outer layers of the star to expand to become a red giant it is named after the astrophysicists subrahmanyan chandrasekhar and mario sch nberg who estimated its value in a 1942 paper they estimated it to be formula 1 the sch nberg chandrasekhar limit comes into play when fusion in a main sequence star exhausts the hydrogen at the center of the star the star then contracts until hydrogen fuses in a shell surrounding a helium rich core both of which are surrounded by an envelope consisting primarily of hydrogen the core increases in mass as the shell burns its way outwards through the star if the star s mass is

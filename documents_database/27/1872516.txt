upjohn looked for the key moieties which gave the greatest activity and posted over a dozen patents on related compounds each optimizing one moiety until they discovered that u 47700 was the most active u 47700 became the lead compound of selective kappa opioid receptor ligands such as u 50488 u 51754 containing a single methylene spacer difference and u 69 593 which share very similar structures although not used medically the selective kappa ligands are used in research u 47700 has never been studied on humans but would be expected to produce effects similar to those of other potent opioid agonists including strong analgesia sedation euphoria constipation itching and respiratory depression which could be harmful or fatal tachycardia was another side effect encountered with u 47700 use tolerance and dependence would be expected to develop combined consumption of u 47700 with fentanyl and flubromazepam caused one fatality in belgium and germany respectively one death was reported in ireland another one in italy 17 opioid overdoses and several deaths in the united states had initially been associated with u 47700 in april 2016 as of september 2016 at least 15 fatalities were confirmed by december 2017 at least 46 fatalities

it is a part of the respiratory system of gastropods it is an opening in the right side of the mantle of a stylommatophoran snail or slug air enters through the pneumostome into the animal s single lung the air filled mantle cavity inside the mantle cavity the animal has a highly vascularized area of tissue that functions as a lung the pneumostome is often much easier to see in slugs than in snails because of the absence of a shell which can often block the view of this area in a land slug when the pneumostome is wide open it is usually very clearly visible on the right side of the animal however the position of the pneumostome is often not at all easy to discern when this orifice is completely closed the pneumostome opens and closes in a cyclical manner the frequency of pneumostome closing and opening is typically less than 0 5 closures per minute in fully hydrated slugs and snails the rate of closures per minute increases the more dehydrated the slug is the images in the gallery below show the position of the pneumostome in three different families of slugs

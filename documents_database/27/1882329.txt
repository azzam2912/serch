the simplest non neutral plasmas are plasmas consisting of a single charge species examples of single species non neutral plasmas that have been created in laboratory experiments are plasmas consisting entirely of electrons pure ion plasmas positron plasmas and antiproton plasmas non neutral plasmas are used for research into basic plasma phenomena such as cross magnetic field transport nonlinear vortex interactions and plasma waves and instabilities they have also been used to create cold neutral antimatter by carefully mixing and recombining cryogenic pure positron and pure antiproton plasmas positron plasmas are also used in atomic physics experiments that study the interaction of antimatter with neutral atoms and molecules cryogenic pure ion plasmas have been used in studies of and quantum entanglement more prosaically pure electron plasmas are used to produce the microwaves in microwave ovens via the magnetron instability neutral plasmas in contact with a solid surface that is most laboratory plasmas are typically non neutral in their edge regions due to unequal loss rates to the surface for electrons and ions an electric field the ambipolar field builds up acting to hold back the more mobile species until the loss rates are the same the electrostatic potential as measured

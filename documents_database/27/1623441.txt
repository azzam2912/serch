if x and y are independent random vectors in r with cumulative distribution functions cdf f and g respectively then the energy distance between the distributions f and g is defined to be the square root of where x x y y are independent the cdf of x and x is f the cdf of y and y is g formula 2 is the expected value and denotes the length of a vector energy distance satisfies all axioms of a metric thus energy distance characterizes the equality of distributions d f g 0 if and only if f g energy distance for statistical applications was introduced in 1985 by g bor j sz kely who proved that for real valued random variables formula 3 is exactly twice harald cram r s distance for a simple proof of this equivalence see sz kely 2002 in higher dimensions however the two distances are different because the energy distance is rotation invariant while cram r s distance is not notice that cram r s distance is not the same as the distribution free cramer von mises criterion one can generalize the notion of energy distance to probability distributions on metric spaces let formula

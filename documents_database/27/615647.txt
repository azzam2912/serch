like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone it is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict sized based dominance hierarchy the female is largest the breeding male is second largest and the male non breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends they exhibit protandry meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies with the largest non breeder becomes the breeding male the fish s natural diet includes zooplankton the side of a rubrocinctus has blackish or dark brown sides with red snout breast belly and fins it has a single white head bar that is often poorly developed and lacking a pronounced black margin some anemonefish species have color variations based on geographic location sex and host anemone a rubrocinctus does not show any of these variations a rubrocinctus is included in the tomato complex and so has similarities with other species in this complex a frenatus is similar however males are entirely bright red and the white head bar is more vivid on females a barberi was originally thought to be a geographic color variation of a rubrocinctus

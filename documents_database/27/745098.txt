the square root of the sum of two squares also known as pythagorean addition is a useful function because it finds the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the two side lengths the norm of a 2 d vector or the magnitude formula 1 of a complex number z a b i given the real and imaginary parts the algorithm avoids performing the square and square root operations instead using simple operations such as comparison multiplication and addition some choices of the and parameters of the algorithm allow the multiplication operation to be reduced to a simple shift of binary digits that is particularly well suited to implementation in high speed digital circuitry the approximation is expressed as where formula 3 is the maximum absolute value of a and b and formula 4 is the minimum absolute value of a and b for the closest approximation the optimum values for formula 5 and formula 6 are formula 7 and formula 8 giving a maximum error of 3 96 when formula 9 formula 10 becomes smaller than formula 3 which is geometrically impossible near the axes where formula 4 is near 0 this can be remedied by replacing the result with

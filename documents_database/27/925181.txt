such compounds include lead nitrate and calcine decrepitation is one of the most accurate ways to calculate a mineral deposit scale so that the analysis of the hydrothermal system is advanced and improved fluid inclusions are important in regards to decrepitation because they are the microscopic areas of gas and liquid within crystals that are decrepitated or broken with the application of heat when decrepitating the crystal or salt the liquid pressure is released which can result in a crack however in some cases the fluid inclusions are not fully decrepitated in which case other methods must be used despite this shortcoming decrepitation is the preferred procedure for identifying minerals because it allows for the quickest and greatest number of inclusions to be measured the pressure necessary to spur decrepitation is reliant upon the size of the fluid inclusions bigger inclusions decrepitate more easily at pressures between 700 900 atmospheres while smaller fluid inclusions may require upwards of 1200 atmospheres contrastingly when fluid inclusions become even smaller the amount of pressure applied will have no effect and decrepitation will not occur if the decrepitation begins at a temperature less than the temperature required to form the mineral it is likely

hd 139139 is a g type main sequence star a little larger and more luminous than the sun and at an almost identical temperature it has an apparent magnitude of 9 8 the companion star is thought to be a k5 7 red dwarf away from hd 139139 it is about three magnitudes fainter and has a temperature of between 4 100 and both stars have a similar proper motion meaning they may form a gravitationally bound binary pair hd 139139 exhibits dips in brightness similar to those caused by transiting earth like planets the kepler space telescope observed 28 dips in their brightness over an 87 day period 23 august 20 november 2017 the dips do not appear to be periodic as would be expected if they were due to transiting planets it is unknown which of the two stars produces the dimming events potential explanations that have been investigated include planets transiting a binary star planets that are perturbing the orbits of each other producing large transit timing variations a disintegrating planet large dust producing asteroids and short lived sunspots according to andrew vanderburg one of the researchers of the original studies in astronomy we have a long

these carbohydrates are composed of three principal monosaccharides glucose fructose and galactose in addition glycogen is the storage form of carbohydrates in humans the failure to effectively use these molecules accounts for the majority of the inborn errors of human carbohydrates metabolism glycogen storage diseases are enzyme deficiencies which impair glycogen synthesis glycogen degradation or glycolysis the two organs most commonly affected are the liver and the skeletal muscle glycogen storage diseases that affect the liver typically cause hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia those that affect skeletal muscle cause exercise intolerance progressive weakness and cramping glucose 6 phosphate isomerase deficiency affects step 2 of glycolysis triosephosphate isomerase deficiency affects step 5 of glycolysis phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency affects step 7 of glycolysis pyruvate kinase deficiency affects the 10th and last step of glycolysis glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency affects the degradation of glucose in the pentose phosphate pathway which is especially important in red blood cells for further information on inborn errors of glucose metabolism and inborn errors of glycogen metabolism see below lactose is a disaccharide sugar composed of galactose and glucose that is found in milk lactose can not be absorbed by the intestine and needs to be split in the

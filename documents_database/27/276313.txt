prior to contact with han chinese the taiwanese aborigines named themselves according to each tribe s tradition the naming system varies greatly depending on the particular tribes some tribes do not have family names at least as part of the personal name under the strong influence of chinese culture and forces of cultural assimilation brought by han settlers in the 17th century the aborigines have gradually adopted han names in the 17th and 18th centuries possession of a han surname was considered to be a sign of being civilized in part because adoption of a han surname meant that that person was now entered into the population registration books and could be taxed upon possessing a han surname most of the lowland aboriginal tribes assimilated with the han immigrants and eventually no longer saw themselves or were seen as a distinct population the handful of highland tribes generally kept separate names until after world war ii when the government systematically assigned han names to indigenous taiwanese aborigines settled near hakka communities were sometimes assigned hakka like family names for instance aboriginal pop singer a mei may have a name with hakka characteristics for a few decades in the first half

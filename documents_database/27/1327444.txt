ce ms combines advantages of both ce and ms to provide high separation efficiency and molecular mass information in a single analysis it has high resolving power and sensitivity requires minimal volume and can analyze at high speed ions are typically formed by electrospray ionization but they can also be formed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization or other ionization techniques it has applications in basic research in proteomics and quantitative analysis of biomolecules as well as in clinical medicine since its introduction in 1987 new developments and application has made ce ms powerful separation and identification technique use of ce ms has increased for protein and peptides analysis and other biomolecules however the development of online ce ms is not without challenges understanding of ce the interface setup ionization technique and mass detection system is important to tackle problems while coupling capillary electrophoresis to mass spectrometry the original interface between capillary zone electrophoresis and mass spectrometry was developed in 1987 by richard d smith and coworkers at pacific northwest national laboratory and who also later were involved in development of interfaces with other ce variants including capillary isotachophoresis and capillary isoelectric focusing capillary electrophoresis is a separation technique which

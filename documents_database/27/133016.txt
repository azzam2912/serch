it performs reasonably well over a broad frequency range without marked dead spots in terms of either frequency direction or angle of radiation above the horizon although inferior in electrical terms up to 30 of the rf power is converted to heat in the resistor to antennas specifically designed for given frequency bands or optimized for directionality its all around performance relatively modest size low cost and the fact that it does not require any complex electronic matching to operate with a standard shortwave transmitter have made it popular in professional shortwave communications the history of the ttfd antenna divides conveniently into three different phases it was first developed for use as a general purpose antenna on naval ships in the 1940s the design became public in the 1950s and was adopted by radio amateurs but then fell out of use with the advent of shorter wavelengths and the widespread adoption of low impedance transmitters and antenna feeds recently with the advent of multiple new frequency bands which are not even integer multiples of existing bands frequencies it has started to draw renewed attention from radio amateurs the ttfd antenna was originally developed during ww ii at the san diego

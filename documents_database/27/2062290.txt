the region forms part of the great rift a dark lane of cosmic dust that passes through the middle of the galactic plane of the milky way the clouds that form this structure are called molecular clouds constituting a phase of the interstellar medium which is cold and dense enough for molecules to form particularly molecular hydrogen h these clouds are opaque to light in the optical part of the spectrum due to the presence of interstellar dust grains mixed with the gaseous component of the clouds therefore the clouds in the serpens aquila rift block light from background stars in the disk of the galaxy forming the dark rift the complex is located in a direction towards the inner galaxy where molecular clouds are common so it is possible that not all components of the rift are at the same distance and physically associated with each other several star forming regions are projected in or near the direction of the serpens aquila rift including westerhout 40 w40 serpens main serpens south serpens nh and mwc297 sh2 62 parallax measurements have been used to determine the distance to some of the stars clusters thought to be related to the serpens

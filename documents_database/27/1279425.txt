the system is designed to prevent train to train collisions protect against overspeed and protect work crews with temporary speed restrictions the information about permanent and temporary speed restrictions is transmitted to the train by transponders balises lying in the track coded track circuits and digital radio it was installed beginning in 2000 on all of amtrak s northeast corridor except mta territory between washington and boston and has been fully active since december 2015 a few months after the 2015 philadelphia train derailment which it would have prevented acses provides railway trains with positive enforcement of civil speed restrictions those based on the physical characteristics of the line the on board components keep track of a train s position and continuously calculates a maximum safe braking curve for upcoming speed restrictions if the train exceeds the safe braking curve then the brakes are automatically applied there are two kinds of speed restrictions which are enforced by the system data regarding permanent speed restrictions and other information about the permanent way and track configuration is obtained in chunks from the track mounted transponders and stored in an on board database information regarding temporary speed restrictions is given to the train

each method returns an object allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results local variable declarations are syntactic sugar method chaining eliminates an extra variable for each intermediate step the developer is saved from the cognitive burden of naming the variable and keeping the variable in mind method chaining has been referred to as producing a train wreck due to the increase in the number of methods that come one after another in the same line that occurs as more methods are chained together a similar syntax is method cascading where after the method call the expression evaluates to the current object not the return value of the method cascading can be implemented using method chaining by having the method return the current object itself cascading is a key technique in fluent interfaces and since chaining is widely implemented in object oriented languages while cascading isn t this form of cascading by chaining by returning this is often referred to simply as chaining both chaining and cascading come from the smalltalk language while chaining is syntax it has semantic consequences namely that requires methods to return an object and

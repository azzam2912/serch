they form from the interaction between lava flows and water steam explosions fragment the lava and the fragments can pile up and form a cone such cones usually form on aa lava flows and typically require large lava flows to form they have been found on hawaii and elsewhere littoral cones are semicircular cones which are breached in the direction of the lava flow that created them they are formed by mounds of clasts that appear like cones without a crater littoral cones are constructed by volcanic ash lava bombs and lapilli their component material is usually poorly sorted and can feature agglutinated structures and layering sometimes spatter fed lava flows occur on such cones they are formed by degassed hyaloclastite the most common form found on hawaii involves two semicircles on both sides of the lava flow that generated them some such cones on hawaii form a complete rim with diameters of puu ki on hawaii has nested craters on top of a lava tube typically such cones are not larger than wide and high other smaller cones on hawaii have diameters of and heights reaching littoral cones not primary volcanic vents and distinguishing between a littoral cone and

however yilmaz has claimed that his theory is compatible with quantum mechanics he suggests that it might be an alternative to superstring theory in his theory yilmaz wishes to retain the left hand side of the einstein field equation namely the einstein tensor which is well defined for any lorentzian manifold independent of general relativity but to modify the right hand side the stress energy tensor by adding a kind of gravitational contribution according to yilmaz s critics this additional term is not well defined and cannot be made well defined no astronomers have tested his ideas although some have tested competitors of general relativity see

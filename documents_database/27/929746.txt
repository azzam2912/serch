it was first found in humans in 1913 a 1990 study has indicated that the terminal nerve is a common finding in the adult human brain the nerve has been called by other names including cranial nerve xiii zero nerve nerve n and nt the terminal nerve appears just anterior of the other cranial nerves bilaterally as a microscopic plexus of unmyelinated peripheral nerve fascicles in the subarachnoid space covering the gyrus rectus this plexus appears near the cribriform plate and travels posteriorly toward the olfactory trigone medial olfactory gyrus and lamina terminalis the nerve is often overlooked in autopsies because it is unusually thin for a cranial nerve and is often torn out upon exposing the brain careful dissection is necessary to visualize the nerve its purpose and mechanism of function is still open to debate consequently nerve zero is often not mentioned in anatomy textbooks the zebrafish was used as a developmental model in research from 2004 the connections between the terminal nerve and the olfactory system have been extensively studied in human embryos it was found to enter the brain at stages 17 and 18 from olfactory origins although very close to and often confused for a

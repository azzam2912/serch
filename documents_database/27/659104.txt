with its relatively large but moderate resolution super ccd sensors it concentrated on image quality and low light shooting without flash which was mostly restricted to prosumer models at the time image comparisons show that fujifilm s sixth generation 6 3 megapixel super ccd sensor used on f10 f20 f30 f31 models set the benchmark for low noise high iso performance among point and shoot cameras and has not yet been matched by any of fuji s higher megapixel super ccd sensors to date the fujifilm finepix f200exr february 2009 has similar low light capabilities as the f31fd in pixel binning mode but allows for double the resolution in good light however at the same focal length the lens of the f200exr is about 1 2 stop slower than that of the f31fd the key feature of the f200exr is its very large dynamic range estimated to be 11 stops when used in its dual capture mode the first breakthrough model of the f series the 6 3 megapixel finepix f10 was announced in february 2005 and became available on april 30 of that year the f10 was met with widespread critical acclaim and became a hit seller for fujifilm

meteoriticists often use the term to represent stardust grains that originated within a single star and which they extract from meteorites for study because most interstellar grains are not stardust from a single star however being instead interstellar cloud matter accreted by smaller presolar grains most presolar grains are also not stardust logically all stardust are presolar grains but not all presolar grains are stardust this confusing terminology is heavily entrenched among 21st century meteoriticists who prefer to use the terms interchangeably however so it is best to live with both usages or to write presolar stardust grains for stardust presolar stardust grains formed within outflowing and cooling gases from earlier presolar stars the stellar nucleosynthesis that took place within each presolar star gives to each granule an isotopic composition unique to that parent star which differs from the isotopic composition of our solar system s matter as well as from the galactic average these isotopic signatures often fingerprint very specific astrophysical nuclear processes that took place within the parent star and prove their presolar origin in the 1960s the noble gases neon and xenon were discovered to have unusual isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites their origin and the type

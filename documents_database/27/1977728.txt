resource slack can be considered as the opposite of resource scarcity or resource constraints the availability of resources can therefore be defined in terms of resource slack versus constraints as two ends of a continuum resource slack then refers to the relative abundance of the resource and resource constraints refer to its limited availability however the effects of both resource slack and resource constraints are ambiguous as both can have both negative and positive consequences both new and established firms need resources for their survival growth and sustainable competitive advantage on the other hand severe resource constraints hinder the growth of firms and lower the probability of their survival however resource constraints have also been observed to foster creativity and force firms to deal with problems promptly moreover slack resources tend to improve firms financial performance serve to buffer environmental shocks and allow for more discretion and flexibility in responding to competitors however large amounts of resources could also hinder the entrepreneurial process by impairing the firm s ability to identify new business opportunities these contradictory potential outcomes of resource slack constraints on creativity and performance have been explained in terms of an inverse u shaped relationship and context dependent

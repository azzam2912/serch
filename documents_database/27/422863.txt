its taxonomical status is in dispute as the failure to discover adult specimens strongly implies that collected holotypes merely represent juvenile pachycephalosaurs this hypothesis has been supported by numerous modern studies the most recent of which agrees that stygimoloch is synonymous with pachycephalosaurus the genus was discovered in the hell creek formation ferris formation and lance formation of the western interior united states where it lived alongside such genera as tyrannosaurus triceratops and edmontosaurus it is a relatively large pachycephalosaur with the skull being about 46 centimeters long 18 in among north american pachycephalosaurs only pachycephalosaurus is larger unlike other pachycephalosaurs the domed skull is relatively small slightly flattened from side to side and pear shaped even when isolated this unusual dome can easily be distinguished from the broader larger domes of pachycephalosaurus while the dome is reduced in size the ornamentation over the skull is more elaborate than in any other pachycephalosaur short conical hornlets covered the nose and the back corners of the skull bore an enormous pair of massive backward pointing spikes up to 5 centimeters in diameter 2 in and 15 centimeters long 6 in these are surrounded by two or three smaller spikes the function

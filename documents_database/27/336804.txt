a screw thread is a ridge wrapped around a cylinder or cone in the form of a helix with the former being called a straight thread and the latter called a tapered thread a screw thread is the essential feature of the screw as a simple machine and also as a fastener the mechanical advantage of a screw thread depends on its lead which is the linear distance the screw travels in one revolution in most applications the lead of a screw thread is chosen so that friction is sufficient to prevent linear motion being converted to rotary that is so the screw does not slip even when linear force is applied as long as no external rotational force is present this characteristic is essential to the vast majority of its uses the tightening of a fastener s screw thread is comparable to driving a wedge into a gap until it sticks fast through friction and slight elastic deformation screw threads have several applications in all of these applications the screw thread has two main functions every matched pair of threads external and internal can be described as male and female for example a screw has male threads while its

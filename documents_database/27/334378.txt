it is generated within the periodic beacon at a frequency specified by the dtim interval beacons are packets sent by an access point to synchronize a wireless network normal tims that are present in every beacon are for signaling the presence of buffered unicast data after a dtim the access point will send the multicast broadcast data on the channel following the normal channel access rules csma ca this helps to have minimum collision and in effect increased throughput in cases where there is not much interference or where the number of clients is limited the dtim interval has little or no significance usually a value of 1 or 2 also see wi fi as established by the wi fi alliance according to the 802 11 standards a delivery traffic indication map dtim period value is a number that determines how often a beacon frame includes a delivery traffic indication message and this number is included in each beacon frame a dtim is included in beacon frames according to the dtim period to indicate to the client devices whether the access point has buffered broadcast and or multicast data waiting for them following a beacon frame that includes a dtim

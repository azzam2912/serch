it is a flagellate adapted to micro aerobic environments that causes systemic infections in salmonid fish the species creates foul smelling pus filled abscesses in muscles and internal organs of aquarium fish in the late 1980s when the disease was first reported it was believed to be caused by spironucleus barkhanus anders j rgensen was the person that found out what species really caused the disease there is a distinct lack of models for diverse microbial eukaryotes spironucleus salmonicida was chosen as a model due to its complex genome and ability to adapt to fluctuating environments this ability was proven by genetically modifying the pathogen and seeing the results by comparing these results with the closest model organism giardia intestinalis researchers were able to see that the parasite has a more complex gene regulation system this system of genetic modification was also used to sequence the genome for further study spironucleus salmonicida contains mitochondrion related organelles mros mros identified in s salmonicida contained similar protein import and fe s machinery as in giardia mitosomes and the mros contained the enzyme characteristics similar to hydrogenosomes thereby affirming hydrogen production is prevalent in the genus spironucleus hydrogenosomes produce atp by substrate level

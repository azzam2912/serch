the orbit of the moon undergoes two important types of precessional motion apsidal and nodal the axis of the moon also experiences precession the first type of lunar precession is that of the plane of the moon s orbit the period of the lunar nodal precession is defined as the time it takes the ascending node to move through 360 relative to the vernal equinox autumnal equinox in southern hemisphere it is about 18 6 years and the direction of motion is westward i e in the direction opposite to the earth s orbit around the sun if seen from the celestial north this is the reason that a draconic month or nodal period the period the moon takes to return to the same node in its orbit is shorter than the sidereal month after one nodal precession period the number of draconic months exceeds the number of sidereal months by exactly one this period is about 6 793 days 18 60 years as a result of this nodal precession the time for the sun to return to the same lunar node the eclipse year is about 18 6377 days shorter than a sidereal year the number of solar orbits

as such the design emphasizes simplicity of construction to reduce building time the gw 4 was a higher wing loading development the gw 3 and 4 both use a wing with a naca 43012a airfoil the aircraft are all metal with the portion of the wing aft of the spar covered in doped aircraft fabric the flaps and ailerons are sheet metal covered the wing design is unusual as it uses a single spar and transmits its torsion and drag loads via a thick leading edge skin this resulted in wings that weigh each the prototype gw 3 weighed empty in total the prototype gw 3 was involved in an accident on 9 july 1992 when downdrafts were encountered in mountainous terrain the aircraft was unable to return to the airport and crashed resulting in serious injury to the pilot it was removed from the federal aviation administration registry on 13 september 1997 and listed as destroyed

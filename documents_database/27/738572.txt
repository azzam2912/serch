that is instead of 46 chromosomes the cell could have 47 with the 47th being very small roughly 6 10megabases mb in size instead of 50 250mb for natural chromosomes and able to carry new genes introduced by human researchers ideally researchers could integrate different genes that perform a variety of functions including disease defense alternative methods of creating transgenes such as utilizing yeast artificial chromosomes and bacterial artificial chromosomes lead to unpredictable problems the genetic material introduced by these vectors not only leads to different expression levels but the inserts also disrupt the original genome hacs differ in this regard as they are entirely separate chromosomes this separation from existing genetic material assumes that no insertional mutants would arise this stability and accuracy makes hacs preferable to other methods such as viral vectors yacs and bacs hacs allow for delivery of more dna including promoters and copy number variation than is possible with viral vectors yeast artificial chromosomes and bacterial artificial chromosomes were created before human artificial chromosomes which first appeared in 1997 hacs are useful in expression studies as gene transfer vectors as a tool for elucidating human chromosome function and as a method for actively annotating the

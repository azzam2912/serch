the mechanisms involved in the transfer of energy from foods to neurons are likely to be fundamental to the control of brain function human bodily processes including the brain all require both macronutrients as well as micronutrients insufficient intake of selected vitamins or certain metabolic disorders may affect cognitive processes by disrupting the nutrient dependent processes within the body that are associated with the management of energy in neurons which can subsequently affect synaptic plasticity or the ability to encode new memories choline is an essential nutrient and its primary function within the human body is the synthesis of cellular membranes although it serves other functions as well it is a precursor molecule to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which serves a wide range of functions including motor control and memory choline deficiencies may be related to some liver and neurological disorders because of its role in cellular synthesis choline is an important nutrient during the prenatal and early postnatal development of offspring as it contributes to brain development choline intakes from food for men women and children may be below the adequate intake levels women especially when pregnant or lactating the elderly and infants are at risk for choline deficiency beef

they are used in pressurized water reactors pwr between the primary and secondary coolant loops in typical pwr designs the primary coolant is high purity water kept under high pressure so it cannot boil this primary coolant is pumped through the reactor core where it absorbs heat from the fuel rods it then passes through the steam generator where it transfers its heat via conduction through metal to lower pressure water which is allowed to boil unlike pwrs boiling water reactors bwr do not use steam generators the primary coolant is allowed to boil directly in the reactor core and the steam is simply passed through a steam turbine while theoretically simple this has a downside for maintenance while passing through the core primary coolant water is subjected to high neutron flux this activates oxygen and dissolved nitrogen in the water the major reaction is an atom of oxygen 16 absorbs 1 neutron and emits 1 proton becoming nitrogen 16 nitrogen 16 has a 7 second half life and produces a gamma ray when it decays back to oxygen 16 the 7 second half life is long enough for the water to circulate out of the reactor in a bwr

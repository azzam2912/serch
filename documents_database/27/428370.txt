the development of this technique made the construction of the skyscraper possible the rolled steel profile or cross section of steel columns takes the shape of the letter i the two wide flanges of a column are thicker and wider than the flanges on a beam to better withstand compressive stress in the structure square and round tubular sections of steel can also be used often filled with concrete steel beams are connected to the columns with bolts and threaded fasteners and historically connected by rivets the central web of the steel beams is often wider than a column web to resist the higher bending moments that occur in beams wide sheets of steel deck can be used to cover the top of the steel frame as a form or corrugated mold below a thick layer of concrete and steel reinforcing bars another popular alternative is a floor of precast concrete flooring units with some form of concrete topping often in office buildings the final floor surface is provided by some form of raised flooring system with the void between the walking surface and the structural floor being used for cables and air handling ducts the frame needs to be

it occurs in many species of lichens including roccella tinctoria and lecanora orcinol has been detected in the toxic glue of the ant species camponotus saundersi it is a colorless solid it is related to resorcinol 1 3 ch oh orcinol was first prepared by dehydroacetic acid a conversion that involved ring opening of the pyrone to a triketone this early experiment helped establish the rich condensation chemistry of polyketides it can be obtained by fusing extract of aloes with potash followed by acidification it undergoes o methylation with dimethylsulfate it is used in the production of the dye orcein and as a reagent in some chemical tests for pentoses such as bial s test it may be synthesized from toluene more interesting is its production when acetone dicarboxylic ester is condensed with the aid of sodium it crystallizes in colorless prisms with one molecule of water which redden on exposure to air ferric chloride gives a bluish violet coloration with the aqueous solution unlike resorcinol it does not give a fluorescein with phthalic anhydride oxidation of the ammoniacal solution gives orcein chno the chief constituent of the natural dye archil 4 methylcatechol is an isomer found as its methyl

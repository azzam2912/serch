the reaction product is an alkenyl sulfide the reaction was first reported in 1949 with thioacetic acid as reagent and rediscovered in 2009 it is used in click chemistry and in polymerization especially with dendrimers this addition reaction is typically facilitated by a radical initiator or uv irradiation and proceeds through a sulfanyl radical species with monoaddition a mixture of e z alkenes form the mode of addition is anti markovnikov the radical intermediate can engage in secondary reactions such as cyclisation with diaddition the 1 2 disulfide or the 1 1 dithioacetal forms reported catalysts for radical additions are triethylborane indium iii bromide and aibn the reaction is also reported to be catalysed by cationic rhodium and iridium complexes by thorium and uranium complexes by rhodium complexes by caesium carbonate and by gold diphenyl disulfide reacts with alkynes to a 1 2 bis phenylthio ethylene reported alkynes are ynamides a photoredox thiol yne reaction has been reported in polymer chemistry systems have been described based on addition polymerization with 1 4 benzenedithiol and 1 4 diethynylbenzene in the synthesis of other addition polymer systems in the synthesis of dendrimers in star polymers in graft polymerization block copolymers and in

it implies that if a countable first order theory has an infinite model then for every infinite cardinal number it has a model of size and that no first order theory with an infinite model can have a unique model up to isomorphism as a consequence first order theories are unable to control the cardinality of their infinite models the downward l wenheim skolem theorem is one of the two key properties along with the compactness theorem that are used in lindstr m s theorem to characterize first order logic in general the l wenheim skolem theorem does not hold in stronger logics such as second order logic in its general form the l wenheim skolem theorem states that for every signature every infinite structure m and every infinite cardinal number there is a structure n such that n and such that the theorem is often divided into two parts corresponding to the two bullets above the part of the theorem asserting that a structure has elementary substructures of all smaller infinite cardinalities is known as the downward l wenheim skolem theorem the part of the theorem asserting that a structure has elementary extensions of all larger cardinalities is known

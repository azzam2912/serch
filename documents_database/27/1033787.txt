this gene was uncovered recently by the human genome project and its expression patterns in humans remains unknown keratins are the intermediate filament proteins that form a dense meshwork of filaments throughout the cytoplasm of epithelial cells keratins form heteropolymers consisting of a type i and a type ii keratin keratins are generally expressed in particular pairs of type i and type ii keratin proteins in a tissue specific and cellular differentiation specific manner the keratin proteins of epithelial tissues are commonly known as keratins or are sometimes referred to as epithelial keratins or cytokeratins the specialized keratins of hair and nail are known as hard keratins or trichocyte keratins trichocytes are the specialized epithelial cells from which hair and nail are composed trichocyte keratins are similar in their gene and protein structure to keratins except that they are especially rich in the sulfur containing amino acid cysteine which facilitates chemical cross linking of the assembled hard keratins to form a more structurally resilient material both epithelial keratins and hard keratins can be further subdivided into type i acidic keratins and type ii neutral basic keratins the genes for the type i keratins are located in a gene cluster on

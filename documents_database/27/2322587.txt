its unique property is that it contains copper in both of its common oxidation states it is insoluble in water and stable in air what was known as rogojski s salt is a mixture of chevreul s salt and metallic copper chevreul s salt is prepared by treating aqueous copper sulfate with a solution of potassium metabisulfite the solution changes colour from blue to green immediately the identity of the green species is unknown heating this solution produces a reddish solid precipitate 3 cuso 4 kso 3 ho cu so 2ho 4 kso 4 so hso when sodium ions are present in the solutions that form the salt sodium can substitute for some of the copper i as the ions have the same charge and similar sizes chevreul s salt exhibits properties of both copper i and copper ii hydrochloric acid produces a white solid of copper i chloride if too much acid is added the precipitate dissolves if an ammonia solution is added to the product it is dissolved and a deep blue color appears the presence of cu nh complex on heating in an inert atmosphere it is stable to 200 c it gives off water and sulfur

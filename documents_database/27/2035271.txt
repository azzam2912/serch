that approach can be helped by tools that allow an integrated development environment ide to show code examples or api documentation related to coding behaviors occurring in the ide borrow tactics are often employed from online sources by programmers leaving the ide to troubleshoot the purpose of example centric programming is to reduce the time spent by developers searching online ideally in example centric programming the user interface integrates with help module examples for assistance without programmers leaving the ide the idea for this type of instant documentation is to reduce programming interruptions the usage of this feature is not limited to experts as some novices reap the benefits of an integrated knowledge base without resorting to frequent web searches or browsing the growth of the web has fundamentally changed the way software is built vast increase in information resources and the democratization of access and distribution are main factors in the development of example centric programming for end user development tutorials are available on the web in seconds thus broadening the space of who writes it designers scientists or hobbyists by 2012 13 million program as a part of their job yet only three million of those are actual

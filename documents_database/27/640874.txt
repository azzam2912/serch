originally differentiated by the approach used to engineer them rassls and dreadds are often used interchangeably now to represent an engineered g protein receptor ligand system these systems utilize g protein coupled receptors gpcr engineered to respond exclusively to synthetic ligands like clozapine n oxide cno and not to their natural ligand s one of the first dreadds was based on the human m muscarinic receptor hm only two point mutations of hm were required to achieve a mutant receptor with nanomolar potency for cno insensitivity to acetylcholine ach and low constitutive activity and this dreadd receptor was named hm3dq m and m muscarinic receptors have been mutated to create dreadds hm1dq and hm5dq respectively the most commonly used inhibitory dreadd is hm4di derived from the m muscarinic receptor that couples with the g protein another g coupled human muscarinic receptor m was also mutated to obtain the dreadd receptor hm2d another inhibitory g dreadd is the kappa opioid receptor kor dreadd kord which is selectively activated by salvinorin b salb g coupled dreadds have also been developed these receptors are also known as gd and are chimeric receptors containing intracellular regions of the turkey erythrocyte adrenergic receptor substituted into

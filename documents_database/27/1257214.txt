it also allows applying incompressible flow data to compressible flow cases inviscid compressible flow over slender bodies is governed by linearized compressible small disturbance potential equation together with the small disturbance flow tangency boundary condition formula 3 is the freestream mach number and formula 4 are the surface normal vector components the unknown variable is the perturbation potential formula 5 and the total velocity is given by its gradient plus the freestream velocity formula 6 which is assumed here to be along formula 7 the above formulation is valid only if the small disturbance approximation applies and in addition that there is no transonic flow approximately stated by the requirement that the local mach number not exceed unity the prandtl glauert pg transformation uses the prandtl glauert factor formula 11 it consists of scaling down all y and z dimensions and angle of attack by the factor of formula 12 the potential by formula 13 and the x component of the normal vectors by formula 14 this formula 16 geometry will then have normal vectors whose x components are reduced by formula 14 from the original ones the small disturbance potential equation then transforms to the laplace equation and the

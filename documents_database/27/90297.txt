an example is the relation is equal to because if a b is true then b a is also true formally a binary relation r over a set x is symmetric if and only if if r represents the converse of r then r is symmetric if and only if r r symmetry along with reflexivity and transitivity are the three defining properties of an equivalence relation by definition a nonempty relation cannot be both symmetric and asymmetric where if a is related to b then b cannot be related to a in the same way however a relation can be neither symmetric nor asymmetric which is the case for is less than or equal to and preys on symmetric and antisymmetric where the only way a can be related to b and b be related to a is if a b are actually independent of each other as these examples show a symmetric relation that is also transitive and reflexive is an equivalence relation one way to conceptualize a symmetric relation in graph theory is that a symmetric relation is an edge with the edge s two vertices being the two entities so related thus symmetric relations and undirected

it provides a wide range of algorithms for deep learning and uses the scripting language luajit and an underlying c implementation as of 2018 torch is no longer in active development however pytorch is actively developed as of august 2019 the core package of torch is codice 1 it provides a flexible n dimensional array or tensor which supports basic routines for indexing slicing transposing type casting resizing sharing storage and cloning this object is used by most other packages and thus forms the core object of the library the tensor also supports mathematical operations like codice 2 codice 3 codice 4 statistical distributions like uniform normal and multinomial and blas operations like dot product matrix vector multiplication matrix matrix multiplication matrix vector product and matrix product the following exemplifies using torch via its repl interpreter a torch randn 3 4 a 0 2381 0 3401 1 7844 0 2615 1 0434 2 2291 1 0525 0 8465 torch doubletensor of dimension 3x4 a 1 2 0 34010116549482 a narrow 1 1 2 0 2381 0 3401 1 7844 0 2615 torch doubletensor of dimension 2x4 a index 1 torch longtensor 1 2 0 2381 0 3401 1 7844 0

the two main groups are the labyrinthulids or slime nets and thraustochytrids they are mostly marine commonly found as parasites on algae and seagrasses or as decomposers on dead plant material they also include some parasites of marine invertebrates although they are outside the cells the filaments are surrounded by a membrane they are formed and connected with the cytoplasm by a unique organelle called a sagenogen or bothrosome the cells are uninucleated and typically ovoid and move back and forth along the amorphous network at speeds varying from 5 150 m per minute among the labyrinthulids the cells are enclosed within the tubes and among the thraustochytrids they are attached to their sides labyrinthulomycetes labyrinthulea used to belong to the defunct fungal phylum labyrinthulomycota they were originally considered unusual slime moulds although they are not very similar to the other sorts the structure of their zoospores and genetic studies show them to be a primitive group of heterokonts but their classification and treatment remains somewhat unsettled this class has usually two orders labyrinthulales and thraustochytriales icbn or labyrinthulida and thraustochytrida iczn but a third has recently been proposed

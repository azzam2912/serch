usually system temperatures are positive however in particular isolated systems the temperature defined in terms of boltzmann s entropy can become negative the possibility of negative temperatures was first predicted by onsager in 1949 in his analysis of classical point vortices confined to a finite area confined point vortices are a system with bounded phase space as their canonical momenta are not independent degrees of freedom from their canonical position coordinates bounded phase space is the essential property that allows for negative temperatures and such temperatures can occur in both classical and quantum systems as shown by onsager a system with bounded phase space necessarily has a peak in the entropy as energy is increased for energies exceeding the value where the peak occurs the entropy decreases as energy increases and high energy states necessarily have negative boltzmann temperature a system with a truly negative temperature on the kelvin scale is hotter than any system with a positive temperature if a negative temperature system and a positive temperature system come in contact heat will flow from the negative to the positive temperature system a standard example of such a system is population inversion in laser physics temperature is loosely interpreted

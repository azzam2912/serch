this pathway was first described by john lowenstein who outlined its importance in processes including amino acid catabolism and regulation of flux through glycolysis and the krebs cycle the cycle is composed of three enzyme catalysed reactions the first stage is the deamination of the purine nucleotide adenosine monophosphate amp to form inosine monophosphate imp catalysed by the enzyme amp deaminase the second stage is the formation of adenylosuccinate from imp and the amino acid aspartate which is coupled to the energetically favourable hydrolysis of gtp and catalysed by the enzyme adenylosuccinate synthetase finally adenylosuccinate is cleaved by the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase to release fumarate and regenerate the starting material of amp a recent study conducted by sridharan et al ajp cell physiology 2008 295 c29 c37 showed that activation of hif 1 allows cardiomyocytes to sustain mitochondrial membrane potential during anoxic stress by utilizing fumarate produced by adenylosuccinate lyase as an alternate terminal electron acceptor in place of oxygen this mechanism should help provide protection in the ischemic heart this cycle occurs in skeletal muscle myocyte s cytosolic compartment this reaction helps to dispose amp produced after following reaction 2 adp atp amp catalysed by adenylyl kinase myokinase purine

ska2 is a part of a spindle and kinetochore associated complex also including ska1 and ska3 which is responsible for onset of the anaphase in mitosis by regulating chromosomal segregation ska2 may function as a prognostic gene marker for identifying lung cancer as well as a proposed biomarker for suicidal tendencies and post traumatic stress disorders the ska2 gene contains one single nucleotide polymorphism snp rs7208505 located in the 3 utr this genetic variant containing a cytosine existing in the less common allele instead of thymine along with epigenetic modification such as dna methylation is correlated with suicidal tendencies and post traumatic stress ska2 protein was first documented as a product of as hypothetical gene fam33a part of a spindle and kinetochore kt associated complex necessary for timely anaphase onset ska2 was identified as the partner of ska1 hence the name in 2006 later on the 3rd component of the ska complex was mass spectrometrically identified as c13orf3 later referred to as ska3 this complex plays an important role in the cell during mitotic transition from the metaphase to the anaphase ska2 gene product is a 121 amino acid long chain and a molecular weight of 14 188 da containing

the operation is commutative as an operation on isomorphism classes of graphs and more strongly the graphs g formula 1 h and h formula 1 g are naturally isomorphic but it is not commutative as an operation on labeled graphs the notation g h has often been used for cartesian products of graphs but is now more commonly used for another construction known as the tensor product of graphs the square symbol is an intuitive and unambiguous notation for the cartesian product since it shows visually the four edges resulting from the cartesian product of two edges if a connected graph is a cartesian product it can be factorized uniquely as a product of prime factors graphs that cannot themselves be decomposed as products of graphs however describe a disconnected graph that can be expressed in two different ways as a cartesian product of prime graphs where the plus sign denotes disjoint union and the superscripts denote exponentiation over cartesian products a cartesian product is vertex transitive if and only if each of its factors is a cartesian product is bipartite if and only if each of its factors is more generally the chromatic number of the cartesian product satisfies

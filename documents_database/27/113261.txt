it is a topological space called the underlying space with an orbifold structure see below the underlying space locally looks like the quotient space of a euclidean space under the linear action of a finite group definitions of orbifold have been given several times by ichir satake in the context of automorphic forms in the 1950s under the name v manifold by william thurston in the context of the geometry of 3 manifolds in the 1970s when he coined the name orbifold after a vote by his students and by andr haefliger in the 1980s in the context of mikhail gromov s programme on cat k spaces under the name orbihedron the definition of thurston will be described here it is the most widely used and is applicable in all cases mathematically orbifolds arose first as surfaces with singular points long before they were formally defined one of the first classical examples arose in the theory of modular forms with the action of the modular group formula 1 on the upper half plane a version of the riemann roch theorem holds after the quotient is compactified by the addition of two orbifold cusp points in 3 manifold theory the theory

however acyltransferase activities involved in the reacylation of mlcl had not been identified or characterized in any mammalian tissue until 1999 by the hatch lab at the university of manitoba in rat heart mitochondria in 2003 the same lab purified and characterized an mlcl acyltransferase in pig liver mitochondria and by comparing this protein against a human protein database they identified a sequenced but uncharacterized human protein as the enzyme responsible in 2009 mlcl at 1 catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acid chain attached to a coenzyme a molecule to an available hydroxyl group on mlcl producing cardiolipin this lipid remodeling is separate from the cardiolipin synthesis pathway and is essential to maintain its unique unsaturated fatty acyl composition mlcl at 1 typically utilizes linoleoyl coenzyme a preferred to oleoyl coenzyme a which is preferred to palmitoyl coenzyme a mlcl at 1 activity increases in cells cardiac myoblast cells exposed to 2 deoxyglucose induced apoptosis mlcl at 1 activity also increases in a rat model of spontaneously hypertensive heart failure since cardiolipin content is significantly diminished in the inner mitochondrial membrane during apoptosis the increase of lipid remodeling by mlcl at 1 may be an effort of the cell

de blainville included in his group many unicellular forms sea anemones corals jellyfish hydroid polyps echinoderms polyzoa and rotifera thomas huxley afterwards applied the term in a restricted sense he showed that within de blainville s group along with a number of heterogeneous forms there was a group of animals characterized by being composed of two layers of cells comparable with the first two layers in the development of vertebrate animals these he called coelentera and showed that they had no special affinity with echinoderms polyzoa etc he further divided the coelentera into a group hydrozoa in which the sexually produced embryos were usually set free from the surface of the body and a group actinozoa in which the embryos are detached from the interior of the body and escape generally by the oral aperture huxley s actinozoa comprised the sea anemones corals and sea pens on the one hand and the ctenophora comb jellies on the other modern biology confirms huxley s criticism of de blainville s actinozoa and upholds hydrozoa but it is now known that the ctenophora are only distantly related to jellyfish and their relatives so huxley s actinozoa and coelentera are no longer used though

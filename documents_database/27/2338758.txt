first invented by wallace h coulter in 1953 the rps technique is also known as the coulter principle an international standard has been developed for the use of this technique the basic principle is shown in fig 1 in which individual particles suspended in fluid flow one at a time through a micro or nanoconstriction the fluid is weakly conducting and the obscuration of an electrical sensing current flowing through the fluid by the presence of the particle causes an increase in the measured voltage in other words the particle causes a change in the electrical resistance of the nanoconstriction this is shown schematically in fig 2 the quantitative relationship between the measured change in resistance and particle size was worked out by de blois and bean in 1970 where they found the very simple result that the resistance change is proportional to the ratio of particle volume to the effective volume of the nanoconstriction the dynamic range of an rps instrument is thus limited at its upper end by the diameter of the nanoconstriction setting the maximum detectable particle size and at its lower end by the electrical noise in the sensing circuit setting the minimum resistance change and

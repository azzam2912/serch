giaever s share of the prize was specifically for his experimental discoveries regarding tunnelling phenomena in superconductors giaever is a professor emeritus at the rensselaer polytechnic institute and the president of the company applied biophysics giaever earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the norwegian institute of technology in trondheim in 1952 in 1954 he emigrated from norway to canada where he was employed by the canadian division of general electric he moved to the united states four years later joining general electric s corporate research and development center in schenectady new york in 1958 he has lived in niskayuna new york since then taking up us citizenship in 1964 while working for general electric giaever earned a ph d degree at the rensselaer polytechnic institute in 1964 the work that led to giaever s nobel prize was performed at general electric in 1960 following on esaki s discovery of electron tunnelling in semiconductors in 1958 giaever showed that tunnelling also took place in superconductors demonstrating tunnelling through a very thin layer of oxide surrounded on both sides by metal in a superconducting or normal state giaever s experiments demonstrated the existence of an energy gap in superconductors one of

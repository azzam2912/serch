it is considered as one of the major components of autonomic networking one of the most important characteristics of today s internet that has contributed to its success is its basic design principle a simple and transparent core with intelligence at the edges the so called end to end principle based on this principle the network carries data without knowing the characteristics of that data e g voice video etc only the end points have application specific knowledge if something goes wrong with the data only the edge may be able to recognize that since it knows about the application and what the expected behavior is the core has no information about what should happen with that data it only forwards packets although an effective and beneficial attribute this design principle has also led to many of today s problems limitations and frustrations currently it is almost impossible for most end users to know why certain network based applications do not work well and what they need to do to make it better also network operators who interact with the core in low level terms such as router configuration have problems expressing their high level goals into low level actions

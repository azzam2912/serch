the zcam supplements full color video camera imaging with real time range imaging information allowing for the capture of video in 3d the original zcam released in 2000 was an eng video camera add on used for digital video compositing before agreeing in march 2009 to sell its assets to microsoft 3dv had planned to release a ranging video webcam previously called the z sense also under the name zcam the zcam webcam was one of several competing real time range imaging camera products in development that target home game controller applications the zcam s time of flight camera system features a near infrared nir pulse illumination component as well as an image sensor with a fast gating mechanism based on the known speed of light zcam coordinates the timing of nir pulse wave emissions from the illuminator with the gating of the image sensor so that the signal reflected from within a desired depth range is captured exclusively the amount of pulse signal collected for each pixel corresponds to where within the depth range the pulse was reflected from and can thus be used to calculate the distance to a corresponding point on the captured subject due to the

these models are useful in modeling time series with long memory that is in which deviations from the long run mean decay more slowly than an exponential decay the acronyms arfima or farima are often used although it is also conventional to simply extend the arima p d q notation for models by simply allowing the order of differencing d to take fractional values in an arima model the integrated part of the model includes the differencing operator 1 b where b is the backshift operator raised to an integer power for example where so that in a fractional model the power is allowed to be fractional with the meaning of the term identified using the following formal binomial series expansion the simplest autoregressive fractionally integrated model arfima 0 d 0 is in standard notation where this has the interpretation arfima 0 d 0 is similar to fractional gaussian noise fgn with d h their covariances have the same power law decay the advantage of fgn over arfima 0 d 0 is that many asymptotic relations hold for finite samples the advantage of arfima 0 d 0 over fgn is that it has an especially simple spectral density and it

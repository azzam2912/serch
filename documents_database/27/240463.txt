gammaquest ii created randomly generated dungeons that were revealed piece by piece as the character explored the map and stayed lit behind the character as it moved emulating the mapping of a dungeon level the game graphics however were limited to the character set of the computer mccord accepted an offer to publish the game from the video game developer and publisher epyx in 1982 on the commodore vic 20 his original name for the new version was sword of fargaol deriving the name from the old english spelling of jail gaol but his producer at epyx susan lee merrow convinced him to change it to its present form the following year with the release of the commodore 64 c64 mccord was asked to release a version of sword of fargoal for that machine as well mccord was unable to implement the conversion as it was written in basic and the sprite based graphics required machine language programming mccord s friend scott corsaire then carter and steve lepisto wrote all the machine language code that was needed so that game would perform fast enough for the c64 version of the game including the main redrawing of the dungeon levels clearing

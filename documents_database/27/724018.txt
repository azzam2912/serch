among molluscs it is primarily seen in snails and clams i e in gastropods and bivalves but it is also found in cephalopods such as allonautilus scrobiculatus periostracum is an integral part of the shell and it forms as the shell forms along with the other shell layers periostracum is visible as the outer layer of the shell of many molluscan species from terrestrial freshwater and marine habitats and may be seen in land snails river mussels and other kinds of freshwater bivalves as well as in many kinds of marine shelled molluscs the word periostracum means around the shell meaning that the periostracum is wrapped around what is usually the more calcareous part of the shell technically the calcareous part of the shell can at least in theory be referred to as the ostracum but that term is only very rarely used this shell layer is composed of a type of protein known as conchiolin conchiolin is largely composed of quinone tanned proteins which are similar to those found in the epidermal cuticle the formation of a shell requires certain biological machinery the shell is deposited within a small compartment the extrapallial space which is sealed from the environment

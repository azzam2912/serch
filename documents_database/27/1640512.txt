fourneyron made significant contributions to the development of water turbines beno t fourneyron was educated at the cole nationale sup rieure des mines de saint tienne a nearby engineering school that had recently opened after he graduated in 1816 he spent the next few years in mines and ironworks around this time a number of french engineers including some of fourneyron s former teachers were starting to apply the mathematical techniques of modern science to the ancient mechanism called the waterwheel for centuries waterwheels had been used to convert the energy of streams into mechanical power mostly for milling grain but the new machines of the industrial revolution required more power and by the 1820s there was enormous interest in making waterwheels more efficient using the proposal of a former teacher claude burdin as a guide fourneyron built in 1827 at age of 25 his first prototype for a new type of waterwheel called a turbine the term turbine is derived from the latin word for a spinning top in fourneyron s design the wheel was horizontal unlike the vertical wheels in traditional waterwheels this turbine used two sets of blades curved in opposite directions to get as much power

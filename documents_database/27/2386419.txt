it is an experiment designed with several goals including to determine the pressure and temperature of plutonian atmosphere to measurements of a possible ionosphere of pluto and or charon to record thermal emission temperatures and to take more accurate chord lengths of charon and pluto to accomplish the objectives as the spacecraft passes by pluto it is targeted on a path that takes it behind the dwarf planet in relation to where earth is and at that time radio signals from the flyby spacecraft pass through atmosphere of body and from this various aspects can be determined rex also is designed to take measurements of the atmospheric conditions at pluto s moon charon as part of the mission rex utilizes an ultrastable oscillator various electronics and radio hardware aboard the new horizons spacecraft rex utilizes the x band radio uplink on the spacecraft rex hardware weights 160 g 0 16 kg and consumes 1 6 watts of spacecraft electrical power it also makes use of other nh hardware overall key hardware components for rex include to take the measurements rex communicates with the deep space network back on earth rex can also directly measure the thermal radiation of pluto at

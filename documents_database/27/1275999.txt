phospholipids are the primary lipids composing cellular membranes phospholipids can be saponified which releases the fatty acids contained in their diglyceride tail once the phospholipids of an unknown sample are saponified the composition of the resulting plfa can be compared to the plfa of known organisms to determine the identity of the sample organism plfa analysis may be combined with other techniques such as stable isotope probing to determine which microbes are metabolically active in a sample plfa analysis was pioneered by d c white at the university of tennessee in the early to mid 1980s plfas are an essential structural component of all microbial cellular membranes plfa analysis is a technique widely used for estimation of the total biomass and to observe broad changes in the community composition of the living microbiota of soil and aqueous environments there has been a surge of interest in plfas in recent years evident from the large increase in peer reviewed journal references on the subject however there is increasing concern that some researchers are assigning plfas to specific microbial classes when in fact those plfas are present in a broad range of life forms phospholipids can occur in many biological classes such

it has no paralogs but is predicted to have many orthologs across eukaryotes the secondary structure of tmem53 is predicted to consist of alternating pairs of alpha helices and beta sheets tmem53 has 3 exons twelve alternative splice forms have been identified using 26 alternative exons the following table includes the predicted post translational modifications for each isoform the function of tmem53 is not fully understood it contains a domain of unknown function duf829 which is approximately 240 amino acids long this domain has not been found in proteins other than tmem53 and its orthologs based on human and mouse est profiles and a human tissue geo profile tmem53 appears to be expressed ubiquitously at low levels in both normal and cancerous tissues more specific expression patterns have also been observed transmembrane protein 53 has no paralogs it does however have orthologs extending throughout eukaryotes from primates to amoeba the following table presents a selection of orthologs found using searches in blast and blat it is not a comprehensive list but rather a small selection meant to display the diversity of species in which orthologs are found based on clustalw multiple sequence alignments of 38 orthologs including the ones above

it was introduced by tetsuo asano jiri matousek and takeshi tokuyama in 2007 formally it is a fixed point of a certain function its existence or uniqueness are not clear in advance and have been established only in specific cases its computation is not obvious too consider a group of formula 1 different points formula 2 in the euclidean plane each point is called a site when we speak about the voronoi diagram induced by these sites we associate to the site formula 3 the set formula 4 of all points in the plane whose distance to the given site formula 3 is not greater to their distance to any other site formula 6 the collection formula 7 of these regions is the voronoi diagram associated with these sites and it induces a decomposition of the plane into regions the voronoi regions voronoi cells in a zone diagram the region associated with the site formula 8 is defined a little bit differently instead of associating it the set of all points whose distance to formula 8 is not greater than their distance to the other sites we associate to formula 8 the set formula 11 of all points in the

space telescopes avoid the filtering of ultraviolet frequencies x rays and gamma rays the distortion scintillation of electromagnetic radiation as well as light pollution which ground based observatories encounter suggested by lyman spitzer in 1946 the first operational space telescopes were the american orbiting astronomical observatory oao 2 launched in 1968 and the soviet orion 1 ultraviolet telescope aboard space station salyut 1 in 1971 space telescopes are distinct from satellites that point toward earth for satellite imagery for espionage weather analysis and other types of information gathering space observatories are divided into two types astronomical survey satellites to map the entire sky and satellites which focus on selected astronomical objects or parts of the sky and beyond wilhelm beer and johann heinrich m dler in 1837 discussed the advantages of an observatory on the moon in 1946 american theoretical astrophysicist lyman spitzer proposed a telescope in space 11 years before the soviet union launched the first satellite sputnik 1 spitzer s proposal called for a large telescope that would not be hindered by earth s atmosphere after lobbying in the 1960s and 70s for such a system to be built spitzer s vision ultimately materialized into the hubble space

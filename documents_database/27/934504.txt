computerised treatment planning systems began to be used in the 1970s to improve the accuracy and speed of dose calculations by the 1990s ct scans more powerful computers improved dose calculation algorithms and multileaf collimators mlcs lead to 3d conformal planning 3dcrt categorised as a level 2 technique by the european dynarad consortium 3dcrt uses mlcs to shape the radiotherapy beam to closely match the shape of a target tumour reducing the dose to healthy surrounding tissue level 3 techniques such as imrt and vmat utilise inverse planning to provide further improved dose distributions i e better coverage of target tumours and sparing of healthy tissue these methods are growing in use particularly for cancers in certain locations which have been shown to derive the greatest benefits typically medical imaging is used to form a virtual patient for a computer aided design procedure a ct scan is often the primary image set for treatment planning while magnetic resonance imaging provides excellent secondary image set for soft tissue contouring positron emission tomography is less commonly used and reserved for cases where specific uptake studies can enhance planning target volume delineation modern treatment planning systems provide tools for multimodality image matching also

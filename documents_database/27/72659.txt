it is commonly found on unix like operating systems the rsync algorithm is a type of delta encoding and is used for minimizing network usage zlib may be used for additional data compression and ssh or stunnel can be used for security rsync is typically used for synchronizing files and directories between two different systems for example if the command codice 1 is run rsync will use ssh to connect as codice 2 to codice 3 once connected it will invoke the remote host s rsync and then the two programs will determine what parts of the local file need to be transferred so that the remote file matches the local one rsync can also operate in a daemon mode serving and receiving files in the native rsync protocol using the rsync syntax it is licensed under the gnu general public license andrew tridgell and paul mackerras wrote the original rsync which was first announced on 19 june 1996 tridgell discusses the design implementation and performance of rsync in chapters 3 through 5 of his ph d thesis in 1999 it is currently maintained by wayne davison because of the flexibility speed and scriptability of codice 4 it has become

the world s largest ring lasers can detect details of the earth s rotation such large rings are also capable of extending scientific research in many new directions including the detection of gravitational waves fresnel drag lense thirring effect and quantum electrodynamic effects in a rotating ring laser gyroscope the two counter propagating waves are slightly shifted in frequency and an interference pattern is observed which is used to determine the rotational speed the response to a rotation is a frequency difference between the two beams which is proportional to the rotation rate of the ring laser sagnac effect the difference can easily be measured generally however any non reciprocity in the propagation between the two beams leads to a beat frequency there is a continuous transition between ring lasers for engineering application and ring lasers for research see ring lasers for research rings for engineering have begun to incorporate a vast variety of materials as well as new technology historically the first extension was the use of fiber optics as wave guides obviating the use of mirrors however even rings using the most advanced fiber working in its optimal wavelength range e g sio at 1 5 m have

several natural and human made systems including the internet the world wide web citation networks and some social networks are thought to be approximately scale free and certainly contain few nodes called hubs with unusually high degree as compared to the other nodes of the network the ba model tries to explain the existence of such nodes in real networks the algorithm is named for its inventors albert l szl barab si and r ka albert and is a special case of an earlier and more general model called price s model many observed networks at least approximately fall into the class of scale free networks meaning that they have power law or scale free degree distributions while random graph models such as the erd s r nyi er model and the watts strogatz ws model do not exhibit power laws the barab si albert model is one of several proposed models that generate scale free networks it incorporates two important general concepts growth and preferential attachment both growth and preferential attachment exist widely in real networks growth means that the number of nodes in the network increases over time preferential attachment means that the more connected a node is

an analytic space is a space that is locally the same as an analytic variety they are prominent in the study of several complex variables but they also appear in other contexts fix a field k with a valuation assume that the field is complete and not discrete with respect to this valuation for example this includes r and c with respect to their usual absolute values as well as fields of puiseux series with respect to their natural valuations let u be an open subset of k and let f f be a collection of analytic functions on u denote by z the common vanishing locus of f f that is let z x f x f x 0 z is an analytic variety suppose that the structure sheaf of u is formula 1 then z has a structure sheaf formula 2 where formula 3 is the ideal generated by f f in other words the structure sheaf of z consists of all functions on u modulo the possible ways they can differ outside of z an analytic space is a locally ringed space formula 4 such that around every point x of x there exists an open neighborhood

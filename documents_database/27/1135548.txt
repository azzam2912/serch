vocalizations in this case refers only to sounds generated by the vocal organ mammalian larynx or avian syrinx as opposed to by the lips teeth and tongue which require substantially less motor control a rare trait vocal learning is a critical substrate for spoken language and has only been detected in eight animal groups despite the wide array of vocalizing species these include humans bats cetaceans pinnipeds seals and sea lions elephants and three distantly related bird groups including songbirds parrots and hummingbirds vocal learning is distinct from auditory learning or the ability to form memories of sounds heard a relatively common trait which is present in all vertebrates tested for example dogs can be trained to understand the word sit even though the human word is not in its innate auditory repertoire auditory learning however the dog cannot imitate and produce the word sit itself as vocal learners can historically species have been classified into the binary categories of vocal learner or vocal non learner based on their ability to produce novel vocalizations or imitate other species with evidence from social isolation deafening studies and cross fostering experiments however vocal learners exhibit a great deal of plasticity or variation

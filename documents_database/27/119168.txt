compared to vapor refrigerators thermoacoustic refrigerators have no coolant and few moving parts only the loudspeaker therefore require no dynamic sealing or lubrication the ability of heat to produce sound was noted by glassblowers centuries ago in the 1850s experiments showed that a temperature differential drove the phenomenon and that acoustic volume and intensity vary with tube length and bulb size rijke demonstrated that adding a heated wire screen a quarter of the way up the tube greatly magnified the sound supplying energy to the air in the tube at its point of greatest pressure further experiments showed that cooling the air at its points of minimal pressure produced a similar amplifying effect a rijke tube converts heat into acoustic energy using natural convection in about 1887 lord rayleigh discussed the possibility of pumping heat with sound in 1969 rott reopened the topic using the navier stokes equations for fluids he derived equations specific for thermoacoustics linear thermoacoustic models were developed to form a basic quantitative understanding and numeric models for computation swift continued with these equations deriving expressions for the acoustic power in thermoacoustic devices in 1992 a similar thermoacoustic refrigeration device was used on space shuttle discovery orest

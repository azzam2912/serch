the cell line is pluripotent and can differentiate into cell types of all three germ layers also it is the most characterized embryonic carcinoma ec cell line that can be induced into cardiac muscle cells and neuronal cells by different specific treatments indeed exposing aggregated p19 cells to dimethyl sulfoxide dmso induces differentiation into cardiac and skeletal muscle also exposing p19 cells to retinoic acid ra can differentiate them into neuronal cells cancer cells in humans may result in the patient s death if the aggressive cancer cell grows and metastasizes however researchers utilize these cells to study the development of cancer cells in order to find more specific treatments for developmental biologists embryonal carcinoma which is derived from teratocarcinoma is a good object for developmental study in 1982 mcburney and rogers transplanted a 7 5 day mouse embryo into the testis to induce tumor growth cell cultures containing undifferentiated stem cells were isolated from the primary tumor which have a euploid karyotype these stem cells were named embryonal carcinoma p19 cells these derived p19 cells grew rapidly without feeder cells and were easy to maintain moreover the multipotency of p19 cells was then confirmed by injecting the cells into

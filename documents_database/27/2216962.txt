the conjecture is named for hyman bass and daniel quillen who formulated the conjecture the conjecture is a statement about finitely generated projective modules such modules are also referred to as vector bundles for a ring a the set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles over a of rank r is denoted by formula 2 the conjecture asserts that for a regular noetherian ring a the assignment yields a bijection if a k is a field the bass quillen conjecture asserts that any projective module over formula 5 is free this question was raised by jean pierre serre and was later proved by quillen and suslin see quillen suslin theorem more generally the conjecture was shown by in the case that a is a smooth algebra over a field k further known cases are reviewed in the set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles of rank r over a can also be identified with the nonabelian cohomology group positive results about the homotopy invariance of of isotropic reductive groups g have been obtained by by means of a homotopy theory

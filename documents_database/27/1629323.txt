the energy can be limited by circuit breakers or fuses and the impulse voltages by the nominal level of voltage measuring circuits are subjected to working voltages and transient stresses from the circuit to which they are connected during measurement or test when the measuring circuit is used to measure mains the transient stresses can be estimated by the location within the installation at which the measurement is performed when the measuring circuit is used to measure any other electrical signal the transient stresses must be considered by the user to assure that they do not exceed the capabilities of the measuring equipment in this standard circuits are divided into the following measurement categories category i is for measurements performed on circuits not directly connected to mains examples are measurements on circuits not derived from mains and specially protected internal mains derived circuits in the latter case transient stresses are variable for that reason iec 61010 1 5 4 1 g requires that the transient withstand capability of the equipment is made known to the user measurement category ii is for measurements performed on circuits directly connected to the low voltage installation examples are measurements on household appliances portable tools

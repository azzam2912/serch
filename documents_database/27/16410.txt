without frame synchronization decommutation is impossible the frame synchronization pattern is a known binary pattern which repeats at a regular interval within the pcm stream the frame synchronizer recognizes this pattern and aligns the data into minor frames or sub frames typically the frame sync pattern is followed by a counter sub frame id which dictates which minor or sub frame in the series is being transmitted this becomes increasingly important in the decommutation stage where all data is deciphered as to what attribute was sampled different commutations require a constant awareness of which section of the major frame is being decoded

this practice which is known as fractional reserve banking permits the total supply of credit to exceed the liquid legal reserves of the bank the amount of this excess is expressed as the reserve ratio and is limited by government regulators not to exceed a level which they deem adequate to ensure the ability of banks to meet their payment obligations under this system which is currently practiced throughout the world the money supply varies with the quantity of legal reserves and the amount of credit issuance by banks several major historical examples of financial regulatory reform occurred in the 20th century relating to fractional reserve banking made in response to the great depression and the many bank runs following the crash of 1929 these reforms included the creation of deposit insurance such as the federal deposit insurance corporation to mitigate against the danger of bank runs countries have also implemented legal reserve requirements which impose minimum reserve requirements on banks mainstream economists believe that these monetary reforms have made sudden disruptions in the banking system less frequent however some critics of fractional reserve banking argue that the practice inherently artificially lowers real interest rates and leads to business cycles

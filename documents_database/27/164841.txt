it has a mass of about 30 000 to 60 000 daltons flagellin is the principal component of bacterial flagellum and is present in large amounts on nearly all flagellated bacteria the structure of flagellin is responsible for the helical shape of the flagellar filament which is important for its proper function it is transported through the center of the filament to the tip where it polymerases spontaneously into a part of the filament it is unfolded by the flis flagellar secretion chaperone during transport the filament is made up of eleven smaller protofilaments nine of which contains flagellin in the l type shape and the other two in the r type shape the helical n and c termini of flagellin form the inner core of the flagellin protein and is responsible for flagellin s ability to polymerize into a filament the middle residues make up the outer surface of the flagellar filament while the termini of the protein are quite similar among all bacterial flagellins the middle portion is wildly variable and can be absent in some species the flagellin domains are numbered from the helical core d0 d1 to the outside d2 when viewed from the amino acid

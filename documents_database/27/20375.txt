two common types of waveplates are the half wave plate which shifts the polarization direction of linearly polarized light and the quarter wave plate which converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa a quarter wave plate can be used to produce elliptical polarization as well waveplates are constructed out of a birefringent material such as quartz or mica or even plastic for which the index of refraction is different for light linearly polarized along one or the other of two certain perpendicular crystal axes the behavior of a waveplate that is whether it is a half wave plate a quarter wave plate etc depends on the thickness of the crystal the wavelength of light and the variation of the index of refraction by appropriate choice of the relationship between these parameters it is possible to introduce a controlled phase shift between the two polarization components of a light wave thereby altering its polarization a common use of waveplates particularly the sensitive tint full wave and quarter wave plates is in optical mineralogy addition of plates between the polarizers of a petrographic microscope makes easier the optical identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks in particular

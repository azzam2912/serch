it consists of a higher salinity branch and a lower salinity branch it originates in the weddell sea and closely follows the sea floor as it flows out into the rest of the world s oceans it is created mainly due to the high surface winds blowing off the antarctic continent which helps cool and oxygenate it it flows at a rate of 2 to 5 sv and contributes to the overall flow of the aabw the weddell sea plays an important role in the movement of the world s oceans an important part of the weddell sea is weddell sea bottom water wsbw wsbw is a major contributor to antarctic bottom water aabw while wsbw is considered part of aabw the distinction comes in its potential temperature the potential temperature of wsbw is 0 7 c at this temperature the potential temperature vs salinity chart shows a sharp change in slope the outflow of wsbw is influenced greatly by the scotia ridge the movement of wbsw is listed as 16 sv which contributes to a total 97 sv outflow of aabw 2 to 5 sv of this production is newly formed bottom water off the antarctic coast the weddell

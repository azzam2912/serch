these actions have cost many subsequent restorations dearly however there are a number of different methods for restoring early coloured films today each of which nonetheless comes with its own inherent strengths and weaknesses the most obvious in a way the most straightforward though it still requires a great deal of skill and accuracy in order to be done successfully and still the most common method today is that of copying the original coloured print as is onto modern eastman colour inter negative film from the developed inter negative then a new colour positive print can be struck if set up and executed correctly the colours in the new positive print can resemble very closely the colours in the original print but only as they survive today therefore whatever fading decomposition and or other changes which may have occurred to the colours down through the years will also be copied along with them beyond the possibility to make very slight improvements to the saturation this method offers little in the way of any colour restoration there are meanwhile other notable disadvantages not least the use of modern colour film stock colour film is both expensive and has questionable archival permanence

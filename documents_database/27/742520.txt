it is dubbed time evolving block decimation because it dynamically identifies the relevant low dimensional hilbert subspaces of an exponentially larger original hilbert space the algorithm based on the matrix product states formalism is highly efficient when the amount of entanglement in the system is limited a requirement fulfilled by a large class of quantum many body systems in one dimension there is nowadays a considerable interest in the field of quantum theory for computational methods well suited to the physics of many body systems considering the inherent difficulties of simulating general quantum many body systems the exponential increase in parameters with the size of the system and correspondingly the high computational costs one solution would be to look for numerical methods that deal with special cases where one can profit from the physics of the system the raw approach by directly dealing with all the parameters used to fully characterize a quantum many body system is seriously impeded by the lavishly exponential buildup with the system size of the amount of variables needed for simulation which leads in the best cases to unreasonably long computational times and extended use of memory to get around this problem a number of

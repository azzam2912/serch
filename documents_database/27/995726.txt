mir 92 has been mapped to the human genome as part of a larger cluster at chromosome 13q31 3 where it is 22 nucleotides in length but exists in the genome as part of a longer precursor sequence there is an exact replica of the mir 92 precursor on the x chromosome micrornas are endogenous triggers of the rnai pathway which involves several ribonucleic proteins rnps dedicated to repressing mrna molecules via translation inhibition and or induction of mrna cleavage mirnas are themselves matured from their long rna precursors by ribonucleic proteins as part of a 2 step biogenesis mechanism involving rna polymerase 2 most mirnas are grouped into clusters in the human genome or within families that share functions expression profiles promoters or are incorporated into the same ribonucleic protein the purpose of having a variety of mirnas in a single piece of rna processing machinery is to act as complementary strands to the recognition elements of a variety of target rna molecules the recognition elements of target mrnas are typically within the 3 untranslated regions and with 678 human mirnas and 472 mouse mirnas confidently identified so far mirbase there are extensive efforts taking place using bioinformatics tools

the langlands conjectures were introduced by and describe a correspondence between representations of the weil group of an algebraic function field and representations of algebraic groups over the function field generalizing class field theory of function fields from abelian galois groups to non abelian galois groups the langlands conjectures for gl k follow from and are essentially equivalent to class field theory more precisely the artin map gives a map from the idele class group to the abelianization of the weil group the representations of gl f appearing in the langlands correspondence are automorphic representations here f is a global field of some positive characteristic p and is some prime not equal to p lafforgue s theorem states that there is a bijection between that preserves the l function at every place of f the proof of lafforgue s theorem involves constructing a representation of the absolute galois group for each cuspidal representation the idea of doing this is to look in the adic cohomology of the moduli stack of shtukas of rank n that have compatible level n structures for all n the cohomology contains subquotients of the form which can be used to construct from a major problem

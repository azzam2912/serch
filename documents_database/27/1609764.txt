the family in its current sense is based on molecular research and contains just three genera of temperate corticioid fungi the concept of the family was introduced by french mycologist ren maire in 1902 but the name vuilleminiacaeae was not published till 1907 when johannes paulus lotsy adopted maire s concepts for his work on fungal systematics as originally conceived the family accommodated species within the corticioid fungi having chiastic basidia basidia with nuclear spindles arranged transversely thought to be a primitive character linking the vuilleminiaceae with the tulasnellaceae and the tremellales the family was not however widely adopted most mycological texts preferring to place all corticioid fungi including vuilleminia species in the corticiaceae the latter name was however not published till 1910 making the vuilleminiaceae an earlier name for the group as noted by j lich in 1981 as a result the corticiaceae was conserved against the vuilleminiaceae under the international code of botanical nomenclature but this suppression of the name only applies if the two families are considered identical molecular research based on cladistic analysis of dna sequences has resurrected and redefined the vuilleminiaceae for a small clade of corticioid fungi distinct from the corticiaceae at present the

his greatest achievement was in the development of statistical mechanics which explains and predicts how the properties of atoms such as mass charge and structure determine the physical properties of matter such as viscosity thermal conductivity and diffusion boltzmann coined the word ergodic while he was working on a problem in statistical mechanics boltzmann was born in vienna the capital of the austrian empire his father ludwig georg boltzmann was a revenue official his grandfather who had moved to vienna from berlin was a clock manufacturer and boltzmann s mother katharina pauernfeind was originally from salzburg he received his primary education from a private tutor at the home of his parents boltzmann attended high school in linz upper austria when boltzmann was 15 his father died starting in 1863 boltzmann studied physics at the university of vienna among his teachers were josef loschmidt joseph stefan andreas von ettingshausen and jozef petzval boltzmann received his phd degree in 1866 working under the supervision of stefan his dissertation was on the kinetic theory of gases in 1867 he became a privatdozent lecturer after obtaining his doctorate degree boltzmann worked two more years as stefan s assistant it was stefan who introduced boltzmann

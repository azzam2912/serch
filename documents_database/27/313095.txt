the series consisted of three major generations which were the b1700 b1800 and b1900 series machines they were also known as the burroughs small systems by contrast with the burroughs large systems b5000 b6000 b7000 b8000 and the burroughs medium systems b2000 b3000 b4000 much of the original research for the b1700 initially codenamed the plp proper language processor or program language processor was done at the burroughs pasadena plant production of the b1700s began in the mid 1970s and occurred at both the santa barbara and liege belgium plants the majority of design work was done at santa barbara with the b1830 being the notable exception designed at liege the b1000 is distinguished from other machines in that it had a writeable control store allowing the machine to emulate any other machine the burroughs mcp master control program would schedule a particular job to run the mcp would preload the interpreter for whatever language was required these interpreters presented different virtual machines for cobol fortran etc a notable idea of the semantic gap between the ideal expression of the solution to a particular programming problem and the real physical hardware illustrated the inefficiency of current machine implementations the three

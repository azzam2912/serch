it is performed by placing a drop of a chemical on different parts of the lichen and noting the color change or lack thereof associated with application of the chemical the tests are routinely encountered in dichotomous keys for lichen species and they take advantage of the wide array of secondary metabolites produced by lichens and their uniqueness among taxa as such spot tests reveal the presence or absence of chemicals in various parts of a lichen they were first proposed by the william nylander botanist in 1866 the three most common spot tests are although the above tests are most common a kc test may be performed by wetting the thallus with k followed immediately by c in addition lugol s iodine may be useful in identifying certain species spot tests are performed by placing a small amount of the desired reagent on the portion of the lichen to be tested often both the cortex and medulla of the lichen are tested and at times it is useful to test other structures such as soralia one method is to draw up a small amount of the chemical into a glass capillary and touch it to the lichen thallus a

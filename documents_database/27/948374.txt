the canadian federal government and some provincial governments offer tax credits to lsvcc investors to promote the growth of such companies the idea behind lsvccs was first proposed in the canadian province of quebec in 1982 the province was in the midst of a recession and the lack of capital in small and mid sized companies had caused numerous bankruptcies in response the quebec federation of labour proposed a solidarity fund at a provincial economic summit conference in 1982 to help the province create a locally controlled healthy and sustainable economy the intention was to attract venture capital to smaller quebec firms this new type of fund slowly began to spread across the rest of canada during the 1980s but it wasn t until the late 1990s that lsvccs became truly noteworthy outside quebec thanks in equal part to generous tax breaks from federal and provincial governments and attractive returns to investors so far in the 2000s returns have been less impressive due in part to the bursting of the technology bubble returns for lsvccs have generally been stagnant speculation about the reasons for low returns point to risky ventures inexperienced fund managers lack of requirement to generate positive returns

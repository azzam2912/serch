the brn is a dimensionless ratio in meteorology related to the consumption of turbulence divided by the shear production the generation of turbulence kinetic energy caused by wind shear of turbulence it is used to show dynamic stability and the formation of turbulence the brn is used frequently in meteorology due to widely available rawinsonde frequently called radiosonde data and numerical weather forecasts that supply wind and temperature measurements at discrete points in space below is the formula for the brn where g is gravitational acceleration t is absolute virtual temperature is the virtual potential temperature difference across a layer of thickness z vertical depth and u and v are the changes in horizontal wind components across that same layer high values indicate unstable and or weakly sheared environments low values indicate weak instability and or strong vertical shear generally values in the range of around 10 to 50 suggest environmental conditions favorable for supercell development in the limit of layer thickness becoming small the bulk richardson number approaches the gradient richardson number for which a critical richardson number is roughly ri 0 25 numbers less than this critical value are dynamically unstable and likely to become or remain turbulent

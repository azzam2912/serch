hence zigbee is a low power low data rate and close proximity i e personal area wireless ad hoc network the technology defined by the zigbee specification is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other wireless personal area networks wpans such as bluetooth or more general wireless networking such as wi fi applications include wireless light switches home energy monitors traffic management systems and other consumer and industrial equipment that requires short range low rate wireless data transfer its low power consumption limits transmission distances to 10 100 meters line of sight depending on power output and environmental characteristics zigbee devices can transmit data over long distances by passing data through a mesh network of intermediate devices to reach more distant ones zigbee is typically used in low data rate applications that require long battery life and secure networking zigbee networks are secured by 128 bit symmetric encryption keys zigbee has a defined rate of 250 kbit s best suited for intermittent data transmissions from a sensor or input device zigbee was conceived in 1998 standardized in 2003 and revised in 2006 the name refers to the waggle dance of honey bees after their return to the beehive

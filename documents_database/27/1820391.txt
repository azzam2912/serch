a graphic matroid is bipartite if and only if it comes from a bipartite graph an eulerian graph is one in which all vertices have even degree eulerian graphs may be disconnected for planar graphs the properties of being bipartite and eulerian are dual a planar graph is bipartite if and only if its dual graph is eulerian as welsh showed this duality extends to binary matroids a binary matroid is bipartite if and only if its dual matroid is an eulerian matroid a matroid that can be partitioned into disjoint circuits for matroids that are not binary the duality between eulerian and bipartite matroids may break down for instance the uniform matroid formula 4 is non bipartite but its dual formula 5 is eulerian as it can be partitioned into two 3 cycles the self dual uniform matroid formula 6 is bipartite but not eulerian it is possible to test in polynomial time whether a given binary matroid is bipartite however any algorithm that tests whether a given matroid is eulerian given access to the matroid via an independence oracle must perform an exponential number of oracle queries and therefore cannot take polynomial time

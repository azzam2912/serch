statistical decisions are required when all of the variables that must be considered are not incorporated into the model similar to the actuarial methods used by insurance companies to deal with large numbers of customers and huge numbers of variables likewise military planners rely on such calculations to determine the amount of weapons necessary to destroy an enemy force the probability of kill or p is usually based on a uniform random number generator this algorithm creates a number between 0 and 1 that is approximately uniformly distributed in that space if the p of a weapon target engagement is 30 or 0 30 then every random number generated that is less than 0 3 is considered a kill every number greater than 0 3 is considered a not kill when used many times in a simulation the average result will be that 30 of the weapon target engagements will be a kill and 70 will not be a kill this measure may also be used to express the accuracy of a weapon system for example if a weapon is expected to hit a target nine times out of ten with a representative set of ten engagements one could say

some designs have a ducted fan design in which the propeller is surrounded by a large ring shaped duct to reduce tip losses the powered rotors of a tiltrotor sometimes called proprotor are mounted on rotating shafts or nacelles at the end of a fixed wing and used for both lift and propulsion for vertical flight the rotors are angled to provide thrust upwards lifting the way a helicopter rotor does as the aircraft gains speed the rotors progressively rotate or tilt forward with the rotors eventually becoming perpendicular to the fuselage of the aircraft similar to a propeller in this mode the wing provides the lift and the rotor provides thrust the wing s greater efficiency helps the tiltrotor achieve higher speeds than helicopters the bell boeing v 22 osprey by bell helicopter and boeing is a twin engine tiltrotor design that has two turbine engines each driving three blade rotors the rotors function similar to a helicopter in vertical flight and similar to an airplane in forward flight it first flew on 19 march 1989 the agustawestland aw609 formerly bell agusta ba609 tiltrotor is civilian aircraft based on the v 22 osprey the aircraft can take off and

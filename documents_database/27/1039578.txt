these are called synaphin 1 and 2 in the presence of ca the transport vesicle protein synaptotagmin displaces complexin allowing the snare protein complex to bind the transport vesicle to the presynaptic membrane complexin acts as both an inhibitor and a facilitator of synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release in one conformation it clamps snarepin complexes preventing vesicle fusion while in a different conformation it releases the snarepins allowing synaptotagmin to trigger fusion whereas complexin is not necessary for synaptic vesicle exocytosis it does increase neurotransmitter release by 60 70 as demonstrated by complexin gene knockout in mice a number of human neurological diseases have been linked to a deficiency of complexin synaphin can promote exocytosis by promoting interaction between the complementary syntaxin and synaptobrevin transmembrane regions that reside in opposing membranes prior to fusion complexin is a small highly charged cytosolic protein that is hydrophilic rich in glutamic acid and lysine residues complexin s central region amino acids 48 70 binds to the snare core as an anti parallel helix which attaches complexin to the snare complex it interacts selectively with the ternary snare complex but not with monomeric snare proteins complexin binds to the groove between the synaptobrevin

it is also known as the bugis script as lontara documents written in this language are the most numerous it was largely replaced by the latin alphabet during the period of dutch colonization though it is still used today to a limited extent the term lontara is derived from the malay name for palmyra palm lontar whose leaves are traditionally used for manuscripts in buginese this script is called urupu sulapa eppa which means four cornered letters referencing the bugis makasar belief of the four elements that shaped the universe fire water air and earth lontara is a descendant of the kawi script used in maritime southeast asia around 800 ce it is unclear whether the script is a direct descendant from kawi or derived from one of kawi s other descendants one theory states that it is modelled after the rejang script perhaps due to their graphical similarities but this claim may be unfounded as some characters of the lontara are a late development the term lontara has also come to refer to literature regarding bugis history and genealogy including the sure galigo creation myth historically lontara was also used for a range of documents including contracts trade laws

the name of the facility is an acronym for isotope separator on line device created in 1964 the isolde facility started delivering radioactive ion beams to users in 1967 originally located at the synchrocyclotron accelerator cern s first ever particle accelerator the facility has been upgraded several times most notably in 1992 when the whole facility was moved to be connected to cern s protonsynchroton booster psb entering its 6th decade of existence isolde is currently the oldest facility still in operation at cern from the first pioneering isol beams to the latest technical advances allowing for the production of the most exotic species isolde benefits a wide range of physics communities with applications covering nuclear atomic molecular and solid state physics but also biophysics and astrophysics as well as high precision experiments looking for physics beyond the standard model the facility is operated by the isolde collaboration comprising cern and fifteen mostly european countries as of 2019 more than 800 experimentalists around the world including all continents are coming to isolde to perform typically 45 different experiments per year radioactive nuclei are produced at isolde by shooting a high energy 1 4gev beam of protons delivered by cern s

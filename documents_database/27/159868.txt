it is one of the most studied examples of dynamical systems that exhibit chaotic behavior the h non map takes a point x y in the plane and maps it to a new point the map depends on two parameters a and b which for the classical h non map have values of a 1 4 and b 0 3 for the classical values the h non map is chaotic for other values of a and b the map may be chaotic intermittent or converge to a periodic orbit an overview of the type of behavior of the map at different parameter values may be obtained from its orbit diagram the map was introduced by michel h non as a simplified model of the poincar section of the lorenz model for the classical map an initial point of the plane will either approach a set of points known as the h non strange attractor or diverge to infinity the h non attractor is a fractal smooth in one direction and a cantor set in another numerical estimates yield a correlation dimension of 1 25 0 02 and a hausdorff dimension of 1 261 0 003 for the attractor of the

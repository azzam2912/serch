dereverberation is a subtopic of acoustic digital signal processing and is most commonly applied to speech but also has relevance in some aspects of music processing dereverberation of audio speech or music is a corresponding function to blind deconvolution of images although the techniques used are usually very different reverberation itself is caused by sound reflections in a room or other enclosed space and is quantified by the room reverberation time and the direct to reverberant ratio the effect of dereverberation is to increase the direct to reverberant ratio so that the sound is perceived as closer and clearer a main application of dereverberation is in hands free phones and desktop conferencing terminals because in these cases the microphones are not close to the source of sound the talker s mouth but at arm s length or further distance as well as telecommunications dereverberation is importantly applied in automatic speech recognition because speech recognizers are usually error prone in reverberant scenarios dereverberation became established as a topic of scientific research in the years 2000 to 2005 although a few notable early articles exist the first scientific text book on the topic was published in 2010 a global scientific study sponsored

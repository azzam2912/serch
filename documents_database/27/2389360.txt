it has a robust body and has a shorter spine than first dorsal fin although it has a similar range and appearance to the southern chimaera the shortspine chimaera is darker in colour and smaller a maximum size of at least 95 cm total length including tail and 53 cm body length excluding tail in females has been reported the shortspine chimaera is a subtropical species inhabiting the upper to mid continental slope on the east coast of australia at depths of around 450 1 080 m although it most commonly lives in waters deeper than 1 025 m in particular the species is found near tuncurry new south wales sightings have been reported in other spots on the east coast from ulladulla to queensland but it is probable that these are actually a different species it is not targeted commercially and most fisheries trawl in waters shallower than where the species typically lives so no conservation actions are currently taking place for the species however it may be a bycatch for deepwater fisheries the exact population of the species is unknown and is listed as data deficient by the international union for conservation of nature

hainantoxins specifically inhibit tetrodotoxin sensitive voltage gated sodium channels thereby causing blockage of neuromuscular transmission and paralysis currently 13 different hainantoxins are known hntx i hntx xiii but only hntx i ii iii iv and v have been investigated in detail hntx i hntx iii hntx iv and hntx v are made by the chinese bird spider haplopelma hainanum ornithoctonus hainana selenocosmia hainana hainantoxins i iii iv and v show high homology including the presence of three disulfide bonds that form an inhibitor cysteine knot ick motif the main component of the venom of o hainana is hntx i it has 33 amino acid residues with a total molecular weight of 3605 3608 da hntx i contains a short triple stranded anti parallel beta sheet and four beta turns the amino acid residues his28 and asp26 are needed for the bioactivity of hntx i hntx ii has a molecular weight of 4253 da and contains 37 amino acid residues the complete amino acid sequence of hntx ii is nh2 lfecsv sceiek egnkd ckkkk ckggw kckfn mcvkv cooh the structure of hntx iii consists of 33 35 amino acid residues which form a beta sheet with connections between asp7 and cys9

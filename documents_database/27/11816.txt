it supplies heat to melt solder so that it can flow into the joint between two workpieces a soldering iron is composed of a heated metal tip and an insulated handle heating is often achieved electrically by passing an electric current supplied through an electrical cord or battery cables through a resistive heating element cordless irons can be heated by combustion of gas stored in a small tank often using a catalytic heater rather than a flame simple irons less commonly used today than in the past were simply a large copper bit on a handle heated in a flame soldering irons are most often used for installation repairs and limited production work in electronics assembly high volume production lines use other soldering methods large irons may be used for soldering joints in sheet metal objects less common uses include pyrography burning designs into wood and plastic welding for electrical and electronics work a low power iron a power rating between 15 and 35 watts is used higher ratings are available but do not run at higher temperature instead there is more heat available for making soldered connections to things with large thermal capacity for example a metal chassis some

it is often a part of a rotating wheel e g an eccentric wheel or shaft e g a cylinder with an irregular shape that strikes a lever at one or more points on its circular path the cam can be a simple tooth as is used to deliver pulses of power to a steam hammer for example or an eccentric disc or other shape that produces a smooth reciprocating back and forth motion in the follower which is a lever making contact with the cam the cam can be seen as a device that rotates from spherical to reciprocating or sometimes oscillating motion a common example is the camshaft of an automobile which takes the rotary motion of the engine and translates it into the reciprocating motion necessary to operate the intake and exhaust valves of the cylinders certain cams can be characterized by their displacement diagrams which reflect the changing position a roller follower a shaft with a rotating wheel at the end would make as the cam rotates about an axis these diagrams relate angular position usually in degrees to the radial displacement experienced at that position displacement diagrams are traditionally presented as graphs with non negative

the fossils are arranged by approximate age as determined by radiometric dating and or incremental dating and the species name represents current consensus if there is no clear scientific consensus the other possible classifications are indicated most of the early fossils shown are not considered direct ancestors to homo sapiens but are closely related to direct ancestors and are therefore important to the study of the lineage after 1 5 million years ago extinction of paranthropus all fossils shown are human genus homo after 11 500 years ago 11 5 ka beginning of the holocene all fossils shown are homo sapiens anatomically modern humans illustrating recent divergence in the formation of modern human sub populations the chimpanzee human divergence likely took place during about 10 to 7 million years ago the list of fossils begins with graecopithecus dated some 7 2 million years ago which may or may not still be ancestral to both the human and the chimpanzee lineage for the earlier history of the human lineage see timeline of human evolution hominidae hominidae phylogeny

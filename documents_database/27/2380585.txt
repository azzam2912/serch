it is caused by a combination of sweat gland secretions and normal skin microflora in addition androstane steroids and the abcc11 transporter are essential for most axillary odor body odor is a complex phenomenon with numerous compounds and catalysts involved in its genesis secretions from sweat glands are initially odorless but preodoriferous compounds or malodor precursors in the secretions are transformed by skin surface bacteria into volatile odorous compounds that are responsible for body malodor water and nutrients secreted by sweat glands also contribute to body odor by creating an ideal environment for supporting the growth of skin surface bacteria there are three types of sweat glands eccrine apocrine and apoeccrine apocrine glands are primarily responsible for body malodor and along with apoeccrine glands are mostly expressed in the axillary underarm regions whereas eccrine glands are distributed throughout virtually all of the rest of the skin in the body although they are also particularly expressed in the axillary regions and contribute to malodor to a relatively minor extent sebaceous glands another type of secretory gland are not sweat glands but instead secrete sebum an oily substance and may also contribute to body odor to some degree the main odorous compounds

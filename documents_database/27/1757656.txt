while most systems of the body show some degree of autoregulation the brain is very sensitive to over and underperfusion cerebral autoregulation plays an important role in maintaining an appropriate blood flow to that region brain perfusion is essential for life since the brain has a high metabolic demand by means of cerebral autoregulation the body is able to deliver sufficient blood containing oxygen and nutrients to the brain tissue for this metabolic need and remove co and other waste products cerebral autoregulation refers to the physiological mechanisms that maintain blood flow at an appropriate level during changes in blood pressure however due to the important influences of arterial carbon dioxide levels cerebral metabolic rate neural activation activity of the sympathetic nervous system posture as well as other physiological variables cerebral autoregulation is often interpreted as encompassing the wider field of cerebral blood flow regulation this field includes areas such as co reactivity neurovascular coupling and other aspects of cerebral haemodynamics this regulation of cerebral blood flow is achieved primarily by small arteries arterioles which either dilate or contract under the influence of multiple complex physiological control systems impairment of these systems may occur e g following stroke trauma or

in the absence of publication bias it assumes that studies with high precision will be plotted near the average and studies with low precision will be spread evenly on both sides of the average creating a roughly funnel shaped distribution deviation from this shape can indicate publication bias funnel plots introduced by light and pillemer in 1984 and discussed in detail by matthias egger and colleagues are useful adjuncts to meta analyses a funnel plot is a scatterplot of treatment effect against a measure of study precision it is used primarily as a visual aid for detecting bias or systematic heterogeneity a symmetric inverted funnel shape arises from a well behaved data set in which publication bias is unlikely an asymmetric funnel indicates a relationship between treatment effect estimate and study precision this suggests the possibility of either publication bias or a systematic difference between studies of higher and lower precision typically small study effects asymmetry can also arise from use of an inappropriate effect measure whatever the cause an asymmetric funnel plot leads to doubts over the appropriateness of a simple meta analysis and suggests that there needs to be investigation of possible causes a variety of choices of

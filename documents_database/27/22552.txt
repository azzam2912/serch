a language that developed from a pidgin the vast differences between old and middle english have led some historical linguists to claim that the language underwent creolisation at around the time of the norman conquest the theory was first proposed in 1977 by c bailey and k maroldt and has since found both supporters and detractors in the academic world different versions of the hypothesis refer to creolisation through contact between old english and norman french between old english and old norse or caused by large numbers of people switching from speaking british celtic languages to speaking english some versions of the hypothesis propose multiple creolization events with later ones reinforcing and broadening simplifications introduced by earlier ones the argument in favour of calling middle english a creole comes from the extreme reduction in inflected forms from old english to middle english the system of declension of nouns was radically simplified and analogized the verb system also lost many old patterns of conjugation many strong verbs were reanalysed as weak verbs the subjunctive mood became much less distinct syntax was also simplified somewhat with word order patterns becoming more rigid these grammatical simplifications resemble those observed in pidgins creoles and

it is also referred to as a maximally flat magnitude filter it was first described in 1930 by the british engineer and physicist stephen butterworth in his paper entitled on the theory of filter amplifiers butterworth had a reputation for solving impossible mathematical problems at the time filter design required a considerable amount of designer experience due to limitations of the theory then in use the filter was not in common use for over 30 years after its publication butterworth stated that such an ideal filter cannot be achieved but butterworth showed that successively closer approximations were obtained with increasing numbers of filter elements of the right values at the time filters generated substantial ripple in the passband and the choice of component values was highly interactive butterworth showed that a low pass filter could be designed whose cutoff frequency was normalized to 1 radian per second and whose frequency response gain was where is the angular frequency in radians per second and n is the number of poles in the filter equal to the number of reactive elements in a passive filter if 1 the amplitude response of this type of filter in the passband is 1 0 707

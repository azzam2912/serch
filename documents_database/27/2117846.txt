boiling point vapor pressure rather than a specific chemical composition often obfuscating distinction within the long list of petroleum distillate solvent mixtures mineral spirits naphtha white spirits petroleum spirits turps substitute mineral turpentine petroleum benzine petroleum ether ligroin and stoddard solvent the chemical composition of a petroleum distillate can also be modified to afford a solvent with reduced concentration of unsaturated hydrocarbons i e alkenes by hydrotreating and or reduced aromatics e g benzene toluene xylene by several dearomatization methods in a document that attempts to draw more concise distinctions between hydrocarbon solvents conservator alan phenix explains that the most important distinction amongst the various hydrocarbon solvents are their boiling distillation ranges and by association volatility flash point etc and aromatic content given the toxicity carcinogenicity of some aromatic hydrocarbons most notably benzene the aromatic content of petroleum distillate solvents which would normally be in the 10 25 w w range for most petroleum fractions can be advantageously reduced when their special solvation properties are not required and a less odorous lower toxicity solvent is desired especially when present in consumer products phenix further points out that to all intents and purposes petroleum benzine appears synonymous with petroleum spirit petroleum

examples include the tersoff potential the edip potential the brenner potential the finnis sinclair potentials and the second moment tight binding potentials they have the advantage over conventional molecular mechanics force fields in that they can with the same parameters describe several different bonding states of an atom and thus to some extent may be able to describe chemical reactions correctly the potentials were developed partly independently of each other but share the common idea that the strength of a chemical bond depends on the bonding environment including the number of bonds and possibly also angles and bond length it is based on the linus pauling bond order concept and can be written in the form formula 1 this means that the potential is written as a simple pair potential depending on the distance between two atoms formula 2 but the strength of this bond is modified by the environment of the atom formula 3 via the formula 4term alternatively the energy can be written in the form formula 5 where formula 6 is the electron density at the location of atom formula 3 these two forms for the energy can be shown to be equivalent a more detailed summary

the technology and practice within research has found 3d body scanning measurement extraction methodologies to be comparable to traditional anthropometric measurement techniques while the technology is still developing in its application the technology has regularly been applied in the areas of however despite the potential for the technology to have an impact in made to measure and mass customisation of items with ergonomic properties 3d body scanning has yet to reach an early adopter or early majority stage of innovation diffusion this in part due to the lack of ergonomic theory relating to how to identify key landmarks on the body morphology the suitability of 3d body scanning is also context dependent as the measurements taken and the precision of the machine are highly relative to the task in hand rather than being an absolute additionally a key limitation of 3d body scanning has been the upfront cost of the equipment and the required skills by which to collect data and apply it to scientific and technical fields although the process has been established for a considerable amount of time with international conferences held annually for industry and academics e g the international conference and exhibition on 3d body scanning

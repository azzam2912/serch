the runway bus is a 64 bit wide split transaction time multiplexed address and data bus running at 120 mhz this scheme was chosen by hp as they determined that a bus using separate address and data wires would have only delivered 20 more bandwidth for a 50 increase in pin count which would have made microprocessors using the bus more expensive the runway bus was introduced with the release of the pa 7200 and was subsequently used by the pa 8000 pa 8200 pa 8500 pa 8600 and pa 8700 microprocessors early implementations of the bus used in the pa 7200 pa 8000 and pa 8200 had a theoretical bandwidth of 960 mb s beginning with the pa 8500 the runway bus was revised to transmit on both rising and falling edges of a 125 mhz clock signal which increased its theoretical bandwidth to 2 gb s the runway bus was succeeded with the introduction of the pa 8800 which used the itanium 2 bus bus features most machines use the runway bus to connect the cpus directly to the iommu astro u2 uturn or java and memory however the n class and l3000 servers use an interface chip

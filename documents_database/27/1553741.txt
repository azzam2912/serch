frege systems more often known as hilbert systems in general proof theory are named after gottlob frege let k be a finite functionally complete set of boolean connectives and consider propositional formulas built from variables p p p using k connectives a frege rule is an inference rule of the form where b b b are formulas if r is a finite set of frege rules then f k r defines a derivation system in the following way if x is a set of formulas and a is a formula then an f derivation of a from axioms x is a sequence of formulas a a such that a a and every a is a member of x or it is derived from some of the formulas a i k by a substitution instance of a rule from r an f proof of a formula a is an f derivation of a from the empty set of axioms x f is called a frege system if the length number of lines in a proof a a is m the size of the proof is the total number of symbols a derivation system f as above is refutationally complete if for

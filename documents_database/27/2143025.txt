brop attacks shown by bittau et al have defeated address space layout randomization aslr and stack canaries on 64 bit systems with the current improvements in os security and hardware security features like the linux pax project code injection is now impossible security researchers then conceived a new attack which they named as return oriented programming to defeat nx non executable memory this attack relies on affecting program flow by controlling the stack especially return addresses gadgets are the fundamental units of this attack gadgets are a group of instruction sequences ending in return along with a certain state of the stack a gadget can perform an operation like loading a word from memory into a register or performing a more complex operation like a conditional jump with a large enough target binary a turing complete collection of gadgets can be constructed which is more than enough to get a shellcode executed one assumption which rop makes is that the attacker possesses the target binaries and hence knows the addresses of the gadgets beforehand there are three new scenarios which brop can be relevant for they are i in case of closed binary services to discover vulnerabilities where techniques like

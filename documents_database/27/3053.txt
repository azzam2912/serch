centrioles are found in most eukaryotic cells a bound pair of centrioles surrounded by a shapeless mass of dense material called the pericentriolar material pcm makes up a structure called a centrosome centrioles are not present in all eukaryotes for example they are absent from conifers pinophyta flowering plants angiosperms and most fungi and are only present in the male gametes of charophytes bryophytes seedless vascular plants cycads and ginkgo centrioles are typically made up of nine sets of short microtubule triplets arranged in a cylinder deviations from this structure include crabs and drosophila melanogaster embryos with nine doublets and caenorhabditis elegans sperm cells and early embryos with nine singlets the main function of centrioles is to produce cilia during interphase and the aster and the spindle during cell division edouard van beneden made the first observation of centrosomes in 1883 in 1895 theodor boveri named the organelle a centrosome the pattern of centriole duplication was first worked out independently by etienne de harven and joseph g gall c 1950 centrioles are involved in the organization of the mitotic spindle and in the completion of cytokinesis centrioles were previously thought to be required for the formation of a mitotic spindle

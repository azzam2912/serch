thus there are three kinds of bidirected edges those where the arrows point outward towards the vertices at both ends those where both arrows point inward away from the vertices and those in which one arrow points away from its vertex and towards the opposite end while the other arrow points in the same direction as the first away from the opposite end and towards its own vertex edges of these three types may be called respectively extraverted introverted and directed the directed edges are the same as ordinary directed edges in a directed graph thus a directed graph is a special kind of bidirected graph it is sometimes desirable to have also edges with only one end half edges these get only one arrow an edge with no ends a loose edge has no arrows the edges that are neither half nor loose edges may be called ordinary edges a skew symmetric graph is the double covering graph of a bidirected graph a symmetric directed graph that is a directed graph in which the reverse of every edge is also an edge is sometimes also called a bidirected graph

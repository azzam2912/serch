on 17 june 2005 the cartercopter became the first rotorcraft to achieve mu 1 1 an equal ratio of airspeed to rotor tip speed but crashed on the next flight and has been inoperable since it is being replaced by the carter personal air vehicle the cartercopter is a pusher configuration autogyro with wings and a twin boom tail intended as a prototype and a technology demonstrator the rotor is a two bladed design weighted with depleted uranium at each tip and it is mounted on a tilting mast allowing the wing to stay at optimum wing efficiency at all speeds it is an all composite design with a hull pressurized up to 0 69 bar the tricycle undercarriage is retractable and has a large travel to allow for landing at up to 20 ft sec without bounce the aircraft had been modified and rebuilt after an accident a gear up landing in 2003 nasa had funded 1 million of the development using three research grants and the aircraft managed to accomplish at least one of nasa s five goals the cartercopter concept is a gyrocopter with an unusually stiff relatively heavy rotor supplemented with conventional wings at low speed

it shared many of the features of the n95 quad band gsm 3g wifi bluetooth released around the same time but thinner lighter and without the gps it was followed fairly quickly by the e66 which was very similar but gained an fm radio a newer release of s60 a2dp bluetooth gps and 3 2 mpixel camera operation times vary depending on the network and usage many users have experienced problems with the sim connecting to the network after using the phone for some time most of them had to bring the phone to the nokia center to get their phone repaired or replaced the cause seems to be a design problem in the sim container on the chassis of the phone the sim container is mainly built of a thin metal foil which in time tends to bend thus disconnecting the sim from the mobile phone s sim contacts the problem can apparently be solved just by putting a bit of paper between the metal foil and the sim enabling it to make contact there s also difficulties in making connection to wlan networks which use eap peap and mschapv2 protocols if you update the phone s firmware this

the exoplanet was found using a decade s worth of radial velocity data using the european southern observatory s harps spectrograph high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher at the la silla observatory in chile ross 128 b is the nearest exoplanet around a quiet red dwarf and is considered one of the best candidates for habitability the planet is only 35 more massive than earth receives only 38 more sunlight and is expected to be a temperature suitable for liquid water to exist on the surface if it has an atmosphere the planet does not transit its host star which will make atmospheric characterization very difficult until larger telescopes like the european extremely large telescope and the james webb space telescope come online due to it being discovered by the radial velocity method the only known physical parameter for ross 128 b is its minimum possible mass the planet is at least or 1 35 times the mass of earth about kg this is slightly more massive than the similar and nearby proxima centauri b with a minimum mass of the low mass of ross 128 b implies that it is most likely a rocky earth sized planet with a

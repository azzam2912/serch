it is used for logic programming and for the formalization of programming language theory at its simplest a twelf program called a signature is a collection of declarations of type families and constants that inhabit those type families for example the following is the standard definition of the natural numbers with codice 1 standing for zero and codice 2 the successor operator here codice 3 is a type and codice 1 and codice 2 are constant terms as a dependently typed system types can be indexed by terms which allows the definition of more interesting type families relations here is a definition of addition the type family codice 6 is read as a relation between three natural numbers codice 7 codice 8 and codice 9 such that m n p we then give the constants that define the relation codice 10 indicates that any natural number codice 7 plus zero is still codice 7 the quantifier codice 13 can be read as for all codice 7 of type codice 3 the constant codice 16 defines the case for when the second argument is the successor of some other number codice 8 see pattern matching the result is the successor of

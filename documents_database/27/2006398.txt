the illusion is perceived only by some listeners but not by others reflecting individual variation in hearing abilities it has been estimated that among young adults 24 are susceptible to illusory discontinuity the most susceptible listeners describe their sensations in terms of the sound actually containing a physical gap the illusory discontinuity is strongest when the interrupting sound is short 50ms longer sounds elicit weaker illusory discontinuity this effect may be related to better auditory segregation illusory discontinuity is antagonistic with illusory continuity of tones auditory filling in while illusory continuity restores perceptual continuity of obscured sounds illusory discontinuity disrupts the perception even if the sound is indeed continuous listeners strongly susceptible to illusory discontinuity do not perceive illusory auditory continuity the illusion is likely to be a novel form of informational masking broadly defined as a degradation of auditory detection or discrimination of a signal embedded in a context of other similar sounds illusory discontinuity cannot be explained by simultaneous masking because it appears even if the noise is as far as one octave away it has been suggested that illusory discontinuity is related to inability to segregate the ongoing sound from the interrupting noise although more research is

coli is an enzyme that catalyzes the second step of menaquinone vitamin k2 biosynthesis the two substrates of this enzyme are 2 oxoglutarate and isochorismate the products of this enzyme are 5 enolpyruvoyl 6 hydroxy 2 succinyl cyclohex 3 ene 1 carboxylate and co it belongs to the transferase family this enzyme belongs to a family of enzymes that transfer aldehyde or ketonic groups to be specific this enzyme belongs to the transketolase and transaldolase families common names for the enzyme are in the biosynthesis of vitamin k sephchc is involved in the second step of the pathway the type of reaction is decarboxylating and to have maximum activity this enzymes uses the cofactor mg2 a magnesium ion in previous years it was thought that this reaction led to shchc the product menh after further research we now know that this reaction is a new step in the pathway the actual product of this enzyme can lose a pyruvate spontaneously the structures reveal a stable dimer of dimers association in agreement with gel filtration and analytical studies confirm the classification of mend in the pyruvate oxidase family the active site is highly basic with a hydrophobic patch these features match

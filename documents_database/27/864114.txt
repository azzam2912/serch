it is a seven transmembrane retinylidene protein from microbial rhodopsin family it is similar in tertiary structure but not primary sequence structure to vertebrate rhodopsins the pigments that sense light in the retina halorhodopsin also shares sequence similarity to channelrhodopsin another light driven ion channel halorhodopsin contains the essential light isomerizable vitamin a derivative all trans retinal due to the intense attention on solving the structure and function of this molecule halorhodopsin is one of the few membrane proteins whose crystal structure is known halorhodopsin uses the energy of green yellow light to move chloride ions into the cell overcoming the membrane potential beside chlorides it transports other halides and nitrates into the cell potassium chloride uptake by cells helps to maintain osmotic balance during cell growth by performing the same task light driven anion pumps can considerably reduce the use of metabolic energy halorhodopsin has been the subject of much study and its structure is accurately known its properties are similar to those of bacteriorhodopsin and these two light driven ion pumps transport cations and anions in opposite directions halorhodopsin isoforms can be found in multiple species of halobacteria including halobacterium salinarum and natronobacterium pharaonis much ongoing research is

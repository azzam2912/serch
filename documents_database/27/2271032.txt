like many of rancid s albums trouble maker was produced by epitaph founder and bad religion guitarist brett gurewitz and marks the band s first album since their 1993 self titled debut to feature the original rancid logo on the cover the band recorded the album between december 2015 and january 2017 at big bad sound sunset sound and red star trouble maker received mixed reviews upon its release allmusic writer tim sendra rated the album two and a half stars out of five and called it exactly what a rancid fan would expect a rancid album to sound like which is both a blessing and a curse he continued the former because if classic rancid is what you need to fulfill your punk rock longings as always they deliver the requisite gutter chants spiky attitude and spit covered microphones the latter because at this point the rancid sound can t help but feel a little too safe and sanitized especially given the sparkling production brett gurewitz gives to the album it may be a little late in the game to expect the band to do anything but give the fans exactly what they want or what the band thinks

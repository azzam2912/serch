this maxwell wagner sillars polarization or often just maxwell wagner polarization occurs either at inner dielectric boundary layers on a mesoscopic scale or at the external electrode sample interface on a macroscopic scale in both cases this leads to a separation of charges such as through a depletion layer the charges are often separated over a considerable distance relative to the atomic and molecular sizes and the contribution to dielectric loss can therefore be orders of magnitude larger than the dielectric response due to molecular fluctuations maxwell wagner polarization processes should be taken into account during the investigation of inhomogeneous materials like suspensions or colloids biological materials phase separated polymers blends and crystalline or liquid crystalline polymers the simplest model for describing an inhomogenous structure is a double layer arrangement where each layer is characterized by its permittivity formula 1 and its conductivity formula 2 the relaxation time for such an arrangement is given by formula 3 importantly since the materials conductivities are in general frequency dependent this shows that the double layer composite generally has a frequency dependent relaxation time even if the individual layers are characterized by frequency independent permittivities a more sophisticated model for treating interfacial polarization

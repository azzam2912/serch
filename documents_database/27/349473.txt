power steering can also be engineered to provide some artificial feedback of forces acting on the steered wheels hydraulic power steering systems for cars augment steering effort via an actuator a hydraulic cylinder that is part of a servo system these systems have a direct mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the linkage that steers the wheels this means that power steering system failure to augment effort still permits the vehicle to be steered using manual effort alone electric power steering systems use electric motors to provide the assistance instead of hydraulic systems as with hydraulic types power to the actuator motor in this case is controlled by the rest of the power steering system other power steering systems such as those in the largest off road construction vehicles have no direct mechanical connection to the steering linkage they require electrical power systems of this kind with no mechanical connection are sometimes called drive by wire or steer by wire by analogy with aviation s fly by wire in this context wire refers to electrical cables that carry power and data not thin wire rope mechanical control cables some construction vehicles have a two part frame with a rugged

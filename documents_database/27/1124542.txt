there are three main classes of imidazoline receptor i is involved in inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system to lower blood pressure i has as yet uncertain functions but is implicated in several psychiatric conditions and i regulates insulin secretion as of 2017 there are three known subtypes of imidazoline receptors i i and i the i receptor appears to be a g protein coupled receptor that is localized on the plasma membrane it may be coupled to pla2 signalling and thus prostaglandin synthesis in addition activation inhibits the sodium hydrogen antiporter and enzymes of catecholamine synthesis are induced suggesting that the i receptor may belong to the neurocytokine receptor family since its signaling pathways are similar to those of interleukins it is found in the neurons of the reticular formation the dorsomedial medulla oblongata adrenal medulla renal epithelium pancreatic islets platelets and the prostate they are notably not expressed in the cerebral cortex or locus coeruleus animal research suggests that much of the antihypertensive action of imidazoline drugs such as clonidine is mediated by the i receptor in addition i receptor activation is used in ophthalmology to reduce intraocular pressure other putative functions include promoting na excretion and promoting

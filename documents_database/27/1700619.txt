at staverton airport gloucestershire uk this engine had its origins at the bsa umberslade hall research unit in birmingham david garside a bsa engineer designed an air cooled twin rotor motorcycle engine that was based on the fichtel sachs motor later used in the hercules motorcycle wankel engines run very hot so garside gave this air cooled motor interior cooling air that was drawn first through the rotors and into a large plenum before entering the combustion chambers via the carburetors only 100 air cooled norton classics were produced the later norton commander had liquid cooling but with the same air cooling of the rotors as the classic these norton engines had a total loss oiling system just like an oil injected two stroke engine very closely based on the norton engine the midwest engine nevertheless took things a stage further the lubrication system became a semi total loss system whereby silkolene 2 stroke oil was directly injected into the inlet tracts and onto the main roller bearings but the oil that fed the bearings became an oil mist within the rotor cooling air and around 30 of the oil was recovered and returned to the remote oil tank unlike

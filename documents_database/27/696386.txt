the program has its origins in british colonial era in post colonial era the secular government of india expanded the program in 1959 with the hajj act the subsidy initially applied to indian muslim pilgrims traveling for religious reasons to saudi arabia syria iraq iran and jordan by road and by sea expanded haj subsidy started in 1954 as an idea initiated by the then government with flights between mumbai and jeddah additional flight legs were added over the years and since 1984 all hajj traffic has been shared by air india and saudia the national carriers of india and saudi arabia the monopoly of these airlines had proven the most contentious point of the subsidy with some muslims objecting to it by claiming falsely that the real beneficiary is air india as the subsidy is actually a discount on an overpriced air fare in the past the haj board used to call for a bid to fly these muslims to mecca and for past many years it is saudia saudi arabian government owned airline which came as the lowest bidder there were also requests by muslims to withdraw subsidy including some muslim parliament members as it is against islam

the pathway produces two five carbon building blocks called isopentenyl pyrophosphate ipp and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate dmapp which are used to make isoprenoids a diverse class of over 30 000 biomolecules such as cholesterol vitamin k coenzyme q10 and all steroid hormones the mevalonate pathway begins with acetyl coa and ends with the production of ipp and dmapp it is best known as the target of statins a class of cholesterol lowering drugs statins inhibit hmg coa reductase within the mevalonate pathway the mevalonate pathway of eukaryotes archaea and eubacteria all begin the same way the sole carbon feed stock of the pathway is acetyl coa the first step condenses two acetyl coa molecules to yield acetoacetyl coa this is followed by a second condensation to form hmg coa 3 hydroxy 3 methyl glutaryl coa reduction of hmg coa yields r mevalonate these first 3 enzymatic steps are called the upper mevalonate pathway the lower mevalonate pathway which converts r mevalonate into ipp and dmapp has 3 variants in eukaryotes mevalonate is phosphorylated twice in the 5 oh position then decarboxylated to yield ipp in some archaea such as haloferax volcanii mevalonate is phosphorylated once in the 5 oh position decarboxylated

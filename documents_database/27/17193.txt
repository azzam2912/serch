packets are made of a header and a payload data in the header are used by networking hardware to direct the packet to its destination where the payload is extracted and used by application software packet switching is the primary basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide in the early 1960s american computer scientist paul baran developed the concept distributed adaptive message block switching with the goal to provide a fault tolerant efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the rand corporation funded by the us department of defense this concept contrasted with and contradicted then established principles of pre allocation of network bandwidth largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the bell system the new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of british computer scientist donald davies at the national physical laboratory united kingdom in 1965 davies is credited with coining the modern term packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in the decade following including the incorporation of the concept in the early arpanet in the united states a simple definition of packet switching is packet switching allows delivery of variable bit rate data

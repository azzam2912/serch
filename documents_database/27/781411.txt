causal models can improve study designs by providing clear rules for deciding which independent variables need to be included controlled for they can allow some questions to be answered from existing observational data without the need for an interventional study such as a randomized controlled trial some interventional studies are inappropriate for ethical or practical reasons meaning that without a causal model some hypotheses cannot be tested causal models can help with the question of external validity whether results from one study apply to unstudied populations causal models can allow data from multiple studies to be merged in certain circumstances to answer questions that cannot be answered by any individual data set causal models are falsifiable in that if they do not match data they must be rejected as invalid causal models have found applications in signal processing epidemiology and machine learning pearl defines a causal model as an ordered triple formula 1 where u is a set of exogenous variables whose values are determined by factors outside the model v is a set of endogenous variables whose values are determined by factors within the model and e is a set of structural equations that express the value of each

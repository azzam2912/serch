such circuits can be used to implement related functions such as squares apply same signal to both inputs and square roots an electronic analog multiplier can be called by several names depending on the function it is used to serve see analog multiplier applications if one input of an analog multiplier is held at a steady state voltage a signal at the second input will be scaled in proportion to the level on the fixed input in this case the analog multiplier may be considered to be a voltage controlled amplifier obvious applications would be for electronic volume control and automatic gain control agc although analog multipliers are often used for such applications voltage controlled amplifiers are not necessarily true analog multipliers for example an integrated circuit designed to be used as a volume control may have a signal input designed for 1 vp p and a control input designed for 0 5 v dc that is the two inputs are not symmetrical and the control input will have a limited bandwidth by contrast in what is generally considered to be a true analog multiplier the two signal inputs have identical characteristics applications specific to a true analog multiplier are

historically ray tracing had been reserved to non real time applications with video games having to rely on rasterization for their rendering rtx facilitates a new development in computer graphics of generating interactive images that react to lighting shadows reflections rtx runs on nvidia volta and turing based gpus specifically utilizing the tensor cores and new rt cores on turing on the architectures for ray tracing acceleration in march 2019 nvidia announced that selected gtx 10 series pascal and gtx 16 series turing cards would receive support for subsets of rtx technology in upcoming drivers although functions and performance will be affected by their lack of dedicated hardware cores for ray tracing nvidia worked with microsoft to integrate rtx support with microsoft s directx raytracing api dxr rtx is currently available through nvidia optix and for directx for the turing architecture it is also available for vulkan in addition to ray tracing rtx includes artificial intelligence integration common asset formats rasterization cuda support and simulation apis the components of rtx are in computer graphics ray tracing generates an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual

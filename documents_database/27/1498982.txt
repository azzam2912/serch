it can be applied when there are no replicated values in the data set a situation in which it is impossible to directly estimate a fully general non additive regression structure and still have information left to estimate the error variance the test statistic proposed by tukey has one degree of freedom under the null hypothesis hence this is often called tukey s one degree of freedom test the most common setting for tukey s test of additivity is a two way factorial analysis of variance anova with one observation per cell the response variable y is observed in a table of cells with the rows indexed by i 1 m and the columns indexed by j 1 n the rows and columns typically correspond to various types and levels of treatment that are applied in combination the additive model states that the expected response can be expressed ey where the and are unknown constant values the unknown model parameters are usually estimated as where y is the mean of the i row of the data table y is the mean of the j column of the data table and y is the overall mean of the data table the

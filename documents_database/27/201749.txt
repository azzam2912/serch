the sas is not inflated like a conventional spacesuit it uses mechanical pressure rather than air pressure to compress the human body in low pressure environments development was begun by nasa and the air force in the late 1950s and then again in the late 1960s but neither design was used research is under way at the massachusetts institute of technology mit on a bio suit system which is based on the original sas concept the human body can briefly survive exposure to the hard vacuum of space unprotected despite contrary depictions in some popular science fiction human skin does not need to be protected from vacuum and is gas tight by itself human flesh expands to about twice its size in such conditions giving the visual effect of a body builder rather than an overfilled balloon this can be counteracted through mechanical counter pressure from a suitably designed garment consciousness is retained for up to 15 seconds as the effects of oxygen starvation set in counteracting this requires a helmet to contain breathing gases and protect the ears and eyes these effects have been confirmed through various accidents in very high altitude conditions outer space and training vacuum chambers

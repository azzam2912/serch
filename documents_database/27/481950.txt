algorithm x is a recursive nondeterministic depth first backtracking algorithm that finds all solutions to the exact cover problem some of the better known exact cover problems include tiling the n queens problem and sudoku the name dancing links stems from the way the algorithm works as iterations of the algorithm cause the links to dance with partner links so as to resemble an exquisitely choreographed dance knuth credits hiroshi hitotsumatsu and k hei noshita with having invented the idea in 1979 but it is his paper which has popularized it as the remainder of this article discusses the details of an implementation technique for algorithm x the reader is strongly encouraged to read the algorithm x article first the idea of dlx is based on the observation that in a circular doubly linked list of nodes will remove node x from the list while will restore x s position in the list assuming that x right and x left have been left unmodified this works regardless of the number of elements in the list even if that number is 1 knuth observed that a naive implementation of his algorithm x would spend an inordinate amount of time searching for

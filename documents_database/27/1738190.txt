increasingly larger and more complex designs are being simulated using the fem or bem however some problems of fem and bem engineering analysis are still on the cutting edge the first problem is a reliability of engineering analysis that strongly depends upon the quality of initial data generated at the pre processing stage it is known that automatic element mesh generation techniques at this stage have become commonly used tools for the analysis of complex real world models with fem and bem increasing in popularity comes the incentive to improve automatic meshing algorithms however all of these algorithms can create distorted and even unusable grid elements several techniques exist which can take an existing mesh and improve its quality for instance smoothing also referred to as mesh refinement is one such method which repositions nodal locations so as to minimize element distortion the stretched grid method sgm allows the obtaining of pseudo regular meshes very easily and quickly in a one step solution see let one assume that there is an arbitrary triangle grid embedded into plane polygonal single coherent contour and produced by an automeshing procedure see fig 1 it may be assumed further that the grid considered as

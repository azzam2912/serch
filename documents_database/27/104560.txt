it is implemented as a heap similar to a binary heap but using a special tree structure that is different from the complete binary trees used by binary heaps binomial heaps were invented in 1978 by jean vuillemin a binomial heap is implemented as a set of binomial trees compare with a binary heap which has a shape of a single binary tree which are defined recursively as follows a binomial tree of order formula 1 has formula 5 nodes and height formula 1 the name comes from the shape a binomial tree of order formula 1 has formula 8 nodes at depth formula 9 a binomial coefficient because of its structure a binomial tree of order formula 1 can be constructed from two trees of order formula 2 by attaching one of them as the leftmost child of the root of the other tree this feature is central to the merge operation of a binomial heap which is its major advantage over other conventional heaps a binomial heap is implemented as a set of binomial trees that satisfy the binomial heap properties the first property ensures that the root of each binomial tree contains the smallest key in the

rollovers have a higher fatality rate than other types of vehicle collisions vehicle rollovers are divided into two categories tripped and untripped tripped rollovers are caused by forces from an external object such as a curb or a collision with another vehicle untripped crashes are the result of steering input speed and friction with the ground untripped rollovers occur when cornering forces destabilize the vehicle as a vehicle rounds a corner three forces act on it tire forces the centripetal force inertial effects the centrifugal force and gravity the cornering forces from the tire push the vehicle towards the center of the curve this force acts at ground level below the center of mass the force of inertia acts horizontally through the vehicle s center of mass away from the center of the turn these two forces make the vehicle roll towards the outside of the curve the force of the vehicle s weight acts downward through the center of mass in the opposite direction when the tire and inertial forces are enough to overcome the force of gravity the vehicle starts to turn over the most common type of tripped rollover occurs when a vehicle is sliding sideways and

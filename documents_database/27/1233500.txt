the algorithm defines dissimilar based on the maximum distance between the original curve and the simplified curve i e the hausdorff distance between the curves the simplified curve consists of a subset of the points that defined the original curve the starting curve is an ordered set of points or lines and the distance dimension 0 the algorithm recursively divides the line initially it is given all the points between the first and last point it automatically marks the first and last point to be kept it then finds the point that is farthest from the line segment with the first and last points as end points this point is obviously farthest on the curve from the approximating line segment between the end points if the point is closer than to the line segment then any points not currently marked to be kept can be discarded without the simplified curve being worse than if the point farthest from the line segment is greater than from the approximation then that point must be kept the algorithm recursively calls itself with the first point and the farthest point and then with the farthest point and the last point which includes the farthest

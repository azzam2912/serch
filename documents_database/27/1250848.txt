the ligase chain reaction lcr is an amplification process that differs from pcr in that it involves a thermostable ligase to join two probes or other molecules together which can then be amplified by standard pcr cycling barany 1991 each cycle results in a doubling of the target nucleic acid molecule a key advantage of lcr is greater specificity as compared to pcr thus lcr requires two completely different enzymes to operate properly ligase to join probe molecules together and a thermostable polymerase e g taq polymerase to amplify those molecules involved in successful ligation the probes involved in the ligation are designed such that the 5 end of one probe is directly adjacent to the 3 end of the other probe thereby providing the requisite 3 oh and 5 po4 group substrates for the ligase lcr was originally developed to detect point mutations a single base mismatch at the junction of the two probe molecules is all that is need to prevent ligation by performing the ligation right at the tm of the oligonucleotide probe only perfectly matched primer template duplexes will be tolerated lcr can also be used to amplify template molecules that have been successfully ligated for

inflammation of the optic nerve head is called papillitis or intraocular optic neuritis inflammation of the orbital portion of the nerve is called retrobulbar optic neuritis or orbital optic neuritis it is often associated with substantial losses in visual fields pain on moving the globe and sensitivity to light pressure on the globe it is often an early sign of multiple sclerosis papillitis may have the same appearance as papilledema however papillitis may be unilateral whereas papilledema is almost always bilateral papillitis can be differentiated from papilledema by an afferent pupillary defect marcus gunn pupil by its greater effect in decreasing visual acuity and color vision and by the presence of a central scotoma papilledema that is not yet chronic will not have as dramatic an effect on vision because increased intracranial pressure can cause both papilledema and a sixth abducens nerve palsy papilledema can be differentiated from papillitis if esotropia and loss of abduction are also present however esotropia may also develop secondarily in an eye that has lost vision from papillitis retrobulbar neuritis an inflamed optic nerve but with a normal appearing nerve head is associated with pain and the other findings of papillitis pseudopapilledema is a normal

it is notable for its bioluminescent properties it is found in woodland areas in europe where it grows on decaying stumps on buried roots or at the base of hardwood trees it has also been reported from the western cape province south africa a similar but phylogenetically distinct species found in eastern north america is omphalotus illudens unlike chanterelles omphalotus olearius and other omphalotus species contain the toxin illudin s and are poisonous to humans while not lethal consuming this mushroom leads to very severe cramps vomiting and diarrhea the jack o lantern mushroom is orange its bioluminescence a blue green color can be observed in fresh specimens in low light conditions once the eye becomes dark adapted the whole mushroom does not glow only the gills do so this is due to an enzyme called luciferase acting upon a compound called luciferin leading to the emission of light much as fireflies do when glowing unlike chanterelles jack o lantern mushrooms have true sharp non forking gills this is possibly the simplest trait for distinguishing between the two furthermore if the jack o lantern s stem is peeled the inside is orange while the chanterelle is paler inside the stem

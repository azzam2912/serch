the plutons stretch over an area of about and intruded and cooled in late cretaceous times much of the batholith is weathered into a thick saprolite mantle in some locations this saprolite reaches thicknesses of about the development of this weathering is attributed to the humid climate and to stable conditions with limited amounts of erosion where the batholith derived saprolite is eroded inselbergs such as el pe n de guatap crop out inselbergs correspond to rock masses of the batholith that resisted weathering and erosion by being less fractured the batholith was named after antioquia by botero in 1942 after various authors as boussignault in 1825 ospina in 1911 scheibe in 1933 and posada in 1936 mentioned its existence the batholith varies in composition between hornblende biotite tonalite to granodiorite with lateral variations between gabbro to granite common minerals are hornblende quartz plagioclase k feldspar biotite and amphibole with traces of epidote chlorite and sphene the batholith underlies the municipalities san andr s de cuerquia san jos de la monta a in the east of san jer nimo around belmira in don mat as girardota g mez plata entrerr os carolina del pr ncipe barbosa santo domingo and santa

ngc 759 was discovered by astronomer by heinrich d arrest on september 17 1865 it is a member of abell 262 despite being classified as a radio galaxy the radio emission in ngc 759 could be due to star formation rather than an active galactic nucleus the central region of ngc 759 harbors a face on dust disk with tightly wound spiral structure the disk has a diameter of the dust disk also contains a smaller circumnuclear molecular gas ring that has star formation in h ii regions these features may be the result of a merger of gas rich disk galaxies or by the accretion of gas rich material in ether scenario the gas would have lost momentum and fallen to the center of the galaxy to produce the disk and current star formation however vlasyuk et al suggests that the disk and the smaller circumnuclear molecular gas ring with star formation inside the main disk formed from a tidal encounter between ngc 759 and a large spiral galaxy which was accompanied by a substantial gas accretion ngc 759 contains 2 4 10 m of molecular gas most of the gas is concentrated in a circumnuclear molecular gas ring

hc 12a is a mixture of hydrocarbons specifically propane r 290 and isobutane r 600a and is therefore considered nearly non ozone depleting when compared to dichlorodifluoromethane r 12 freon 12 or 1 1 1 2 tetrafluoroethane r 134a the mixture can be used in refrigeration systems designed for r 12 hc 12a provides better cooling than an r 12 system retrofitted to r 134a with much greater energy efficiency as well unlike r 134a hc 12a is completely compatible with the hoses and oils used in r 12 systems making the conversion much easier to accomplish hc 12a is also patent free due to its non synthetic nature because of its flammability it is illegal to replace r 12 with hc 12a in the united states it is not illegal to purchase hc 12a or to use it in refrigeration systems that were not originally charged with r 12 except for in certain states that prohibit the use of flammable refrigerants in automobiles some advantages to using the hc 12a mixture over retrofitting to r 134a are cost and labor since hc 12a is a drop in replacement no seals need to be replaced and minimal effort has to

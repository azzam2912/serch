an ear decomposition of an undirected graph g is a partition of its set of edges into a sequence of ears such that the one or two endpoints of each ear belong to earlier ears in the sequence and such that the internal vertices of each ear do not belong to any earlier ear additionally in most cases the first ear in the sequence must be a cycle an open ear decomposition or a proper ear decomposition is an ear decomposition in which the two endpoints of each ear after the first are distinct from each other ear decompositions may be used to characterize several important graph classes and as part of efficient graph algorithms they may also be generalized from graphs to matroids several important classes of graphs may be characterized as the graphs having certain types of ear decompositions a graph is k vertex connected if the removal of any k 1 vertices leaves a connected subgraph and k edge connected if the removal of any k 1 edges leaves a connected subgraph the following result is due to the following result is due to in both cases the number of ears is necessarily equal to the circuit

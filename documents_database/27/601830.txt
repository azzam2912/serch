free implies that the tissue is completely detached from its blood supply at the original location donor site and then transferred to another location recipient site and the circulation in the tissue re established by anastomosis of artery s and vein s this is in contrast to a pedicled flap in which the tissue is left partly attached to the donor site pedicle and simply transposed to a new location keeping the pedicle intact as a conduit to supply the tissue with blood various types of tissue may be transferred as a free flap including skin and fat muscle nerve bone cartilage or any combination of these lymph nodes and intestinal segments an example of free flap could be a free toe transfer in which the great toe or the second toe is transferred to the hand to reconstruct a thumb for all free flaps the blood supply is reconstituted using microsurgical techniques to reconnect the artery brings blood into the flap and vein allows blood to flow out of the flap free autologous tissue transfer is performed by many surgical specialties free flaps are used to reconstruct tissue defects particularly when postoperative radiotherapy is indicated vascularized free tissue is

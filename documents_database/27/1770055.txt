its length measures 4 9 mm the whorls in the protoconch number at least two they are rather large depressed helicoid well rounded and about half immersed in the first of the succeeding turns the eight whorls of the teleoconch are moderately well rounded they are shouldered at the summit which is slightly exserted and marked by obsolete axial ribs which are best expressed on the early turns of these ribs about 18 are indicated upon the second 22 upon the third and fourth 28 upon the fifth and 20 upon the sixth and penultimate turns the intercostal spaces are scarcely visible the ribs appearing a little more opaque than the spaces between them in addition to the axial sculpture the whorls are marked between the sutures by about eleven slender spiral striations which are of somewhat varying strength and spacing the region immediately below the summit being free of spiral sculpture the sutures are well impressed the periphery is well rounded the base of the shell is well rounded it is marked by about 16 slender spiral lirations which are strongest near the periphery and grow weaker and closer spaced towards the umbilical chink where they are very densely

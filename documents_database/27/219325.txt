the rule was formulated by christopher a lipinski in 1997 based on the observation that most orally administered drugs are relatively small and moderately lipophilic molecules the rule describes molecular properties important for a drug s pharmacokinetics in the human body including their absorption distribution metabolism and excretion adme however the rule does not predict if a compound is pharmacologically active the rule is important to keep in mind during drug discovery when a pharmacologically active lead structure is optimized step wise to increase the activity and selectivity of the compound as well as to ensure drug like physicochemical properties are maintained as described by lipinski s rule candidate drugs that conform to the ro5 tend to have lower attrition rates during clinical trials and hence have an increased chance of reaching the market lipinski s rule states that in general an orally active drug has no more than one violation of the following criteria note that all numbers are multiples of five which is the origin of the rule s name as with many other rules of thumb such as baldwin s rules for ring closure there are many exceptions to lipinski s rule in an attempt to improve

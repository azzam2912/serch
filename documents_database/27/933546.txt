often formula 12 is a linear function in which case the conic optimization problem reduces to a linear program a semidefinite program and a second order cone program respectively certain special cases of conic optimization problems have notable closed form expressions of their dual problems the dual of the conic linear program is where formula 17 denotes the dual cone of formula 18 whilst weak duality holds in conic linear programming strong duality does not necessarily hold the dual of a semidefinite program in inequality form is given by

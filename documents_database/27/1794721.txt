operating on lox rp 1 the engine was throttleable and had a thrust of at a chamber pressure of making it one of the most powerful engines ever constructed the tr 107 was built by trw following the successful conclusion of the development program for the tr 106 engine a similar throttleable engine of about half the thrust burning lox lh2 instead of lox rp 1 tom mueller then vp of propulsion development at northrop was project manager for both the tr 106 and tr 107 engines in 2002 mueller co founded spacex with elon musk and became the vp of propulsion after cancellation of sli program the engine used duct cooling of the main combustion chamber and materials that would not interact with kerosene to minimize coking the duct separated the fuel from the chamber wall and allowed controlled cooling of the chamber to keep the temperature of the kerosene down this approach simplified the engine in comparison with competing designs by eliminating the regenerative cooling circuit many large manifolds and associated plumbing were eliminated as well reducing potential failure modes and improving engine reliability the tr107 engine used oxygen rich combustion orsc products to alleviate soot build up

in a free market economy productively efficient firms optimize their production process by minimizing cost consistent with each possible level of production and the result is a cost curve profit maximizing firms use cost curves to decide output quantities there are various types of cost curves all related to each other including total and average cost curves marginal for each additional unit cost curves which are equal to the differential of the total cost curves and variable cost curves some are applicable to the short run others to the long run there are standard acronyms for each cost concept expressed in terms of the following descriptors these can be combined in various ways to express different cost concepts with sr and lr often omitted when the context is clear one from the first group sr or lr none or one from the second group a m or none meaning level none or one from the third group f v or t and the fourth item c from the various combinations we have the following short run cost curves and the following long run cost curves the short run total cost srtc and long run total cost lrtc curves are increasing

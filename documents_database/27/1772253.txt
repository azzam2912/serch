q vectors are not physical quantities that can be measured in the atmosphere but are derived from the quasi geostrophic equations and can be used in the previous diagnostic situations on meteorological charts q vectors point toward upward motion and away from downward motion q vectors are an alternative to the omega equation for diagnosing vertical motion in the quasi geostrophic equations first derived in 1978 q vector derivation can be simplified for the midlatitudes using the midlatitude plane quasi geostrophic prediction equations and the thermal wind equations formula 4 x component of thermal wind equation formula 5 y component of thermal wind equation where formula 6 is the coriolis parameter approximated by the constant 1e s formula 7 is the atmospheric ideal gas constant formula 8 is the latitudinal change in the coriolis parameter formula 9 formula 10 is a static stability parameter formula 11 is the specific heat at constant pressure formula 12 is pressure formula 13 is temperature anything with a subscript formula 14 indicates geostrophic anything with a subscript formula 15 indicates ageostrophic formula 16 is a diabatic heating rate and formula 17 is the lagrangian rate change of pressure with time formula 18 note that

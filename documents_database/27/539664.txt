some breeds particularly pony breeds have a naturally thick forelock while other breeds such as many thoroughbreds have a thinner forelock primitive wild equines such as the przewalski s horse with a naturally short upright mane generally have no hair falling forward onto the forehead other equidae such as donkeys and zebras have no discernible forelock at all little research has been published on the purpose of the forelock however the thick forelock is more prevalent in breeds developed in the cold wet climates of northern europe and is minimal on wild horse subspecies and other equine species adapted to hot dry climates such as the zebra or donkey it tends to be fine and thin on many oriental horse breeds even if they otherwise have long manes and tails thus it may play a role in temperature regulation in competition the forelock is braided for some events such as those in the dressage and hunt seat disciplines conversely some breeds such as the andalusian are usually shown with a long full forelock that is never braided other breeds may confine the forelock with rubber bands and anchor it to the bridle the forelock may also be roached shaved off

finite sequences of symbols that need not be of the same length string kernels can be intuitively understood as functions measuring the similarity of pairs of strings the more similar two strings a and b are the higher the value of a string kernel k a b will be using string kernels with kernelized learning algorithms such as support vector machines allow such algorithms to work with strings without having to translate these to fixed length real valued feature vectors string kernels are used in domains where sequence data are to be clustered or classified e g in text mining and gene analysis suppose one wants to compare some text passages automatically and indicate their relative similarity for many applications it might be sufficient to find some keywords which match exactly one example where exact matching is not always enough is found in spam detection another would be in computational gene analysis where homologous genes have mutated resulting in common subsequences along with deleted inserted or replaced symbols since several well proven data clustering classification and information retrieval methods for example support vector machines are designed to work on vectors i e data are elements of a vector space using

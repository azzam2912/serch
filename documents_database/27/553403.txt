the software was intimately linked to the hardware and could not function independent of it as computers became less expensive generalized personal computers the concept of peripheral devices was introduced where the base hardware could have a variety of different accessory devices from different manufacturers at first software which was to use this accessory hardware was required to be specifically designed to support it in the time of ms dos game programmers typically had to write custom control software for each type of sound card or video card that might be installed in the user s computer the need to provide custom support for so many devices consumed a considerable amount of time for software development eventually hardware abstraction layers hal such as directx were developed which separate application software from the underlying hardware the application software does not need to know anything about the hardware on which it was to be used instead it discovers the capabilities of the hardware through the standardized abstraction layer and then use abstracted commands to control the hardware it is up to the hal to be able to translate these commands into the specific format required for each device using device drivers typically

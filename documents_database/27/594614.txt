it is lightweight and resistant to oxidation and heat however it suffers from low ductility the density of tial is about 4 0 g cm it finds use in several applications including automobiles and aircraft the development of tial based alloys began circa 1970 the alloys have been used in these applications only since about 2000 titanium aluminide has three major intermetallic compounds gamma tial alpha 2 tial and tial among the three gamma tial has received the most interest and applications gamma tial has excellent mechanical properties and oxidation and corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures over 600 degrees celsius which makes it a possible replacement for traditional ni based superalloy components in aircraft turbine engines tial based alloys have potential to increase the thrust to weight ratio in aircraft engines this is especially the case with the engine s low pressure turbine blades and the high pressure compressor blades these are traditionally made of ni based superalloy which is nearly twice as dense as tial based alloys several types of titanium aluminide alloys retain strength to 750 c which is at least 150 c higher than the operating temperature limit of conventional titanium alloys general electric uses gamma tial

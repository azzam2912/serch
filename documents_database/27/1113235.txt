a chirp is a sinusoidal signal of frequency increase or decrease over time often with a polynomial expression for the relationship between time and frequency in the picture is an example of an upchirp in which the frequency increases linearly over time sometimes the frequency of upchirps increase exponentially over time as with other spread spectrum methods chirp spread spectrum uses its entire allocated bandwidth to broadcast a signal making it robust to channel noise further because the chirps utilize a broad band of the spectrum chirp spread spectrum is also resistant to multi path fading even when operating at very low power however it is unlike direct sequence spread spectrum dsss or frequency hopping spread spectrum fhss in that it does not add any pseudo random elements to the signal to help distinguish it from noise on the channel instead relying on the linear nature of the chirp pulse additionally chirp spread spectrum is resistant to the doppler effect which is typical in mobile radio applications chirp spread spectrum was originally designed to compete with ultra wideband for precision ranging and low rate wireless networks in the 2 45 ghz band however since the release of ieee 802 15

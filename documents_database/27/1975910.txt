it is both free as an algebra and graded cofree as a graded coalgebra so is in some sense as far as possible from being either commutative or cocommutative it was introduced by and studied by the underlying free abelian group of the mpr algebra has a basis consisting of the disjoint union of the symmetric groups s for n 0 1 2 which can be thought of as permutations the identity 1 is the empty permutation and the counit takes the empty permutation to 1 and the others to 0 the product of two permutations a a and b b in mpr is given by the shuffle product a a m b m b the coproduct of a permutation a on m points is given by st b st c where the sum is over the m 1 ways to write a considered as a sequence of m integers as a concatenation of two sequences b and c and st b is the standardization of b where the elements of the sequence b are reduced to be a set of the form 1 2 n while preserving their order the antipode has infinite order the hopf algebra of permutations

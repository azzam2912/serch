a term is first interpreted into a denotational model of the term structure and then a canonical normal and long representative is extracted by reifying the denotation such an essentially semantic approach differs from the more traditional syntactic description of normalisation as a reductions in a term rewrite system where reductions are allowed deep inside terms nbe was first described for the simply typed lambda calculus it has since been extended both to weaker type systems such as the untyped lambda calculus using a domain theoretic approach and to richer type systems such as several variants of martin l f type theory consider the simply typed lambda calculus where types can be basic types function types or products given by the following backus naur form grammar associating to the right as usual these can be implemented as a datatype in the meta language for example for standard ml we might use terms are defined at two levels the lower syntactic level sometimes called the dynamic level is the representation that one intends to normalise here lam app resp pair fst snd are the intro elim forms for resp and x are variables these terms are intended to be implemented as

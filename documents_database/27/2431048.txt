post kpg coelacanth fossils have been claimed to have come from northern european rock deposits dating the paleocene and remains from the levant areas claimed to date to the miocene the last confirmed coelacanth remains are dated to the late cretaceous up until such finds were found these fossils are used mainly as evidence by british vertebrate paleontologist and science writer darren naish against cryptozoology in terms of validity the only plausible fossil is the one from the european paleocene however it has problems mainly the fact that it has been evaluated based on comparative bone histology methods of doubtful reliability the goldsmith early miocene israeli coelacanth fossils were never tested the one from palestinian territories named by its describer khalaf as macropomoides palaestina were written by a creationist and they had no drawn out pictures no fossils have been found of the modern genus latimeria this is probably due to the fact that modern coelacanths both in the comoros and sulawesi are found in environments that do not favor fossil formation they inhabit caves and overhangs in near vertical marine reefs at about 200 metres depth off newly formed volcanic islands genetic tests link the modern species to date

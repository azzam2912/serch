scott coman hall was completed in 1958 and was designed by paul thiry with a few exceptions scott and coman halls are designed as mirrored versions of each another both halls have four floors and were built to hold 142 residents per building 284 in total the ground floor of each building has a study lounge and another lounge for more social and relaxing purposes the front desk of scott coman is found in the front door of scott hall serving as the main desk for both buildings something semi unique to scott coman is each building has a set of ramps along with the staircases in the time period that the halls were built these ramps were more of an homage to the european modernist style that the buildings were designed after throughout time however the ramps served well for disability access and an easier move in for residents this was a unique feature given that disability access was not a priority for university buildings in the mid 1900s since the buildings only have 4 floors and there are ramps and stairs elevators were never part of the plan for the halls and none have been any installed since

the braking force derives from the friction resulting from the application of wood or metal braking shoes directly to the tracks as the name suggests early examples of track brakes used on the horse hauled mineral tramways that preceded the steam locomotive were described as sledge brakes and are usually associated with lines that used gravity propulsion in 1849 locomotive engineer daniel gooch fitted early examples of his corsair class tank engine with these devices later these were replace with a conventional wheel brake early systems used manual force to apply the braking shoes more recently system have used arrays of electromagnets to hold the shoes against the rail in some applications the shoes are applied by powerful springs and held off by mechanical or electro magnetic force the grip of steel wheels on steel rails tends to be less than is the case with rubber tires though sanding dropping gritty material on the track does compensate if wheel slippage occurs therefore when light rail systems or trams share space with pedestrians automobiles and other road traffic or where the vehicles operate on steep track safety demands that the tram be fitted with electromagnetic track braking for emergency use in

these systems use either electromagnetic or ultrasonic sensors these systems feature ultrasonic proximity detectors to measure the distances to nearby objects via sensors located in the front and or rear bumper fascias or visually minimized within adjacent grills or recesses the sensors emit acoustic pulses with a control unit measuring the return interval of each reflected signal and calculating object distances the system in turns warns the driver with acoustic tones the frequency indicating object distance with faster tones indicating closer proximity and a continuous tone indicating a minimal pre defined distance systems may also include visual aids such as led or lcd readouts to indicate object distance a vehicle may include a vehicle pictogram on the car s infotainment screen with a representation of the nearby objects as coloured blocks rear sensors may be activated when reverse gear is selected and deactivated as soon as any other gear is selected front sensors may be activated manually and deactivated automatically when the vehicle reaches a pre determined speed to avoid subsequent nuisance warnings as an ultrasonic systems relies on the reflection of sound waves the system may not detect flat objects or object insufficiently large to reflect sound e g

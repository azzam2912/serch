unlike other secure collision resistant hashes vsh is efficient and usable in practice asymptotically it only requires a single multiplication per log n message bits and uses rsa type arithmetic therefore vsh can be useful in embedded environments where code space is limited two major variants of vsh were proposed for one finding a collision is as difficult as finding a nontrivial modular square root of a very smooth number modulo n the other one uses a prime modulus p with no trapdoor and its security proof relies on the hardness of finding discrete logarithms of very smooth numbers modulo p both versions have similar efficiency vsh is not suitable as a substitute for a random oracle but can be used to build a secure randomized trapdoor hash function this function can replace the trapdoor function used in the cramer shoup signature scheme maintaining its provable security while speeding up verification time by about 50 all cryptographic hash functions that are now widely used are not based on hard mathematical problems those few functions that are constructed on hard mathematical problems are called provably secure finding collisions is then known to be as hard as solving the hard mathematical problem

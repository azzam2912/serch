this is done either exactly for very light nuclei up to four nucleons or by employing certain well controlled approximations for heavier nuclei ab initio methods constitute a more fundamental approach compared to e g the nuclear shell model recent progress has enabled ab initio treatment of heavier nuclei such as nickel a significant challenge in the ab initio treatment stems from the complexities of the inter nucleon interaction the strong nuclear force is believed to emerge from the strong interaction described by quantum chromodynamics qcd but qcd is non perturbative in the low energy regime relevant to nuclear physics this makes the direct use of qcd for the description of the inter nucleon interactions very difficult see lattice qcd and a model must be used instead the most sophisticated models available are based on chiral effective field theory this effective field theory eft includes all interactions compatible with the symmetries of qcd ordered by the size of their contributions the degrees of freedom in this theory are nucleons and pions as opposed to quarks and gluons as in qcd the effective theory contains parameters called low energy constants which can be determined from scattering data chiral eft implies the

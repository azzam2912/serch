when the trigger is actuated the bolt travels forward feeds a cartridge from the magazine or belt into the chamber and fires that cartridge in the same movement like any other self loading design the action is cycled by the gas expended from the round hence the necessity of a gas system this excess of gas sends the bolt back to the rear ejecting the empty cartridge case and preparing for the next shot or continuing forward again if the trigger is held down in turn keeping the catch depressed and the weapon is an automatic generally an open bolt firing cycle is used for fully automatic weapons and not for semi automatic weapons except some semi automatic conversions of automatic designs firearms using advanced primer ignition blowback inherently fire from open bolt only compared to a closed bolt design open bolt weapons generally have fewer moving parts the firing pin is often part of the bolt saving on manufacturing costs the inertia of the bolt closing also causes the fixed firing pin to strike a blow on the primer without need for a separate hammer striker and spring in automatic weapons an open bolt helps eliminate the dangerous phenomenon

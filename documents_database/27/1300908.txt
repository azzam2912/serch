it states that the interactions between the catalyst and the substrate should be just right that is neither too strong nor too weak if the interaction is too weak the substrate will fail to bind to the catalyst and no reaction will take place on the other hand if the interaction is too strong the product fails to dissociate the principle can be shown graphically by plotting the reaction rate against a property such as the heat of adsorption of the reactant by the catalyst such plots pass through a maximum looking roughly like a triangle or an inverted parabola and are called volcano plots because of their shape analogous three dimensional plots can also be built against two different properties such as the heats of adsorption of the two reactants for a two component reaction in that case the plot is generally shown as a contour plot and is called a volcano surface volcano plots were introduced by balandin the figure on the right shows a volcano plot for the decomposition of formic acid using different transition metals as catalysts in this case the heat of formation h of the metal formate salt was used for the x axis

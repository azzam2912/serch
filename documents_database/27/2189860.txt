pre clinical studies primarily in animal models and human tissues implicate spm in orchestrating the resolution of inflammation spm join the long list of other physiological agents which tend to limit inflammation see including glucocorticoids interleukin 10 an anti inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 receptor antagonist an inhibitor of the action of pro inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 annexin a1 an inhibitor of formation of pro inflammatory metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids and the gaseous resolvins carbon monoxide see nitric oxide see and hydrogen sulfide see and the absolute as well as relative roles of the spm along with other physiological anti inflammatory agents in resolving human inflammatory responses remain to be defined precisely however studies suggest that synthetic spm that are resistant to being metabolically inactivated hold promise of being clinically useful pharmacological tools for preventing and resolving a wide range of pathological inflammatory responses along with the tissue destruction and morbidity that these responses cause based on animal model studies the inflammation based diseases which may be treated by such metabolically resistant spm analogs include not only pathological and tissue damaging responses to invading pathogens but also a wide array of pathological conditions in which inflammation is a contributing factor

the systems assisted software development with assemblers and compilers for pascal and c provided hardware for in circuit emulation of processors and memory had debugging tools including logic analysis hardware and a programmable read only memory prom chip programmer a wide variety of optional cards and software were available tailored to particular microprocessors when introduced the hp 64000 had two distinguishing characteristics first unlike most microprocessor development systems of the day such as the intel intellec and motorola exorciser it was not dedicated to a particular manufacturer s microprocessors and second it was designed such that up to six workstations would be connected via the hp ib ieee 488 instrumentation bus to a common hard drive and printer to form a tightly integrated network as shown in the block diagram to the right a 64000 system consisted of a number of components whose names had specific definitions the 64000 provided a file system and text editor for writing software there was a generic assembler linker manual bitsavers pascal compiler manual bitsavers and c compiler manual bitsavers which were supplemented with add on cross assemblers and cross compilers for each particular microprocessor a list of these by product number is hpcm

the tree you see today is not an elm because of the presence of dutch elm disease in the uk the parish pump though not the original is sited near the tree there is no record of the date when elm hill first came into being but there is some evidence for its existence around 1200 very few buildings now standing in elm hill are of an earlier date than 1507 when a disastrous fire destroyed over 700 houses in norwich the britons arms was the only building to survive so is much older elm hill used to continue in a straight line past britons arms and intersect with st georges street but was re aligned in the 15th century to permit the construction of st andrew s blackfriars halls which were originally the home of the dominican friars elm hill today extends from the church of st peter hungate where the top of elm hill meets princes street to the church of st simon and st jude sited at the bottom of elm hill on the corner with wensum street although it may not be immediately apparent today the north side of elm hill runs parallel to the river

and originally developed by the letscontrolit com community formerly known as esp8266 nu community it runs on esp8266 wi fi based mcu microcontroller unit platforms for iot from espressif systems the name esp easy by default refers to the firmware rather than the hardware on which it runs at a low level the esp easy firmware works the same as the nodemcu firmware and also provides a very simple operating system on the esp8266 the main difference between esp easy firmware and nodemcu firmware is that the former is designed as a high level toolbox that just works out of the box for a pre defined set of sensors and actuators users simply hook up and read control over simple web requests without having to write any code at all themselves including firmware upgrades using ota over the air updates the esp easy firmware can be used to turn esp8266 modules into simple multifunction sensor and actuator devices for home automation platforms once the firmware is loaded on the hardware configuration of esp easy is entirely web interface based esp easy firmware is primarily used on esp8266 modules hardware as a wireless wi fi sensor device with added sensors for

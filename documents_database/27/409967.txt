mds america was the primary party responsible for the invalidation of northpoint technology inc s patents having to do with extraterrestrial rebroadcast of satellite signals mds operations an affiliated company participated in recent auctions in 2005 and 2006 held by the federal communications commission fcc of the frequency band of 12 2 12 7 ghz which it christened mvdds the receiver of mdsa s system uses a technology that is patented under us patent number 7 286 795 the mvdds system uses similar spectrum to a direct broadcast satellite dbs system and is capable of operating at the same frequencies without interference the mdsa two way system competes against satellite internet access the shorter round trip distance of only a few hundred kilometers reduces the latency compared with a geostationary satellite s 44 000 mile 250ms latency the mdsa system has the disadvantage of requiring infrastructure closer to the user a satellite can cover a significant proportion of the country instead of the maximum 200 km radius of an mdsa base station however since the mdsa signal can be sectorized mdsa s bandwidth unlike that of satellite can be multiplied in most geographical areas for video distribution this means that

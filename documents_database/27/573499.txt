reflection symmetry which is invariant under a kind of flip from one state to another however a discrete symmetry can always be reinterpreted as a subset of some higher dimensional continuous symmetry e g reflection of a 2 dimensional object in 3 dimensional space can be achieved by continuously rotating that object 180 degrees across a non parallel plane the notion of continuous symmetry has largely and successfully been formalised in the mathematical notions of topological group lie group and group action for most practical purposes continuous symmetry is modelled by a group action of a topological group that preserves some structure particularly let formula 1 be a function and g is a group that acts on x then a subgroup formula 2 is a symmetry of f if formula 3 for all formula 4 the simplest motions follow a one parameter subgroup of a lie group such as the euclidean group of three dimensional space for example translation parallel to the x axis by u units as u varies is a one parameter group of motions rotation around the z axis is also a one parameter group continuous symmetry has a basic role in noether s theorem in theoretical

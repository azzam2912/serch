although several protein families have four transmembrane alpha helices tetraspanins are defined by conserved amino acid sequences including four or more cysteine residues in the ec2 domain with two in a highly conserved ccg motif tetraspanins are often thought to act as scaffolding proteins anchoring multiple proteins to one area of the cell membrane tetraspanins are highly conserved between species some tetraspanins can have n linked glycosylations on the long extracellular loop lel ec2 and palmitoylations at a cxxc motif in their transmembrane region there are 34 tetraspanins in mammals 33 of which have also been identified in humans tetraspanins display numerous properties that indicate their physiological importance in cell adhesion motility activation and proliferation as well as their contribution to pathological conditions such as metastasis or viral infection a role for tetraspanins in platelets was demonstrated by the bleeding phenotypes of cd151 and tssc6 deficient mice which exhibit impaired outside in signalling through the major platelet integrin it is hypothesized that tetraspanins interact with and regulate other platelet receptors the schistosome worms make two tetraspanins tsp 1 and tsp 2 tsp 2 antibodies are found in some people who seem to have immunity to schistosome infection schistosomiasis

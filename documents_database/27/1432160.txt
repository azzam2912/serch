it works by having the equal but opposite spherical aberration of the objective it is designed to correct usually a spherical mirror meniscus correctors are used as full aperture correctors most commonly in a maksutov telescope sub type called the gregory or spot maksutov cassegrain telescope they are also used in the bouwers meniscus telescope there are maksutov variations that use the same principle but place the meniscus lens as a sub aperture corrector near the focus of the objective there are other sub aperture meniscus corrector catadioptric telescopes such as the argunov cassegrain telescope and the klevtsov cassegrain telescope the idea of using the spherical aberration of a meniscus lens to correct the opposite aberration in a spherical objective dates back as far as w f hamilton s 1814 hamiltonian telescope in colonel a mangin s 1876 mangin mirror and also appears in ludwig schupmann s schupmann medial telescope near the end of the 19th century after the invention of the wide field schmidt camera in the early 1930s at least four optical designers in early 1940s war torn europe came up with the idea of replacing the complicated schmidt corrector plate with a simpler meniscus lens including albert

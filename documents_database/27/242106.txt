cyclobutane is a colourless gas and commercially available as a liquefied gas derivatives of cyclobutane are called cyclobutanes cyclobutane itself is of no commercial or biological significance but more complex derivatives are important in biology and biotechnology it was early theorised by chad cartledge and henry ross and was allocated the name the ross cartledge thereom also commonly referred to as the carbon square the bond angles between carbon atoms are significantly strained and as such have lower bond energies than related linear or unstrained hydrocarbons e g butane or cyclohexane as such cyclobutane is unstable above about 500 c the four carbon atoms in cyclobutane are not coplanar instead the ring typically adopts a folded or puckered conformation one of the carbon atoms makes a 25 angle with the plane formed by the other three carbons in this way some of the eclipsing interactions are reduced the conformation is also known as a butterfly equivalent puckered conformations interconvert despite inherent strain the cyclobutane motif is indeed found in nature one unusual example is pentacycloanammoxic acid which is a ladderane composed of 5 fused cyclobutane units the estimated strain in this compound is 3 times that of cyclobutane the compound

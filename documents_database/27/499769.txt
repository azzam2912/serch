it is a faint star near the lower limit of visibility to the naked eye having an apparent visual magnitude of 5 85 based upon an annual parallax shift of as seen from earth this system is roughly 628 light years from the sun at that distance the visual magnitude of the star is diminished by an extinction factor of 0 10 due to interstellar dust it is receding from the sun with a radial velocity of 2 km s at an estimated age of 270 million years this is an evolved g type giant with a stellar classification of g8 iii with the supply of hydrogen at its core exhausted the star has cooled and expanded to 18 times the girth of the sun it has 3 4 times the mass of the sun and is radiating 224 times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5 070 the surface metallicity of this star what astronomers term the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium is 41 higher than in the sun

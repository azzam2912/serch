as of august 2019 there are two return flights per day to tenerife north and two return flights per day to gran canaria although from the island capital the airport was located here to avoid disturbing the garajonay national park and avoid the cloudier and foggier climate to the north of the island whilst the volcanic terrain gives few suitable sites anywhere on la gomera although even this site required extensive embankments at both ends of the runway aviation in the island of la gomera started in the 1950s when a private airfield was constructed its name was el revolcadero and it was situated in tecina this airfield had a runway 09 27 an hangar and a small stand which was used as control tower the airfield was for the owner s private use and for emergencies and fumigation works in the year 1962 the island had a lot of sanitary assistance problems so studies to build an airport in the island were started but this project was not carried out until 1975 however due to the opening of the tenerife south airport and a new maritime line with the island the project was again delayed finally in the 1980s

these microfibrils provide force bearing structural support in elastic and nonelastic connective tissue throughout the body the sequence of fibrillin 1 includes 47 six cysteine egf like domains 7 eight cysteine domains homologous with latent tgf beta binding protein and a proline rich region the fbn 1 gene is involved in a variety of embryonic developmental programs the microfibrils that are made from fibrillin 1 contribute to both elastic and non elastic structures the formation of the elastic fibers in the heart valves and the aorta require the involvement of both fbn 1 and fbn 2 it has been shown that both fbn 1 and fbn 2 along with the other components of elastic fibers are expressed in the embryonic semilunar valves as early as 4 weeks of gestation these molecules interact to form the elastic fibers in the ventricularis layer of the semilunar valves fibrillin 1 and fibrillin 2 are also crucial for the development of elastic fibers in the aorta while expression of fibrillin 2 decreases significantly after fetal development the expression of fibrillin 1 continues into adulthood this supports the idea that fibrilin 2 dictates the development of early elastic fibers while fibrillin 1 provides the structural

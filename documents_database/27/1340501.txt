explicit file sequences are in fact sequences whose filenames all end with a numeric or alphanumeric tag in the end excluding file extension the aforementioned locality of reference usually pertains either to the data the metadata e g their filenames or last access dates or the physical proximity within the storage media they reside in in the latter acception it is better to speak about file contiguity see below every gui program shows contents of folders by usually ordering its files according to some criteria mostly related to the files metadata like the filename the criterion is by default the alphanumeric ordering of filenames although some operating systems do that in smarter ways than others for example codice 1 should ideally be placed before codice 2 like gnome files and thunar do whereas alphanumerically it comes after more on that later other criteria exist like ordering files by their file type or by their extension and if the same type by either filename or last access date and so on for this reason when a file sequence has a more strong locality of reference particularly when it is related to their actual contents it is better to highlight this fact

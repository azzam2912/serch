it is also colloquially referred to as an unusual tightness stiffness or pull of muscles clinically spasticity results from the loss of inhibition of motor neurons causing excessive velocity dependent muscle contraction this ultimately leads to hyperreflexia an exaggerated deep tendon reflex spasticity is often treated with the drug baclofen which acts as an agonist at gaba receptors which are inhibitory spastic cerebral palsy is the most common form of cerebral palsy which is a group of permanent movement problems that do not get worse over time gaba s inhibitory actions contribute to baclofen s efficacy as an anti spasticity agent spasticity mostly occurs in disorders of the central nervous system cns affecting the upper motor neurons in the form of a lesion such as spastic diplegia or upper motor neuron syndrome and can also be present in various types of multiple sclerosis where it occurs as a symptom of the progressively worsening attacks on myelin sheaths and is thus unrelated to the types of spasticity present in neuromuscular cerebral palsy rooted spasticity disorders the cause of spasticity is thought to be where an imbalance occurs in the excitatory and inhibitory input to motor neurons caused by damage to the

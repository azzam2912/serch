the null model is used as a term of comparison to verify whether the object in question displays some non trivial features properties that wouldn t be expected on the basis of chance alone or as a consequence of the constraints such as community structure in graphs an appropriate null model behaves in accordance with a reasonable null hypothesis for the behavior of the system under investigation one null model of utility in the study of complex networks is that proposed by newman and girvan consisting of a randomized version of an original graph formula 1 produced through edges being rewired at random under the constraint that the expected degree of each vertex matches the degree of the vertex in the original graph the null model is the basic concept behind the definition of modularity a function which evaluates the goodness of partitions of a graph into clusters in particular given a graph formula 1 and a specific community partition formula 3 an assignment of a community index formula 4 here taken as an integer from formula 5 to formula 6 to each vertex formula 7 in the graph the modularity measures the difference between the number of links from

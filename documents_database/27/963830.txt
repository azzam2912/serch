this is typically taken as an axiom or basic postulate of quantum mechanics while generalizations of or departures from unitarity are part of speculations about theories that may go beyond quantum mechanics a unitarity bound is any inequality that follows from the unitarity of the evolution operator i e from the statement that time evolution preserves inner products in hilbert space time evolution described by a time independent hamiltonian is represented by a one parameter family of unitary operators for which the hamiltonian is a generator formula 1 the expectation value of the hamiltonian is conserved under the time evolution that the hamiltonian generates if the hamiltonian itself has an intrinsic time dependence as occurs when interaction strengths or other parameters vary over time then computing the family of unitary operators becomes more complicated see dyson series in the schr dinger picture the unitary operators are taken to act upon the system s quantum state whereas in the heisenberg picture the time dependence is incorporated into the observables instead similarly the s matrix that describes how the physical system changes in a scattering process must be a unitary operator as well this implies the optical theorem unitarity of the s

any function formula 1 that satisfies the property formula 2 is a radial function the distance is usually euclidean distance although other metrics are sometimes used they are often used as a collection formula 7which forms a basis for some function space of interest hence the name sums of radial basis functions are typically used to approximate given functions this approximation process can also be interpreted as a simple kind of neural network this was the context in which they were originally applied to machine learning in work by david broomhead and david lowe in 1988 which stemmed from michael j d powell s seminal research from 1977 rbfs are also used as a kernel in support vector classification the technique has proven effective and flexible enough that radial basis functions are now applied in a variety of engineering applications a radial function is a function formula 8 when paired with a metric on a vector space formula 9 a function formula 10 is said to be a radial kernel centered at formula 11 a radial function and the associated radial kernels are said to be radial basis functions if for any set of nodes formula 12 formula 17 is

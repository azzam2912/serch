it orbits within the outer part of its star s habitable zone at a distance of 1 01 au the exoplanet was found by using the radial velocity method from radial velocity measurements via observation of doppler shifts in the spectrum of the planet s parent star hip 57274 d is a gas giant a planet that has a radius and mass close to that of the gas giants jupiter and saturn it has a temperature of it has an estimated mass of around 0 527 167 and a potential radius of around 9 based on its mass since it is slightly more massive than saturn the planet orbits a k type star named hip 57274 orbited by a total of three planets the star has a mass of 0 73 and a radius of 0 68 it has a surface temperature of 4640 k and is 7 billion years old in comparison the sun is about 4 6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 k the star s apparent magnitude or how bright it appears from earth s perspective is 8 96 therefore hip 57274 is too dim to be seen with the naked eye

it was defined by the ieee 802 3 working group as part of the ieee 802 3ae 2002 amendment which introduced 10 gbit s ethernet at the time 64b 66b was deployed it allowed 10 gb ethernet to be transmitted with the same lasers used by sonet oc 192 rather than requiring the 12 5 gbit s lasers that were not expected to be available for several years the protocol overhead of a coding scheme is the ratio of the number of added coding bits to the number of raw payload bits the overhead of 64b 66b encoding is 2 coding bits for every 64 payload bits or 3 125 this is a considerable improvement on the 80 efficiency of the previously used 8b 10b encoding scheme which added 2 coding bits to every 8 payload bits the overhead can be reduced further by doubling the payload size to produce the 128b 130b encoding used by pcie 3 0 and 128b 132b encoding used by usb 3 1 and display port 2 0 as its scheme name suggests 64 payload bits are encoded as a 66 bit entity the 66 bit entity is made by prefixing one of two possible

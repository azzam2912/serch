having gained this energy during its acceleration the body maintains this kinetic energy unless its speed changes the same amount of work is done by the body when decelerating from its current speed to a state of rest in classical mechanics the kinetic energy of a non rotating object of mass m traveling at a speed v is in relativistic mechanics this is a good approximation only when v is much less than the speed of light the standard unit of kinetic energy is the joule while the imperial unit of kinetic energy is the foot pound the adjective kinetic has its roots in the greek word kinesis meaning motion the dichotomy between kinetic energy and potential energy can be traced back to aristotle s concepts of actuality and potentiality the principle in classical mechanics that e mv was first developed by gottfried leibniz and johann bernoulli who described kinetic energy as the living force vis viva willem s gravesande of the netherlands provided experimental evidence of this relationship by dropping weights from different heights into a block of clay willem s gravesande determined that their penetration depth was proportional to the square of their impact speed milie du ch

it is a linear polymer made up of the repeating unit of agarobiose which is a disaccharide made up of galactose and 3 6 anhydro galactopyranose agarose is one of the two principal components of agar and is purified from agar by removing agar s other component agaropectin agarose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules especially dna by electrophoresis slabs of agarose gels usually 0 7 2 for electrophoresis are readily prepared by pouring the warm liquid solution into a mold a wide range of different agaroses of varying molecular weights and properties are commercially available for this purpose agarose may also be formed into beads and used in a number of chromatographic methods for protein purification agarose is a linear polymer with a molecular weight of about 120 000 consisting of alternating galactose and 3 6 anhydro galactopyranose linked by 1 3 and 1 4 glycosidic bonds the 3 6 anhydro galactopyranose is an galactose with an anhydro bridge between the 3 and 6 positions although some galactose units in the polymer may not contain the bridge some galactose and galactose units can be methylated and pyruvate and sulfate are also found in

the most commonly species for this purpose is hippophae rhamnoides species belonging to this genus accumulate lipids in the mesocarp the fruit pulp so the oil can be extracted from either the seeds or the pulp the resulting oils seed oil and pulp oil also called fruit or berry oil are used in dietary supplements nutraceuticals cosmetics and skin care products oil content in seeds of sea buckthorn is on average 7 11 while oil content of the fruit pulp is around 1 5 3 per fresh weight seed oil is characterized by high contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids while pulp oil contains monounsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids both oils also contain dense amounts of tocopherols tocotrienols and plant sterols oils from sea buckthorn seeds and pulp differ considerably in fatty acid composition while linoleic acid and linolenic acid are the major fatty acids in seed oil sea buckthorn pulp oil contains approximately 65 combined of the monounsaturated fatty acid palmitoleic acid and the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid this results in a major difference between the sea buckthorn oil extracted from seeds and the sea buckthorn oil extracted from the fleshy part of the fruit in term of appearance

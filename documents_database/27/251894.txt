instead gestalt maintains a dynamically extensible table of ostype selector codes for instance instead of checking the system version to deduce what version of the sound manager might be present there is a separate gestalt selector for directly querying the capabilities of the sound manager thus it could be made possible for an application dependent on capabilities introduced in a newer sound manager to run on an older system which had the updated sound manager installed as an add on as well as on a newer system which had the new sound manager built in and of course the sound manager add on could also query this gestalt selector first to decide whether there was any point in installing itself into the current system the value returned by querying a selector code is 32 bits whose meaning depends on the selector some selectors define this as a version code while others use it as a bit mask of available capabilities some subsystems define both types of selectors allowing querying of both the version number and the capabilities some even use a gestalt selector to pass the address of a shared block of data or even the address of code that

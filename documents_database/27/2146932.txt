there are several workers each worker can do any job but for each worker it takes a different amount of time to complete each job our goal is to allocate jobs to workers such that the total makespan of the project is minimized in the standard job shop scheduling problem the timings of all workers are known so we have a standard optimization problem in contrast in the truthful job scheduling problem the timings of the workers are not known we ask each worker how much time he needs to do each job but the workers might lie to us therefore we have to give the workers an incentive to tell us their true timings by paying them a certain amount of money the challenge is to design a payment mechanism which is incentive compatible the truthful job scheduling problem was introduced by nisan and ronen in their 1999 paper on algorithmic mechanism design there are formula 1 jobs and formula 2 workers m stands for machine since the problem comes from scheduling jobs to computers worker formula 3 can do job formula 4 in time formula 5 if worker formula 3 is assigned a set of jobs formula 7

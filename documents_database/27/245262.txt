this makes four different types of changes combine two close changes and you have a box step in right changes the man starts from the right foot while in left ones the man starts from the left foot a change is called closed if on the last step the moving foot closes to the standing foot a change is open if on the last step the moving foot passes the standing foot the figures are called changes because they allow dancers to change from natural turn to reverse turn and vice versa for example a basic practicing variation in waltz goes as follows all four changes are similar therefore a detailed description is only for the right closed change the man steps forward on right foot while the lady steps backward on the opposing i e left foot they will then step to the side and possibly slightly forward in relation to the man on the other foot and conclude the figure by closing the first foot beside the second each step takes up a full beat of the music a turn of up to 1 8 is optional there will be slight cbm on 1 and sway on 2

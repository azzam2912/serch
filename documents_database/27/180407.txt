also economists sometimes say a model has a representative agent when agents differ but act in such a way that the sum of their choices is mathematically equivalent to the decision of one individual or many identical individuals this occurs for example when preferences are gorman aggregable a model that contains many different agents whose choices cannot be aggregated in this way is called a heterogeneous agent model the notion of the representative agent can be traced back to the late 19th century francis edgeworth 1881 used the term representative particular while alfred marshall 1890 introduced a representative firm in his principles of economics however after robert lucas jr s critique of econometric policy evaluation spurred the development of microfoundations for macroeconomics the notion of the representative agent became more prominent and more controversial many macroeconomic models today are characterized by an explicitly stated optimization problem of the representative agent which may be either a consumer or a producer or frequently both types of representative agents are present the derived individual demand or supply curves are then used as the corresponding aggregate demand or supply curves since it has been shown that the commonly used demand functions do not aggregate

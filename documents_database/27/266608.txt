the smith normal form of a matrix is diagonal and can be obtained from the original matrix by multiplying on the left and right by invertible square matrices in particular the integers are a pid so one can always calculate the smith normal form of an integer matrix the smith normal form is very useful for working with finitely generated modules over a pid and in particular for deducing the structure of a quotient of a free module it is named after the british mathematician henry john stephen smith let a be a nonzero m n matrix over a principal ideal domain r there exist invertible formula 1 and formula 2 matrices s t so that the product s a t is formula 3 and the diagonal elements formula 4 satisfy formula 5 this is the smith normal form of the matrix a the elements formula 4 are unique up to multiplication by a unit and are called the elementary divisors invariants or invariant factors they can be computed up to multiplication by a unit as where formula 8 called i th determinant divisor equals the greatest common divisor of all formula 9 minors of the matrix a and formula

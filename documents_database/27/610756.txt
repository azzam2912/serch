it is one of two menisci of the knee the other being the medial meniscus it is nearly circular and covers a larger portion of the articular surface than the medial it can occasionally be injured or torn by twisting the knee or applying direct force as seen in contact sports the lateral meniscus is grooved laterally for the tendon of the popliteus which separates it from the fibular collateral ligament its anterior end is attached in front of the intercondyloid eminence of the tibia lateral to and behind the anterior cruciate ligament with which it blends the posterior end is attached behind the intercondyloid eminence of the tibia and in front of the posterior end of the medial meniscus the anterior attachment of the lateral meniscus is twisted on itself so that its free margin looks backward and upward its anterior end resting on a sloping shelf of bone on the front of the lateral process of the intercondyloid eminence close to its posterior attachment it sends off a strong fasciculus the ligament of wrisberg which passes upward and medialward to be inserted into the medial condyle of the femur immediately behind the attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament

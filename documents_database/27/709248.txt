it is a process through which two or more exons from different genes can be brought together ectopically or the same exon can be duplicated to create a new exon intron structure there are different mechanisms through which exon shuffling occurs transposon mediated exon shuffling crossover during sexual recombination of parental genomes and illegitimate recombination exon shuffling follows certain splice frame rules introns can interrupt the reading frame of a gene by inserting a sequence between two consecutive codons phase 0 introns between the first and second nucleotide of a codon phase 1 introns or between the second and third nucleotide of a codon phase 2 introns additionally exons can be classified into nine different groups based on the phase of the flanking introns symmetrical 0 0 1 1 2 2 and asymmetrical 0 1 0 2 1 0 1 2 etc symmetric exons are the only ones that can be inserted into introns undergo duplication or be deleted without changing the reading frame exon shuffling was first introduced in 1978 when walter gilbert discovered that the existence of introns could play a major role in the evolution of proteins it was noted that recombination within introns could help assort

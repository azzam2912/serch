the cross section of the bar is constant along its length and need not be circular the differential equation that governs the stress distribution on the bar in torsion is of the same form as the equation governing the shape of a membrane under differential pressure therefore in order to discover the stress distribution on the bar all one has to do is cut the shape of the cross section out of a piece of wood cover it with a soap film and apply a differential pressure across it then the slope of the soap film at any area of the cross section is directly proportional to the stress in the bar at the same point on its cross section simply when steel subjected or installed in a structures load distribution from slab to footing consider a steel element which will allow transfer load through it in a steel molecular are in stress may be normal or shear stress variation steel element trying to resist loads how much stress occurred in length of steel bar or structural element are drawn in contour lines while the membrane analogy allows the stress distribution on any cross section to be determined experimentally it

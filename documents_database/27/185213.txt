this is carried out either by the originator or by an adversary who intercepts the data and re transmits it possibly as part of a masquerade attack by ip packet substitution this is one of the lower tier versions of a man in the middle attack another way of describing such an attack is an attack on a security protocol using replay of messages from a different context into the intended or original and expected context thereby fooling the honest participant s into thinking they have successfully completed the protocol run suppose alice wants to prove her identity to bob bob requests her password as proof of identity which alice dutifully provides possibly after some transformation like a hash function meanwhile eve is eavesdropping on the conversation and keeps the password or the hash after the interchange is over eve posing as alice connects to bob when asked for a proof of identity eve sends alice s password or hash read from the last session which bob accepts thus granting eve access replay attacks can be prevented by tagging each encrypted component with a session id and a component number using this combination of solutions does not use anything that

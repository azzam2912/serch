it is restricted to humid habitats such as rainforest and gallery forest in mixed savanna forest landscapes and occurs at least up to 1600 m above sea level raids are conducted in the leaf litter stratum workers retreat in tunnels when disturbed or exposed to sun limited observations indicate that the species seems to prey almost exclusively on earthworms but this information has to be viewed with caution since variation in prey composition can be considerable in other dorylus species chimpanzees are known to feed on d gribodoi at two sites bossou in guinea and ta in ivory coast they either use sticks to dip for ant workers at trails or nests or open nests and take brood and workers with their hands nests are much less conspicuous than those of driver ant species and extremely difficult to find for humans chimpanzees seem to do much better d emeryi is broadly sympatric with d gribodoi and has nearly identical hunting behavior and habitat requirements such that the two species may be easily confused in the field the largest workers of d emeryi are much larger the diagnostic features of the d gribodoi male are its mandible shape the anterior quarter

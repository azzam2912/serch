relative nonlinearity depends on two processes 1 species have to differ in the curvature of their responses to resource density and 2 the patterns of resource variation generated by each species must favor the relative growth of another species in its most basic form one species grows best under equilibrium competitive conditions and another performs better under variable competitive conditions like all coexistence mechanisms relative nonlinearity maintains species diversity by concentrating intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition because resource density can be variable intraspecific competition is the reduction of per capita growth rate under variable resources generated by conspecifics i e individuals of the same species interspecific competition is the reduction of per capita growth rate under variable resources generated by heterospecifics i e individuals of a different species like some other coexistence mechanisms see the storage effect relative nonlinearity can allow coexistence of at least two species on a single resource relative nonlinearity requires that species differ in the curvature of their fitness response formula 1 to some competitive factor f like resource density the nonlinearity of a response to competition is the second derivative of the per capita growth rate with respect to the competitive factor formula 2

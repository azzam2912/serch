it is essentially the same as an optical parametric oscillator but without the optical cavity i e the light beams pass through the apparatus just once or twice rather than many many times optical parametric generation opg also called optical parametric fluorescence or spontaneous parametric down conversion often precedes optical parametric amplification in optical parametric generation the input is one light beam of frequency and the output is two light beams of lower frequencies and with the requirement these two lower frequency beams are called the signal and idler respectively this light emission is based on the nonlinear optical principle the photon of an incident laser pulse pump is by a nonlinear optical crystal divided into two lower energy photons the wavelengths of the signal and the idler are determined by the phase matching condition which is changed e g by temperature or in bulk optics by the angle between the incident pump laser ray and the optical axes of the crystal the wavelengths of the signal and the idler photons can therefore be tuned by changing the phase matching condition the output beams in optical parametric generation are usually relatively weak and have relatively spread out direction and frequency

it consists of four amino acid residues aspartate cysteine glutamate and glycine bonded with four cr centers it interacts with the insulin receptor by prolonging kinase activity through stimulating the tyrosine kinase pathway thus leading to improved glucose absorption and has been confused with glucose tolerance factor the exact mechanisms underlying this process are currently unknown evidence for the existence of this protein comes from the fact that the removal of cr in the blood exceeds the rate of cr formation in the urine this indicates that the transport of cr must involve an intermediate i e chromodulin and that cr is moved from the blood to tissues in response to increased levels of insulin subsequent protein isolations in rats dogs mice and cows have shown the presence of a similar substance suggesting that it is found extensively in mammals this oligopeptide is small having a molecular weight of around 1 500 g mol and the predominant amino acids present are glutamic acid glycine and cysteine despite recent efforts to characterize the exact structure of chromodulin it is still relatively unknown from spectroscopic data it has been shown that cr binds tightly to chromodulin k 10 m and that the

it promised a data density of more than 1 terabit per square inch 1 gigabit per square millimeter which is about the limit of the perpendicular recording hard drives millipede storage technology was pursued as a potential replacement for magnetic recording in hard drives at the same time reducing the form factor to that of flash media ibm demonstrated a prototype millipede storage device at cebit 2005 and was trying to make the technology commercially available by the end of 2007 however because of concurrent advances in competing storage technologies no commercial product has been made available since then the main memory of modern computers is constructed from one of a number of dram related devices dram basically consists of a series of capacitors which store data as the presence or absence of electrical charge each capacitor and its associated control circuitry referred to as a cell holds one bit and bits can be read or written in large blocks at the same time in contrast hard drives store data on a disk that is covered with a magnetic material data is represented as local magnetisation of this material reading and writing are accomplished by a single head which waits

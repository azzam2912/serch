such a specimen would be taken by sampling so as to be representative of any other specimen taken from the source of the specimen when biological specimens are stored ideally they remain equivalent to freshly collected specimens for the purposes of research human biological specimens are stored in a type of biorepository called a biobank and the science of preserving biological specimens is most active in the field of biobanking setting broad standards for quality of biological specimens was initially an underdeveloped aspect of biobank growth there is currently discussion on what standards should be in place and who should manage those standards since many organizations set their own standards and since biobanks are necessarily used by multiple organizations and typically are driven towards expansion the harmonization of standard operating procedures for lab practices are a high priority the procedures have to be evidence based and will change with time as new research and technology becomes available some progress for the creation of policy making organizations include the national cancer institute s 2005 creation of the office of biobanking and biospecimen research obbr and the annual biospecimen research network symposia the international society for biological and environmental repositories international agency

they help for example earthworms to attach to the surface and prevent backsliding during peristaltic motion these hairs make it difficult to pull a worm straight from the ground setae in oligochaetes a group including earthworms are largely composed of chitin they are classified according to the limb to which they are attached for instance notosetae are attached to notopodia neurosetae to neuropodia crustaceans have mechano and chemosensory setae setae are especially present on the mouthparts of crustaceans and can also be found on grooming limbs in some cases setae are modified into scale like structures setae on the legs of krill and other small crustaceans help them to gather phytoplankton it captures them and allows them to be eaten setae on the integument of insects are unicellular meaning that each is formed from a single epidermal cell of a type called a trichogen literally meaning bristle generator they are at first hollow and in most forms remain hollow after they have hardened they grow through and project through a secondary or accessory cell of a type called a tormogen which generates the special flexible membrane that connects the base of the seta to the surrounding integument depending partly on

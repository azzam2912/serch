john storrs hall in 1989 is a hypothetical collection of tiny robots that can replicate a physical structure as such it is a form of self reconfiguring modular robotics hall thought of it as a nanotechnological replacement for car seatbelts the robots would be microscopic with extending arms reaching in several different directions and could perform three dimensional lattice reconfiguration grabbers at the ends of the arms would allow the robots or foglets to mechanically link to one another and share both information and energy enabling them to act as a continuous substance with mechanical and optical properties that could be varied over a wide range each foglet would have substantial computing power and would be able to communicate with its neighbors in the original application as a replacement for seatbelts the swarm of robots would be widely spread out and the arms loose allowing air flow between them in the event of a collision the arms would lock into their current position as if the air around the passengers had abruptly frozen solid the result would be to spread any impact over the entire surface of the passenger s body while the foglets would be micro scale construction of

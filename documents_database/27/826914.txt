it is unrelated to the noise maker or signaling air horn the velocity stack is designed to modern engines universally have tuned intake tract volumes and associated resonance frequencies designed to provide higher than atmospheric intake air pressure while the intake valves are open increasing the density of the trapped air in the combustion chamber higher compression modified engines often have the original air box and associated ducting removed and velocity stacks are installed as accessories modern fuel injection systems with a plenum and single air inlet typically incorporate some sort of radiused entrance designed to improve power based on air flow increases power gains are usually at higher rpm in amateur and professional racing aftermarket velocity stacks are often used as rules allow and gains in the order of 2 to 4 can be obtained when inlet radii and stack lengths are optimized for that engine oem automotive manufacturers have many regulations to adhere to one of these is noise a properly tuned intake tract produces a rather audible intake noise under high airflow conditions that is commonly untuned to allow the vehicle to pass epa and dot noise regulations the length of the stack is known to have

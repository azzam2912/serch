the model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena including the abundance of light elements the cosmic microwave background cmb large scale structure and hubble s law the farther away galaxies are the faster they are moving away from earth if the observed conditions are extrapolated backwards in time using the known laws of physics the prediction is that just before a period of very high density there was a singularity which is typically associated with the big bang current knowledge is insufficient to determine if the singularity was primordial since georges lema tre first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion the scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories the big bang and the steady state theory but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the big bang which is now universally accepted in 1929 from analysis of galactic redshifts edwin hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart this is important observational evidence for an

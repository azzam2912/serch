in general these controllers are often designed at various operating points using linearized models of the system dynamics and are scheduled as a function of a parameter or parameters for operation at intermediate conditions it is an approach for the control of non linear systems that uses a family of linear controllers each of which provides satisfactory control for a different operating point of the system one or more observable variables called the scheduling variables are used to determine the current operating region of the system and to enable the appropriate linear controller for example in case of aircraft control a set of controllers are designed at different gridded locations of corresponding parameters such as aoa mach dynamic pressure cg etc in brief gain scheduling is a control design approach that constructs a nonlinear controller for a nonlinear plant by patching together a collection of linear controllers these linear controllers are blended in real time via switching or interpolation scheduling multivariable controllers can be very tedious and time consuming task a new paradigm is the linear parameter varying lpv techniques which synthesize of automatically scheduled multivariable controller though the approach is simple and the computational burden of linearization scheduling approaches

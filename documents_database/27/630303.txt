the format means that it is not possible to play defensively for a draw when the allotted time runs out and delays due to bad weather will not prevent the match ending with a positive result it also means that there is far less reason for a side to declare an innings since time pressure should not affect the chances of winning the game although the format should guarantee a result it was ultimately abandoned as it was impossible to predict with any certainty when a match would be finished making scheduling and commercial aspects difficult in the modern era teams often play back to back tests in consecutive weeks something that would be impossible without the five day limit there were 99 timeless tests between 1877 and 1939 the last was the fifth test between england and south africa at durban in 1939 which was abandoned as a draw after nine days of play spread over twelve days otherwise the england team would have missed the boat for home this match had started on 3 march south africa had set a target of 696 for england to win by the time england had to leave to catch their boat

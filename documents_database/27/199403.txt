a total coloring is a partitioning of the vertices and edges of the graph into total independent sets some properties of g here g is the maximum degree and ch g the edge choosability total coloring arises naturally since it is simply a mixture of vertex and edge colorings the next step is to look for any brooks typed or vizing typed upper bound on the total chromatic number in terms of maximum degree it turns out that the total coloring version of maximum degree upper bound is a difficult problem and has eluded mathematicians for 40 years a trivial lower bound for the total chromatic number is the increment of the maximum degree that is g 1 if equality occurs it is called a class 1 graph some graphs like cycles of length formula 1 and complete bipartite graphs of the form formula 2 need g 2 colors no graph has been found with total chromatic number greater than g 2 thus leads to the speculation that every graph needs either g 1 or g 2 colors but never more total coloring conjecture behzad vizing apparently the term total coloring and the statement of total coloring conjecture were independently

the ndufb4 protein is a subunit of nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain the ndufb4 gene located on the q arm of chromosome 3 in position 13 33 is 6 130 base pairs long the ndufb4 protein weighs 15 kda and is composed of 129 amino acids ndufb4 is a subunit of the enzyme nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone the largest of the respiratory complexes the structure is l shaped with a long hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the nadh binding site ndufb4 is one of about 31 hydrophobic subunits that form the transmembrane region of complex i and is of the non catalytic subunits of the complex it has been noted that the n terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a c terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of complex i the highly conserved two domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an

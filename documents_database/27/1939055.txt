enphase designs and manufactures software driven home energy solutions that span solar generation home energy storage and web based monitoring and control enphase has shipped about twenty million solar microinverters primarily into the residential and commercial markets in north america europe and australia microinverters convert the direct current power from the solar panel dc directly into grid compatible alternating current ac for use or export enphase was the first company to successfully commercialise the microinverter on a wide scale and remains the market leader enphase energy pioneered the concept of a microinverter the basic idea behind a microinverter is to convert manage and monitor energy per panel rather than the entire array of panels this so reduces the size of the inverter that it can be placed on the back of the panel producing an ac panel such a system can be connected directly to the grid or to each other to produce larger arrays this contrasts with the traditional central inverter approach where many panels are connected together in series on the dc side and then run en masse to a single larger inverter in the aftermath of the 2001 telecoms crash martin fornage of cerent corporation was looking

its protein is expected to localize to the nucleus and bind dna orthologs have been identified in all of the major animal groups minus amphibians and insects tracing as far back as the sea anemone indicating an origin of over 1000 mya highlighting its importance in the animal genome c3orf14 is also known by the aliases loc57415 flj94553 and flj17473 gene orthologs found in other organisms are usually known by the name c3orf14 like though some are known as loc57415 like or ht021 like protein name the mrna is composed of 6 exons and encodes a 15007 84 kd protein known as ht021 this protein has a pre modification isoelectric point of 5 57 and alpha helices span most of its length four sites of possible phosphorylation have been identified and at least two sites of phosphorylation are conserved in all orthologs as are two alpha helices this protein is also predicted as a dna binding protein the protein may assume a tertiary structure of a coiled coil orthologs of this gene has been identified in most animal groups mammals monotremes aves reptiles fish and invertebrates transcripts have not been identified in amphibians or insects however only model organisms have

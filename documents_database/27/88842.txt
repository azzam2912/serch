the genus daspletosaurus contains two species fossils of the earlier type species d torosus have been found in alberta while fossils of the later second species d horneri have been found only in montana a possible third species also from alberta awaits formal identification daspletosaurus sp daspletosaurus is closely related to the much larger and more recent tyrannosaurid tyrannosaurus rex like most tyrannosaurids daspletosaurus was a multi tonne bipedal predator equipped with dozens of large sharp teeth daspletosaurus had the small forelimbs typical of tyrannosaurids although they were proportionately longer than in other genera as an apex predator daspletosaurus was at the top of the food chain probably preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid centrosaurus and the hadrosaur hypacrosaurus in some areas daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid gorgosaurus though there is some evidence of niche differentiation between the two while daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals including social behavior diet and life history while very large by the standard of modern predators daspletosaurus was not the largest tyrannosaurid adults could reach a length of 8 9 meters 26 30 ft from snout to tail mass estimates

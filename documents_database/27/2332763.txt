c16orf82 encodes a 2285 nucleotide mrna transcript which is translated into a 154 amino acid protein using a non aug cug start codon the gene has been shown to be largely expressed in the testis tibial nerve and the pituitary gland although expression has been seen throughout a majority of tissue types the function of c16orf82 is not fully understood by the scientific community c16orf82 is located in humans at locus 16p12 1 on the positive strand the gene encodes for a 2285 nucleotide mrna transcript that is intronless human intronless genes represent a unique subset of the genome that are often involved in signaling sperm formation immune responses or development c16orf82 being such a gene indicates it may play a role in one of these processes translation of c16orf82 initiates at a non aug cug start codon the presence of the non canonical start codon suggests possible increased regulation of c16orf82 translation and or possibly could allow for the translation of protein products that start with leucine instead of methionine as seen in proteins coded for by some genes present in the major histocompatibility complex the c16orf82 promoter region has been predicted to contain a number of transcription factor

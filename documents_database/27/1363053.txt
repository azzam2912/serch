in particular it furnishes the fundamental matrix of a system of linear ordinary differential equations of order with varying coefficients the exponent is aggregated as an infinite series whose terms involve multiple integrals and nested commutators given the coefficient matrix one wishes to solve the initial value problem associated with the linear ordinary differential equation for the unknown dimensional vector function when n 1 the solution simply reads this is still valid for n 1 if the matrix satisfies for any pair of values of t t and t in particular this is the case if the matrix is independent of in the general case however the expression above is no longer the solution of the problem the approach introduced by magnus to solve the matrix initial value problem is to express the solution by means of the exponential of a certain matrix function which is subsequently constructed as a series expansion where for simplicity it is customary to write for and to take t 0 magnus appreciated that since using a poincar hausdorff matrix identity he could relate the time derivative of to the generating function of bernoulli numbers and the adjoint endomorphism of to solve for recursively in

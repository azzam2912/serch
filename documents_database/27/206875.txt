a sheep goat chimera should not be confused with a sheep goat hybrid which can result when a goat mates with a sheep the first sheepgoat chimeras were created by researchers at the institute of animal physiology in cambridge england by combining sheep embryos with goat embryos they reported their results in 1984 the successful chimeras were a mosaic of goat and sheep cells and tissues in a chimera each set of cells germ line keeps its own species identity instead of being intermediate in type between the parental species because the chimera contains cells from at least two genetically different embryos and each of these arose by fertilization of an egg by a sperm cell it has at least four genetic parents in contrast a hybrid has only two although the individual cells in interspecies chimeras are entirely of one of the component species their behaviour is influenced by the environment in which they find themselves the sheep goat chimeras have yielded several demonstrations of this the most obvious was that the woolly areas of their fleece tufts of goat wool angora type grew intermingled with ordinary sheep wool even though the goat breed used in the experiments did

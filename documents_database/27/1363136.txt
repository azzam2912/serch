the company is funded by a variety of investors the fusion device under development injects plasma in the form of a compact toroid into a hollow cylinder which is then compressed to fusion relevant densities and pressures in contrast to most mtf systems which use magnets to compress the plasma the general fusion design instead uses a large number of steam driven pistons to mechanically compress a vortex of liquid metal general fusion was developing subsystems for use in a prototype to be built in three to five years in 2018 the company published several papers on a new design using a spherical tokamak as the plasma source as opposed to the compact toroid it is not clear in existing references whether this represents a major change of the original concept as of 2016 general fusion has 65 employees and has raised over c 150 million in funding from a global syndicate of investors the company was founded in 2002 by former creo products senior physicist and principal engineer dr michel laberge who completed his ph d in fusion physics at the university of british columbia in 1990 the company is led by a management team consisting of christofer m

the name taicatoxin taipan calcium toxin is derived from its natural source the taipan snake the site of its action calcium channels and from its function as a toxin taicatoxin was isolated from the venom of australian taipan snake oxyuranus scutellatus scutellatus tcx is a secreted protein produced in the venom gland of the snake through sds page analysis tcx was determined to be a complex held together by non covalent forces of the following three polypeptides in a stoichiometry of 1 1 4 respectively the active complex was isolated by ion exchange chromatography through de cellulose and two steps of cm cellulose chromatography at ph 4 7 and ph 6 0 respectively it migrates in beta alanine acetate urea gel electrophoresis as a single compound the phospholipase activity can be separated by affinity chromatography using a phospholipid analog pc sepharose the alpha neurotoxin like peptide can be separated from the protease inhibitor sephadex g 50 gel filtration chromatography can be used in the presence of high salt 1m nacl and alkaline conditions ph 8 2 the amino sequence of the protease inhibitor was determined by using the automatic edman degradation method taicatoxin acts on the voltage dependent l type

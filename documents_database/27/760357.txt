as a result rocks that are otherwise similar but are now separated by a valley or other erosional feature can be assumed to be originally continuous layers of sediment do not extend indefinitely rather the limits can be recognized and are controlled by the amount and type of sediment available and the size and shape of the sedimentary basin as long as sediment is transported to an area it will eventually be deposited however as the amount of material lessens away from the source the layer of that material will become thinner often coarser grained material can no longer be transported to an area because the transporting medium has insufficient energy to carry it to that location in its place the particles that settle from the transporting medium will be finer grained and there will be a lateral transition from coarser to finer grained material the lateral variation in sediment within a stratum is known as sedimentary facies if sufficient sedimentary material is available it will be deposited up to the limits of the sedimentary basin often the sedimentary basin is within rocks that are very different from the sediments that are being deposited in those cases the lateral limits

together with hydrogen they comprise group 1 which lies in the s block of the periodic table all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s orbital this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties indeed the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting well characterised homologous behaviour this family of elements is also known as the lithium family after its leading element the alkali metals are all shiny soft highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge 1 they can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen and in the case of lithium nitrogen because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements caesium the fifth alkali metal is the most reactive of all the metals all the alkali metals react with water with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously

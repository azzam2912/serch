state of washington completed by the united states army corps of engineers in 1989 it is meant to prevent sediment from the 1980 eruption of mount st helens from increasing flood risks along the toutle and cowlitz rivers the corps initially expected the basin behind the dam to be filled by 2035 with 258 million cubic yards 197 million m of sediment however additional debris flows from mount st helens plus sediment from storm related riverbank failures quickly filled the basin it was nearly full by 2012 and large amounts of sediment overflowed the srs and continued downstream in july 2012 the corps awarded a 4 5 million contract to lke corporation of washougal to raise the spillway by in 2013 the contractor raised the dam s spillway by to increase the ability of the srs to trap sediment the higher spillway reduces the slope of the sediment plain behind the dam thus allowing more debris to accumulate on top of existing debris the corps estimated that the higher spillway would maintain the trapping efficiency of the srs at or above 31 percent the fraction being trapped without the higher spillway for 5 to 10 years after completion of the

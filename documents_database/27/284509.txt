in this position the crater is seen from on edge from the earth and its visibility is affected by libration this situation makes it difficult to discern much detail about the crater unless it is viewed from orbit at one time this crater was considered to have formed due to volcanic activity in contrast to most lunar craters which are considered to have been created through impacts however it is more likely that the crater was formed by an impact against a surface that was still partly molten this has left the crater with a sharp edged circular rim and a flat dark hued interior floor indeed the albedo of the interior floor matches that of the lunar mare to the west the southeast part of the floor is fractured with a series of narrow rilles the floor along the northwest and northeast edges is more rugged and these sections have escaped the lava that covered the remainder of the floor by convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to kopff the following craters have been renamed by the iau

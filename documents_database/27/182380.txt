this contrasts with the faster fixed precision arithmetic found in most arithmetic logic unit alu hardware which typically offers between 8 and 64 bits of precision several modern programming languages have built in support for bignums and others have libraries available for arbitrary precision integer and floating point math rather than store values as a fixed number of binary bits related to the size of the processor register these implementations typically use variable length arrays of digits arbitrary precision is used in applications where the speed of arithmetic is not a limiting factor or where precise results with very large numbers are required it should not be confused with the symbolic computation provided by many computer algebra systems which represent numbers by expressions such as and can thus represent any computable number with infinite precision a common application is public key cryptography whose algorithms commonly employ arithmetic with integers having hundreds of digits another is in situations where artificial limits and overflows would be inappropriate it is also useful for checking the results of fixed precision calculations and for determining optimal or near optimal values for coefficients needed in formulae for example the that appears in gaussian integration arbitrary precision

the project is being developed by solarreserve and is scheduled to reach commercial operation in 2019 the copiap project will comprise two 120 megawatt mw 130 mw gross solar thermal towers with up to 14 hours thermal storage combined with 150 mw of pv the hybrid project will deliver over 1 700 gigawatt hours gw h annually as non intermittent baseload power 24 hours a day the project uses heliostat mirrors that collect and focus the sun s thermal energy to heat molten salt flowing through a solar power tower the molten salt circulates from the tower to a storage tank where it is then used to produce steam and generate electricity excess thermal energy is stored in the molten salt and can be used to generate power for up to fourteen hours including during the evening hours and when direct sunlight is not available the project s solar tower component technology is based on the solarreserve crescent dunes solar energy project in the us the project is expected to cost 2 billion the copiap solar project was submitted to a full environmental assessment under the chilean system of environmental impact assessment seia administered by the department of environmental assessment

ond is related to all carbon bicycle norbornadiene while unsubstituted ond is known the most useful ond derivatives are dialkyl ond 2 3 dicarboxylates readily obtainable by a diels alder cycloaddition between furans and acetylenedicarboxylates such as dmad ond 2 3 dicarboxylates thereafter referred to as ond display unusually high reactivity towards azides and thiols ond thiol adducts are prone to retro diels alder fragmentation which occurs with widely variable rates onds react with azides to yield a mixture of four products arising from initial 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition onto either of the two olefins followed by retro diels alder cycloreversion to form 1 2 3 triazoles and furans the intermediate triazolines avoid detection because of a very strong thermodynamic drive to collapse into two aromatic products the relative preference of attack on either double bond is governed by the electronic nature of the azides electron rich aliphatic azides e g benzyl azide react preferentially via their homo orbital interaction of the azide homo with lumo orbital of the ond localized on the electron poor c 2 and c 3 leads the products consistent with path a electron poor aryl azides such as p nitrophenyl azide react to a significant

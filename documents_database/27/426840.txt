one of the two categories of movement disorders hypokinesia is characterized by a partial or complete loss of muscle movement due to a disruption in the basal ganglia patients with hypokinetic disorders like parkinson s disease experience muscle rigidity and an inability to produce movement it is also associated with mental health disorders and prolonged inactivity due to illness amongst other diseases the other category of movement disorder resulting from damage to the basal ganglia hyperkinesia features an exaggeration of unwanted motion like twitching or writhing in huntington s disease or tourette syndrome hypokinesia describes a variety of more specific disorders dopamine the main neurotransmitter thought to be involved in hypokinesia is dopamine essential to the basal ganglionic thalamocortical loop which processes motor function dopamine depletion is common in these areas of hypokinesic patients bradykinesia is correlated with lateralized dopaminergic depletion in the substantia nigra the dopamine pathway in the substantia nigra is essential to motor function and commonly a lesion in this area correlates with displayed hypokinesia tremor and rigidity however seem to be only partially due to dopamine deficits in the substantia nigra suggesting other processes are involved in motor control treatments for hypokinesia often either attempt to

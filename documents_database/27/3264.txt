descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics or inductive statistics in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent this generally means that descriptive statistics unlike inferential statistics is not developed on the basis of probability theory and are frequently nonparametric statistics even when a data analysis draws its main conclusions using inferential statistics descriptive statistics are generally also presented for example in papers reporting on human subjects typically a table is included giving the overall sample size sample sizes in important subgroups e g for each treatment or exposure group and demographic or clinical characteristics such as the average age the proportion of subjects of each sex the proportion of subjects with related comorbidities etc some measures that are commonly used to describe a data set are measures of central tendency and measures of variability or dispersion measures of central tendency include the mean median and mode while measures of variability include the standard deviation or variance the minimum and maximum values of the variables kurtosis and skewness descriptive statistics provide simple summaries about the sample and about the observations

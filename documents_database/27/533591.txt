it ranges from costa rica southward to argentina it has around 30 species some phyllomedusa species produce a waxy secretion that reduces the evaporative water loss of their bodies if they begin to dry out they move their limbs over their backs where the secretory glands are and spread the lipid secretion over their entire skin some indigenous groups from south america use the secretions of phyllomedusa bicolor the giant leaf frog in shamanic hunting practices the substance is said to intoxicate the hunters who ingest it causing them to temporarily improve their sensorial capacities in this genus of tree frogs eggs are deposited on a leaf surface interspersed with hydrating jelly capsules during the mating process the frogs fold the leaf around their batch of eggs using their limbs with a jelly plug at the bottom of the folded leaf to prevent the eggs from falling out at hatching the jelly plug is liquified and the tadpoles drop through the previously plugged hole these nests are made above water so the tadpoles drop into a suitable habitat where they begin their lives as filter feeders two species the waxy monkey tree frog phyllomedusa sauvagii and the tiger legged monkey

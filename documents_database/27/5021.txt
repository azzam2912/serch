elemental gallium is a soft silvery blue metal at standard temperature and pressure however in its liquid state it becomes silvery white if too much force is applied the gallium may fracture conchoidally it is in group 13 of the periodic table and thus has similarities to the other metals of the group aluminium indium and thallium gallium does not occur as a free element in nature but as gallium iii compounds in trace amounts in zinc ores and in bauxite elemental gallium is a liquid at temperatures greater than above room temperature but below the normal human body temperature of hence the metal will melt in a person s hands the melting point of gallium is used as a temperature reference point gallium alloys are used in thermometers as a non toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to mercury and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury an even lower melting point of well below the freezing point of water is claimed for the alloy galinstan 62 95 gallium 5 22 indium and 0 16 tin by weight but that may be the freezing point with the effect of supercooling since its discovery in 1875 gallium has been used to make

this number is at most 2 n since if 2 n 1 points are placed in the grid then by the pigeonhole principle some row and some column will contain three points the problem was introduced by henry dudeney in 1917 although the problem can be solved with 2 n points for every n up to 46 it is conjectured that fewer than 2 n points are possible for sufficiently large values of n the best solutions that are known to work for arbitrarily large values of n place slightly fewer than 3 n 2 points paul erd s in observed that when n is a prime number the set of n grid points i i mod n for 0 i hyperbola xy k mod n 2 where k may be chosen arbitrarily as long as it is nonzero mod n 2 again for arbitrary n one can perform this construction for a prime near n 2 to obtain a solution with points conjectured that for large n one cannot do better than c n with which if corrected results in the heilbronn triangle problem asks for the placement of n points in a unit square that maximizes the area

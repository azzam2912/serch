there they synapse with interneurons which in turn excite or inhibit alpha motor neurons to the muscles of the contralateral limb in the ipsilateral leg the one which steps on the nail the flexors contract and the extensors relax to lift the leg from the ground on the contralateral side the one that bears all the weight the flexors relax and the extensors contract to stiffen the leg since it must suddenly support the entire weight of the body at the same time signals travel up the spinal cord and cause contraction of the contralateral muscles of the hip and abdomen to shift the body s center of gravity over the extended leg to a large extent the coordination of all these muscles and maintenance of equilibrium is mediated by the cerebellum and cerebral cortex

disruptions in these signaling pathways often have implications in the formation of a variety of cancers by definition as a proto oncogene fyn codes for proteins that help regulate cell growth changes in its dna sequence transform it into an oncogene that leads to the formation of a different protein with implications for normal cell regulation fyn is a member of the protein tyrosine kinase oncogene family it encodes a membrane associated tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in the control of cell growth the protein associates with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and interacts with the fyn binding protein alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms exist fyn is a member of the src family of kinases sfk the first proto oncogene to be identified the discovery of the src family in 1976 led to the nobel prize for medicine in 1989 for j m bishop and e m varmus fyn was first identified in 1986 as syn or slk through probes derived from v yes and v fgr a common feature of sfks is that they are commonly upregulated in cancers fyn is functionally distinct from its family members in that it interacts with fak and

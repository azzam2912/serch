the mechanical signals can be forces pressures pull push and shear designating the forces pressures that push pull or are tangential if we generalize we will speak of stress field and stress tensor a cancerous tumor or solid tumor in the jargon of oncologists to differentiate them from hematological malignancies is an organ consisting of two tissues in the center the cancerous tumor proper and around the extracellular matrix ecm sometimes called stroma chorion or connective tissue the concept of connective tissue is interesting because it defines a tissue that travels the entire organism except the brain and is a preferred transmitter of mechanical signals but for the cancer organ isolated from this connective system we prefer the term ecm the cancerous tissue is derived from a normal tissue of the body breast cancer arises from a cancerous transformation of the normal mammary glandular tissue it looks more or less like the original tissue it is said that it is more or less differentiated poorly differentiated it has a microscopic appearance that is far from normal tissue and is then poorly prognostic will make more metastases and will be more difficult to treat we are only considering cancers derived from

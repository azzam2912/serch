edge is considered a pre 3g radio technology and is part of itu s 3g definition edge was deployed on gsm networks beginning in 2003 initially by cingular now at t in the united states edge is standardized also by 3gpp as part of the gsm family a variant so called compact edge was developed for use in a portion of digital amps network spectrum through the introduction of sophisticated methods of coding and transmitting data edge delivers higher bit rates per radio channel resulting in a threefold increase in capacity and performance compared with an ordinary gsm gprs connection edge can be used for any packet switched application such as an internet connection evolved edge continues in release 7 of the 3gpp standard providing reduced latency and more than doubled performance e g to complement high speed packet access hspa peak bit rates of up to 1 mbit s and typical bit rates of 400 kbit s can be expected edge egprs is implemented as a bolt on enhancement for 2 5g gsm gprs networks making it easier for existing gsm carriers to upgrade to it edge is a superset to gprs and can function on any network with

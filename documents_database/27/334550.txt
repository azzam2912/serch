plants have both stress induced and age related developmental aging chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence reveals the carotenoids and is the cause of autumn leaf color in deciduous trees leaf senescence has the important function of recycling nutrients mostly nitrogen to growing and storage organs of the plant unlike animals plants continually form new organs and older organs undergo a highly regulated senescence program to maximize nutrient export programmed senescence seems to be heavily influenced by plant hormones the hormones abscisic acid ethylene jasmonic acid and salicylic acid are accepted by most scientists as promoters of senescence but at least one source lists gibberellins brassinosteroids and strigolactone as also being involved cytokinins help to maintain the plant cell and expression of cytokinin biosynthesis genes late in development prevents leaf senescence a withdrawal of or inability of the cell to perceive cytokinin may cause it to undergo apoptosis or senescence in addition mutants that cannot perceive ethylene show delayed senescence genome wide comparison of mrnas expressed during dark induced senescence versus those expressed during age related developmental senescence demonstrate that jasmonic acid and ethylene are more important for dark induced stress related senescence while salicylic acid is more important for developmental

since the ribbon formula 6 has edges formula 3 and formula 8 the twist or total twist number formula 9 measures the average winding of the curve formula 10 around and along the curve formula 3 according to love 1944 twist is defined by where formula 13 is the unit tangent vector to formula 3 the total twist number formula 9 can be decomposed moffatt ricca 1992 into normalized total torsion formula 16 and intrinsic twist formula 17 as where formula 19 is the torsion of the space curve formula 3 and formula 21 denotes the total rotation angle of formula 22 along formula 3 neither formula 24 nor formula 9 are independent of the ribbon field formula 22 instead only the normalized torsion formula 27 is an invariant of the curve formula 3 banchoff white 1975 when the ribbon is deformed so as to pass through an inflectional state i e formula 3 has a point of inflection torsion becomes singular but its singularity is integrable moffatt ricca 1992 and formula 9 remains continuous this behavior has many important consequences for energy considerations in many fields of science together with the writhe formula 31 of formula 3 twist is

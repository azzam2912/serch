the large number of combinations available from a small number of keys allows text or commands to be entered with one hand leaving the other hand free a secondary advantage is that it can be built into a device such as a pocket sized computer or a bicycle handlebar that is too small to contain a normal sized keyboard a chorded keyboard minus the board typically designed to be used while held in the hand is called a keyer douglas engelbart introduced the chorded keyset as a computer interface in 1968 at what is often called the mother of all demos each key is mapped to a number and then can be mapped to a corresponding letter or command by pressing two or more keys together the user can generate many combinations in engelbart s original mapping he used five keys 1 2 4 8 16 the keys were mapped as follows a 1 b 2 c 3 d 4 and so on if the user pressed keys 1 2 3 simultaneously and then released the keys the letter c appeared unlike pressing a chord on a piano the chord is recognized only after all the keys or mouse buttons

most members of this genus are commonly known as picnic beetles or beer bugs glischrochilus are oblong shiny black beetles with attractive yellow red or orange markings on their elytra their elytra are short and expose the upper surface of their last abdominal segment s a good way to distinguish them from the superficially similar but generally larger megalodacne beetles they are so similar that some species of glischrochilus were once classified along with megalodacne under the now reclassified genus ips like other nitulidid beetles adult glischrochilus can be distinguished from other kinds of sap feeding beetles by their characteristic 11 segmented antennae that end with a 3 segmented ball like club glischrochilus are among the largest of the nitulidid beetles but they are still generally smaller in comparison to other beetles averaging at only in length with larger specimens at long glischrochilus eggs are sausage shaped and milky white eggs are laid during spring near decaying plant matter larvae are about long and feed for three weeks on fermenting juices and then pupate it takes a little over a month for picnic beetles to develop from egg to adult and only one generation is produced each year glischrochilus beetles

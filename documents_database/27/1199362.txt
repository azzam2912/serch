this process can be made by means of matched male and female roller dies or by passing sheet or a strip of metal between rolls of the desired pattern it is often combined with foil stamping to create a shiny 3d effect the metal sheet embossing operation is commonly accomplished with a combination of heat and pressure on the sheet metal depending on what type of embossing is required theoretically with any of these procedures the metal thickness is changed in its composition metal sheet is drawn through the male and female roller dies producing a pattern or design on the metal sheet depending on the roller dies used different patterns can be produced on the metal sheet the pressure and a combination of heat actually irons while raising the level of the image higher than the substrate to make it smooth the term impressing refers to an image lowered into the surface of a material in distinction to an image raised out of the surface of a material in most of the pressure embossing operation machines the upper roll blocks are stationary while the bottom roll blocks are movable the pressure with which the bottom roll is raised is

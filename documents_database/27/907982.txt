in bone skin and connective tissues that is broken down into iminodipeptides at the end of its lifecycle of these dipeptides those containing c terminal proline or hydroxyproline would normally be broken down further by the enzyme prolidase recovering and thus recycling the constituent amino acids due to a genetic defect prolidase activity in individuals with pd is either knocked out or severely reduced those affected therefore eliminate excessive amounts of iminodipeptides in their urine wasting this precious resource with debilitating effects prolidase deficiency generally becomes evident during infancy but initial symptoms can first manifest anytime from birth to young adulthood the condition results in a very diverse set symptoms the severity of which can vary significantly between patients depending on the degree to which prolidase activity is hampered by the individual underlying mutation s in each case it is even possible though rare for affected individuals to be asymptomatic in which case the disorder can only be identified through laboratory screening of the prospective patient and or their extended family one of the signature features of pd is the elimination of high quantities of peptides through urine in addition most of those affected exhibit persistent skin lesions starting from

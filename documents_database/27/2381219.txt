furthermore we also have where is the gamma function the hurwitz and riemann zeta functions may be expanded into these polynomials as follows and and also the bernoulli polynomials of the second kind are also involved in the following relationship between the zeta functions as well as in various formulas for the stieltjes constants e g and which are both valid for formula 24 and formula 25

the system is required because various industrial process plants uses heat exchanger and also for active fire protection measures in chemical plants for example in caustic soda production water is needed in bulk quantity for preparation of brine the circulating water system in any plant consists of a circulator pump which develops an appropriate hydraulic head and pipelines to circulate the water in the entire plant circulating water systems are normally of the wet pit type but for sea water circulation both the wet pit type and the concrete volute type are employed in some industries one or two stand by pumps are also connected parallel to cw pumps it is recommended that these pumps must be constantly driven by constant speed squirrel cage induction motors cw pumps are designed as per is 9137 standards of the hydraulic institute usa or equivalent in the present era mechanical induced draft type cooling towers are employed in cooling of water performance testing of cooling towers both idct and ndct shall be carried out as per atc 105 at a time when the atmospheric conditions are within the permissible limits of deviation from the design conditions as guidelines of central electricity authority two

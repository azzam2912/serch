nigeria suffers heavy traffic circulation problems and this day was no exception with a large traffic jam covering all lanes of the road and numerous pedestrians weaving in between them a large petrol tanker bringing fuel to ifan was travelling on the same road at high speed when it suddenly encountered the traffic jam and attempted to come to a halt at this point the poorly maintained vehicle suffered a total brake failure and ploughed straight into the queue of cars ahead the numbers killed in the initial collision were probably high but they will never be known because the tanker which had finally come to rest on its side had begun to leak its highly flammable load onto the roadway within seconds this trail was alight and the tanker disappeared in an enormous fireball which rose above the city and devastated a wide area around the accident scene those still in their cars trapped in the crash wreckage or standing too close were immolated instantly while those further away were burnt to death or hit by flying shrapnel from the blast burning wreckage caused several small fires in nearby suburbs estimates of casualties in the disaster remain imprecise the

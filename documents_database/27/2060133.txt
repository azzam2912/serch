gram negative bacteria serve as the natural host with transmission achieved through passive diffusion there are currently twelve species in this genus including the type species escherichia virus t4 the following list is a map of t4virus species according to ictv master species list msl 2018a v1 group dsdna t4virus species are nonenveloped with a head and tail the head is a prolate spheroid approximately 120 nm in length and 86 nm in width with an elongated icosahedral symmetry t 13 q 21 composed of 152 total capsomers the tail has six long terminal fibers six short spikes and a small base plate the tail is enclosed in a sheath which loosens and slides around the tail core upon contraction genomes are linear around 169kb in length the genome codes for 300 proteins twelve of the fourteen species have been fully sequenced and are available from ictv they range between 159k and 235k nucleotides with 242 to 292 proteins the complete genomes are available from the national center for biotechnology information along with the complete genomes for dozens of other similar unclassified virus strains viral replication is cytoplasmic the virus attaches to the host cell using its terminal fibers and

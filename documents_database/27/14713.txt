the term counterfactual definiteness is used in discussions of physics calculations especially those related to the phenomenon called quantum entanglement and those related to the bell inequalities in such discussions meaningfully means the ability to treat these unmeasured results on an equal footing with measured results in statistical calculations it is this sometimes assumed but unstated aspect of counterfactual definiteness that is of direct relevance to physics and mathematical models of physical systems and not philosophical concerns regarding the meaning of unmeasured results counterfactual may appear in physics discussions as a noun what is meant in this context is a value that could have been measured but for one reason or another was not the subject of counterfactual definiteness receives attention in the study of quantum mechanics because it is argued that when challenged by the findings of quantum mechanics classical physics must give up its claim to one of three assumptions locality no spooky action at a distance counterfactual definiteness or non contextuality and no conspiracy called also asymmetry of time if physics gives up the claim to locality it brings into question our ordinary ideas about causality and suggests that events may transpire at faster than light speeds

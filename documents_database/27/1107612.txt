calcrl is linked to one of three single transmembrane domain receptor activity modifying proteins ramps that are essential for functional activity the association of calcrl with different ramp proteins produces different receptors these receptors are linked to the g protein g which activates adenylate cyclase and activation results in the generation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp cgrp receptors are found throughout the body suggesting that the protein may modulate a variety of physiological functions in all major systems e g respiratory endocrine gastrointestinal immune and cardiovascular in wounds cgrp receptors found in nerve cells deactivate the immune system to prevent collateral damage in case of a clean wound common case however when a wily pathogen such as those causing necrotizing fasciitis are involved this is the wrong response in very preliminary research nerve blockers like e g lidocaine or botox have been demonstrated to block cgrp cascade thereby allowing immune system involvement and control of pathogens resulting in complete control and recovery calcrl associated with ramp1 produces the cgrp receptor which is a trans membrane protein receptor that is made up of four chains two of the four chains contain unique sequences it is a heterodimer protein composed of

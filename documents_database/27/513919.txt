the opteron cpus feature a cache coherent hypertransport ccht bus to permit glueless multiprocessor interconnect between physical cpu packages but as there is a maximum of three ccht interfaces per chip the systems are limited to a maximum of 8 sockets the hypertransport bus is also distance restricted and does not permit off system interconnect the horus system overcomes these limitations by creating a pseudo opteron the horus chip which connects to four real opterons via the hypertransport bus as far as the opterons are concerned they are in a five way system and this is the basic horus node as called quad the horus chip then provides an additional off board interface based on the infiniband standards which can link to additional horus nodes up to 8 the chip handles the necessary translation between local and off board ccht communications by building the cpus around the horus chip with 12 bit lanes running at 3125 mhz with infiniband technology 8b 10b encoding this system has an effective internal speed of 30 gbit s with 8 quads connected together each with the maximum of four opteron sockets per node the horus system allows a total of 32 cpu sockets in

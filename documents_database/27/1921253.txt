the plasma diffusion may be classified by the classical diffusion of b scaling the bohm diffusion conjectured to follow the b scaling and the hsu diffusion of b scaling here b is the external magnetic field the low frequency fluctuating electric fields can cause particles to execute the exb drift due to the long range nature of coulomb interaction the electric field coherence time is long enough to allow virtually free streaming of particles across the field lines thus when no other decoherence mechanism exists the transport would be the only mechanism to limit the run of its own course and to result in the bohm diffusion of 1 b scaling in a 2d like plasma in a 3d plasma the parallel decoherence the decoherence along the field line is significant enough to reduce the transport of exb drifts to only the classical diffusion there are however cyclotron harmonics that can cause resonance diffusion in the velocity space leading to an unbounded larmor radius enlargement and particle diffusion hsu wu agarwal and ryu in 2013 proposed this effective diffusion mechanism by the combined effects from the exb drift and the cyclotron resonance since the cyclotron harmonic is in tune with

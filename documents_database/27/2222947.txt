it is particularly suited for applications in stochastic programming and asymptotic statistics a map formula 1 between banach spaces formula 2 and formula 3 is hadamard directionally differentiable at formula 4 in the direction formula 5 if there exists a map formula 6 such thatformula 7 for all sequences formula 8 and formula 9 note that this definition does not require continuity or linearity of the derivative with respect to the direction formula 10 although continuity follows automatically from the definition linearity does not a version of functional delta method holds for hadamard directionally differentiable maps namely let formula 11 be a sequence of random elements in a banach space formula 2 equipped with borel sigma field such that weak convergence formula 13 holds for some formula 14 some sequence of real numbers formula 15 and some random element formula 16 with values concentrated on a separable subset of formula 2 then for a measurable map formula 18 that is hadamard directionally differentiable at formula 19 we have formula 20 where the weak convergence is with respect to borel sigma field on the banach space formula 3 this result has applications in optimal inference for wide range of econometric models

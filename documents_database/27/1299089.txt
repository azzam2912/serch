at these conditions the adsorbate s partial pressure formula 1 is related to the volume of it adsorbed onto a solid adsorbent the adsorbent as indicated in the figure is assumed to be an ideal solid surface composed of series of distinct sites capable of binding the adsorbate the adsorbate binding is treated as a chemical reaction between the adsorbate molecule formula 2 and an empty site this reaction yields an adsorbed complex formula 3 with an associated equilibrium constant formula 4 from these assumptions the langmuir isotherm can be derived see below which states that where formula 6 is the fractional occupancy of the adsorption sites and formula 7 is the volume of the monolayer a continuous monolayer of adsorbate molecules surrounding a homogeneous solid surface is the conceptual basis for this adsorption model in 1916 irving langmuir presented his model for the adsorption of species onto simple surfaces langmuir was awarded the nobel prize in 1932 for his work concerning surface chemistry he hypothesized that a given surface has a certain number of equivalent sites to which a species can stick either by physisorption or chemisorption his theory began when he postulated that gaseous molecules do not rebound

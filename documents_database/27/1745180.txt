previously dr smith was professor of molecular and cellular physiology at the stanford university school of medicine in 1990 smith published an article in the journal science which proposed that certain glial cells in the human brain known as astrocytes would be able to communicate through chemical signals rather than electrical by utilizing the neurotransmitter glutamate he was able to show that these cells which had once been perceived as inert tissue between neurons in fact were actively communicating with the rest of the brain this discovery showed that astrocytes likely play an important role in learning and memory since smith s discovery astrocytes have become an increasingly important part of neural research smith has also been a primary leader in the development of array tomography at a proteomic imaging method of volumetric microscopy in which ultrathin sections of a plastic embedded tissue are sliced using an ultramicrotome bonded in an ordered array to a glass coverslip stained and imaged the public methodology for this technique was introduced in a 2007 article in the scientific journal neuron journal with kristina micheva and was expanded upon in a 2010 article also in neuron journal with micheva brad busse nicolas weiler and

it expresses the fact that a holomorphic function defined on a disk is completely determined by its values on the boundary of the disk and it provides integral formulas for all derivatives of a holomorphic function cauchy s formula shows that in complex analysis differentiation is equivalent to integration complex differentiation like integration behaves well under uniform limits a result denied in real analysis let be an open subset of the complex plane and suppose the closed disk defined as is completely contained in let be a holomorphic function and let be the circle oriented counterclockwise forming the boundary of then for every in the interior of the proof of this statement uses the cauchy integral theorem and like that theorem it only requires to be complex differentiable since the reciprocal of the denominator of the integrand in cauchy s integral formula can be expanded as a power series in the variable namely when it follows that holomorphic functions are analytic in particular is actually infinitely differentiable with this formula is sometimes referred to as cauchy s differentiation formula the theorem stated above can be generalized the circle can be replaced by any closed rectifiable curve in which has winding

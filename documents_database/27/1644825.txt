in the donor cell a repressor protein encoded by the prophage viral dna keeps the viral genes turned off so that virus is not produced when dna is transferred to the recipient cell by conjugation the viral genes in the transferred dna are immediately turned on because the recipient cell lacks the repressor as a result lots of virus is made in the recipient cell and lysis eventually occurs to release the new virus zygotic induction was discovered by lie wollman and fran ois jacob in 1954 historically zygotic induction provided insight into the nature of bacterial conjugation it also contributed to the development of the early repression model of gene regulation that explained how the lac operon and bacteriophage genes are negatively regulated in 1947 joshua lederberg and edward tatum discovered that nutritional mutants of the bacterium e coli when incubated in mixed cultures exchanged genetic markers to generate new recombinants although the mating efficiency was inefficient later experiments with e coli strains that mated at a high frequency which were called hfr high frequency of recombinants revealed how genetic markers were transferred lie wollman and fran ois jacob showed that genes were transferred in a certain order from

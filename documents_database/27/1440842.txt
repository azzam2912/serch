the species has a worldwide distribution microsporum canis reproduces by means of two conidial forms large spindle shaped multicelled macroconidia and small single celled microconidia first records of m canis date to 1902 evolutionary studies have established that m canis like the very closely related sibling species m distortum and m equinum is a genetic clone derived from the sexually reproducing species arthroderma otae members of ascomycota often possess conspicuous asexual and sexual forms that can coexist in time and space microsporum canis exemplifies a common situation in ascomycetous fungi in which over time one mating type strain has undergone habitat divergence from the other and established a self sustaining reproductive population that consists only of the asexual form it is hypothesized that asexual lineage of microsporum canis evolved as a result of host specific interactions changes in ecological niche as well as geographic isolation of and mating types of arthroderma otae hence making it difficult to sustain sexual reproduction early domestication of animals such as cats and dogs in africa led to a later evolution of host specific fungus microsporum canis which is commonly associated with loose fur animals nearly all reported isolates of microsporum canis represent the mating

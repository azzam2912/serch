in other words the iqr is the first quartile subtracted from the third quartile these quartiles can be clearly seen on a box plot on the data it is a trimmed estimator defined as the 25 trimmed range and is a commonly used robust measure of scale the iqr is a measure of variability based on dividing a data set into quartiles quartiles divide a rank ordered data set into four equal parts the values that separate parts are called the first second and third quartiles and they are denoted by q1 q2 and q3 respectively unlike total range the interquartile range has a breakdown point of 25 and is thus often preferred to the total range the iqr is used to build box plots simple graphical representations of a probability distribution the iqr is used in businesses as a marker for their income rates for a symmetric distribution where the median equals the midhinge the average of the first and third quartiles half the iqr equals the median absolute deviation mad the median is the corresponding measure of central tendency the iqr can be used to identify outliers see below the iqr of a set of values is calculated

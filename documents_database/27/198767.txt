molecules are transported across the stratum corneum by electrophoresis and electroosmosis and the electric field can also increase the permeability of the skin these phenomena directly and indirectly constitute active transport of matter due to an applied electric current the transport is measured in units of chemical flux commonly mol cm hour iontophoresis has experimental therapeutic and diagnostic applications iontophoresis is useful in laboratory experiments especially in neuropharmacology transmitter molecules naturally pass signals between neurons by microelectrophoretic techniques including microiontophoresis neurotransmitters and other chemical agents can be artificially administered very near living and naturally functioning neurons the activity of which can be simultaneously recorded this is used to elucidate their pharmacological properties and natural roles therapeutically electromotive drug administration emda delivers a medicine or other chemical through the skin in a manner of speaking it is an injection without a needle and may be described as non invasive it is different from dermal patches which do not rely on an electric field it drives a charged substance usually a medication or bioactive agent transdermally by repulsive electromotive force through the skin a small electric current is applied to an iontophoretic chamber placed on the skin containing a charged active agent

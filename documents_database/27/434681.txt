it can be performed with a number of different combinations of r groups which include methyl methoxy ethyl propyl and h substituents there is also a solid state variation in which the reaction takes place on a highly cross linked polymer scaffold the synthesis is particularly interesting because indoles are the foundation for a number of biochemically important molecules including neurotransmitters and a new class of antitumor compounds the mechanism of a nenitzescu reaction consists of a michael addition followed by a nucleophilic attack by the enamine pi bond and then an elimination the reaction was first published by nenitzescu in 1929 and has since been refined by allen et al in his 1966 publication allen and coworkers investigated the effects that different substituents on the benzoquinone starting material had on the arrangement of the final product these steric effects also gave evidence that one of the two current proposed mechanisms was more likely than the other which led to the publication of the mechanism shown above a preliminary study conducted by katkevica et al investigated the reaction conditions for a nenitzescu synthesis and reported on the behavior of the reaction when it takes place in various solvents their results

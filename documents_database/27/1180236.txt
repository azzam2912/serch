sediments and sedimentary rocks are characterized by bedding which occurs when layers of sediment with different particle sizes are deposited on top of each other these beds range from millimeters to centimeters thick and can even go to meters or multiple meters thick sedimentary structures such as cross bedding graded bedding and ripple marks are utilized in stratigraphic studies to indicate original position of strata in geologically complex terrains and understand the depositional environment of the sediment there are two kinds of flow structures bidirectional multiple directions back and forth and unidirectional flow regimes in single direction typically fluvial flow which at varying speeds and velocities produce different structures are called bedforms in the lower flow regime the natural progression is from a flat bed to some sediment movement saltation etc to ripples to slightly larger dunes dunes have a vortex in the lee side of the dune as the upper flow regime forms the dunes become flattened out and then produce antidunes at higher still velocity the antidunes are flattened and most sedimentation stops as erosion takes over as the dominant process typical unidirectional bedforms represent a specific flow velocity assuming typical sediments sands and silts and water depths

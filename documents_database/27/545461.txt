anurognathus was first named and described by ludwig d derlein in 1923 the type species is anurognathus ammoni the genus name anurognathus is derived from the greek an without oura tail and gnathos jaw in reference to its unusually small tail relative to other rhamphorhynchoid i e basal pterosaurs the specific name ammoni honours the bavarian geologist ludwig von ammon from whose collection d derlein had acquired the fossil in 1922 the genus is based on holotype bsp 1922 i 42 bayerische staatssammlung f r palaeontologie und geologie found in the solnhofen limestone near eichst tt it consists of a crushed relatively complete skeleton on a slab the counterslab is missing and with it most of the bones much of the skeleton is only visible as an impression anurognathus had a short head with pin like teeth for catching insects and although it traditionally is ascribed to the long tailed pterosaur group rhamphorhynchoidea its tail was comparatively short allowing it more maneuverability for hunting according to d derlein the reduced tail of anurognathus was similar to the pygostyle of modern birds its more typical rhamphorhynchoid characters include its elongated fifth toe and short metacarpals and neck with an estimated wingspan

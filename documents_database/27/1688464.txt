a qualitative discussion of fraunhofer diffraction can be found elsewhere when a beam of light is partly blocked by an obstacle some of the light is scattered around the object and light and dark bands are often seen at the edge of the shadow this effect is known as diffraction the kirchhoff diffraction equation provides an expression derived from the wave equation which describes the wave diffracted by an aperture analytical solutions to this equation are not available for most configurations the fraunhofer diffraction equation is an approximation which can be applied when the diffracted wave is observed in the far field and also when a lens is used to focus the diffracted light in many instances a simple analytical solution is available to the fraunhofer equation several of these are derived below if the aperture is in plane with the origin in the aperture and is illuminated by a monochromatic wave of wavelength wavenumber with complex amplitude and the diffracted wave is observed in the plane where are the direction cosines of the point with respect to the origin the complex amplitude of the diffracted wave is given by the fraunhofer diffraction equation as it can be seen from

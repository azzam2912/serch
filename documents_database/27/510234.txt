single track is usually found on lesser used rail lines often branch lines where the level of traffic is not high enough to justify the cost of constructing a second track single track is significantly cheaper to build but has operational and safety disadvantages for example a single track line that takes 15 minutes to travel through would have capacity for only two trains per hour in each direction by contrast a double track with signal boxes four minutes apart can allow up to 15 trains per hour in each direction provided all the trains travel at the same speed this hindrance on the capacity of a single track may be partly overcome by making the track one way on alternate days if the single track is not used for public passenger transit long freight trains are a problem if the passing stretches are not long enough other disadvantages include the propagation of delays since one delayed train on a single track will also delay any train waiting for it to pass also a single track does not have a reserve track that can allow a reduced capacity service to continue if one track is closed if a single track

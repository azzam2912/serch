okroshka is usually garnished with sour cream smetana later versions that first appeared in soviet times use light or diluted kefir whey vinegar or mineral water instead of kvass the ingredients are diced and then mixed with kvass just before eating the ratio of chopped food to kvass is similar to that of cereal to milk this allows the vegetables to retain their texture for that same reason even though the ingredients are similar to those in a russian salad the taste of okroshka is quite different from that of the salad okroshka is mostly served in summer because the soup combines the refreshing taste of kvass and the lightness of a salad salt and sugar can be added according to taste okroshka is always served cold sometimes ice cubes are added to served portions to keep the soup cold in hot weather

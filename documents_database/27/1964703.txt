chemogenetics as a term was originally coined to describe the observed effects of mutations on chalcone isomerase activity on substrate specificities in the flowers of dianthus caryophyllus this method is very similar to optogenetics however it uses chemically engineered molecules and ligands instead of light and light sensitive channels known as opsins in recent research projects chemogenetics has been widely used to understand the relationship between brain activity and behavior prior to chemogenetics researchers used methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation tms and deep brain stimulation dbs to study the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior optogenetics and chemogenetics are the more recent and popular methods used to study this relationship both of these methods target specific brain circuits and cell population to influence cell activity however they use different procedures to accomplish this task optogenetics uses light sensitive channels and pumps that are virally introduced into neurons cells activity having these channels can then be manipulated by light chemogenetics on the other hand uses chemically engineered receptors and exogenous molecules specific for those receptors to affect the activity of those cells the engineered macromolecules used to design these receptors include nucleic acid hybrids kinases variety of metabolic enzymes and

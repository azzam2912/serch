the pontificates of urban ii and paschal ii saw an expansion in the college of cardinals of italian clerics that strengthened the local roman influence these cardinals were reluctant to meet with the batch of cardinals recently promoted by callixtus ii who were mainly french or burgundian as far as the older cardinals were concerned these newer cardinals were dangerous innovators and they were determined to resist their increasing influence the northern cardinals led by cardinal aymeric de bourgogne the papal chancellor were equally determined to ensure that the elected pope would be one of their candidates both groups looked towards the great roman families for support by 1124 there were two great factions dominating local politics in rome the frangipani family which controlled the region around the fortified colosseum and supported the northern cardinals and the pierleoni family which controlled the tiber island and the fortress of the theatre of marcellus and supported the italian cardinals with callixtus ii s death on 13 december 1124 both families agreed that the election of the next pope should be in three days time in accordance with the church canons the frangipani led by leo frangipani pushed for a delay in order

it is often used to deduce facts about varieties embedded in well behaved spaces such as projective space or to prove theorems by induction let x be a smooth algebraic variety or smooth complex manifold and y be a smooth subvariety of x denote the inclusion map by i and the ideal sheaf of y in x by formula 1 the conormal exact sequence for i is where denotes a cotangent bundle the determinant of this exact sequence is a natural isomorphism where formula 4 denotes the dual of a line bundle suppose that d is a smooth divisor on x its normal bundle extends to a line bundle formula 5 on x and the ideal sheaf of d corresponds to its dual formula 6 the conormal bundle formula 7 is formula 8 which combined with the formula above gives in terms of canonical classes this says that both of these two formulas are called the adjunction formula the restriction map formula 11 is called the poincar residue suppose that x is a complex manifold then on sections the poincar residue can be expressed as follows fix an open set u on which d is given by the vanishing of

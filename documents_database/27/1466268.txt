the pressure dependence of the melting temperature is small for small pressure changes because the volume change during fusion or melting is rather small however at very high pressures higher melting temperatures are generally observed as the liquid usually occupies a larger volume than the solid making melting more thermodynamically unfavorable at elevated pressure if the liquid has a smaller volume than the solid as for ice and liquid water a higher pressure leads to a lower melting point t and p are normally the temperature and the pressure of the triple point but the normal melting temperature at atmospheric pressure are also commonly used as reference point because the normal melting point is much more easily accessible typically p is then set to 0 a and c are adjustable and component specific parameters for methanol the following parameters can be obtained the reference temperature has been t t 174 61 k and the reference pressure p has been set to 0 kpa methanol is a component where the simon glatzel works well in the given validity range the simon glatzel equation cannot be used if the melting curve is falling or has maximums

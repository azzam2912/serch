intuitively triangles in a formula 3 space are slimmer than corresponding model triangles in a standard space of constant curvature formula 2 in a formula 3 space the curvature is bounded from above by formula 2 a notable special case is formula 7 complete formula 8 spaces are known as hadamard spaces after the french mathematician jacques hadamard originally aleksandrov called these spaces formula 9 domain the terminology formula 3 was coined by mikhail gromov in 1987 and is an acronym for lie cartan aleksandr danilovich aleksandrov and victor andreevich toponogov although toponogov never explored curvature bounded above in publications for a real number formula 2 let formula 12 denote the unique complete simply connected surface real 2 dimensional riemannian manifold with constant curvature formula 2 denote by formula 14 the diameter of formula 12 which is formula 16 if formula 17 and formula 18 for formula 19 let formula 20 be a geodesic metric space i e a metric space for which every two points formula 21 can be joined by a geodesic segment an arc length parametrized continuous curve formula 22 whose length is precisely formula 24 let formula 25 be a triangle in formula 26 with geodesic

the city s name in greek is romanized as dokimeion dokimia kome dokimaion and later dokimion strabo places docimium somewhere about synnada he calls it a village and says that there is there a quarry of synnadic stone as the romans call it but the people of the country call it docimites and docimaea the quarry at first yielded only small pieces of the stone but owing to the later efforts of the romans large columns of one piece are taken out which in variety come near the alabastrites so that though the transport to the sea of such weights is troublesome still both columns and slabs were brought to rome of wondrous size and beauty the red colors which streaked the white marble taken from the city s holy mountain were attributed to the drops of blood from the dying god attis the word docimaea in this passage of strabo appears to be corrupt it should be either or strabo says that the plain of synnada is about 60 stadia long and beyond it is docimium we may however infer that he supposed docimium to be not far from the limit of the plain the table makes it 32

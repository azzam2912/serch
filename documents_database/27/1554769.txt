there is some overlap with the history of machine translation the history of speech recognition and the history of artificial intelligence the history of machine translation dates back to the seventeenth century when philosophers such as leibniz and descartes put forward proposals for codes which would relate words between languages all of these proposals remained theoretical and none resulted in the development of an actual machine the first patents for translating machines were applied for in the mid 1930s one proposal by georges artsrouni was simply an automatic bilingual dictionary using paper tape the other proposal by peter troyanskii a russian was more detailed it included both the bilingual dictionary and a method for dealing with grammatical roles between languages based on esperanto in 1950 alan turing published his famous article computing machinery and intelligence which proposed what is now called the turing test as a criterion of intelligence this criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real time written conversation with a human judge sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably on the basis of the conversational content alone between the program and a real human in 1957

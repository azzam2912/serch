it includes an interactive geometry editor ray tracing support for graphics rendering and geometric analysis computer network distributed framebuffer support scripting image processing and signal processing tools the entire package is distributed in source code and binary form although brl cad can be used for a variety of engineering and graphics applications the package s primary purpose continues to be the support of ballistic and electromagnetic analyses in keeping with the unix philosophy of developing independent tools to perform single specific tasks and then linking the tools together in a package brl cad is basically a collection of libraries tools and utilities that work together to create raytrace and interrogate geometry and manipulate files and data in contrast to many other 3d modelling applications brl cad primarily uses csg rather than boundary representation this means brl cad can study physical phenomena such as ballistic penetration and thermal radiative neutron and other types of transport it does also support boundary representation the brl cad libraries are designed primarily for the geometric modeler who also wants to tinker with software and design custom tools each library is designed for a specific purpose creating editing and ray tracing geometry and image handling the

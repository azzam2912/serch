the target may be a physical object distant from the heliostat or a direction in space to do this the reflective surface of the mirror is kept perpendicular to the bisector of the angle between the directions of the sun and the target as seen from the mirror in almost every case the target is stationary relative to the heliostat so the light is reflected in a fixed direction according to contemporary sources the heliostata as it was called at first was invented by willem s gravesande 1688 1742 other contenders are giovanni alfonso borelli 1608 1679 and daniel gabriel fahrenheit 1686 1736 nowadays most heliostats are used for daylighting or for the production of concentrated solar power usually to generate electricity they are also sometimes used in solar cooking a few are used experimentally or to reflect motionless beams of sunlight into solar telescopes before the availability of lasers and other electric lights heliostats were widely used to produce intense stationary beams of light for scientific and other purposes most modern heliostats are controlled by computers the computer is given the latitude and longitude of the heliostat s position on the earth and the time and date from these

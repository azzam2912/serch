it is a heterocyclic structure similar to the propellanes it has a transannular dative bond from a nitrogen at one bridgehead to a lewis acidic atom such as silicon or boron at the other bridgehead the name atrane was first proposed by various atranes are named depending on the central element e g silatrane e silicon boratrane e boron phosphatrane e phosphorus etc it is also proposed that when y nitrogen the prefix aza be inserted before element atrane azasilatrane for example because atranes wherein e silicon and y oxygen have been referred to as just silatranes silatranes exhibit unusual properties as well as biological activity in which the coordination of nitrogen to silane plays an important role some derivatives such as phenylsilatrane are highly toxic the transannular coordinate bond in atranes can be stretched quasiatranes and even broken proatranes by controlling their stereoelectronic properties proazaphosphatrane is a very strong non ionic base and is utilized in various types of organic synthesis as an efficient catalyst the strength of the transannular interaction depends on the electronegativity of the participating atoms and the size of the rings

bacteria serve as natural hosts with transmission achieved through passive diffusion there is currently only one species in this genus the type species enterobacteria phage n15 group dsdna n15likeviruses are nonenveloped with a head and tail the head is about 60 nm in diameter the tail is long and flexible at about 140 nm long 8 nm wide with short brush like terminal fibers enterobacteria phage n15 has been fully sequenced it has about 46k nucleotides with 60 proteins the complete genome is available here viral replication is cytoplasmic the virus attaches to the host cell s adhesion receptors using its terminal fiber and ejects the viral dna into the host cytoplasm via long flexible tail ejection system replication follows the replicative transposition model dna templated transcription is the method of transcription once the viral genes have been replicated the procapsid is assembled and packed the tail is then assembled and the mature virions are released via lysis bacteria serve as the natural host transmission routes are passive diffusion according to ictv the genus n15likevirus was first accepted under the name n15 like viruses in 2004 assigned to family siphoviridae in order caudovirales in 2012 the genus was renamed to

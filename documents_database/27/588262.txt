the definitions of strong primes are different in cryptography and number theory in number theory a strong prime is a prime number that is greater than the arithmetic mean of the nearest prime above and below in other words it s closer to the following than to the preceding prime or to put it algebraically given a prime number p where n is its index in the ordered set of prime numbers for example 17 is the seventh prime the sixth and eighth primes 13 and 19 add up to 32 and half that is 16 17 is greater than 16 and so 17 is a strong prime the first few strong primes are in a twin prime pair p p 2 with p 5 p is always a strong prime since 3 must divide p 2 which cannot be prime it is possible for a prime to be a strong prime both in the cryptographic sense and the number theoretic sense for the sake of illustration 439351292910452432574786963588089477522344331 is a strong prime in the number theoretic sense because the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring primes is 62 less without the aid of a computer this number would be a

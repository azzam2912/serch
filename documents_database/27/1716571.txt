the title comes from the contemporary use of the phrase doctrine of chances to mean the theory of probability which had been introduced via the title of a book by abraham de moivre contemporary reprints of the essay carry a more specific and significant title a method of calculating the exact probability of all conclusions founded on induction the essay includes theorems of conditional probability which form the basis of what is now called bayes s theorem together with a detailed treatment of the problem of setting a prior probability bayes supposed a sequence of independent experiments each having as its outcome either success or failure the probability of success being some number p between 0 and 1 but then he supposed p to be an uncertain quantity whose probability of being in any interval between 0 and 1 is the length of the interval in modern terms p would be considered a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 conditionally on the value of p the trials resulting in success or failure are independent but unconditionally or marginally they are not that is because if a large number of successes are observed then p is more likely to

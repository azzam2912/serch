it is part of the chain of rift basins along the eastern part of north america that formed during the break up of the pangaea supercontinent it is filled by a fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary sequence of the newark supergroup the taylorsville basin extends for about from just southeast of richmond virginia to near clinton maryland at its broadest it is about wide some of its boundaries are poorly defined due to burial by younger coastal plain deposits the sequence is broken down into two tectonostratigraphic intervals thought to reflect two distinct rift phases the lower unit is the doswell group which has a more restricted extent and comprises two formations the south anna formation and the falling creek formation the upper unit which is separated from the underlying doswell group by an unconformity is the king george group which comprises three formations the newfound formation the port royal formation and the leedstown formation the taylorsville basin is a half graben with the main controlling fault forming the northwestern boundary of the basin subsurface data from boreholes and seismic reflection profiles indicate that the basin was originally a series of smaller half graben at the time of the deposition of

it assures that the construction will perform its designed function during reasonable use for as long as its intended life span items are constructed with structural integrity to prevent catastrophic failure which can result in injuries severe damage death and or monetary losses structural failure refers to the loss of structural integrity or the loss of load carrying capacity in either a structural component or the structure itself structural failure is initiated when a material is stressed beyond its strength limit causing fracture or excessive deformations one limit state that must be accounted for in structural design is ultimate failure strength in a well designed system a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure structural integrity is the ability of a structure to withstand its intended loading without failing due to fracture deformation or fatigue it is a concept often used in engineering to produce items that will serve their designed purposes and remain functional for a desired service life to construct an item with structural integrity an engineer must first consider a material s mechanical properties such as toughness strength weight hardness and elasticity and then determine the size and shape necessary

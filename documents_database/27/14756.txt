the law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers the leading significant digit is likely to be small for example in sets that obey the law the number appears as the leading significant digit about 30 of the time while appears as the leading significant digit less than 5 of the time if the digits were distributed uniformly they would each occur about 11 1 of the time benford s law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits third digits digit combinations and so on the graph to the right shows benford s law for base 10 there is a generalization of the law to numbers expressed in other bases for example base 16 and also a generalization from leading 1 digit to leading n digits it has been shown that this result applies to a wide variety of data sets including electricity bills street addresses stock prices house prices population numbers death rates lengths of rivers physical and mathematical constants like other general principles about natural data for example the fact that many data sets are well approximated by a normal distribution there are illustrative examples and explanations that cover many of the cases where

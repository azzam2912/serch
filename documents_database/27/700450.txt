it is studied in the fields of computer vision and visual perception in biological vision sfm refers to the phenomenon by which humans and other living creatures can recover 3d structure from the projected 2d retinal motion field of a moving object or scene humans perceive a lot of information about the three dimensional structure in their environment by moving around it when the observer moves objects around them move different amounts depending on their distance from the observer this is known as motion parallax and from this depth information can be used to generate an accurate 3d representation of the world around them finding structure from motion presents a similar problem to finding structure from stereo vision in both instances the correspondence between images and the reconstruction of 3d object needs to be found to find correspondence between images features such as corner points edges with gradients in multiple directions are tracked from one image to the next one of the most widely used feature detectors is the scale invariant feature transform sift it uses the maxima from a difference of gaussians dog pyramid as features the first step in sift is finding a dominant gradient direction to make

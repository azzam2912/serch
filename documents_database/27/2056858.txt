it is approved for use in form of the combination drug trifluridine tipiracil for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer tipiracil helps maintain the blood concentration of trifluridine by inhibiting the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase which metabolizes trifluridine adverse effects were not assessed independently of trifluridine but only in the combination drug only in vitro interaction studies are available in these tipiracil was transported by the solute carrier proteins slc22a2 and slc47a1 drugs that interact with these transporters could influence blood plasma concentrations of tipiracil tipiracil is a thymidine phosphorylase tpase inhibitor and inhibits degradation of trifluridine by inhibiting tpase thus increasing systemic exposure to trifluridine when tipiracil is given together with trifluridine at least 27 of tipiracil is absorbed from the gut in cancer patients highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after three hours the substance has no tendency to accumulate in the body the in vitro protein binding in human plasma is below 8 tipiracil is not metabolized by cytochrome p450 cyp enzymes to a small extent it is hydrolyzed to 6 hydroxymethyluracil but the main fraction is excreted in unchanged form in the faeces 50 and urine 27 elimination half life is 2 1 hours

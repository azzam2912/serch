like the carbonate dianion the thiocarbonates are planar with carbon at the center the average bond order from c to s or o is the state of protonation is usually not specified these anions are good nucleophiles and good ligands organic compounds containing divalent functional groups similar to these anions are also called thiocarbonates monothiocarbonate is the dianion cos which has c symmetry monothiocarbonate arises by the hydrolysis of thiophosgene or the reaction of base with carbonyl sulfide dithiocarbonate is the dianion which has c symmetry it arises from the reaction of aqueous base with carbon disulfide important derivatives of dithiocarbonates are the xanthates o esters of dithiocarbonates with the formula these salts are typically prepared by the reaction of sodium alkoxides with carbon disulfide another group of dithiocarbonates have the formula rs co they are often derived by hydrolysis of the corresponding trithiocarbonates rs cs one example is tetrathiapentalenedione a heterocycle that consists of two dithiocarbonate groups trithiocarbonate is the dianion which has d symmetry trithiocarbonate is derived from the reaction of sulfide sources with carbon disulfide dimethyl trithiocarbonate chs cs is organic and co valent not ionic addition of sulfur to trithiocarbonate gives the perthiocarbonate anion which contains

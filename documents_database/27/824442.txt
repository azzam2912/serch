this concept is called protein turnover and different types of proteins have very different turnover rates protein synthesis occurs during the process of translation on ribosomes protein breakdown occurs generally in two cellular locations a balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation is required for good health and normal protein metabolism more synthesis than breakdown indicates an anabolic state that builds lean tissues more breakdown than synthesis indicates a catabolic state that burns lean tissues according to d s dunlop protein turnover occurs in brain cells the same as any other eukaryotic cells but that knowledge of those aspects of control and regulation specific or peculiar to brain is an essential element for understanding brain function protein turnover is believed to decrease with age in all senescent organisms including humans this results in an increase in the amount of damaged protein within the body four weeks of aerobic exercise has been shown to increase skeletal muscle protein turnover in previously unfit individuals a diet high in protein increases whole body turnover in endurance athletes some bodybuilding supplements claim to reduce the protein breakdown by reducing or blocking the number of catabolic hormones within the body this is believed to increase

it typically has a depth of and rises about two kilometers above the deepest portion of an ocean basin this feature is where seafloor spreading takes place along a divergent plate boundary the rate of seafloor spreading determines the morphology of the crest of the mid ocean ridge and its width in an ocean basin the production of new seafloor and oceanic lithosphere results from mantle upwelling in response to plate separation the melt rises as magma at the linear weakness between the separating plates and emerges as lava creating new oceanic crust and lithosphere upon cooling the first discovered mid ocean ridge was the mid atlantic ridge which is a spreading center that bisects the north and south atlantic basins hence the origin of the name mid ocean ridge most oceanic spreading centers are not in the middle of their hosting ocean basis but regardless are traditionally called mid ocean ridges mid ocean ridges around the globe are linked by plate tectonic boundaries and the trace of the ridges across the ocean floor appears similar to the seam of a baseball the mid ocean ridge system thus is the longest mountain range on earth reaching about the mid ocean

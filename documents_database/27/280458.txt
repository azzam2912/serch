the splitting of prime ideals in galois extensions is sometimes attributed to david hilbert by calling it hilbert theory there is a geometric analogue for ramified coverings of riemann surfaces which is simpler in that only one kind of subgroup of g need be considered rather than two this was certainly familiar before hilbert let l k be a finite extension of number fields and let o and o be the corresponding ring of integers of k and l respectively which are defined to be the integral closure of the integers z in the field in question finally let p be a non zero prime ideal in o or equivalently a maximal ideal so that the residue o p is a field from the basic theory of one dimensional rings follows the existence of a unique decomposition of the ideal po generated in o by p into a product of distinct maximal ideals p with multiplicities e the field f o p naturally embeds into f o p for every j the degree f o p o p of this residue field extension is called inertia degree of p over p the multiplicity e is called ramification index of p

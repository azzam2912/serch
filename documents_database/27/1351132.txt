a summary video of rppa is available one microarray depending on the design can accommodate hundreds to thousands of samples that are printed in a series of replicates detection is performed using either a primary or a secondary labeled antibody by chemiluminescent fluorescent or colorimetric assays the array is then imaged and the obtained data is quantified multiplexing is achieved by probing multiple arrays spotted with the same lysate with different antibodies simultaneously and can be implemented as a quantitative calibrated assay in addition since rpma can utilize whole cell or undissected or microdissected cell lysates it can provide direct quantifiable information concerning post translationally modified proteins that are not accessible with other high throughput techniques thus rpma provides high dimensional proteomic data in a high throughput sensitive and quantitative manner however since the signal generated by rpma could be generated from unspecific primary or secondary antibody binding as is seen in other techniques such as elisa or immunohistochemistry the signal from a single spot could be due to cross reactivity thus the antibodies used in rpma must be carefully validated for specificity and performance against cell lysates by western blot rpma has various uses such as quantitative analysis of

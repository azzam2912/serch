a general approach to obtain such a complete route panorama is to use a line camera or slit camera mounted on a vehicle moving along the path smoothly the camera scans temporal scenes in the side direction of the path and connect them to the spatial image this is realized by a program that processes temporal image data or video data in a computer the route panorama can extend to a long distance for indexing scenes and navigation on the internet the long image can further be transmitted to and be scrolled on computer screens or handheld devices as moving panorama for access of geospatial locations navigation georeferencing etc mathematically the route panorama employs a parallel and perspective projection that is a continuous and extreme case of multi perspective view to pixel lines it may have the aspect ratio of an object different from what a normal perspective projection generates in addition a video camcorder is used to produce the route panorama by taking only one pixel line in the video frame at a time with the auto exposure function of the camcorder and shaking removal function using the inter frame matching if the depth of scenes from the path

in mammals this has been proposed to be caused by the introduction of phospholipase c isoform zeta plc from the sperm cytoplasm although this remains to be established definitively activation of the ovum includes the following events the sperm may trigger egg activation via the interaction between a sperm protein and an egg surface receptor izumo is the sperm cell signal that will trigger the egg receptor juno this receptor is activated by the sperm binding and a possible signaling pathway could be the activation of a tyrosine kinase which then activates phospholipase c plc the inositol signaling system has been implicated as the pathway involved with egg activation ip and dag are produced from the cleavage of pip by phospholipase c however another hypothesis is that a soluble sperm factor diffuses from the sperm into the egg cytosol upon sperm oocyte fusion the results of this interaction could activate a signal transduction pathway that uses second messengers a novel plc isoform plc plcz1 may be the equivalent of the mammalian sperm factor a 2002 study demonstrated that mammalian sperm contain plc zeta which can start the signaling cascade polyspermy is the condition when multiple sperm fuse with a single

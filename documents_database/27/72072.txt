this is the normal subgroup of the general linear group given by the kernel of the determinant where we write f for the multiplicative group of f that is f excluding 0 these elements are special in that they form a subvariety of the general linear group they satisfy a polynomial equation since the determinant is polynomial in the entries the special linear group can be characterized as the group of volume and orientation preserving linear transformations of r this corresponds to the interpretation of the determinant as measuring change in volume and orientation when f is r or c is a lie subgroup of of dimension the lie algebra formula 2 of sl n f consists of all matrices over f with vanishing trace the lie bracket is given by the commutator any invertible matrix can be uniquely represented according to the polar decomposition as the product of a unitary matrix and a hermitian matrix with positive eigenvalues the determinant of the unitary matrix is on the unit circle while that of the hermitian matrix is real and positive and since in the case of a matrix from the special linear group the product of these two determinants must

these authors reported a five cases of intractable diarrhoea four of whom died post mortum showed a thin and dilated intestine with flat small bowel mucosa a number of jejunal biopsies had been taken during life and these showed partial villous atrophy with by crypt hyperplasia and an increased number of mitotic figures in the crypts normal numbers and types of mononuclear cells were present in the lamina propria most notably focal epithelial tufts were found on the surface epithelium these tufts were composed of closely packed enterocytes with apical rounding of the plasma membrane resulting in a teardrop configuration of the cells inclusion bodies or secretory granules were not visualised on transmission electron microscopy within the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes reifen et al reported 2 additional cases in 1994 and coined the name congenital tufting enteropathy two genes have been associated with this condition epithelial cell adhesion molecule epcam on chromosome 2 2p21 and spint2 on chromosome 19 spint2 is a kunitz type protease inhibitor the mutation in the epcam gene in kuwait and qatar appears to have originated 5000 6000 years ago histological examination of the small bowel shows varying degrees of villous atrophy with low or

it is designed to be efficient expressive and elegant supporting metaprogramming functional message passing procedural and object oriented programming styles by providing several features such as compile time code generation algebraic data types a foreign function interface ffi with c and c and compiling to c c objective c and javascript nim is statically typed it supports compile time metaprogramming features such as syntactic macros and term rewriting macros term rewriting macros enable library implementations of common data structures such as bignums and matrices to be implemented efficiently as if they were builtin language facilities iterators are supported and can be used as first class entities as can functions allowing for the use of functional programming methods object oriented programming is supported by inheritance and multiple dispatch functions can be generic and can also be overloaded and generics are further enhanced by the support for type classes operator overloading is also supported nim includes tunable automatic garbage collection based on deferred reference counting with cycle detection which can be turned off altogether in 2014 andrew binstock editor in chief of dr dobb s journal said nimrod former name presents a most original design that straddles pascal and python and compiles

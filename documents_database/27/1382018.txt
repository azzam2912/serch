it is used in the synthesis of polyesters paints lubricants and plasticizers when used in the manufacture of polyesters it enhances the stability of the product towards heat light and water by esterification reaction with fatty or carboxylic acids synthetic lubricating esters with reduced potential for oxidation or hydrolysis compared to natural esters can be produced neopentyl glycol is synthesized industrially by the aldol reaction of formaldehyde and isobutyraldehyde this creates the intermediate hydroxypivaldehyde which can be converted to neopentyl glycol with either excess formaldehyde or catalytic hydrogenation of the aldehyde group to an alcohol group it is used as a protecting group for ketones for example in gestodene synthesis reaction of neopentyl glycol with 2 6 di tert butylphenol gives cgp 7930 it has been reported that plastic crystals of neopentyl glycol exhibit a colossal barocaloric effect cbces which is a cooling effect caused by pressure induced phase transitions the obtained entropy changes are about 389 joules per kilogram per kelvin near room temperature this cbce phenomenon is likely to be very useful in future solid state refrigeration technologies

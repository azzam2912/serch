it was originally identified as part of a larger conserved region present in the drosophila trithorax protein and was subsequently identified in the drosophila su var 3 9 and enhancer of zeste proteins from which the acronym set is derived su var 3 9 enhancer of zeste and trithorax the set domain appears generally as one part of a larger multidomain protein and recently there were described three structures of very different proteins with distinct domain compositions the set domain itself turned out to be an uncommon structure although in all three studies electron density maps revealed the location of the adomet or adohcy cofactor the set domain bears no similarity at all to the canonical adomet dependent methyltransferase fold strictly conserved in the c terminal motif of the set domain tyrosine could be involved in abstracting a proton from the protonated amino group of the substrate lysine promoting its nucleophilic attack on the sulphonium methyl group of the adomet cofactor in contrast to the adomet dependent protein methyltranferases of the classical type which tend to bind their polypeptide substrates on top of the cofactor it is noted from the rubisco lsmt structure that the adomet seems to bind in

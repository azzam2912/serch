examples of metric modulation may include changes in time signature across an unchanging tempo but the concept applies more specifically to shifts from one time signature tempo metre to another wherein a note value from the first is made equivalent to a note value in the second like a pivot or bridge the term modulation invokes the analogous and more familiar term in analyses of tonal harmony wherein a pitch or pitch interval serves as a bridge between two keys in both terms the pivoting value functions differently before and after the change but sounds the same and acts as an audible common element between them metric modulation was first described by richard franko while reviewing the cello sonata of elliott carter who prefers to call it tempo modulation another synonymous term is proportional tempi the following formula illustrates how to determine the tempo before or after a metric modulation or alternatively how many of the associated note values will be in each measure before or after the modulation thus if the two half notes in time at a tempo of quarter note 84 are made equivalent with three half notes at a new tempo that tempo will be note

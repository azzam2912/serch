it lies in a designated radio quiet zone located near boolardy station in western australia it currently comprises two main instruments the murchison widefield array mwa a low frequency array operating in the frequency range 80 300 mhz and the australian square kilometre array pathfinder askap it is also one of two core sites for the square kilometre array ska and both current instruments are technology and science pathfinders for the ska several smaller experiments core edges paper and scope will also be sited at mro the australian square kilometre array pathfinder askap was built by csiro and comprises 36 identical antennas each 12 metres in diameter working together as a single instrument askap s combination of fast survey speed and high sensitivity will allow astronomers to answer some fundamental questions about the creation and early evolution of our universe and to test theories of cosmic magnetism and predictions from einstein s general theory of relativity the facility was formally opened on 5 october 2012 the murchison widefield array mwa is a joint project between an international consortium of universities to build a low frequency radio array operating in the frequency range 80 300 mhz the main scientific goals of

he is particularly interested in the design and development of new stereo and enantioselective strategies for the creation of several contiguous stereogenic centres and by the functionalization of organic molecules at the least reactive position these processes are carried out in a single chemical step and lead to the synthesis of complex molecular structures understanding reaction mechanisms provides insight into the origins of stereoselectivity and governs optimization for the development of the most effective and general methodologies possible he studied at the university pierre et marie curie in paris bsc 1983 and obtained his msc in chemistry in 1986 and his phd under the supervision of prof jean normant in december 1988 he then spent a year at the catholic university of louvain belgium for a postdoctoral stay with professor leon ghosez 1989 he was recruited at the cnrs centre national de la recherche scientifique in 1990 at the university pierre et marie curie in paris received his habilitation in 1995 and moved in september 1997 to the technion israel institute of technology as an assistant professor he was promoted to associate professor in 2000 and professor in 2004 since 2005 he holds the sir michael and lady sobell academic

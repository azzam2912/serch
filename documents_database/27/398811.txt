this design first used in radiotelegraphy stations in the early 1900s is commonly used for transmitting antennas operating at low frequencies in the vlf lf and mf ranges in particular those used for am broadcasting the metal mast is electrically connected to the transmitter its base is usually mounted on a nonconductive support to insulate it from the ground a mast radiator is a form of monopole antenna most mast radiators are built as guyed masts insulated from the ground at the base steel lattice masts of triangular cross section are the most common type square lattice masts and tubular masts are also sometimes used to ensure that the tower is a continuous conductor the tower s structural sections are electrically bonded at the joints by short copper jumpers which are soldered to each side at its base the mast is usually mounted on a thick ceramic insulator which has the compressive strength to support the tower s weight and the dielectric strength to withstand the high rf voltage applied by the transmitter the rf power to drive the antenna is supplied by a matching network usually housed in an antenna tuning hut next to the mast and the cable

it is approximately as corrosive as normal tap water and in varying concentrations can be effective in stopping road ice from forming down to around its eutectic temperature cma can also be used as an hs capture agent cma can be produced from a reaction of a magnesium calcium compound with glacial acetic acid if it is reacted with dolomite or dolomitic lime acetic acid does not need to be concentrated to produce cma acetic acid production requires the fermentation of organic material which must be carried out at a ph around 6 0 separating agents used to recover acetic acid must therefore maintain a high capacity while within this ph range amberlite la 2 in 1 octanol diluent maintains nearly full capacity up to a ph value of 6 0 and is readily regenerated by aqueous slaked dolomitic lime to form cma making it a good acetic acid separating agent for cma production sodium chloride road salt costs less than 50 per ton to produce but is corrosive to metals in highway structures and increases the concentration of sodium in drinking water which can lead to adverse health effects alternative deicing substances have been sought to alleviate these problems

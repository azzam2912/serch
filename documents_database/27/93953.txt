he married into the de jussieu botanical family his earliest work was concerned with improvements in photographic processes following suggestions by fran ois arago l on foucault and fizeau collaborated in a series of investigations on the interference of light and heat in 1848 he predicted the redshifting of electromagnetic waves in 1849 fizeau calculated a value for the speed of light to a better precision than the previous value determined by ole r mer in 1676 he used a beam of light reflected from a mirror 8 kilometers away the beam passed through the gaps between teeth of a rapidly rotating wheel the speed of the wheel was increased until the returning light passed through the next gap and could be seen fizeau calculated the speed of light to be which was within 5 of the correct value 299 792 458 kilometers per second fizeau published the first results obtained by his method for determining the speed of light in 1849 see fizeau foucault apparatus fizeau made the first suggestion in 1864 that the speed of a light wave be used as a length standard fizeau was involved in the discovery of the doppler effect which is known in

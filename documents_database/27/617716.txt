the other binary fluoride is tellurium hexafluoride the widely reported tef has been shown to be fteotef there are other tellurium compounds that contain fluorine but only the two mentioned contain solely tellurium and fluorine tellurium difluoride tef and ditellurium fluoride tef are not known tellurium tetrafluoride can be prepared by the following reaction it is also prepared by reacting nitryl fluoride with tellurium or from the elements at 0 c or by reacting selenium tetrafluoride with tellurium dioxide at 80 c fluorine in nitrogen can react with tecl or tebr to form tef pbf will also fluorinate tellurium to tef tellurium tetrafluoride will react with water or silica and forms tellurium oxides copper silver gold or nickel will react with tellurium tetrafluoride at 185 c it does not react with platinum it is soluble in sbf and will precipitate out the complex tefsbf tellurium tetrafluoride melts at 130 c and decomposes to tellurium hexafluoride at 194 c in the solid phase it consists of infinite chains of teff in an octahedral geometry a lone pair of electrons occupies the sixth position

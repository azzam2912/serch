this protein is included in the neuroblastoma breakpoint family of proteins the nbpf19 gene is a protein encoding gene in humans it is composed of 80 464 bases including all introns and exons it is located on the positive strand of chromosome 1 at locus 1q21 2 est profiling of nbpf19 shows it to be ubiquitously expressed in most human tissues at unremarkable amounts it is expressed in relatively higher amounts in the skin lymphoid organs lymph nodes spleen and the gonads ovary testes the mrna transcript of nbpf19 in humans is 13 190 bases long there are 2 predicted alternative splicing isoforms although none have been experimentally observed the protein product of the nbpf19 transcript is composed of 3 843 amino acids and weights 440 5 kd it contains 45 duf1220 domains of unknown function but that have been linked to evolutionary changes and generally decrease in number in species increasingly evolutionarily distant from humans nbpf19 is expected to undergo many post translational modifications most notably phosphorylation and sumoylation the protein is extensively phosphorylated on serine threonine and tyrosine residues in a repetitive pattern seen in the figure to the left there are 14 predicted repeats within the protein

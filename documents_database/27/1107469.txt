additionally the nsrrc also operates two beamlines at spring 8 in japan the tls is taiwan s first synchrotron and was opened in 1993 as a third generation synchrotron with a beam energy of 1 5 gev beam the storage ring has a circumference of 120 m there are twenty six operational beamlines they cover a wide range of functionality from ir microscopy to x ray lithography the tps is a 3 gev third generation synchrotron light source built at a cost of approximately nt 7 billion us 224 million after a seven year plan was launched in 2007 it delivered first light on december 31 2014 projected to be 10 000 times brighter than the tls the tps is considered one of the world s brightest light sources it has a storage ring circumference of 518 4 m the facility is expected to have 48 experimental stations fully operational by 2016 the synchrotron is aimed to benefit biomedical and nanotechnology research the tps is located adjacent to the tls and the two light sources are intended to be complementary in providing a wide range of the photon spectrum from ir to x rays greater than 10 kev for researchers

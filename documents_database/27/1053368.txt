the name macs is a registered trademark of the company the method was developed with miltenyi biotec s macs system which uses superparamagnetic nanoparticles and columns the superparamagnetic nanoparticles are of the order of 100 nm they are used to tag the targeted cells in order to capture them inside the column the column is placed between permanent magnets so that when the magnetic particle cell complex passes through it the tagged cells can be captured the column consists of steel wool which increases the magnetic field gradient to maximize separation efficiency when the column is placed between the permanent magnets magnetic activated cell sorting is a commonly used method in areas like immunology cancer research neuroscience and stem cell research miltenyi sells microbeads which are magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies which can be used to target specific cells the macs method allows cells to be separated by using magnetic nanoparticles coated with antibodies against a particular surface antigen this causes the cells expressing this antigen to attach to the magnetic nanoparticles after incubating the beads and cells the solution is transferred to a column in a strong magnetic field in this step the cells attached to the nanoparticles expressing

this is important because a dna sequence can code for multiple polypeptides so it is these non dna factors that are present in order to help determine the polypeptide that is made the definition was first proposed by eva m neumann held suggesting that a redefinition of our view of the gene in relation to developmental genetics this concept claims that the definition is too general we therefore need to either clarify its definition or stop using the term gene in the cycles of contingency neumann held states this empirical evidence shows that it is not only the presence of dna sequence that determines the course of events that lead to the synthesis of a polypeptide but in addition specific non dna factors must act on dna and derived mrna to determine the particular processing mechanisms the developmental state and tissue determine the outcome of the dna an example neumann held gives of this is rna editing depending on the environmental and developmental state of the organism mrna might enhance delete or even add nucleotides to create a different mrna so according to neumann held the gene is the process that brings together the non dna elements to dna in

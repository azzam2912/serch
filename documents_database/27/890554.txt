the majority of digital sculpting tools on the market use mesh based geometry in which an object is represented by an interconnected surface mesh of polygons that can be pushed and pulled around this is somewhat similar to the physical process of beating copper plates to sculpt a scene in relief other digital sculpting tools use voxel based geometry in which the volume of the object is the basic element material can be added and removed much like sculpting in clay still other tools make use of more than one basic geometry representation a benefit of mesh based programs is that they support sculpting at multiple resolutions on a single model areas of the model that are finely detailed can have very small polygons while other areas can have larger polygons in many mesh based programs the mesh can be edited at different levels of detail and the changes at one level will propagate to higher and lower levels of model detail a limitation of mesh based sculpting is the fixed topology of the mesh the specific arrangement of the polygons can limit the ways in which detail can be added or manipulated a benefit of voxel based sculpting is

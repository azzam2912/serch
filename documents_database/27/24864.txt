they are similar to yeast and paramecium killing factors and are structurally functionally and ecologically diverse applications of bacteriocins are being tested to assess their application as narrow spectrum antibiotics bacteriocins were first discovered by andr gratia in 1925 he was involved in the process of searching for ways to kill bacteria which also resulted in the development of antibiotics and the discovery of bacteriophage all within a span of a few years he called his first discovery a colicine because it killed e coli bacteriocins are categorized in several ways including producing strain common resistance mechanisms and mechanism of killing there are several large categories of bacteriocin which are only phenomenologically related these include the bacteriocins from gram positive bacteria the colicins the microcins and the bacteriocins from archaea the bacteriocins from e coli are called colicins formerly called colicines meaning coli killers they are the longest studied bacteriocins they are a diverse group of bacteriocins and do not include all the bacteriocins produced by e coli in fact one of the oldest known so called colicins was called colicin v and is now known as microcin v it is much smaller and produced and secreted in a different

today this baltic city is called klaip da in lithuania in the lithuanian memel means mute silent m melis m m and this same name was adopted by speakers of german who later colonized that part of the baltic whilst silence certainly remains one of the fine attributes of the surrounding rural area it can be difficult to find within the town itself these days as the population of memel continues to expand there is also little evidence to support the alternate theory that memel means surrounded by water although that is an equally apt description the recent changes that swept across south africa since the early 1990s have also brought about a change to the name of this town memel zamani now being the official name in recognition of the zamani township a settlement adjoining memel to the west in which several thousand black africans reside during the apartheid era zamani was separated from memel by a golf course which acted as a buffer between the two now however the golf course no longer exists houses have been built on it and the buffer zone has disappeared the town and township are now adjacent in one small location memel

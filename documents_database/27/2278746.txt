this decay is extremely unlikely in the standard model of particle physics as it changes the lepton number several new theories especially supersymmetric ones predict a much more frequent decay searching for this decay allows a test of these theories even if they cannot be tested directly in other experiments like at the lhc it has also been shown the experiment is sensitive to probe new light dark sector particles such as dark photon mu3e is constructed at the paul scherrer institute as it provides the world s most intense muon beam more than one billion decays per second can be analyzed this rate is necessary to study more than 10 muon decays in total important backgrounds are the decays formula 1 and formula 2 to distinguish between signal and background the detector has a spatial resolution better than 200 m a time resolution better than 100 ps and an energy resolution better than 0 5 mev for the individual electrons to minimize multiple scattering the detector is built as light as possible semiconductor detectors are used for the spatial and energy resolution scintillator fibers provide a good timing resolution the whole experiment is in a magnetic field of 1

significant energy is usually required to disintegrate soil etc particles into the psd that is then called a grain size distribution the psd of a material can be important in understanding its physical and chemical properties it affects the strength and load bearing properties of rocks and soils it affects the reactivity of solids participating in chemical reactions and needs to be tightly controlled in many industrial products such as the manufacture of printer toner cosmetics and pharmaceutical products particle size distribution can greatly affect the efficiency of any collection device settling chambers will normally only collect very large particles those that can be separated using sieve trays centrifugal collectors will normally collect particles down to about 20 m higher efficiency models can collect particles down to 10 m fabric filters are one of the most efficient and cost effective types of dust collectors available and can achieve a collection efficiency of more than 99 for very fine particles wet scrubbers that use liquid are commonly known as wet scrubbers in these systems the scrubbing liquid usually water comes into contact with a gas stream containing dust particles the greater the contact of the gas and liquid streams the higher

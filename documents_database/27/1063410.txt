the new aircraft followed a classical layout for a twin engine transport with a metallic structure monoplane wings a conventional tail section one major improvement over the li 2 design was the tricycle landing gear which allowed better visibility when taxiing and landing initially the il 12 was designed for 29 passengers in a pressurized fuselage with projected maximum range is assumed of 5 000 kilometers at a cruising speed 400 kph the aircraft was to use four m 88b engines already proven in use on the ilyushin il 4 however during development the m 88b engines had to be replaced by two ach 31 diesel engines each producing 1 500 hp the plans for a pressurized fuselage were abandoned and the number of passengers reduced to 27 the il 12 made its maiden flight on 15 august 1945 it was soon decided to re engine the aircraft with shvetsov ash 82 radial engines with the revised aircraft flying on 9 january 1946 the il 12 was found to have problems with vibration during testing having poor engine out characteristics and requiring a strut under the rear fuselage to prevent tipping during loading due to center of gravity problems further

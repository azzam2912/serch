like the other slrps lumican has a molecular weight of about 40 kilodaltons and has four major intramolecular domains there are four n linked sites within the leucine rich repeat domain of the protein core that can be substituted with keratan sulfate the core protein of lumican like decorin and fibromodulin is horseshoe shaped this enables it bind to collagen molecules within a collagen fibril thus helping keep adjacent fibrils apart lumican is a major keratan sulfate proteoglycan of the cornea but is ubiquitously distributed in most mesenchymal tissues throughout the body lumican is involved in collagen fibril organization and circumferential growth corneal transparency and epithelial cell migration and tissue repair corneal transparency is possible due to the exact alignment of collagen fibers by lumican and keratocan in the intrafibrillar space mice that have the lumican gene knocked out lum develop opacities of the cornea in both eyes and fragile skin the lumican lum gene was thought to be a candidate susceptibility gene for high myopia however a meta analysis showed no association between lum polymorphism and high myopia susceptibility in all genetic models studied lum knockout mice also have abnormal collagen in their heart tissue with fewer and thicker

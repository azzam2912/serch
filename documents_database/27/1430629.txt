ltp is commonly seen as the standard underlying convergence layer protocol for the bundle protocol rfc 5050 supporting a wide selection of networks ltp is named in honor of american computer scientist joseph carl robnett licklider ltp is designed to run directly over a data link layer such as e g aos it can also run on the user datagram protocol udp e g if used in a sensor network in a private network where bandwidth contestation isn t an issue or for software debug purposes therefore it does not address issues like routing or congestion control it was originally designed to support long haul transmission in an interplanetary network its design is based on experiences with the ccsds file delivery protocol cfdp developed for space communication its features are the application divides its data to send into two parts either part may have a size of 0 the ltp engine stores data in a queue checks whether the link towards the destination is available and if so starts the transmission if the link is not available the data remains in queue and transmission starts as soon as a so called link state cue arrives either from an underlying link

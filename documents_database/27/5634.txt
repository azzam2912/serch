homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces that is they are the mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called homeomorphic and from a topological viewpoint they are the same the word homeomorphism comes from the greek words homoios similar or same and morph shape form introduced to mathematics by henri poincar in 1895 very roughly speaking a topological space is a geometric object and the homeomorphism is a continuous stretching and bending of the object into a new shape thus a square and a circle are homeomorphic to each other but a sphere and a torus are not however this description can be misleading some continuous deformations are not homeomorphisms such as the deformation of a line into a point some homeomorphisms are not continuous deformations such as the homeomorphism between a trefoil knot and a circle an often repeated mathematical joke is that topologists can t tell the difference between a coffee cup and a donut since a sufficiently pliable donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it while preserving the donut

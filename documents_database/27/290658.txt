one views x as suspended between these end points the space sx is sometimes called the unreduced unbased or free suspension of x to distinguish it from the reduced suspension x of a pointed space described below the reduced suspension can be used to construct a homomorphism of homotopy groups to which the freudenthal suspension theorem applies in homotopy theory the phenomena which are preserved under suspension in a suitable sense make up stable homotopy theory given a topological space x the suspension of x is defined as the quotient space of the product of x with the unit interval i 0 1 modulo the equivalence relation formula 2generated by one can view the suspension as two cones on x glued together at their base it is also homeomorphic to the join formula 4 where formula 5 is a discrete space with two points in rough terms s increases the dimension of a space by one it takes an n sphere to an n 1 sphere for n 0 given a continuous map formula 6 there is a continuous map formula 7 defined by formula 8 where square brackets denote equivalence classes this makes formula 9 into a functor from

the organisms of this order are characterized by a skeleton cross link with a cone or ring nassellaria is an order of radiolaria under the class polycystina these organisms are unicellular eukaryotic heterotrophic plankton typically with a siliceous cone shaped skeleton the most common group of radiolarians are the polycystine radiolarians which are divided into two subgroups the spumellarians and the nassellarians both spumellarians and nassellarians are common chert forming microfossils and are important in stratigraphical dating as the oldest radiolarians are precambrian in age the nassellarians appear in the fossil record much later than their other polycystine relatives the spumellarians spumellarians can be seen as far back as the precambrian whereas nassellarians do not begin to appear until the carboniferous nassellarians are believed to be have been increasing in species diversity since the beginning of the cenozoic nassellarians have been and continue to be some of the most remarkable and aesthetically interesting protists both alive and in the fossil record they occupy an important role ecologically and have done so since the precambrian there is still much we do not know about these protists and discovering more will require the continued interdisciplinary effort of many scientists the holotype morphology

a b c b a c these related molecules are known as isomers in some molecules and under some conditions isomerization occurs spontaneously many isomers are roughly equal in bond energy and so exist in roughly equal amounts provided that they can interconvert somewhat freely that is the energy barrier between the two isomers is not too high when the isomerization occurs intramolecularly it is considered a rearrangement reaction the energy difference between two isomers is called isomerization energy isomerizations with low energy difference both experimental and computational in parentheses are endothermic trans cis isomerization of 2 butene with 2 6 1 2 kcal mol cracking of isopentane to n pentane with 3 6 4 0 kcal mol or conversion of trans 2 butene to 1 butene with 2 6 2 4 kcal mol skeletal isomerization is not normally encountered in the laboratory but is the basis of large applications in refineries in general straight chain alkanes are converted to branched isomers by heating in the presence of a platinum or acid catalyst examples include isomerisation of n butane to isobutane and pentane to isopentane fuels with high branching are favored by internal combustion engines for their higher octane rating

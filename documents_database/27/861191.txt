let formula 2 be two measurable spaces such as formula 3 let formula 4 be an integral operator with the non negative schwartz kernel formula 5 formula 6 formula 7 if there exist real functions formula 9 and formula 10 and numbers formula 11 such that for almost all formula 13 and for almost all formula 15 then formula 4 extends to a continuous operator formula 17 with the operator norm such functions formula 19 formula 20 are called the schur test functions in the original version formula 4 is a matrix and formula 22 a common usage of the schur test is to take formula 23 then we get this inequality is valid no matter whether the schwartz kernel formula 5 is non negative or not a similar statement about formula 26 operator norms is known as young s inequality for integral operators if where formula 28 satisfies formula 29 for some formula 30 then the operator formula 31 extends to a continuous operator formula 32 with formula 33 using the cauchy schwarz inequality and the inequality 1 we get integrating the above relation in formula 35 using fubini s theorem and applying the inequality 2 we get it

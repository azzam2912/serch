its chemical formula is nh po oh showing that each monomer consists of an orthophosphate radical of a phosphorus atom with three oxygens and one negative charge neutralized by an ammonium cation leaving two bonds free to polymerize in the branched cases some monomers are missing the ammonium anion and instead link to three other monomers the properties of ammonium polyphosphate depend on the number of monomers in each molecule and to a degree on how often it branches shorter chains n1000 but short polymer chains e g pyro tripoly and tetrapoly are more soluble and show increasing solubility with increasing chain length ammonium polyphosphate can be prepared by reacting concentrated phosphoric acid with ammonia however iron and aluminum impurities soluble in concentrated phosphoric acid form gelatinous precipitates or sludges in ammonium polyphosphate at ph between 5 and 7 other metal impurities such as copper chromium magnesium and zinc form granular precipitates however depending on the degree of polymerization ammonium polyphosphate can act as a chelating agent to keep certain metal ions dissolved in solution ammonium polyphosphate is used as a food additive emulsifier e number e545 and as a fertilizer ammonium polyphosphate app is also used as a flame

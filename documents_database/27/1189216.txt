it also filters through water and dirt the contaminated water is either collected from a waste site and brought to the plants or the plants are planted in the contaminated area where the roots then take up the water and the contaminants dissolved in it many plant species naturally uptake heavy metals and excess nutrients for a variety of reasons sequestration drought resistance disposal by leaf abscission interference with other plants and defense against pathogens and herbivores some of these species are better than others and can accumulate extraordinary amounts of these contaminants identification of such plant species has led environmental researchers to realize the potential for using these plants for remediation of contaminated soil and wastewater this process is very similar to phytoextraction in that it removes contaminants by trapping them into harvestable plant biomass both phytoextraction and rhizofiltration follow the same basic path to remediation first plants that have stable root systems are put in contact with the contamination to get acclimated to the toxins they absorb contaminants through their root systems and store them in root biomass and or transport them up into the stems and or leaves the plants continue to absorb contaminants until they are

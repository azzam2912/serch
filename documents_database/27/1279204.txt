the order is of particular importance in riemann surface theory in connection with surfaces with maximal symmetry namely the hurwitz surfaces the hurwitz quaternion order was studied in 1967 by goro shimura but first explicitly described by noam elkies in 1998 for an alternative use of the term see hurwitz quaternion both usages are current in the literature let formula 1 be the maximal real subfield of formula 2formula 3 where formula 4 is a 7th primitive root of unity the ring of integers of formula 1 is formula 6 where the element formula 7 can be identified with the positive real formula 8 let formula 9 be the quaternion algebra or symbol algebra so that formula 11 and formula 12 in formula 13 also let formula 14 and formula 15 let then formula 17 is a maximal order of formula 9 described explicitly by noam elkies the order formula 19 is also generated by elements and in fact the order is a free formula 22 module over the basis formula 23 here the generators satisfy the relations which descend to the appropriate relations in the 2 3 7 triangle group after quotienting by the center the principal congruence subgroup

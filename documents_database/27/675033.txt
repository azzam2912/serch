this reactor was designed and is used to test nuclear fuels and materials to be used in power plants naval propulsion research and advanced reactors it can operate at a maximum power of 250 mw thermal power and has a four leaf clover core design similar to the camunian rose that allows for a variety of testing locations the unique design allows for different neutron flux number of neutrons impacting one square centimeter every second conditions in various locations six of the test locations allow an experiment to be isolated from the primary cooling system providing its own environment for temperature pressure flow and chemistry replicating the physical environment while accelerating the nuclear conditions the atr is a pressurized light water reactor lwr using water as both coolant and moderator the core is surrounded by a beryllium neutron reflector to concentrate neutrons on experiments and houses multiple experiment positions as well it operates at low temperature and pressure 71 c 160 f and up to 2 69 mpa water pressure the atr reactor vessel is solid stainless steel tall by across the core is approximately tall by across in addition to its role in nuclear fuels and materials irradiation the

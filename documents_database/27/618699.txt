it is often used by beginning shooters for target practice and for hunting small game it takes 20 lead balls of the diameter of a 20 gauge shotgun bore to equal one pound while it only takes 12 lead balls of the diameter of a 12 gauge shotgun bore to equal the same weight a 20 gauge shotgun is more suitable for hunting certain types of game or for some hunters because it recoils less and the guns weigh less and may be smaller 20 gauge shotguns are especially suitable for hunting game birds such as quail grouse turkey and other game when using shot shells a 20 gauge can also shoot slugs and buckshot and thereby become an effective deer hunting gun 20 gauge shotguns loaded with slugs are usually less accurate than rifles but they often have better stopping power at short range although this depends on the amount of gunpowder in the shell s load in addition 20 gauge shotguns have less recoil than 10 12 or 16 gauge versions on average and may be more desirable to those who want to experience less recoil for prolonged shooting the lower recoil also makes a 20 gauge appropriate

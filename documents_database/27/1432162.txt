the designers intend the system to provide almost full time communication even with satellites in low earth orbit that often have reduced visibility from ground stations it makes on demand data available to for example rescue workers who want near real time satellite data of a crisis region the system has been developed as part of the artes 7 programme and is intended to be an independent european satellite system that reduces time delays in the transmission of large quantities of data the programme is similar to the american tracking and data relay satellite system that was set up to support the space shuttle but edrs is using a new generation laser communication terminal lct which carries data at a much larger bit rate the laser terminal transmits 1 8 gbit s across 45 000 km the distance of a leo geo link while the tdrss provides ground reception rates of 6 mbit s in the s band and 800 mbit s in the ku and ka bands such a terminal was successfully tested during in orbit verification between the german radar satellite terrasar x and the american nfire satellite it is also embarked on the commercial telecommunication satellite alphasat

to generate an output voltage as a precision ratio of an input voltage with several decades of resolution in effect the kelvin varley divider is an electromechanical precision digital to analog converter the circuit is used for precision voltage measurements in calibration and metrology laboratories it can achieve resolution accuracy and linearity of 0 1 ppm 1 in 10 million the conventional voltage divider kelvin divider uses a tapped string of resistors connected in series the fundamental disadvantage of this architecture is that resolution of 1 part in 1000 would require 1000 precision resistors to overcome this limitation the kelvin varley divider uses an iterated scheme whereby cascaded stages consisting of eleven precision resistors provide one decade of resolution per stage cascading three stages for example therefore permits any division ratio from 0 to 1 in increments of 0 001 to be selected each stage of a kelvin varley divider consists of a tapped string of equal value resistors let the value of each resistor in the i th stage be r for a decade stage there will be eleven resistors two of those resistors will be bridged by the following stage and the following stage is designed to have

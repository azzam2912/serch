let formula 6 and formula 7 be any two mutually perpendicular lines through formula 5 let formula 9 formula 10 and formula 11 be the points where formula 6 intersects the side lines formula 13 formula 14 and formula 15 respectively similarly let let formula 16 formula 17 and formula 18 be the points where formula 7 intersects those side lines the droz farny line theorem says that the midpoints of the three segments formula 20 formula 21 and formula 22 are collinear the theorem was stated by arnold droz farny in 1899 but it is not clear whether he had a proof a generalization of the droz farny line theorem was proved in 1930 by ren goormaghtigh as above let formula 1 be a triangle with vertices formula 2 formula 3 and formula 4 let formula 27 be any point distinct from formula 2 formula 3 and formula 4 and formula 31 be any line through formula 27 let formula 9 formula 10 and formula 11 be points on the side lines formula 13 formula 14 and formula 15 respectively such that the lines formula 39 formula 40 and formula 41 are the images of the lines formula 42

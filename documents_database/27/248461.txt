it is an important intermediate in the production of titanium metal and the pigment titanium dioxide ticl is a volatile liquid upon contact with humid air it forms spectacular opaque clouds of titanium dioxide tio and hydrated hydrogen chloride it is sometimes referred to as tickle or tickle 4 due to the phonetic resemblance of its molecular formula ticl to the word ticl is a dense colourless distillable liquid although crude samples may be yellow or even red brown it is one of the rare transition metal halides that is a liquid at room temperature vcl being another example this property reflects the fact that molecules of ticl are weakly self associate most metal chlorides are polymers wherein the chloride atoms bridge between the metals its melting and boiling points are similar to those of ccl ti has a closed electronic shell with the same number of electrons as the inert gas argon the tetrahedral structure for ticl is consistent with its description as a d metal center ti surrounded by four identical ligands this configuration leads to highly symmetrical structures hence the tetrahedral shape of the molecule ticl adopts similar structures to tibr and tii the three compounds share

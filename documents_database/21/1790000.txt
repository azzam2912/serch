the cnf is one of the sixteen members of the national nanotechnology coordinated infrastructure nnci the cnf was started as part of a national science foundation initiative in 1977 and has subsequently been partially supported by several other nsf programs it currently receives about 20 million each year in federal funding in 2004 the cnf moved into its current facility duffield hall supported by 100 million in support from cornell it now includes 15 000 square feet of level 1000 cleanroom as well as several times more non cleanroom laboratory space in 2009 the nnin received 10 million as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act the cnf is a general user facility and while many users are from cornell or other nearby universities it also draws users from a wide range of universities and companies around the world roughly 700 scientists use the facility every year half of whom are associated with cornell the cnf is used for research in a wide range of fields such as mems microfluidics nanomagnetics and bioelectronics it includes fabrication tools for processes including electron beam lithography photolithography chemical vapor deposition electron beam deposition and reactive ion etching it also contains characterization equipment

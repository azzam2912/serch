it lies at the centre of ngc 1999 and is the primary source lighting up this and other nebulae in the region v380 orionis is a multiple star system containing at least three stars a very faint cool star 9 away is also thought to be gravitationally bound making it a hierarchical quadruple system two infrared sources within ngc 1999 have been listed as companions in some catalogues but are not thought to be stars when discovered they were referred to as v380 ori b and v 380 ori c a notation which can lead to confusion the main component is visible as the 10th magnitude variable star at the centre of ngc 1999 referred to as the primary speckle interferometry shows a cool companion separated by 0 15 approximately 62 au referred to as the tertiary spectroscopy shows a third star at a projected separation less than 0 33 au referred to as the secondary the two closest stars the primary and tertiary are surrounded by a circumstellar disk lying almost edge on to observers on earth the fourth star has a projected separation of 4 000 au and is receding from the other three the system is believed

the first lanthanum c complex was synthesized in 1985 and called la c the at sign in the name reflects the notion of a small molecule trapped inside a shell two types of endohedral complexes exist endohedral metallofullerenes and non metal doped fullerenes in a traditional chemical formula notation a buckminsterfullerene c with an atom m was simply represented as mc regardless of whether m was inside or outside the fullerene in order to allow for more detailed discussions with minimal loss of information a more explicit notation was proposed in 1991 where the atoms listed to the left of the sign are situated inside the network composed of the atoms listed to the right the example above would then be denoted m c if m were inside the carbon network a more complex example is k k cb which denotes a 60 atom fullerene cage with one boron atom substituted for a carbon in the geodesic network a single potassium trapped inside and two potassium atoms adhering to the outside the choice of the symbol has been explained by the authors as being concise readily printed and transmitted electronically the at sign is included in ascii which most modern

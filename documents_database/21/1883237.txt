christina white and her graduate student mark s chen the catalyst is used along with hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid additive to oxidize aliphatic sp3 c h bonds in organic synthesis the catalyst is the first to allow for preparative and predictable aliphatic c h oxidations over a broad range of organic substrates oxidations with the catalyst have proven to be remarkably predictable based on sterics electronics and stereoelectronics allowing for aliphatic c h bonds to be thought of as a functional group in the streamlining of organic synthesis in the case where an electron withdrawing group ewg is present in the substrate the highly electrophilic catalyst will oxidize the more electron rich c h bond that is most remote from the ewg in the case above the c h bond shaded yellow is further from the electron withdrawing group and therefore has a higher electron density than the one not shaded yellow the yellow shaded c h bond is therefore the primary site for oxidation by the catalyst the reaction selectivity is highly influenced by electronics due to the highly electron withdrawing ester group present in the substrate for that reason the reaction proceeds with oxidation at the tertiary

banks can use this approach only subject to approval from their local regulators under a irb banks are supposed to use their own quantitative models to estimate pd probability of default ead exposure at default lgd loss given default and other parameters required for calculating the rwa risk weighted asset then total required capital is calculated as a fixed percentage of the estimated rwa some credit assessments in standardised approach refer to unrated assessment basel ii also encourages banks to initiate internal ratings based approach for measuring credit risks banks are expected to be more capable of adopting more sophisticated techniques in credit risk management banks can determine their own estimation for some components of risk measure the probability of default pd loss given default lgd exposure at default ead and effective maturity m for public companies default probabilities are commonly estimated using either the structural model of credit risk proposed by robert merton 1974 or reduced form models like the jarrow turnbull model for retail and unlisted company exposures default probabilities are estimated using credit scoring or logistic regression both of which are closely linked to the reduced form approach the goal is to define risk weights by determining

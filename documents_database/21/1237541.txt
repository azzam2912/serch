it is named after the town of zunil in guatemala the crater is located in the elysium quadrangle visible in images from the viking 1 and viking 2 mars orbiters in the 1970s zunil was subsequently imaged at higher resolution for the first time by the mars global surveyor mgs mars orbiter camera moc in 2000 a ray system associated with the zunil impact visible in infrared images from the mars odyssey thermal emission spectrometer themis was later detailed by mcewen et al 2003 prior to this large craters with ray systems had not been seen on mars the debris from a recent landslide was first spotted on the south east wall of the crater by the mars global surveyor mars orbiter camera moc in 2003 and was subsequently imaged at higher resolution by the mars reconnaissance orbiter high resolution imaging science experiment hirise in december 2006 the impact which formed zunil occurred no more than a few million years ago and hence the crater is in a relatively pristine form it was probably not produced in a high velocity impact such as from a comet if the interpretation that zunil is the source of the basaltic shergottite meteorites is

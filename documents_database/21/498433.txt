it is a triode with the filament being the cathode note principles are mostly the same for hot cathode ion sources in particle accelerators to create electrons a regulated electron current typically 10 ma is emitted from a heated filament the electrons are attracted to the helical grid by a dc potential of about 150 v most of the electrons pass through the grid and collide with gas molecules in the enclosed volume causing a fraction of them to be ionized the gas ions formed by the electron collisions are attracted to the central ion collector wire by the negative voltage on the collector typically 30 v ion currents are on the order of 1 ma pa this current is amplified and displayed by a high gain differential amplifier electrometer this ion current differs for different gases at the same pressure that is a hot filament ionization gauge is composition dependent over a wide range of molecular density however the ion current from a gas of constant composition is directly proportional to the molecular density of the gas in the gauge a hot cathode ionization gauge is composed mainly of three electrodes all acting as a triode wherein the cathode

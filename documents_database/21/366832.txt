the coarsest polar topology is called weak topology let formula 1 be a dual pair of vector spaces over the field formula 2 of real formula 3 or complex formula 4 numbers let us denote by formula 5 the system of all subsets formula 6 bounded by elements of formula 7 in the following sense then the strong topology formula 9 on formula 7 is defined as the locally convex topology on formula 7 generated by the seminorms of the form in the special case when formula 13 is a locally convex space the strong topology on the continuous dual space formula 14 i e on the space of all continuous linear functionals formula 15 is defined as the strong topology formula 16 and it coincides with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets in formula 13 i e with the topology on formula 14 generated by the seminorms of the form where formula 20 runs over the family of all bounded sets in formula 13 the space formula 14 with this topology is called strong dual space of the space formula 13 and is denoted by formula 24

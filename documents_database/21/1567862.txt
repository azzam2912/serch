this technique involves inserting a tetra polar catheter into the ventricle and measuring conductance this measured conductance is a combination of blood and muscle and various techniques are used to identify the blood conductance from the total measured conductance blood conductance can then be converted to volume using a linear baan or a non linear wei relationship that relates conductance to volume this approach is based on the idea that the total conductance g of a fluid between two electrodes is a function of the fluid s conductivity reciprocal of resistivity and volume in cardiology a tetra polar catheter is inserted into the ventricle and a constant current i is applied across the two outer electrodes this generates an electrical field within the ventricle and the two inner electrodes measure a voltage generated due to the electric field this measured voltage v is used to determine conductance through a modified version of ohm s law conductance g is the reciprocal of resistance r which changes the standard ohm s equation from v ir to v i g conductance is then related to blood volume though baan s equation when used in cardiology the electric field generated is not limited to

some white nationalists and others who want to minimize the hereditary chattel slavery experience of africans and their descendants have used the false equivalence myth to promote racism against african americans or claim that african americans are too vocal in seeking justice the irish slaves myth has also been invoked by some irish activists to highlight the british oppression of the irish people and to suppress the history of irish involvement in the transatlantic slave trade the myth has become increasingly prominent since the 1990s and has been prominent in online memes and social media debates in 2016 academics and irish historians wrote to condemn the myth some books have used the term slaves for captive irish people forced from their homes in ireland and shipped overseas against their will to the new world particularly the british colonies the term slaves or bond slaves was used for a time bound system of years that was not perpetual the british legal term used was indentured servants whether the servants had volunteered for transport or were kidnapped and forced aboard ships however for centuries irish folklore or various books had referred to the captive servants as irish slaves even into the 20th

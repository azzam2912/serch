informally put the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins each containing at least one object it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin even if the collection is infinite formally it states that for every indexed family formula 1 of nonempty sets there exists an indexed family formula 2 of elements such that formula 3 for every formula 4 the axiom of choice was formulated in 1904 by ernst zermelo in order to formalize his proof of the well ordering theorem in many cases such a selection can be made without invoking the axiom of choice this is in particular the case if the number of sets is finite or if a selection rule is available some distinguishing property that happens to hold for exactly one element in each set an illustrative example is sets picked from the natural numbers from such sets one may always select the smallest number e g in the smallest elements are 4 10 1 in this case select the smallest number is a choice function even if infinitely many sets were collected from the natural numbers it will always be possible to choose the

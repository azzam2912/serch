the technique was superseded by multiplexing via http 2 which is supported by most modern browsers as of 2018 http pipelining is not enabled by default in modern browsers due to several issues including buggy proxy servers and hol blocking the pipelining of requests results in a dramatic improvement in the loading times of html pages especially over high latency connections such as satellite internet connections the speedup is less apparent on broadband connections as the limitation of http 1 1 still applies the server must send its responses in the same order that the requests were received so the entire connection remains first in first out and hol blocking can occur the asynchronous operation of http 2 and spdy are solutions for this browsers ultimately did not enable pipelining by default and by 2017 most browsers supported http 2 by default which used multiplexing instead non idempotent requests like those using post should not be pipelined sequences of get and head requests can always be pipelined a sequence of other idempotent requests like put and delete can be pipelined or not depending on whether requests in the sequence depend on the effect of others http pipelining requires both the

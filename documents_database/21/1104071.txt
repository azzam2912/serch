other names in common use include stearyl acyl carrier protein desaturase and stearyl acp desaturase this enzyme participates in polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis it employs one cofactor ferredoxin the 3 substrates of this enzyme are stearoyl acyl carrier protein reduced acceptor and o whereas its 3 products are oleoyl acyl carrier protein acceptor and ho the precise mechanism of this class of enzymes is not known however recent studies using the kinetic isotope effect suggest that the rate limiting step is the removal of a hydrogen from the carbon nearest the carboxylic acid group the diiron cluster moves through to a peroxo intermediate which can then dehydrate the short lived alcohol intermediate liberating water there are a variety of specific enzymes within this class that attack using this mechanism but do so at different points along the carbon chain of their respective fatty acids this enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases specifically those acting on paired donors with o as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen the oxygen incorporated need not be derived from o with oxidation of a pair of donors resulting in the formation of ho this family of enzymes is found only in the plastids

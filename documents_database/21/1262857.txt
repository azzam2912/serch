there are about 60 inm proteins most of which are poorly characterized with respect to structure and function among the few well characterized inm proteins are lamin b receptor lbr lamina associated polypeptide 1 lap1 lamina associated polypeptide 2 lap2 emerin and man1 several integral nuclear membrane proteins of different size and structure have been identified it is proposed that they share some structural features with respect to nucleoplasmic domain s and lipid soluble domain s some inm proteins contain common protein domain structures and can thus be categorised into known protein domain families these include the lem sun and kash domain families members of the lem domain family play a part in chromatin organisation sun and kash domains participate in linking the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton through the linc complex lamins and chromatin found at the nuclear envelope are organised with the assistance of proteins embedded in the inm inm proteins also aid in organization of nuclear pore complexes npcs the protein mpom121 is targeted to the inm and is necessary for npc formation proteins containing the lem domain such as emerin lap2 and man1 seem to have a number of roles they interact with the barrier to autointegration factor

in probability theory and statistics the definition of variance is either the expected value of the sdm when considering a theoretical distribution or its average value for actual experimental data computations for analysis of variance involve the partitioning of a sum of sdm an understanding of the computations involved is greatly enhanced by a study of the statistical value for a random variable formula 3 with mean formula 4 and variance formula 5 therefore from the above the following can be derived the sum of squared deviations needed to calculate sample variance before deciding whether to divide by n or n 1 is most easily calculated as from the two derived expectations above the expected value of this sum is which implies this effectively proves the use of the divisor n 1 in the calculation of an unbiased sample estimate of in the situation where data is available for k different treatment groups having size n where i varies from 1 to k then it is assumed that the expected mean of each group is and the variance of each treatment group is unchanged from the population variance formula 5 under the null hypothesis that the treatments have no effect

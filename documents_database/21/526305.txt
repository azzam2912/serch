earlier wingtip coupling experiments included tip tow which were attempts at carrying fighters connected to the wingtips of bombers tom tom followed the ficon project afterwards wingtip coupling experiments were evolved from the concept of adding extra floating panels to extend the effective wingspan of an aircraft in the hope this would extend the range of the aircraft this would theoretically act in the same manner as the long narrow wings of a glider it is reported that the germans experimented with the idea in 1944 and 1945 by coupling two equal sized light planes together then the idea was further developed by richard vogt who came to the us from germany after world war ii the idea was tested at wright field in the late 1940s using a douglas c 47a skytrain and culver q 14b cadet these tests showed the idea had promise and republic aviation was awarded a contract to investigate further thus began the tip tow project the mx 1018 program code named tip tow sought to extend the range of the early jets in order to give fighter protection to piston engined bombers with the provision for in flight attachment detachment of the fighter to

the interchange is located at exit 57 on the capital beltway exit 170 on i 95 and exit 1 on i 395 some people including many washington area media sources refer to this interchange as the mixing bowl because prior to the reconstruction local and long distance travelers shared the same lanes and travelers had to merge to the right or left to reach the correct lanes for their destination the last of this weaving and merging was eliminated on april 21 2007 the interchange was originally built in the 1960s as a simple interchange between i 95 and the capital beltway at the time i 95 was expected to go through the district of columbia after community opposition prevented its construction through the city in 1977 i 95 was shifted to the eastern portion of the beltway between springfield and college park maryland eliminating the i 495 designation there although that designation was reinstated in 1989 because of this route change all traffic continuing on i 95 through the washington area was exiting at springfield through an interchange not designed for that purpose by early 1970 there were 150 000 vehicles per day traveling through the intersection thirty years

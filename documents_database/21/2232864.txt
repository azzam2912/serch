it can control the temperature moisture and especially light regime of the plant based on light emitting diodes leds light emitting diodes leds have efficient electric lighting with desired wavelengths red blue which support greenhouse production in a minimum time and with high quality and quantity as leds are cool it helps plants to be placed as close as possible to light sources without overheating or scorching this saves space for intense cultivation it could provide the opportunity of greenhouse produced fruits and vegetable to be available for the market more quickly and less expensively due to the effect of led lighting on earliness compactness and quality of products incandescent and fluorescent lamps currently available for lighting greenhouse phytotrones and plant incubators emit color bands that may cause unwanted stem elongation and low quality in plant species are electrically inefficient short lived and particularly not eco friendly for having hazardous waste disposal issues on the other side high sodium pressure hsp discharge lamps have been well established in the greenhouses for their sufficient light intensities which support transplants and seedlings growth and development unfortunately they have also many drawbacks they are intensely hot and scorch nearby plant tissues consume high

such spectroscopic investigations have previously been carried out with long slit spectrographs in which the spectrum is dispersed perpendicular to the slit and spatial resolution is obtained in the dimension along the slit then by stepping the position of the slit the spectrum of points in the imaged field can be obtained but the process is comparatively slow and wasteful of potentially restricted telescope time integral field spectrographs are used to speed up such observations by simultaneously obtaining spectra in a two dimensional field as the spatial resolution of telescopes in space and also of ground based instruments using adaptive optics has rapidly improved in recent years the need for such multiplexed instruments has become more and more pressing in this approach an image is sliced using for example a bowen image slicer in the image plane and re arranged such that different parts of the image all fall onto a slit and a dispersing element such that a spectrum is obtained for a larger area of interest another way to think of this is that the slit is optically cut into smaller pieces and re imaged onto the image plane at multiple locations an instrument using this technique is

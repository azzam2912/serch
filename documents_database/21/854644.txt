it defines two mechanisms for identifying the protocol carried in atm adaptation layer 5 aal5 frames it replaces rfc 1483 a standard data link access protocol supported by dsl modems rfc 2684 describes two encapsulation mechanisms for network traffic virtual circuit multiplexing and llc encapsulation either mechanism carries either routed or bridged protocol data units and dsl modems often include a setting for rfc 1483 bridging this is distinct from other bridge modes commonly found in combined dsl modems and routers which turn off the router portion of the dsl modem in vc multiplexing vc mux the hosts agree on the high level protocol for a given circuit it has the advantage of not requiring additional information in a packet which minimises the overhead for example if the hosts agree to transfer ip a sender can pass each datagram directly to aal5 to transfer nothing needs to be sent besides the datagram and the aal5 trailer the chief disadvantage of such a scheme lies in duplication of virtual circuits a host must create a separate virtual circuit for each high level protocol if more than one protocol is used because most carriers charge for each virtual circuit customers try to

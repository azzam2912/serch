dome building eruptions are common particularly in convergent plate boundary settings around 6 of eruptions on earth are lava dome forming the geochemistry of lava domes can vary from basalt e g semeru 1946 to rhyolite e g chaiten 2010 although the majority are of intermediate composition such as santiaguito dacite andesite present day the characteristic dome shape is attributed to high viscosity that prevents the lava from flowing very far this high viscosity can be obtained in two ways by high levels of silica in the magma or by degassing of fluid magma since viscous basaltic and andesitic domes weather fast and easily break apart by further input of fluid lava most of the preserved domes have high silica content and consist of rhyolite or dacite existence of lava domes has been suggested for some domed structures on the moon venus and mars e g the martian surface in the western part of arcadia planitia and within terra sirenum lava domes evolve unpredictably due to non linear dynamics caused by crystallization and outgassing of the highly viscous lava in the dome s conduit domes undergo various processes such as growth collapse solidification and erosion lava domes grow by endogenic
